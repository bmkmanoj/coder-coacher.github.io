Voss
on night hacking and we might
accidentally share something on Johan's
oh oops what's uh oh that's I was my
doing I wake I was hacking on ha were
you hacking on something dr. buss is
this is this something super secret
project with you yeah well it's um we
have a conference are coming up in the
xt one day and a half and we're working
on a tweet wall for that a conference so
well not only tweet wall but also we're
going to show the next upcoming talks
best tops of the day in the week and I'm
going to do this in a jar of X with some
animations of course it's I can't
discuss what confines of this and I'm
pretty sure no one can tell based yeah
it's hard to tell but I bet I bet it
seems to have something to do with
Oracle on google so maybe it's um it's a
not google i/o nets and a little and
y'all so that's some it might be a
subsidiary of java one with Tom google
one all right java police oh so you
might you might want to close down the
broadcaster listening to our own stream
up I mean it's good to know that it's
working but perhaps you don't actually
need to have that playing all the time
alright so i'm back with dr. johann bus
and we're chatting about javafx and ends
and java development and social java and
brussels which where we are we're in
brussels belgium and this is just I
think I'm finally going to make it to
dev ox after two weeks of being on the
road maybe would be yeah thank you you
made a little detour would really suck
it if I'm the last little bike here from
Brussels to Antwerp if I something
happens
they make it to tell box audio you're
sure you got a ticket because it's sold
out so oh you mean I can't buy a ticket
for double black market prices are
extremely high oh that sucks maybe I
should've bought one way I started my
trip two weeks ago I can't send you the
email view organizer he might be able to
do you like you're gonna help you so I
would recommend everyone if you want to
go to the devil but you don't have a
ticket yet send an email to Stephanie
Elsa and he firstly reply to all his
long as I wanna here's the regulation
god I know he's gonna watch the
interview yeah yeah you know whether
he's washed next time you come if you go
sir strangle see you do it for whatever
reason okay so let's get back to the
business here so we've got a dolly core
and tweet tweet wall was that tweet well
yeah that's uh um maybe something is
that like like in like malls you walk
into malls and they show tweets on them
um I never walked him also I you know
you don't do shopping no no huh here I
married your wife yes I had this is a
subtle slide aside but actually I had to
walk into a department store for the
first time like a couple years oh I'm
sorry about it was it was very painful
ones I didn't know what to do but um it
was a necessity because I left my my
underwear son with another opens all
right good enough then you went to a to
a store yeah it was quite painful maybe
there's one thing that I can tell about
the tweet water if you want to see it in
action you have to come to that works of
course and first and we will do
Stephanie also for getting a ticket
again this is well before our break
we're talking about visualizing data and
using Java FX and one of the fun
projects that I'm working on
the Caliph of gelatin guards is a data
effects now while you're going to juggle
the plat taking our data core you might
also want to go to java 6 data or no
it's called data data FX right I have to
change the name so data FX is just a
library in in for javafx that allows you
to easily access data and visualize it
in controls with a presentation on gr
one last year as a good open source
stuff anyone it's all it's all open
source there's actually a website Java
vegetated org with some explanations and
some examples and actually I'm music
using it in almost all of my projects
because most of my projects the as I
mentioned it's about visualizing data
and you talk to a back-end in order to
get the data now talking to a back in to
get the data for example let's talk
about the tweet wall suppose if we want
to get some data from Twitter and using
the anonymous Twitter rest api if you
want back in the previous example you
want to have authenticated tweets10 you
can go static water does not a lot of
clutter now it's a accident it should
even be be easier but i think it's it's
pretty solid explaining so what you do
is you create the rest request builder
kudos to mr. Weaver for introducing me
to the Builder pattern yeah remember you
and you you supply the path so we go to
twitter com paths gonna be sorry to
Jason you can concatenate the path some
credit problems are still Q which is the
search term for twitter is dev ox and
then we have for our data source reader
i'm not very good in names so actually
the rest request builder built creates
not the rest request but the data source
reader should fix that somehow met hard
because working with jonathan garden
this and he's a kiwi and i'm from from
so our accents um yeah yeah thanks I
trouble understanding both of you
equally so yes because of our coat not
because of my kin yeah perhaps your your
your what what you say Kota no no no
thatthat's anyways yeah that was
embarrassing loss yeah well I had no gym
it's not harder it's coat was pretty
embarrassing but I I didn't hear him
talking about code up anymore okay okay
so he didn't that was it those a gym ism
yesterday it wasn't because I haven't
heard you well you I think you humor him
and you said it several times wrong yeah
just to pay him back okay but I guess I
had to find something else that you you
say backwards like maybe dials how would
you say it Giles oh gosh comes i know i
have as i used to say a garage he
actually he's a little play now he can't
watch the like girls with it okay well
actually I in trouble earlier today
because I was there some village in
place i was visiting and I did the
opposite I said the g Salman was a J
sound anyway this is my D French so it's
probably right yeah I'm very I just
watched to call me Jonathan so I can
call him with his first name so yeah
yeah you can so okay need it back to the
coda okay alright so the this this
twitter stuff we are easy to do and
that's all because of data effects and
the slightly miss name builders awesome
yes I'll deliver and then we die for its
not on with google but quite important
with efforts the observable list feature
so what I did before we had data axis
you click on a button you make a request
to the backend server it might take
while mean why are you using to race
freezes when the information come back
you display all the information probably
way too much information it doesn't fit
on the screen because you have zillions
of tweets but
it's pretty inefficient now with Java X
you have the service worker task
framework where you can do some things
in the background now that's nice so
what you can do then is you click on a
button you your user interface is not
freeze but it doesn't show results until
you have everything and that might take
a while sometimes twitter is pretty slow
in responding but it sends the first
tweet it send them immediately and the
last tweets it might take take a while
so what we do in data FX is once we have
the data source reader which is come
read the data we create an object data
source and that's going to create
objects based on the data source and
again we have a builder for this and
note that this time the builder to build
will create the object data store is
itself we supply the Java class that
that will contain the results we have a
tweet class here I can show the tweet
class pretty simple this one is using
JSON but we can also use XML and data
actual parts the incoming stream into
tweet objects and it will we have to
tell it the let me show you a trick here
watch this voila yeah no no you're
you're used to work on a laptop
apparently if you have a big screen then
yeah better on my laptop at 1920 x ok
1200 yeah ok anyway this is this is this
is presenter phone tricks that's
probably what you're gonna send me after
or after the recording gonna give me
your laptop facilities in 1920 as well
that's nice thanks a lot of here so
you're wrong so I think one of the most
important methods on the object data
store do is that we can supply to the
result with a with the list so in this
case the result list is we got to go
this one is an observable list
in our model and by doing so the moment
that we read tweets the observable it
will be populated so that it's pulling
data back incrementally from the back
end as we fetch request sir yes exactly
yes or no so it's it's gonna so if you
only need treat which you will be able
to show them immediately and it will if
your populate to remain or later but
it's a the observer be list will go get
populated and the user interface will if
it listens to the observable list a for
example list your table view they do
have invalidation listeners they will be
able to render the data when it is being
passed oh so instead of the button
waiting not being able to do anything we
now have you click the button and as
soon as data gets in you can visualize
it and that's a I think one of the neat
features that we have in a data of X
whoops it's always nice to have an
overview of your house so that's
something that we we use in oh well
maybe I have to enlarge it again because
we don't only use it for parsing the
tweets but the dead Fox our call for
papers API the CFP has a rest interface
as well for obtaining speakers and the
box was one of the action of the first
conferences to do several things so the
one the first java conference is to do
recording a molotov some parlors and
also to have a standard rest interface
for all of the all the conference info
and a bunch of other conferences like
jay focus have been adopting the same
rest api used to be compatible mm-hmm so
good job good job mathias if you're
listening to the stream I've been I met
him the Netherlands and he's gotten
great mileage out of the shirts he gave
me a little big one right now but if you
watch a book yeah so you were using a
police shirt as well yeah yeah well you
know the warning
you know someone who is working on of
our race because I try to get in touch
with those guys but they never give me
t-shirts yeah well I think you need to
drive them around San Francisco it's up
to make t-shirts when they win at dukes
choice of words and maybe you'll get 1
i'll never see anything wet all right so
what else what else we got we are we got
a real speed this up we're already like
okay so we have the the delicacy FP rest
api and we use the same rest request
builder to create a request object data
source builder to to pass all these
incoming information into speaker
instances and we also obtained the
schedule and based on this we can show
the upcoming speakers and upcoming
sessions now one thing here synchronous
synchronization is quite important here
so the data effects call in order to to
get the data is also servers so we can
add a property here we can listen to the
state property and once it's succeeded
so once we have all data we can do
something else that does not mean of
course that we can't do anything else
before we have all the data because the
speakers will get populated so result
list is here speaking it will get
populated with once we have all speakers
we will go to the next task which is
here pastimes so then we're gonna going
to pass the schedule I'm going to see
who is coming up next this is a very
event driven way of organizing your code
well yes but the yes this is
event-driven but yeah the cool thing is
you can combine this with so
event-driven if if if the if we have all
the information you can do this and this
and this but it's also even without we
have to succeed at event we can still do
something with the information so oh and
actually that's one of the things that
are like about java vex there are
different ways to use it different
patterns and it's not yet clear to me
what will be the best pattern i'm
changing patterns every every few days
it's
both because you're a researcher and and
and and because I have to because my
previous battles don't know about me
that's really the works okay cool all
right so anything else um maybe we've
seen data effects what is that where's
the devil speaker data show up in the UI
pop up nadal effects client the devil
take your data um or you don't use that
Sally tell it this one this one is not
showing the dev box a different version
yes it's a it's on my desktop probably
oh yeah for isn't it I was about to
bring my discipline well it probably
would have been a pain to set up here
but I'm glad I'm glad you're your old
year olds on computer here your old
laptop still works actually people off
with my old laptop visits it's actually
a point knew you wouldn't tell it from
its design it is seriously given your
back and your workplace I saw that last
time i was there yeah i may be sure
about that that's easy you didn't you
sign a confidential agreement and you're
not allowed to tell that I smack I have
my card went home oh it's it's a secret
that's okay well just just between you
me and then everyone watching well I've
stricken well it'll be ours don't tell
anyone the Johan has mac harb no but I
yeah I really like to make hearth where
the the opener could be a bit better
enough yeah they could they could make
it work on improvements on their own
some some improvements on the operating
system be nice you're too busy playing
around the phones
logos on the bottom right yes yes
Russell yes Russell's foreo which one
kufi come on Teague is not getting the s
fastest Java I think um well he's
talking about Russell's talking about
the new static compilation groovy
support and with the additional type
information they can compile you know
proper by codes you know direct method
dispassion all that stuff so it makes
groovy a lot faster if you code it in
this the right style but the problem is
all the groovy libraries a lot of them
are still dynamic so you don't quite get
the same performances java based on what
you use but for most things it actually
is most dynamic languages on the JVM are
fast enough and with invoke dynamic
they're even faster yeah I think it's
that's I really like the fact that there
are so many dynamic languages on top of
the Java platform these days ok so yeah
so Russell's mentioning its dynamic with
invoke dynamic to choose to referring to
so yeah with invoke dynamic all the Ruby
ins groovy and all the other JVM
languages have gotten like a huge speed
boost and actually Russell if you have
any good performance data on groovy
verse java using above dynamic that um
shoot out a social stream and i'll make
sure folks get a little bit though ok so
what are we looking at next do anything
else you're playing around I focus or
yeah but that it has in the might have
an issue because we're using the VPN OG
needs a log on to a UK until know at the
country but i'm already using some
feedback between the two of us with the
sharing the sharing my desktop ok what
also that also that for the next
interview well yeah well there are so i
can now I'm not gonna show show the
movies the thing is we we have a chat
application for focus groups using data
access all but one
of my or fun frameworks one of X which
is database is school for get post HTTP
request we have another fun project to
run of X and that's it's about life
synchronization so we use it in chat
applications where shared object so it's
a bit late yes why don't why we do this
close that stream pop open a webpage
with a couple links you want people to
to know so they can get more information
about data effects and read effects and
Dalek or so you're here screams visible
while he's doing that let me quickly
describe what's up next for the night
hacking tour so I'm taking a break
tomorrow to set up for dead box then
we'll have some impromptu interviews on
monday and tuesday i think is the hacker
garden monday or monday monday and
tuesday i think ok so i'll be streaming
live from the hacker garden at devoxx
i'll add that to the calendar so you
guys can sign up for that event and then
wednesday and thursday our tuesday night
i'm going to have sign up so the speaker
dinner for any devil speakers who want
to have live hacking / interview
sessions at devoxx and those will be
posted tuesday evening or wednesday
morning for for you guys to sign up and
check out those streams but you can go
to night hacking com to find out more
information about this program and also
the ustream site has they joined the
crowd button you can use to get notified
whenever we go live and that's probably
the easiest way to just find out when
we're broadcasting interesting things
and all the videos are available on
Ustream and they're also available on
the java youtube channel and will soon
be available on Pallas all right so you
got a few your l's here alright so
that's that is me that's you without a
without a suit on I like that Johan
better
you mean the without the silver with the
suit yeah without the suit okay what
yeah you know you in a suit your suit
just it doesn't work okay I'm glad you
if you gotta do this to my wife no more
funerals or weddings for you know all
right and then Johann put up some URLs
on screen for data FX Delacour dally
cloud lodge on himself what's what's
what's with the google thing just if
people want to search for something they
good with some it's a company but also a
platform on our website is that is that
going to be an acquisition target for
large on in the next calendar year I
mean um we're gonna acquire google or
google acquires ha ha i can't comment on
now you can't comment on future M&amp;amp;A
activity i watch on corporation alright
so thanks everybody for joining us for
another night hacking session and stay
tuned for more info about the upcoming
devops schedule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
