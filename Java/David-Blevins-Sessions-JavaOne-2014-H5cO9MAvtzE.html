our series of videos on key some key
java ee 2014 sessions and speakers today
i have with me David Blevins I've known
David for quite a few years he has been
instrumental to the job I ecosystem for
a number of years he used to be a part
of the open a JV project was still very
much alive and kicking he was a key
contributor in open web beings Geronimo
as well he's been contributing to the
Java a specification for a long period
of time and that's basically where we
know each other from most recently he's
found it very interesting project called
Romney and his own company named Tommy
tribe and I'm very we're very honored to
have him speak at javaone he's an
excellent speaker and a blogger as well
okay so first and foremost David thank
you very much for joining us today
hopefully all's well on your end yeah
all right so I know very good thank you
so I guess the first question I want to
really ask you is a tell us a bit more
about your sessions at javaone 2014 and
what do you expect to sort of deliver
there yeah well this year I'm you know I
submitted a different talk that I don't
normally give so of course I'm giving a
you know otami talk as I usually do and
that's been very well received um and
it's sort of an interesting phenomena
happened giving that talk over the last
you know two years or so is uh
eventually started to work in this one
slide that was you know things you may
have missed and was intended to kind of
catch people up on on what has happened
in Java EE since they last looked
because of course a lot of the people
that attend you know Tommy talk from mom
off ends and and simply haven't been
aware of a lot of changes you know since
basically 2006 or
are the ee 14 days you know and this one
slide turns into a 15 point in section
of the presentation so decided to make a
whole talked out of it and so this this
talk is titled java game changers and
the goal of that talk is really kind of
no threefold it's one to catch people up
to speed but it's also to uh you know to
show people that things can change and
in the most important part that they can
be part of that change that
participating in the specifications is
an option and you can put your
fingerprint on Java EE and it's you know
it's a neat too neat thing and so the
whole talk is basically kind of starts
and takes a look at what's changed takes
a look at where we are and then show you
know talks about where we could go so
it's sort of a you know a Dickens ghost
of Christmas past Christmas present
Christmas future kind of a talk so I'm
really looking forward to that one
personally I think it's going to be
pretty great then the other tuck that
we're doing is a java e8 panel that we
have that every year and last year was
an incredible fun it was was the last
day of the conference and we had a full
house and it was myself camera Purdy a
manual Bernard from Red Hat and Antonio
go calvez and you know so was it was a
pivotal was there an IBM of course and
people asked really crave questions a
hard-hitting questions it was almost
like they had saved up every question
that it had throughout the whole
conference and didn't get answered any
of the presentations they saw and then
asked it at the last day at the last
panel it was such a wonderful finale I'm
really looking forward to that talk I I
hope it's every bit of explosives as
explosive as it was last year and it was
was it was a lot of fun for everybody a
speakers included excellent so I think
it's helpful to
for you to actually talk a little bit
about Tommy e + n Tommy tribe and I
guess as following to that I'd like to
ask you how do you think things are
going with Tommy Tommy tried when I
guess java ee in generally from your
standpoint yeah i think it's the what's
going great I you know and so for those
who aren't necessarily familiar with
Tommy perhaps you know it's tom cat
entered into the java ee world finally
and so for the number of years you know
you'd go on the mailing list and say oh
can I use ejbs can I use this that
you've course you get in a very loud
resounding no no you can't that's not
what we do and so the fact that now tom
cat is in the realm of ee certified
servers this is this big and so people
are responding very well to it and i
think there's all there's you know when
we go around and we promote it to people
there's always some skepticism the
thinking all this can't really be the
Tomcat there like you must have done
something to ruin it in some way and
once they get once they try it out it's
it's always this sort of wow really
that's it this this works and so we're
getting some really enthusiastic people
using it and people making pretty big
changes in an organization to
accommodate it which is pretty fantastic
you know another on the tummy tribe side
of things i think that were just uh were
a young excited company and I think all
relationships they have really featured
that heavily and and people are always
really happy to do business with a young
open source company that caters to them
completely and in terms of the people
who have been working on Tommy for the
last several years this is a dream come
true for us there's nothing we've wanted
more than to work together under the
same roof for the longest time and so
now we can and it's kind of fairy tale
scenario so knock on wood we're just
really happy
it's not so let me tell you a bit of a
curveball here David I know Tommy at the
moment is EE 6 web profile certified and
of course you have a bit more than the
way profile I know Oh what are your
plans with regards to e7 yeah so we just
switched trunk over to Tommy 2 point 0
and EE 7 work is started there it's
going pretty well for the very short
time that we've had it going so all the
Apache projects have you know been
working on their portions of of the e7
bits right still see XF is pretty much
finished Tomcat obviously is is done
that's Tomcat 8 and so like just last
week or rather maybe was tuesday's times
going so fast you know we have C xf3
point 0 and Tomcat 8 going in Tommy 2
point 0 in the trunk and so things are
going pretty well in that regard the one
of the one over the projects that was
looking like it might not make it was
activemq which hadn't even started KMS
to point o but there's some potential
that hornet + mq might actually get
donated to apache and get merged in with
activemq so that would be a pretty
exciting development for the industry i
think that'll certainly help out our
Tommy 7 efforts so knock on wood we can
see some preliminary releases of it you
know maybe in beta form not not too
distant future excellent going back to
the ee8 panel what are you looking to I
guess get done in EA to yourself and
what has been your general impression of
the e8 efforts so far yeah well actually
I'm pretty looks good I mean we've done
on the eg level we've done surveys of
people before and to get their feedback
and we had a lot more people as you know
respond to the e 8 surveys and so on
it's really fantastic to see engagement
and I really like what's on people's
radar and in terms of what's on my radar
you know we have a lot of things that
live that we started in EE 7 and in even
far back as eg6 you know of course some
of my big ticket items have always been
more embed ability in java eden general
so we added that in a jiffy 3.1 and we
try to get some more in EK b in java ee
7 in general but i think now it's kind
of reached a point where a lot of people
are just saying this has got to happen
and perhaps the configuration api that
will go into ETA could help with that
significantly so i have some really high
hopes that we'll see some more control
of public static void main 8 as well we
did some really big revamps of how the
connector MDB relationship works and
most people don't even know what that is
which is a big sign of how it needed to
be revamped and what it's going to allow
us is to do some really cool stuff with
say having annotation driven consumers
of say a message like JMS messenger
convene so you know at topic at header /
am from the JMS message so basically
imagine a jax-rs style annotation API
for consuming JMS messages or you can
pull parameters out of the headers and
you can get the objects marshaled and
passed in as objects rather than a
message and so it going to open up a lot
of really neat characteristics I hope
that there's a certain before and after
kind of feeling to JMS sort of like you
know you sir rest the jig the jax-rs api
is a pretty much better than the servlet
api in a lot of regards even if you were
just doing web pages you could use the
jax-rs api because it's far more
expressive for doing the same thing then
that one big do get method that you get
with a servlet and so I hope
do the same thing for consuming JMS
topic so instead of having one big on
message you know you could have like a
dozen that consumed messages data from
different topics different cubes all in
one being and save people a lot of time
with the standard plumbing they have to
do and then of course I really hope that
we can get some more alignment between
CI and ejb uh we have a two component
models that are very similar that neat
the closer I instep a lot of things that
we do in Egypt we really do apply and
could apply to CGI there's also a bigger
item on that bucket and something that I
know if is necessarily strictly on the
radar but with CDI extensions you can
add any number of CDI beans but you
can't add other eat componentry can't
add a servlet it can't add an ejb you
can't add a jsf manage being so the
things that you can dynamically and
programmatically add see I stopped at
CDI it would be really neat if we could
consider if there's time adding ability
for more components to be added via or
at that startup time yes the CI
extension that would be really really
keen to see that kind of thing happen ok
so those are some pretty big items on my
list I have a bunch more of course but
you know in the interest of time all
right very good thank you so i do i
guess i have to ask david besides your
sessions what else are you looking
forward to accomplishing at javaone any
part in very interesting sessions topics
anything that you're planning to do uh
you know uh of course i'm always looking
forward to the language talks i
particularly enjoy those quite a bit i'm
really looking forward to checking out
the Internet of Things track this year
that's pretty interesting addition uh
that sounds fun I know that there's one
particular talk
that Stefan Jensen's going to had
approved about his experience using a
raspberry pi to make a scoreboard for a
basketball game and using ee
technologies to get that accomplished
that's going to be pretty fun session to
check out i recommend people looking at
that i also think that you know just i
look forward to the same thing at
javaone every year which is connecting
with people and it's a really
interesting thing that happens when you
get a bunch of geeks together and they
all from all different parts of the
world and i know like two years ago I
ran into somebody at the lobby at the
Java one conference hotel the Hilton and
we just started talking and he was like
oh this is my first Java one oh that's
really cool welcome I'm having a good
time it was the last day of the
conference we ended up going on to
dinner we stayed in contact and he had
never presented anywhere he'd ever
written any articles and now he's giving
three talks at javaone this year I just
think that that is the most awesome
thing that ever could possibly happen I
want people to go to john 1 and know
that those people they see on stage that
could be them and the only thing holding
them back is it themselves so just go
for it get inspired at javaone you know
do something cool take take that
inspiration and use it to some good ends
that would be you know what I look
forward to connecting with people
hopefully inspires some people and
hopefully see some of those people up on
stage speaking at future Java ones all
right excellent so thank you very much
again for your time honor to have you
and hopefully we'll meet up at javaone
they thought were you Fantasticks thank
you very much resin or exit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
