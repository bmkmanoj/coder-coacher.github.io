hiking in Java one led and today I have
with me
Girja good Jam hi hi you want so you
want to talk to us about Oracle jet so
what is the Oracle jet Oracle jet is a
toolkit of technologies solutions and
components that are really helpful when
you're creating larger JavaScript
applications especially business
applications finance applications
something with customer data if you're
creating those kinds of applications and
JavaScript then really you need to take
a look at Oracle jet so it's the front
end it's purely front-end so do you have
also they won't you show us yes yes can
you explain what you're going to show us
yes well if we are on the Oracle jet
home page or a quad jet or acusa there's
a getting started link and you find out
that there's a yeoman generator for
getting started with jet and when you
click on try demo you'll be on the work
better app in in JavaScript using Oracle
Jets components and architecture and
when you click on user cookbook you find
yourself in the place where you see all
the jet components and there are data
visualizations and various kinds and
when you scroll down you see that one of
these is a map component and I've taken
that map component and I've integrated
it into an application and since we were
in Brazil we have here a map of Brazil
that I've integrated into an Oracle jet
application and I'll show you how I did
that
so jet applications are inherently
modular everything you do in jet is
within a module and a module in jet is a
module defined by require requirejs
currently that's the module system that
we use at the moment and you can see
that here there is a home jeaious page
i'll just clean this up a bit there's a
home j/s page and on the other side home
HTML is the view and I'll just clean
that a bit okay so what you see here is
a thematic map and this is the
thematic map component that you'll find
in the cookbook and there's a complete
recipe for this so the cookbook is
literally a bunch of recipes for
different components and I've taken that
map component as a starting point and
what I also have is I've downloaded a
JSON file that defines OD it's a very
large file all the states within Brazil
and oh they're and locations and
geographies and I found this online
somewhere and just found that and then I
went and in my home JS file
I used a jQuery text to point to that
file you can see here it's called Brazil
JSON and I'm referring to materia
mattifying block in my home JS file and
I'm passing it in as the first parameter
here so then in the function call back
here on line 5 that first parameter is
that is that JSON file and then it gets
in here and there is here something
called a map provider and that comes
from Oracle jet and if we take a look
here you'll see that there's this map
provider concept meaning that you don't
have to use the base maps that are
Aquajet provides but you can provide
your own alternative maps using GL JSON
which is a standard in in doing that so
we have this geo JSON file and I create
a new map provider I pass in that that
JSON file as I json.parse and I pass in
that the JSON file and then there are
properties defined in that JSON file
this there's named as one of the
properties you see in there and I've
mapped that to the ID and to the short
label and the long label and what that
means is here is a short label are the
texts that you see and this pop up is a
long label so I can say here something
something and when I hover over this
what I couldn't work there isn't a
property like that there is a property
so we can take a look at our file to
find another property let's see there is
name
and there is also Sickler which is the
abbreviation so let's take that and
we'll go in here and we'll set that as a
long label so this is the abbreviation
of the state and now you can see that as
I move that pop up appears and shows the
abbreviation of the state so you can
very easily get hold of those properties
from our geo JSON file and reference
them in our JavaScript file so this is
the JavaScript side so we build up a map
provider and then we link to that map
provider in our LGA thematic map on the
view side so here is the map provider
it's a reference to that observable
property inside of our JavaScript side
and you can call this base map whatever
we like it can be any name and you can
name the layer whatever we like and then
you can see that there are different
colors that have been assigned to some
of the states as an example so I could
take another state so here's one state
and I'll add this one to this list so so
this state is the one in the bottom left
here we'll give it a unique ID and now
we'll give it a special color so I don't
know just gonna choose some random color
and when I save what we will see is that
this will have a color so I'll just save
ctrl s and the page refreshes and there
you can see this color so you can very
easily tweak and update this map when
add add values and so on to it so this
is making use of a JSON file that I have
downloaded and that is available locally
within my project but what you can also
do is you can link off to a JSON file
that you've generated in some other way
so it doesn't have to be a local JSON
file I want to see here in the browser
is I'm pointing to the the payload of a
Java EE back-end so here is where Java
EE comes into it so I have here a
customer back-end and this this is a
plain Java EE back-end connecting to a
Java DB database that I have set up
inside NetBeans and I'm so here is that
that database this customer data in
there and I can see all the customer
data in here now
question is how would I integrate that
into my jet application so what I can do
is correct let's create a new module
here so go here's and we can say here
restful jet module and we can point to
one of our restful services in this case
our customer service click Next and we
say we wanted to be created so we wanted
to be created in view model so this is
the JavaScript side and the javis and
the HTML side the the view will be in
j/s views so home already exists so this
will be customers say finish and now we
see that here is a again so before in
home j/s we had a component or home HDMI
way the comfort is called LJ thematic
map and in our customers HTML we have
component called LJ table so this is
another one of these nice jet components
and it's been generated from that from
that JSON payload these columns have
been generated when we look at the
JavaScript file you can see that we are
pointing to our JSON that is online so
now it's not local JSON in the file but
now it's JSON that is online and pushed
into a observable array called data is
are the values that are available in
that payload and so now we actually
wrote down so let's just make this a
unique attribute is let's say that it is
the name is the unique attribute and we
also need to include one more item in
here which is the making use of the
array table data source so here is array
so for each of the components that you
make use of you need to include this in
the define statement in your define
block within your javascript file so now
there should be good to go and I'm not
going to hook it into the application
I'm going to replace one of the existing
pages with our customers page so you can
see here that there's people okay so
we're going to I'm just going to delete
people Jas and I'm going to delete
people HTML
and I'm going to rename this to that
I've just created two people GIS and
people HD now so delete these two and
then this will be people and what was
the other one it was called customers
also so this will be people so now they
should be loaded when we switch to that
people page okay so basically you you
can don't okay perfect there's a typo
said you can't all the data from any
server basically yes so our data can be
in a micro file or it could be somewhere
online and this is integration with a
Java EE beckoned so this is a velocity
of Java to this to this Java Script
scenario right so you could have like
any type of observer in the backend yes
or cloud solution you can also I think
if I understood correctly also you can
also deploy that on a mobile phone or
any electable it's absolutely yes so
right now we're on the on the browser on
the desktop but jet also has support for
Cordova
so check mobile lets you create mobile
applications for Android or iOS or
Windows Phone via Cordova and this
integration works very nicely wonderful
so thank you so much for them for the
demo that was very insightful and well
see you at our next conference yes I
will be online so the the interview and
the demo will be also available online
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
