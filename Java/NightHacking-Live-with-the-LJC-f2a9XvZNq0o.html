loved the java community leaders and
there is your microphone so what we'll
do is to start out with will just
introduce yourself talk a little about
what you do and yeah say hi to some
through i'll be on the camera cool hi
everyone I'm Martain I help run the
london java community in particular i
try and help one the programs to have
developers around the world work to
adopt OpenJDK which is Java itself and
all the driver standards in the ee in
any space as well and apart from that by
wreak havoc at conferences as the
diabolical developer hello i'm tricia g
i am also an organizer in the london
java community I mostly organize where
we're going to get drunk and we have no
beer out which is very disappointing and
i work at ten dome which is very kindly
hosting this particular session and I to
speak at conferences largely about
whatever comes into my head at the time
my name is Victor grazi and I work in
the financial industry I also speak at
conferences generally about concurrency
and I'm Java champion and I am happy to
be in London hi everyone my name is
Alvin man in developer I'm a student our
city university and I'm actually joined
the group lost it last week thank you
so I'm Elliot I'm also pretty new to the
ljc I write about Java for Jack center
com that's about it really let's be any
conferences sadly on the Sailor hi my
name is to look I know I've been jarred
old perform last four years so I work in
financial industry and i joined this
community a month back sure for tonight
is we will do some hacking a different
technologies so I brought some stuff to
show you guys to begin and I also have
some bleeding edge stuff you take
employment and then we'll try to get you
guys set up so you can do little
projects yourself and will test us on my
equipment and I figure the ball process
that out until on the equipment dies we
rented a battery and then one go get
appropriately drunk okay so one of you
guys like these
alright so to start out with let's check
out my presentation that i put together
a little
and we'll go quickly or so easy guys one
citizen perceptions on rehab from
Portland
Travis to grow so we're doing this in
the room here we're watching live stream
projected all another life and I've got
a lot of top gear driving it with the
slides and straining to when you guys
who's the whole
yeah pretty good ci ci's long with about
a 30 second floor okay first thought is
just an introduction to the presentation
perfection second slide is the orbital
space that I will pop up for about 10
seconds standard don't base feature
proposition of the things like
next slides have a talking a little bit
about so I'm actually physically better
cycling around Europe I needy folks like
a little walk don't work doing
interviews with different folks on the
live stream and just like this is going
at a video stream and other posts to
watch it comments on social stream you
guys can check out the interviews and
five thousand six of them to another 24
do you part refuse and that's why my
quarter you can see on screen what in
the
yeah that's the final top right back
here okay so what about drop effects so
it's a desktop technology you can do
animation video Charlie etcetera
integrates with javascript HTML 5 you
slaughter web standards CSS for the
technologies and it has a optimized
graphics pipeline whole person so you
actually get quite the performance take
advantage of order to craft stuff so all
that is all that is goodness the way you
get Jonah ducks is you've got 10 so
that's it I think
attack Syria chat box if you dress up
that sounded Apple what is your favorite
operating systems all good stuff he you
guys see the free slot except because
everyone else is here my voice too late
i'm very excited but you have to listen
to me talk
you can use you know like a good ck use
a favor Debbie SS special support for
calipers and if something is easier but
obviously sometimes mixed most of us
about essentially put it flips there's a
good plug in x best solution I just
don't give me some things one which is
called best solution effects ok there's
a GFX / oh yes the same thing is
it
this is the best solutions system these
are a variety and you can even use take
over what okay so let's look at our
first job of our application and what
we'll use for this is an easel example
for power grows naturally let me
recommend this is this is not a usual
okay so two ways to do this on the one
is I try to talk the light
I think it has ever going it keeps
slipping farther farther clans all right
so it doesn't feel whole long you guys
this is this one first this is what I'm
saying pulse itemizes Nettie has changed
execution model up steps so it launches
doctors who want your classes but that
means you can't put a file itself the
final thing here is a small example of
scrolling text in javafx and flying like
a respective transform funky effect on
it it's clothing it to a certain region
display image and this is not much code
quite easy manipulate what a nice things
you can specify all these effects I
think
and it runs right on your desktop who
need those kind of go to atone quite a
lot so there's a bunch of different
visual hooks like drop shadows recover
and you can also do stuff like 3d 3d
animation which is why I play
and I was perspective
oh this doesn't use any jobs of teachers
in particular yeah it's just you you
said effects on different things like
let's say we want to do a drop shadow we
could simply pick another
can you fill those yeah yeah you can
apply multiple cuts an excess baggage I
think there's a
gets a little are these facts have input
and the input condition
she cast a different
see
that's really good
and then
that is a apply so quick powerful stuff
you can do dhadka now one thing I did is
I i modified this example just for kicks
and I put in you guys so I put in this
as the image
this one doesn't have three deep under
Minnesota to show up and I changed some
of the title else's stuff the nest rain
is just look at this is not enough for a
normal child phenomenal job application
you just extend the effects application
funds supply a method and then the
override certain
this is one in special effects artist
watch
alright
slightly not forever
kid yeah that's that's what I was trying
for with the 3d stuff but I hit the
angles and explain yeah maybe you guys
know all right that's a really simple
example what you here with java bex and
it also will soon run currently we have
public development base for the or which
is not a bad word it's a little more
expensive than it started posting
but
wonderful this
but these are your pretty nice little
force bases I
it doesn't and you can also have a cell
y vector to complexity to support the
kids it urges the outlets here 20 little
habits
Oh
the dinosaur busty heart you have some
two are currently pointing it out
optical standard Ethernet jack and two
USB ports if you want to use for your
support for even if you're using I party
feed my sister Club how to book this
bezel seal will reduce so this is the
processor here it's armed 676
she and her faster
okay except this this whore is a whole
distribution depends you can run job so
let's let's get that chart i guess i
have VLC which is a video video hooked
up to this is this is release a black
magic box which does other politician on
screen capture this is hooked up to hdmi
hit with restaurants you're seeing
exactly what's on straight here when
they Michael screaming how are our
social stream work
announcer
this is a
it is nice and the real ways i have this
is doing a presentation like this all
right round or executive working hdmi
your shop ok now this keyboard is about
passwords are standard pod right sorry I
think this might work this is not
productions doesn't means this and I
don't have the very latest virtually
part shows education but I do a version
of job which they're going to public
version of black students in turn both
which it hasn't all right
this version of the referee paisa needs
root access for some proper
mystic earth under needs root access
magic
I find especially the pipeline video
gives you kind really accelerates up
such prison on top of the deal
dell site versions of the fact
in the guys
things but this one was accessed
he
and
reversal
place
60 1925 sliding open gles are in there
sir
so have we been clear apply now we'll
see
Jasper
there's
this distracted was done by the DevOps
Commission's to do this but he got the
original graphics set up all of these
different elements come they were all
free to render in a common set of finals
masks on and that there's it some
additional ships and things so mix those
together
I think that's how I could it be that
because allie is right I originally had
an exit 20 with anything and a half this
work before I was in London Johnny
figured out an objective and sport and
so it was improv and I could be refunded
so I think we need each other
Oh
i also created two versions of 91 years
old all right so quick you'll see
this is any better
I
here's our bills I shot the discovery
there's a nice job st charles the u.s.
is on the three on the website is so
example it just it just email us right
examples a test for internal cracks and
it just got released and the answer some
of the new features that is so i think
you know what this is the future of
distributing that's how our patients and
you know doing a lot of people
search sorry was when I first came out
it was operated
and TV first job application that's
pretty
it showcases all controls
fitness
one
a few
as it is the same executable Sigma star
the
hello
the last year
no the right
so if you're walking in your practice
workbook
Oh
proton with us
ok
and then I was smart
40 LSP so that's what happens people
also the
see what
and most of all together I think I think
my life I saw posting so there's two
issues one two days over standards and
the other one is this is actually
playing
after one of the jacket up hold
it so you can still search you still
play without see you can either select a
good one well we have all enhanced off
which me just locks as a client and then
we put all dependencies and mix right
along with it you know it meant a gas
attack yeah I think you this potential
it yes I'd like the problem with Atlas
traditionally has been you have the
right person John himself and he had
that irregular from the Apple assault
for the browser
the operating system you're using not
some old version
and it's like we got in front or rear
side all right a lot less you're really
close it's a lot of support web starts
better we publish about for applications
is web start and it's a newer form of
deployments it doesn't want unplug it
and for most people
and ask packaging the best one
advantages of this is that your security
job here to jump here you know if
bubbles bubbles job and bubble the same
very few actually
worried about
it's the same approach I mean it bundles
the JTP choose with your honor and it's
the sellers here's a nativist hours for
those apple and linux windows has a
little mixing social tonight Apple has
energy files or less p.m. or so but you
can also then take that footsteps and
app stores that the apple app store is
where it supple is all I gotcha with
that is to get that working in the app
store the rim plus issues there since
fix that they haven't released yet so
that should be fine soon where everybody
for giving you the native p.m. geez 22
is that leads hopes you think is
important
yeah just a normal job x factor and
steady version option city was in the
traditional
you have to see
yeah yeah traditionally well the GV
website and most armored cars or any
plugins say this is I think this is
where you really want to beat the sweet
spot for applications and like like what
you guys attack engineer and apps this
is what he's going to do for many years
with their own job apps besides now some
such horrible
your change yeah so this says about
there this has a little updating thought
of things in the works packaging as well
although in a lot of cases you just want
a lot story date process let people in
apple app store say that there
this was all right I can show you this
is one ok so what I was thinking got the
single stuff to be found
that's not hard to do you guys have John
seven
so maybe so maybe we'll just work
stream
so that I open here
and a few video hookups on the stream
apparently my mic is fix all over there
yes I think of Wi-Fi double Wi-Fi
frustrating the
hey you made it
you're oh you're trying to get in and
you guys could make it all right so um
sorry I'm right arias okay why did you
let you introduce yourself on the camera
which is stringing us to all your
friends in the East Coast for watching
hello am I other time you will be in for
the delay oh so hello everyone Dario I'm
from the NYC java java user group and
it's great to be here in London and are
you trapped here because the hurricane
all right so we're just we just finished
the presentation demo part and we're
gonna start the hacking so we're gonna
do some hello world javafx applications
on a couple of people's visions and
I think also
this
since Lou
what
i will use it
alright here's this person virtual and
beer for you can see that you can you
can put yourself on your own courage
oh we have question for you so what's
the best energy due to this is I opening
normal and you project yeah this is java
project so senior suppose yeah yeah 1.6
social
superclass you can change it but it
needs to be the JavaFX application class
and you probably need to include the JFX
on TV are from your java 7 distribution
sofa y equal to t
these are photos for the new one imagine
one year huh yes please I think it's
upside down and I try to give 20 thank
you see said ECBC cool um Phyllis
extends java text our application is it
does is it the whole new visual effects
baba but you might not have it in your
and your path because they took food
down with our cleanup charm
jf xrd dejar in your home in your
library certification you don't know
what to put inside already so it would
be silly emeco so I make a mess in the
total built off yeah so the build tab
may be compiling building where's your
lives
now is this not working you just say
that speak up only one person maybe you
just want me know
with you
test test this microphone is very loud
which probably means my levels the two
mics oh I know it is batteries
alright so I never the same video or
just a sex you guys don't hear the
hissing as our place batteries and we'll
be back online in like 10 seconds
you
alright fresh batteries testing
test test all right I figured on all
right so apologized apologized to focus
on the stream for the audio issues it
should be much much louder now I had I
had both audio outputs going to any
other the other the other microphone one
of one of the switches got full baths
applause manana como
stop
I keep a long ago so change that to
something meaningful like stage and do
stage dot show and then i'll show the
window sure
ok so I get a window now you can add
stuff to this window so that the
hierarchy is there there's a scene
inside the stage that's your scene graph
and then to the scene you could add
visual elements like text or buttons or
controls so for example if you wanted to
tell me let me show you a quick let it
let me show you something quickly that
was a right click now left wing okay so
if you want to do stage set seed you
seen and we should get the proper clips
as a four-track variable but on the
scene we can
so yeah yeah area import it oh I
remember rude so the scene takes scene
takes a root as the parameter which has
to be something inside parent so put a
box in there an age box an H box is just
a vertical layout we're all the ailments
are kind of the lines vertically and
import this is 12 oops do what's the
clip system for chorus be okay and now
we can take our H box get children which
is a it's an observable list javafx has
what are called um reservable lists
where you modify the contents of the
list on the UI om Ackley updates and you
can add an illness to this like text
let's do a button
hello your keyboards weird yeah hello
javafx hello ljc okay and they we should
show after we got it it just so it
doesn't flicker ok and then control way
to import the button
do is a very important for the butter
newest couple thanks John Oh wrong type
of bond yeah that's a little easier but
thank you sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
