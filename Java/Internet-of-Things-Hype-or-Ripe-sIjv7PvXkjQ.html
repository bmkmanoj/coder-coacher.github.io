to throw our first night hacking panel
interview hope you guys are enjoying
your lunch and had some good sessions
after the keynote with me I have several
panelists too well we'll introduce
shortly we're going to try to divine if
the internet is really ready for devices
or not because there's certainly a lot
of hype about it I'm sure you guys have
heard things we have folks on an online
stream what you see up behind me is
exactly the same thing which is being
broadcast at night hacking calm so we
have a bunch of folks watching this live
from the live stream they're going to be
interacting via twitter via hashtag
night hacking so we'll post questions
from those guys obviously if you're in
the room here you don't have to use
twitter to interact you can just come
closer to the stage and ask your
questions directly to the panel and i'll
repeat it for folks on the stream so
sound good you guys ready for the panel
session yeah okay we need to add filler
applause there so
alright so just to set the stage the
Internet of Things which which is all
about devices and some small embedded
things that can communicate interface
with the internet with back-end cloud
services and change the way that people
are interfacing in their lives with
wearable electronics and different
things it's received a lot of hype in
industry analysts protecting 10 billion
devices and more coming up if you look
at all the companies investing in it
even here in the pavilion they have the
Lego Mindstorms over there which runs an
ARM processor I know for an Oracle we're
doing a lot of work on embedded and
there's also some other device
manufacturers here which build chips so
the question is is everybody ahead of
the game are they trying to put money
into something which isn't quite ready
yet or is this actually a technology
which you can apply today and and
actually make use of so we got some
practitioners here folks who actually
work on the technology and we're going
to chat with them today and see what
their opinions are about the state of
embedded and Internet of Things
technology so starting on my left here
Garrett Grunwald would you care to
introduce yourself yeah I can introduce
myself shortly so um yeah I'm a software
engineer studied physics working for can
do engineering in Switzerland and so I
came to the IOT thing just because I'm
interested in the physics behind it and
in the semiconductor stuff and it was
just natural to use Java and to code for
that kind of devices so so that there
was a happy accident yes very happy all
right mark
hi hello my name is marc ecko because
your engineer with oracle kind of st.
Louis Missouri USA office all right Mike
let him borrow yours and that was going
so well until then yeah my name is mark
heckler I'm a software engineer with or
kind of the st. Louis Missouri USA
office work more on the server side of
Java but the Internet of Things has
become a passion of mine so I've been as
we said in our talk earlier kind of
pressing against all of the edges I can
find to see where they lie and see how
far out we can push them so that's in a
nutshell it okay i'm jose paradigm from
spain it work at the University in
Valladolid I'm an engineer but my
passion has been for several years
codeine and applying this calling to
actual projects real projects and in the
industry so besides besides that I i
tried debated stuff for many long years
in this industry environment and now i
have the pleasure to share my hobby
hours with mark playing with a raspberry
pi to do the arduino on and all the
things you can find in the IOT
environment cool I'm you like American
working at the Swedish Institute at
computer science with networked embedded
systems like these ones really small
devices I'm developing low level see
mostly thought up a device you to tell
us what you put you hold up there this
is a court act mm3 bastes really small
system-on-chip with built-in radio so in
this you have 256k of a program memory
and 16 k or wrong which is a huge device
for me a small for anyone else but here
you can run a full type ev6 tack routing
protocols web server and more or less
anything you like soon I hope job also
so I'm working with this on a daily
basis low-level see but also on the
Gateway side and cloud side of course
java and other technologies also okay so
just to set the stage see if some
devices Jose would you like to
demonstrate to us and give us an idea
what sort of things you're showing your
helping with the mic while he's showing
it Isis for starters most of you should
know by now about the raspberry pi okay
this is a Raspberry Pi within a case and
a camera it's a very little tiny camera
but it's 5 megabytes of resolution it's
really huge resolution for this device
okay this is an arduino most of you will
know a lot other another we know for
sure we have this morning the keynote
with david were two years one of the
creators of the earth Arduino project so
this is another tool from Italy it's an
open pickles project and this is a fly
port with ethernet and web server
embedded so you can apply many seals to
build something more sophisticated with
your a with your bars so these are
Ethernet sales or deserve a zigbee
protocol Anton's and the sill for
plugging into the Arduino well I have
plenty of this at home and play with
them but you know there are many many
things many devices out there and maybe
Garrett will tell us about all the
devices in houses at home
well you know so the IOT that I use is
for your Arkham it's more super
supercomputer size so it's in the
gigahertz range dual core cpus you have
megabytes of RAM you can run java SE
which is with javafx support so this is
nothing that to run on this very tiny
cortex and three devices but the hurdle
to to start with is so low that every
java developer can really easily start
to to coat with that stuff and that
makes it so much fun in principle this
is not new technology if this is things
we knew for years but now it's so small
and so cheap that you can just buy it
and attach some sensors or actors at
home and that that's the fun part of it
and that's where I started with this so
I different devices on the market right
now like a BeagleBone black or
cubieboard or I don't know there are
lots of devices which have several a
similar specs and that you can buy for
around 30 to 40 bucks so here's a
question for the panel actually one of
the one of the folks online Jim Weaver
asked us a question over Twitter and he
was interested what sort of cool
projects that you guys are working on
and I think this is really directed it
sounds like like you guys are the the
hobbyists your your kind of hacking and
playing with the technologies and it
sounds like you actually have real
industrial applications which are
applying the embedded technology you're
working for so let's start with a good
hobbyist what are you doing Garrett ok
so first of all I also worked as an
engineer for the semiconductor industry
and there I used also embedded
technology based on Java using the sun
spots which are a little bit old now but
also arm-based and i use them to monitor
the temperature and other values inside
of a semiconductor lithography tool and
to monitor the temperature and visualize
it on my desktop so
I have a little bit experience of this
professional users usage of IOT but at
home i'm using it mostly for monitoring
temperatures humidity pressures i have
some actuators to switch on/off light
and all that stuff so location awareness
i'm now working on the interesting
things you can combine all these
technologies suddenly just on your
desktop using these small devices
talking to each other so that's what i'm
doing it's too many things to go into
detail so i think these guys have more
detailed information well i guess yeah
jose and i've been working together on
closer okay jose and i've been working
together on a couple of different things
but they probably the most fun one has
been putting together a renewable energy
system that is monitored and managed by
an embedded system using arduino
raspberry PI's as clients and remote
concentrators pushing as much as far
down the platform scale size as we can
even putting a Java EE web profile on a
Raspberry Pi to run as a data server and
using web socket to tie it all together
to where we have a globally networked
system where we exchange data and record
it live throughout and control the
system lights heat from anywhere i also
have just started working recently on
drone software and Samata autonomous
software for drones so that's something
I'm looking forward to getting more into
after jay focus so what so you mentioned
you both mentioned that you're doing a
lot of lighting and heating and things
with your houses so what what happens
when there's a power outage
well you learn the value of a good UPS I
guess that's the first thing in in a lot
of this when you're testing new
configurations you try different things
you switch configurations around and
recently we had a massive power outage
where I was and I had just changed my
configuration to pull some things off
the ups and and wound up scrambling and
rebuilding some some systems but but the
UPS helps smooth a lot of that out as
well as when you have a sufficiently
large storage or a battery storage array
then that can insulate you from a lot of
that as well but yeah as with anything
good backup sirki so it's kind of like
the difference between manual car
windows and electronic power yes
although i have to tell you after that I
really seriously considered the hand
generators for a while because at least
I would have kept things going when
things got a little dicey with ups so
yeah lesson learned so one of the most
exciting products I'm currently doing is
to port this small operating system that
we run on this really tiny micro
processors to give two to one platform
that happens to be inside this so it's
basically this plus power switch and
electrical metering so you this device
runs the same software contiguous as we
have in in this kind of open electronics
devices and actually it's going to be a
released product soon so it's going to
be more than hype fairly soon i would
say in more realistic device you see
people having those devices all over
their houses or visual businesses or
this will probably i mean we've seen a
lot of these devices all that is selling
quite a lot for smart home applications
and this will be the first generation of
that but this time all IP all the way to
the devices you can actually ping your
thing basically you can in the long run
I think this will be built into the
walls instead of actual additional
sockets because you would be nicer to
hide it away
but also we have some other projects
more on higher levels connecting
different types of systems like heating
system burglar alarms ventilation so
that these services can work together
today they're typically one service per
system which make them not really
optimal so you need to when you kind of
puts on your burglar alarm the heating
system could start slowing down and the
ventilation to avoid burning unnecessary
energy so there's a lot of interesting
things when it comes to how to handle
these how to connect different types of
services over over the internet also
okay let's imagine you mentioned
something interesting burglar alarms and
that ties in with the general security
concerns people have with Internet of
Things so if your if your house is now
on the internet and it's communicating
with different systems if I'm a thief
can I just pack your house and then
break through your security system sure
that's the problem it's actually I mean
what we need is probably something even
higher than typical credit card security
because that's easy to hack it could
guess numbers security card numbers more
or less today and steal people's money
that's handled today but it's worse if
they turn off your heating system so
security will be a key issue before we
have security IOT will actually just be
a hive so it's going to be very
important cool I had an experience it's
just a small example of what may happen
because in our demo we had all our
devices at home working so we we try to
show them working on a desk on the
slides so for that we need to get access
to our home and open our rotor open the
port so we can get with B and C or ss8
or whatever to our Raspberry Pi servers
and so on so when I was at home I opened
all the ports to test it when I was
working I
in and check everything was working but
suddenly one day I couldn't get into my
raspberry pi through a VNC server
because there were really it's true
there were several boats out there
trying to get into this BNC port which
is a regular port and the Shelbourne
blocked the connection because of the
many a times they were doing so I have
to change the debate the number of the
port to a different a random port to
avoid that but these things happens
because there are many many boats how
they are scanning for ports and
everything like that so you want to add
something here about security ok so
we've talked a lot about different
devices which which you can use so one
of the questions we have a we have a lot
of Java hackers who here is a java
hacker in the audience raised here raise
your hand I need Java hackers any shy
Java hackers are you at Java hacker
Matthias so for folks who are developing
a Java what are their options for doing
embedded development today what can they
actually like play with and build with
well i'll throw in what i think is
easiest raspbian now as of the
announcement was made at javaone 2013 Oh
peed back that rasp ian will ship with
the JDK so you've got java SE embedded
that comes with every build of raspy and
that you can download from the raspberry
pi gorg so that's a great place to start
and if you decide that you want to look
at Emmy or if you decide to look at is
in our case we actually deployed full
java enterprise edition with glassfish
for so java ee 7 web profile you can
build off of that so I think it's a
great place to start very approachable
something that you're used to the API
isn't used to are already in place you
just install the OS and you're off and
running
yay you can also start for with for
example Java ME embedded eight with for
around 16 euros you can buy a board from
stmicroelectronics which is supported by
Java ME eight embedded and so this is
just a tiny device and all you can also
get devices from Jim Alto which have
most of the time embedded to 3G
connectivity so that means you can build
your device put it somewhere and add a
sim card to it and then it can whatever
connect to the internet and all these
things are running on Java ME embedded
and then you can use things like the
cubieboard that I mentioned already so
all where you can run raspbian which is
a debian linux there you can use jdk h
SE embedded so it that's really any easy
start and really cheap well actually
there is a problem with the raspberry pi
with it you cannot load your usual a
regular ID there because it's not so
powerful to to run an open for instance
net being eclipsed or whatever so the
for now there are tools in for instance
in net wins eight a bitter which you can
download now that allows you to get to
the Raspberry Pi and but running
everything on your computer or from your
computer on the Raspberry Pi so you can
not only deploy and send the your
programs your jars to the Raspberry Pi
but also you can be back from your
computer on the Raspberry Pi with it
which is very very useful when you are
deploying your program so it's it's like
a really great tool for that ok you want
to add last comment yeah I mean
raspberry PI's really nice platform but
I considered being a good internet
things gateway and then you could
connect a bunch of other link you
consider the small chips the at those
endpoints the real internet events these
are the really small endpoint could be
your temperature sensors or things like
that humidity sensor co2 sensors
and then hook it up to your local
Raspberry Pi and do some nice processing
in Java and do some intelligent decision
making controlling your home so that's
that's one way of doing internal things
with Java or you build a bunch of
devices using raspberry PI's because
they're cheap enough to to actually use
several of but if you would like to
produce your temperature sensor smart
device and then start production you
need to go down where Yahweh is not yet
but I I'm kind of trying each year j
focus to tell oracle that yeah java
keeps getting smaller yeah please any
sits on really tiny chips now yeah so i
think there's hope these devices get
slightly larger their be moving from
eight bits to 32-bit ARM processors so
it's easier to scale up and as yall by
scaling down soon they will meet diode
then it's going to be much easier
because I if we would like to see this
50 billion devices 2020 I think it's
really important to get the higher-level
language on these devices because we
don't have enough low level c programmer
i think no one would really like to
convert so we need to get java or
similar onto these devices to truly
scale up to this and make 50 billion
devices before 2520 that's okay so
speaking of devices and gateway devices
where you might want to have more
interaction we got a question on the
stream and it was how javafx enables iot
applications guess who is from yeah so
yeah you can use java effects on on the
pie for example and like you mentioned
already it's the pie there's a great
device working as a gateway or to
visualize the data that it collects from
the sensor network for example there you
can use javafx really nicely and there
are other ports like javafx on android
and on iOS which are not officially
supported but
I have actually this watch on my on my
first which is running Android and I
have a job FX application running on
that watch so that shows the
capabilities this is like I said this is
just not not official and all right so I
think I think you're you're the first
person we have here with wearable
technology on our panel really wow it's
not that excited anymore right so this
stuff is available why don't you talk a
little bit more about the watch and what
it is and how you watch the amazing
stuff if this is the watch I ordered
from hong kong it's 140 euros so really
not expensive this is in principle a
mobile phone completely it's running
Android on an arm 9 dual core 1
gigahertz so it's really impressive and
you have a touch device and so you can
really do a lot of things it's amazing
what you can do with such a cheap device
right so if you can I don't know if you
can show it oh yeah so let me switch it
on and yeah it's I think it would be
hard to see but just let me take it off
and then I can show it to the camera so
so this one
just give it a second to boot up and
here we go so this is a job of X
application running on the on the watch
and as you can see it's not that slow so
this is something I created in javafx
and it's the same code I used on the
desktop I can also use on that watch and
I can can I can also use it on my for
example on my iPad or whatever so I have
no data here because I'm not connected
to the network but you see that I can I
can do these things and the animations
are quite smooth so it's really nice to
to do that kind of stuff even the
graphics are there this is connected to
my pie at home so it measures data from
my pie and visualize it on the watch so
yeah this is that's 140 bucks and it's
really powerful so you can do and this
is also IOT right if you if you if
you'll be honest then every smartphone
every iPad its arm architecture so that
means it's in principle the same just
more powerful than these tiny devices
but the base is the same and the idea is
the same so for me it's the same thing
so mobile and embedded is in principle
one thing I guess so that's my my
thought
so any of you guys are doing any you I
work with IOT user interfaces yes yes
for our demo we built in fact a 22 yo yo
clients one in javafx and 1a with
JavaScript and the funny thing is that
with the help of the designs by my
gallery it's very easy to run the JavaFX
client on every device and we learn it
we run it also in the Raspberry Pi so
it's really easy to meet the client with
with the devices because though they are
in the back end you can build you have
plenty of ways to communicate the client
with a good you're back in with your
server so with with Java you can do the
full stack you can go from the back end
to through the server to your client and
you can go ahead legend actually or have
your desktop or door any kind of device
you want so with gel effects is really
easy to adapt and to mix all these
devices one hit one thing you have to do
to figure out is the way to communicate
between each other and and you have to
difference to two main streams one
getting the data which is really easy
get everything from your sensors all the
readings display in goat cheese or
whatever you want and the other thing is
controlling real devices at home so you
have to establish two ways to to get in
touch with your devices one for readings
and one actually for writing and digital
pins to trigger some oxy own at home so
from your with your client you can do
both things and put some buttons and
switches or something like a gorilla
song to interact with your devices it
sure is really fun
ok so we're we're getting close to time
when sessions are going to get back in
but I want to get the the panel or
expert panels Paul so five years from
now how much of Jay focus will be
embedded because right now we have a
conference full of Java sessions and
there's a small embedded track so five
years from now what's your prediction on
Jay focus embedded it that's a hard
question i would say that we will still
at least have one track but also since i
assume that we have more java in many
more embedded devices it might actually
pop into the general sessions like we
had some raspberry pi sun on some
performance testing so I think maybe we
know we might not consider splitting the
topics anymore so it might even merge
into being more of the same so of course
you will not run enterprise Java on
embedded system but i think the
programming the way to program embedded
system needs to be closer to actually
programming your desktop or your mobile
phone so if yeah I kind of hope that
rather going to merge in and to be part
of the part of it at least going to be
in the other sessions also okay I have
to talk with your hands for that and
they would seen in five years time eh it
could be that that we don't need to talk
about something called IOT or embedded
style because it could be a solid to say
that we are still talking about a new
thing because in five years time it
should be all embedded in our real lives
so I guess it should be another
maintenance trane also like the other
ones right now
all right I was going to say almost the
same thing in the IOT keynote this
morning David mentioned that I OT the
Internet of Things is really
machine-to-machine computing for the
common person for the everyday person in
the world I think that as it becomes
more pervasive it will just be something
that will be incorporated in every
system if you think about the number of
wearable items or the number of wired or
wireless i should say items items that
communicate that we use daily already
it's kind of staggering and that number
is just going to go up so i think it's
going to take on a much larger role I
don't know that it's going to be talked
about as much because it's going to be
just an accepted part of everything we
do you get the last word Garrett ok so
yeah I think at the moment it's the hype
right IOT is the hype everything
everything is IOT and in five years my
prediction is then it's just there and
nobody talks about it anymore because
it's because it's everywhere right it's
just part of it so then we have another
hype I don't know what it is but it's
good the next big thing yes and you'll
be doing it oh no don't think so all
right so I want to thank my panelists
here for coming and doing the the panel
here Jay focus and then what our next
session is going to be rabia grounds
burger and 15 minutes to talk about ID
usage so thanks very much guys and enjoy
the next of the J pocus sessions come
back toward the next break and we'll
have another live stream
