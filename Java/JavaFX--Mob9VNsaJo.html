Network and I'm here today with a cherry
Ezio Senko oh and the Jim Weaver hello
so titties tell us a little bit about
what you do I'm working out general
chicken with the healthcare business and
developing our case management software
for following after patients and Jim
everybody knows you but just uh okay I'm
a technology ambassador for oracle being
an ambassador for java and java FX so
you've both just finish like a
conference session and so tell us a
little bit what what did you cover in
this session well cherry actually
submitted the session so maybe you
should go first we talk about javafx two
on the way you can create all
applications in javafx to it and the new
fears about it and the gym presented us
the whole new functionality of jeddak
a'ight blind to javafx eight so the
anything to add Jim oh yeah it was it
was fun because Terry actually submitted
the talk as a french-speaking talk so
Jerry did his entire half and I'll
francais and then I did my half speaking
in English but my slides were in french
because cherry had translated them and
so then plus while I was speaking I was
speaking in English and then cherry
translated each sentence I said into
French so was it was a really neat
experience he did a fantastic job with
it thank you that's a truly bilingual
presentation absolutely yes that's right
job yes
so July affects it tell us a little bit
what what is exciting with divides X
right now for me the exciting thing is
FX mls where you can do your own UI
using xml files and it's much more
easier than what we did in swing for
example in the driver world and what is
really exciting for me to is the whole
custom component you can create custom
companies from scratch or inner words
from other components and cousin item
the way notes some of the things I find
exciting that I talked about in the
presentation were things coming along
with jdk 8 and one of the things is
lambda expressions lambda expressions
really make event handling a lot easier
because we don't have to use as much
boilerplate code and we can use now
finally closures to do event handling
then I also talked about some of the 3d
features and I drilled down into 3d just
a really exciting area and there's a lot
of business cases for 3d i showed the
demo that that canoe corporation and
novice are doing that we showed a Java
one where they're using 3d to manage
shipping containers in the in the
shipping yard and then I went through
some miscellaneous features that are
coming in javafx 8 know what out some of
this fish juice oh just just a laundry
list of them like like we're getting a
date picker there's a really nice style
that the javafx engineering team has
come up with led by this effort led by
Jasper pots it's called Medina where
it's replacing Caspian as the new style
and it's just an upgraded very very
nice-looking style for for controls like
buttons and things like that
so that they picker the fact that we're
supporting embedded like raspberry pi
but then also java SE embedded for ARM
processors and things like that they're
just very exciting and new things coming
down the pike any demos did you do a
demo as well during the talk or you
didn't give ya sherry there are several
demos I did a little demo of an
application modifying an image by
modifying the red blue and green values
for that mage just to show how we can
customize everything and we can interact
using image apps available in javafx so
tiri you are working with javafx for
work but also you're contributing to
certain like open open source projects
we are I'm contributing to jf extra
which is a nape a bunch of new control
customized control with a lot of stuff
in here where you can use them from out
of the box inside your javafx
applications i'm doing a bread combat
control to add this is concept into a
javafx application cherry has also been
doing lots of presentations at with Java
users group in France and several
locations he's actually a former teacher
of for corporate Java classes and so
he's a very seasoned experienced teacher
and that really showed in the
presentation he did today very animated
very very descriptive to where the
audience really picked up the concepts I
believe that that he was talking about
so it was really really nice he's a real
pro with me thank you yes
so Jim tell us a little bit about what
is happening with the JavaFX community I
mean you have like a community online on
java.net so can you tell that's right
yeah the URL is javafx community calm
and it's growing daily more bloggers are
blogging about new things that they're
doing and the excitement is really
getting very high and they're they're
communicating with each other that's why
ments she re he was blogging about
things that he was doing and tweeting
about them and so the community is
really escalating into a very close-knit
and you know one that are really
innovating things in an open source and
and just showing each other examples and
we're learning from each other so it's
it's really been me any examples of
applications so thinks that people are
doing oh my word yes like for example
Garrett grunwald from from canoe he's
been doing lots of things with embedded
like you know Raspberry Pi and of course
he's got a great graphics I and so he's
been creating some really really
nice-looking controls you know I'm also
available enjoy effects frauds that's
right yes yeah very very beautiful and
is accused and then others have been you
know like Henrik Evers and and others
have been doing things some some really
nice applications and showing some
examples of what can be done others are
starting to blog about patterns that
they're discovering using javafx and
then advocating and so just on and on in
different dimensions of development
you know frameworks and things like that
okay so and have you seen so it is it
this this oldest feedback recent or or I
mean is there like a momentum going
here's a moment i'm growing yes ever
since we put the javafx community page
out there the number of bloggers has
been growing and the frequency of blog
posts and tweets has been growing yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
