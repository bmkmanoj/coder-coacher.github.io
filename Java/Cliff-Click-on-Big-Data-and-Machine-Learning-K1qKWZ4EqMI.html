Steven Chen i work for the Oracle
technology Network and i'm joined by
cliff click how are you doing with I'm
doing great thanks so so you're quite
famous in the in the JVM world for all
the work which you've done but your
current company does a lot of big data
and machine learning yeah so the company
is called h2o now there's an old company
name hexa data nice good programmer in
joke
and in the end the product does machine
learning at scale on big data and so you
know the nature of the machine learning
is a lot of high in math and you need to
go look at and visit and play with the
big data a lot so sort of our hallmark
is that we're holding all the data in
RAM in a very highly compressed format
and then we going past after past after
passover the data at ram speeds and do
this machine learning much much faster
than anyone else so we sort of easily
have the world's fastest logistic
regression by like 10 x or 100 x it's
like stupidly faster than anyone else
and on any such data you want okay so
for those of us who who don't do machine
learning what problem sets or industries
is this applicable to so um so the
industry's actually anyone who's got
data that they want to do something wet
so let me roll back a second here and
throw my two bits on how we got here um
you know a decade ago disk drives got
dirt cheap on some years ago Hadoop
became wildly popular as a sort of
almost free way to manage her huge piles
of data and your good high quality
important data went into an Oracle
database for what you paid gobs of money
for and then it's nice to input your
cheap junk you through 12 this Hadoop
database 10 years later we're staring at
terabytes or petabytes or more of your
google of cheap junk data and now can
you do something with it and so you know
netflix came out some years ago and said
hey look at this netflix prize for
picking movies out we're doing machine
learning on the data we've collected for
a long time and we're using it to drive
the business forward and then everyone
else will planet suddenly woke up and
said oh my gosh we have all this data to
surely make a business out of it somehow
we just have to figure out how so the
the machine learning is essentially
taking miles and miles and miles of big
data that's too um too big and too I
don't wants a subtle to pull something
out of and it finds correlation we're
human cannot it is machines are very
good at teasing out correlations whereas
you know it doesn't give you causality
to see why but it can give you
predictions that are amazingly accurate
and then you know from there it's your
job to go take those predictions and go
turn into a business proposition so it's
sort of a
you know from our point of view there's
a gold rush on again and it's mine all
the data you have and go turn that into
a business proposition and we're selling
shovels okay got it so with this be
applicable to say um stock traders or
people doing financial did any cell to
stock traders and people doing financial
data we sell to healthcare industry are
actually saving lives tracking sepsis
spread of infectious diseases sepsis in
particular but lots of others looking
for cancer and photographs we sell to
marketing people at Tech ad click kind
of stuff we sell to anyone doing
customer journey lifecycle turning
management kind of things we sell the
telcos ATT's using us to do maintenance
management on their fleet of a hundred
thousand trucks um their claims are
saving something like a couple million a
month in reduced downtime on vehicles
against that borders on kind of Internet
of Things yes Oh totally oh we've been
talking to Internet of Things people we
do a lot of fraud stuff so you know if
your credit card company I'm your big
one we losing a hundred million dollars
annually to fraud they have 40 years of
credit card history surely there's
something to be done here and in fact
paypal's using us there are claims that
were saving them like 11 million dollars
a month on on a you know sharpening that
fraud knife this fraud this funny game
where if you if you deny the credit card
purchase somebody gets mad they put in
the back of the wall they never use the
card again and you lose the one percent
right the guy walks in starbucks he
swipes the card he buys a coffee do you
accept or deny okay well that's this you
know maybe it's a thief he just did a
card reader in his car he's trying to
test charge is there's a good or bad he
walked into starbucks the cards good
sweet walks next door picks up the big
screen TV from best buy throws the card
away never uses again the banks out 100
you know thousand bucks in 30 days when
the consumer complaints right yep so
from the bank's point of view they have
this fine edge to walk do they deny the
charge do they accept the charge you
know where and if they piss you off they
lose your one percent that they're going
to get from that charges ok but so they
can use machine learning algorithms to
figure out so machine learning is is the
better way to start making
predictions yeah exactly okay so that's
the set of companies which might use
your thing so technology was what sort
of hard problems yourself so what we've
solved i'll say is basically in the 70s
was called the single system image at
Beowulf cluster kind of coding we've
made it simple this is all pure Java
it's all open source pure Java it'll run
on your laptop but if you put it on
three machines in a row they'll all just
cluster up by themselves and and build a
cluster as big as you want that'll hold
however much data you can hold into Ram
so we are Ram based if and then we can
do machine learning on that and we have
an interface we have a bunch of
interfaces we have an interface people
who've never done this before it's glee
base it's click through it looks like a
ipython notebook kind of web interface
where you can build a script but it's
entirely interactive script as you go
and you can test theories and change
things and see graphs and charts of your
progress if you're an old school machine
learning person data scientists you
probably using our for a long time if we
have an our interface that will
completely take our and just back it by
a cluster and so what you couldn't do on
your laptop and our I can easily do on
my laptop with h2o and our or I can up
in a hundred fold and go to a colonic
cluster okay so your algorithms for
compressing dated memory actually make
it possible to do bigger system checks
on a yachty so commodity pizza box x86
is absolutely absolutely we also have a
python interface it's new we also
interface with spark and we call it
sparkling water but we have a bunch of
interfaces so you know we're much of a
combination of funny old school language
and low-level hacker types and sort of
PhD state-of-the-art mathematicians and
data scientists you know blending skill
sets to make something sort of knew you
couldn't do before so I said logistic
regression what's that well it's a very
old school way to do a machine learning
of a kind that's been around so long
it's been in codified in the laws when
you get a load or denied credit you have
to be explained why you're allowed
credit or denied credit that explanation
almost always now comes from a logistic
regression that was run by the bank
and the district aggression produces a
model that is entirely it's interpretive
all you can understand the model and in
fact you can describe what the model
said to somebody's completely naive the
guy is trying to figure out why he
couldn't get a car because his credit
was no good um that sort of very
primitive if you will machine learning
model but it's very reliable very simple
very fast yeah and a lot of people use
it as a starting point but there are
many better algorithms that will make
higher quality predictions and it's
usually away from a sort of government
regulations so the rule all bets are off
you do whatever you want and so the
sharper the prediction the the generally
the more you can turn it into a profit
line you know the fraud guys can does
the government actually mandate which
algorithms like they almost did what
they do is they mandate what level of
explanation you have to be able to
provide and so only feeling it provides
that right now is logistic regression
yeah so it's my theory that this is
going to change over time because these
better models are being used by non-bank
entities non-regulated Bank entities to
to loan money to people and there are
call themselves a bank and they don't
call it a loan but it's effectively
alone and they're actually making
profits because they can do better I'd
make a better another job of predicting
who will pay off and who will not
absolutely absolutely cool okay so that
was a good overview of what you're doing
now thanks very much for the short
interview here at the Q con conference
um the rest of today and tomorrow I'm
going to be interviewing different folks
who are speaking here the conference so
stay tuned at night hacking calm or tune
into the twitter handle add underscore
night hacking so thanks very much cliff
you're welcome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
