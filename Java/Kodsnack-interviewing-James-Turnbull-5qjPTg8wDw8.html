server is it a problem or should we just
ignore it the rtmp rtmp flasher
Oh
I go here do the same thing
there we go no complaints this time so
welcome James two cords nakia coach at
well actually turns out microsoft has a
podcast called coach at now so okay
there you go play with him first
in my mind I translated the code chat
and I thought I wonder if that sounds
sensible in English or is it just to me
but turns out it might be careful i
think they have more lawyers than me oh
yeah I'm afraid so one or two more
perhaps yes yeah so you're well you used
to be a doctor or well how are we to put
it like I was a docker I was one of the
early employees when it went from not
cloud which was the has company to Dhaka
yeah I was there for a little over lunch
under under a year possibly and my
primary role when i was there was to
think about two things one was helping
solomon hikes sort of run the open
source community and get a bunch of
things organized around that and
documentation and all that stuff too
heading towards the one point i launched
at dhaka now and also commercializing
the software and I building a sort of
services and sales and her and support
model around it yeah and now you're at a
Kickstarter that's right I've been there
just over a year oh yeah I was thinking
it sounds like kind of a big guess which
is sort of going from like working with
the infrastructure to sort of
infrastructure consumption perhaps yeah
so I think the last couple of companies
I worked at you know darker and puppet
labs both heavily infrastructure
companies in the back end of things no
not really retail companies whereas
kickstart is obviously a retail web
property yeah but um it's something that
I'm sort of fairly deeply interested in
as a as a as a product um I'm actually a
fairly big user was a fairly big user of
Kickstarter but prior to working there
and it's also local to me so it's a nice
they're based in greenpoint which is a
few minutes from my house so I'm whereas
my previous life I spend a significant
amount of time and aeroplanes and my new
life are I spend a little bit of time in
the subway
in the network so that's very pleasant
that's a nice stuff but it's also nice
some to be doing something for a
missionary company so Kickstarter is not
a for-profit company like most ones it's
a public benefit corporation so it's so
really we obviously make money by out
where the objective is is actually to do
social good so in this case to generate
social capital by building creative
projects that was new to me I don't know
if our most people aware of that um that
the the actual formal public benefit
corporation change happened a month or
so ago Oh prior to that we were what's
called a B Corp which is like a
essentially a you have the same you're
you're at the same sort of values you
articulate that you have a mission and
you want to do things but you're not
legally bound to do it we actually
change the constitution of the company
to make it us legally bound to do the
right thing instead of traditional
companies really designed to maximize
value for the shareholders our objective
is to maximize you know public benefit
now social cap would in this case no sir
so you find yourself thinking these days
about quite different problems than
previously a doctor and um you know I
think sometimes that there's there's
some strong similarities there you know
I think about it you know what what
Kickstarter does is a product what dhaka
has a product there's a lot of similar
parallels their product management
doesn't change very much it's a
different way of looking at the world
like a retail web properties at
different way about but you're still
trying to you know we're still trying to
persuade people use Kickstarter that's
sure it's marketing and sure we're still
trying to you know sell people on the
concept and that sales and we still
trying to build a product and so means
talking to customers and getting
requirements and understanding what
people need and it's just a slightly
different focus yeah little switches
here and there so so do you think your
doctor has succeeded that's what it
should be and what it's doing um let's
see against it's interesting question I
guess it depends how you define the
success right yeah yeah in terms of in
terms of a
a brand and as a as a way of thinking
about the change in the industry it
certainly succeeded um I don't think
people were thinking about immutable
infrastructure about lightweight
containers and things like that very
much no beforehand this might have been
a small group of people who cared about
this high performance computing people
but it wasn't a mainstream concept oh
and i think that docker has made it a
mainstream concept as to where the
product is I'm if you look at how far
doctors comes instead of one point 0
onwards it's pretty incredible but I
think the product is our is is there yet
in terms of like are there are lots of
moving pieces in order to make a product
sort of really simple and just a drop in
sort of thing and to make it applicable
to a lot of different workloads I think
it's probably the sort of product market
fit is not quite there yet but um that's
more just a maturity and the length of
the project we come naturally you know
you want to keep failing or anything
that yeah I'm just start doing like big
mistakes somehow yeah and I'd be
surprised I think the community is now
large and uh dr. done a very good job of
governing the community they have a
governance board have a you know a
fairly active open source community I
think it would be hard to derail too far
yeah yeah do you think and it's a writ
he said is there sort of sort of a
natural next or a few next steps for
docker like in two months it should be
lesser in six months or a year I think
the logical steps Sedaka is very it was
very focused on it was built on the sort
of unit of the container yep sort of
infrastructure running an application
inside a container the next logical step
from my point of view is to move up the
stack to manage lots of containers and
allocations and services so work around
things like dr. swarm and dr. compose
and machine and outside in other parts
of community seems like kuba not ease
and things like tools like that mais
also mesosphere
integration with with sort of platform
as a service products sort of heading in
that direction so I suspect that the you
know six months from now I don't think
people will be people were starting to
be starting to measure dockers
capabilities not about managing
individual containers as a unit of
compute but managing clusters of
containers as an application and a lot
of the work that's being done right now
is designed to sort of move in that
direction now so it's the container
level solution kind of finished or is it
should it I think it is pretty much
finished there's a few rough edges like
the light at latest release added a lot
more networking support that wasn't
there previously support for storage
backends and things like that that
answers a lot of people's concerns about
the sort of that container manageability
and there'll be lots more nice to have
features but I don't see any mission
critical missing features currently
might be some ways that change
deployment to the way that containers
are executed the example of that is a
currently there's a dr. Damon as to
whether there should always be diamond
or whether a container should be a
self-contained executable that may
memory necessity change but I don't
think it fundamentally changes the the
API or the way a dog attain easily basic
solution is yeah solid yeah I'll start
with a loose version of this little
detail it if I if it's needed who should
be thinking about docker who should be
aware of docker I think there are two
groups that really need starting about
dr. one of those groups to sort of the
application development community and
I've pretty you know they've paid a lot
more attention I suspect though it's
still probably early adopter community
like I think that I'm a conference like
this which is heavily Microsoft and
heavily that the Java world this is
probably something that's sort of
touching people's periphery not actually
inside their way of thinking and I think
those people need to think about that
because they're the ones that
fundamentally suffer from the key
problem of I have code it's on my
machine I want that code to run
somewhere
actually some money yeah action and I
want to have that happen very seamlessly
I want to be low friction and those
people are still trying to solve those
problems yeah you know I mentioned
Microsoft before that one of the things
that I think has been really interesting
about the take-up of a value of for
example is that it's integration with
visual studio so you can just basically
go into visual studio and say here's my
application I would like to launch it on
a computer instance in Azure and I click
one button and it's done ah that's
incredibly powerful lets you see the end
product to be and that's what I think
that um where we're for a lot of
application developers docker will get
them all not all the way there but some
of the way there towards making that
sort of step and the second group is
really people doing production
operations oh yeah I need to start
thinking about that their application
developers are going to start using this
tool already I using the tool you have
to come to terms of it being part of
your environment and how'd you manage
and deploy it and make it part of your
you know make it production ready for
your environment yeah yeah and that's
yeah one of those people on the
periphery that's definitely me I mean
I'm starting to get sort of a feel oh
yes it's solved this problem that's
really interesting it's probably very
applicable to what we do but I'm not
sure quite where to start we have this
product already should I was be starting
to think in some particular way about
how I developed to sort of start
adapting my mind to it yeah i think so i
think one of the really nice things
about docker is it it's sort of in
carriages a new way I think about
architecture and I'm certainly not a
something on a microservices fanboy I
don't think every solution needs to be a
micro service in fact a lot of
monolithic applications are very
effective and and and perfect for their
jobs no but it does start to think about
even your not think about mark services
themselves does set you think about your
application architecture in terms of
redundancy and resilience and what are
the pieces that make it up um I think a
lot of the challenge you have we have a
very large model nas's it's very easy to
make a change at one end of the monolith
that has an unintended consequence on
the other end of the model oh yes add to
that their layers of things like secure
operational security and monitoring and
all those are the things we like
developer changes the way our particular
socket works but doesn't realize you
need stopped at a bunch of firewall
rules and all of a sudden you deploy to
production it doesn't work oh yeah I
think docker sort of it allows you to
sort of introspect all that stuff and to
find a lot of that stuff I think that's
a very interesting that's going to
provide a very interesting perspective
for a lot of developer so so let's say
just hypothetically leather we have a
rather maybe maybe not exactly one
monolith maybe two monoliths or some
people make up a system we use would've
with a natural way to start thinking
about what could be to like wrap out
each monolith in a container to start
thinking about packing things apart in
some particular way I in some cases
depends on me the monolith is right if
you talk about a hundreds of thousands
of lines of code then it's probably not
going to run in a container okay but if
you think about the monolith is probably
made up of some sets of services like a
good example here is where heavy users
of elastic search and that's something
that very easily could be dropped into a
container memcache rattus things like
that that are on the periphery of the of
the monolith things that you can easily
start to split out and put into
container often your model this is not
as model too thick as you think like
it's not are in many ways she think
about the fact that you know maybe it's
it maybe it's modular in a web tiered
kind of way so you know I'm web server
application server database sir yes like
all you can run all the web servers
instead of instead of running those as a
standalone host you can run them in
containers yeah same with application
servers and desire yeah if you start
with a more physical architecture and
and then if that if that you know works
then you can look at the more logical
architecture inside in agile application
components yeah because when I started
thinking about it I realized that one of
the rather monolithic things we have its
it probably would fill up fall apart
very neatly into smaller services
because the me the main reason they're
all there is that it was convenient to
put them there yep but they're still
very isolated things and when you try to
look at them as a whole they communicate
in really weird wait and you'll see this
quite often on an application server
right they'll be
will be 20 services that run on the
server that make up that application and
they're already services that there may
be that they are memcache and reticent
elasticsearch they would exist there and
they're already configured there and
they exist in the same machine because
it was really simple right you have to
worry about networks and ports or other
things talking to one another or it just
like what local to local is is really
easy like if you're if everywhere in
your code you know memcache is referred
to by local host port named port number
then you know that doesn't require a lot
of thinking whereas if you actually put
it on a separate machine you have to
start thinking about managing that
machine managing the connectivity
managing the relationship now yeah the
reason i asked about you know who should
who should think about doctors that it
occurred to me that I mean it's it
through least infrastructure on some
limit some level so maybe should there
be a future with where it sort of
disappears completely from you it's just
you know electricity are we sitting
around like building our own little
power plants right now yeah I think
there is um anyone orange an android
phone runs containerized apps right now
and I have no idea um uh I think in the
future you know I don't why I do but I
don't really understand how let's say
let's say let's say I'm you know I'm not
I'm not a I really understand how my
phone works for example no this case I
do but the sidebar but they've glee sad
don't um exactly like the vast majority
the peak of people when they launched
Google Maps have no idea what's
happening all right they know that
somewhere this must be a server
somewhere that has all the dresses and
and must be able to map the advance of
the physical thing and and do
calculations to work out your routes and
lots of stuff but and someone an equal
of that there's there's probably a
containerized app of some kind running
or series of controls but the details I
don't really care and I think
application developers need to know a
bit more but honestly shouldn't really
have to worry about the fact they should
just be like there's compute resources
available i can consume them yeah yeah
maybe maybe somewhere on the level of
you i mean adding networking to an f
vacation I mean you're sure you have to
think about you have to know about it
but it's not like you have to write the
tcp/ip stack yourself anymore yeah
correct and even thing complicated
things like load balancing and stuff
like that it should be relatively easy
to be able to go I would like this to
talk this application to work on two
containers instead of one and to have a
single VIP IP address as the find or
having a round-robin or like those sort
of things should just be something you
can grab a component of and something
that amazon has been very good at
providing the people is that there are
those little self contained services
still way too complex to adopt and
require you actually have some skills
but if you think about them going
forward things like cloud formation and
stuff like that which is sort of
infrastructure building blocks like were
you I like I would like one of these in
two of these and three of these that
should be the way we should be thinking
about infrastructure now yeah make it as
simple as possible but not not too
simple yeah I guess yeah so yeah so
you've got a lot of writing as well
we're talking about that before we got
on stage yes bringing books on doctor
and more stuff I think win7 technical
books yeah so a couple on puppet one on
docker some linux systems she's had been
sort of books I monitoring book many
years ago and work in another monitoring
book at the moment so so how did you get
into the book writing side of things um
I'm honestly not sure I remember
precisely it's not of all the ten years
ago now my brain as I I think at the
time I was working heavily on Linux
system security and I there wasn't a lot
of good books out there and I decided
you know maybe I should write something
and I started writing some stuff down
and a friend of mine who was going to
co-write the book with me said um you
know we should get a publisher and we
should do a sort of stuff and I was like
okay we approached the publisher engaged
on a pitch and all of a sudden I have a
contract and they want me to write a
book know what now I actually have to
write a book and it was it was a pretty
sort of it was a pretty sort of scary
experience at first I but but I realized
that that um I I rise that I think I'm
reasonably good at it and and be one of
the most frustrating things about our
industry is there's a lot of really
useful knowledge trap from the minds of
some very very smart people oh yes and
and and you know the old William Gibson
line the future is not evenly
distributed now in our industry
knowledge is not evenly distributed so
my objective was to try and write things
and almost all the things I right or
very much aimed at you know getting
people and understand basic concepts
lowest common denominator I don't write
very very technical books and technical
people and books that say here's a
technology like Dhaka if I am an average
application developer or a web developer
how might I learn about this in such a
way that I could work at how it's useful
to me without becoming an infrastructure
expert yeah um that's really good yeah
good way to a my thanks like yeah and
some people I get you know every now and
again I'll get a review of a book that
sort of says I'm this was too simple I
was introduction I'm like yes yes
congratulations are high of 68 is
exactly perfect i'm so happy for you so
I want all of this detail and I'm like
okay um these are not the book for you
there now exactly and yeah there is such
a need for I mean introductions to
things that start from some kind of
sensible low base level and sort of
naturally upward yeah and I think this
is one of the things you don't you know
if you look at the vast majority
programming books they really are like
like with my should look at some
specialized set of patterns or something
specific I I don't know a programming
book that doesn't start with the same
simple you know hollow oldish variable
let's just how you assign a value to it
Apple right they don't assume that you
they might assume you have some prior
programming knowledge like conceptual
knowledge but then an assume you
understand how the syntax work so now
and I know I I think there's a there's a
niche for books that are more complex
but I'm I think we have enough of a
challenge with them getting people
educated about technology full stop not
not just in the industry that the more
simple books out there
and I mean so often if someone can
explain sort of the thinking around
something really well then you can go to
the like detail API documentation I
figure out the details yeah when you
need them so I don't think there's the
same kind of need for books about those
very low-level parts perhaps yeah I
think there's some interesting stuff i
mean like um there's some classic books
like if you look at some of the classic
unix systems for our gaming books no
people go you know that these are quite
complex books and I'm like yeah they are
but they're not act that if you look at
the way they're structured and written
and dennis which is a good example of
this isn't there very conceptual books
they teach you the unix way of doing
things and obviously you know you you
end up having to be quite technical but
you lee you finish the book going huh
this is how this fits together yeah in
such a way that that I'm you know you
right it's not API documentation you've
now you've learned a methodology
approach as well as a bunch of technical
information yeah yeah the sort of stands
alone as well you can figure it out the
book actually teaches you this thing
yeah yeah I talked to Dan Friedman the
other day you know about his book right
now and he was also into those things
like the book should stand alone and yet
it build up the thinking and yeah teach
you something that way yeah so can I
also assume that some people never
finish the book right they will reassure
couple of chapters and go I understand
enough to do what I want to do yeah and
after that I care yeah um yeah I think
that's a I think that's a good way I
think about when you're building a table
of contents or Walker's thing about like
who is going to get all the way through
the book and put the stuff that no one
cares about the end oh yeah or the Red
River people yeah if you need this it's
here but that's the content changes
really quickly to like if I if I built a
reference manual for daca oh yeah I
wrote most of the original documentation
huh with a couple of my colleagues it
changed every day oh yeah so um if I if
I'm you know documenting API endpoints
like no in a book that was never done I
guess I guess maybe that's one of the
reasons people don't
put more work into writing writing well
and documenting things deeply in our
industry because you have always had
this feeling that oh this changes so
quickly anyway I think also developers
are inherently lazy people yes and
documentation is not high on their list
of priorities I find that uh I manage a
team of engineers they're actually I'm
actually I think we have a pretty high
bar for documentation and it's we care
very much about onboarding and getting
people to understand how things work and
as a result there's lots of there's lots
of information out there about how
things work but it's definitely not one
hundred percent of information oh and
I've worked in organizations that where
you know new developers have to sink or
swim right that documentation you can't
introspect the API if no idea why prior
decisions or may accept digging through
commit logs and and and you know I think
we've all seen the commit message that
says fix this problem you know or trying
something else what or that's if
you're brand new developer and you read
that code that's not useful to you
doesn't help alchemist it says it
doesn't help me they're actually and
yeah a year later you're not gonna
remember y know that or no week later
yeah but is that something you work a
lot with like sort of raising the bar
for documentation or I try to do in the
communities that I'm involved in like my
I think my lightest contribution to most
of the open source projects I've worked
on has been sort of documentation and I
try and if I if I use a somebody's to
lure um you know I try and leave it in a
better state like if I if I have to
puzzle something out and they have some
way for me to document the thing i
puzzled out then i tend to my my commute
back tends to be more documentation than
code because someone else is gonna have
the same problem right now all words
there's nothing like reading through a
you know 40 posts on a my own list with
everyone has asked the same question no
one has an answer I'm like oh god I'm
just going to write that down somewhere
reply to this thread and go here its
undocking yeah yeah but I think we have
as engineers we have an obligation to
look at our profession
well rounded and and by well-rounded I
mean not just writing you know amazing
code but actually right you know code
comments and tests and standards and
styles and having style guides and then
documentation all of those things to
varying levels of depth now our aspects
of being an engineer yeah and one of the
reasons the engineering world that the
proper in the capital e engineering
world finds computer science such a will
call it somewhat lackadaisical science
yes that is that in any other industry
it for like a mechanical engineer or a
civil engineer you you can't do anything
that documentation no civil engineer
builds a bridge without it Oh a really
detailed plan a list of every single
component and how it fits together on
tolerances oh yeah like and then test
plans and like you you we're the only
industry that calls itself engineering
where this isn't a base requirement now
and you could argue that some of the
things we've all down as important as a
bridge and ensure not everybody's
building aircraft control software
fortunately yeah the tolerances should
be oh yeah yeah and more and more of the
technology we use becomes critical to
the way we we live like whether it's you
know if a bank let's say a Swedish Bank
has a has an ATM out it's right and and
and half of Stockholm can't get it to
ATM like that paralyzes the city if
particularly lets the scanner neighbors
a good example is where point-of-sale
systems are pretty much yeah very few
people outside of smaller businesses
carry cash right yeah guards right if
you wanna sell system crashes like there
are significant people for whom like a
weekend of a point-of-sale system it may
not be able to buy food no that's right
and i think that there's a you know
whether it's the transport industry the
finance industry or even simple things
like like how much of your job could you
get done if your email doesn't work no
like um well for me it's a whole piece
you are a developer but for your
business as a whole like that email do
because we're out it's the same places
where your phone was or the fax was 20
years ago um 30 years ago
so from my point of view a higher level
of tolerance and a higher level of
precision needs to be applied to our
profession now so so like documentation
Weiss do you think there is anything
yeah a good place to start basically to
improve your like documentation writing
processes in our projects is there
anything particular wicked um I think I
actually its realism I think there's the
first thing you need to do is you need
to explain what your thing does now and
what it doesn't do and you need to
explain to people how they install it
and get started with it and then if
you've got those things down then you
start to look at use cases in you say to
people this is how you do whether it be
a how-to this is how you do various
things here's had the API fits together
big believer in um self-documenting
api's and we introspect api's
particularly ones that sort of spit out
like here is here is the jason that goes
in here is the json that comes out you
know I'm makes testing really easy but I
think having that very basic thing of
like like often i'll open a github
project and there's all there's a title
align a text and it's like gem install
something or keep install something good
and I'm like that's it the documentation
and and the response from the developers
I'll go with the code and I'm like okay
that's great um what if i'm using this
and I don't write the language that
you've written your your your up utility
in or I'm you know I junior person or
now sure the code doesn't make sense
there are many reasons yeah and to write
maybe 10 paragraphs the documentation
that sort of say you know this is what
it does how install it this is how it
works this is how you get started with
it dude no I get it's not it's not an
expensive exercise no and then then I
them the next question okay say I start
writing stuff so where do I put it so so
it ends up in the right hands um well it
depends i mean i think that that read
maze in in in in repositories are a
healthy start I firmly recommend to
people if they're building tools that
they create a website
and I think one of the reasons that um I
used this example of time but are you
familiar with a tool called vagrant yeah
aashiq or there's a mutual I assure moto
one of the things about that has she
called tools as they all come with
amazing documentation and I think their
adoption has been significantly enhanced
by the fact that it the documentation
explains just how it works and just
works out of the box so i think you know
having a nice website having um you know
a way for people to be able to navigate
lots of pictures useful i think even
drawing simple diagrams like you know
this participate this bit goes into this
bit and thumbs out there you like
conceptually our people to grasp things
or more quickly well yes but i feel like
i feel like a problem i've seen which is
where this question came from of course
is that okay a group of developers we
have a sense that yeah we we don't write
enough documentation it's clear that
some stuff we want to communicate it
doesn't get out but if we start writing
this I mean we have we have our source
code repositories and stuff and maybe we
have a wiki somewhere but we don't
really really have a feeling that these
are the right ways to reach the other
people around us the people inside our
company and then maybe later on i'm
writing this now I know the customer
will want to know about this thing and
sort of a sense that there should be
some kind of way for me to write
something and put it over here and say
that this is for other people it may not
be polished for customers but I'm so I
think he's an example that I used to
people all time um a couple projects
we're going to have three types of
documentation one set is auto-generated
out of the commands and and the API and
software and now its reference material
it when you deploy a new version it
automatically builds the website that
has all of the list of all the FI
endpoints and what happens in it has a
sort of how to and use case
documentation that's maybe not polished
but now and that automatically gets
published to a wiki and we
I'm you update and it's the
documentation lives in the source code
tree and a doc directory to mark down
use a check or creates a website helmet
and last one is as a readme and the
readme basically says here is here is um
here's how the basics of at work and
here's the pointer to the docks here's
the things that I'm missing from the
docs like a little to do here's the API
documentation and here's how the current
versions work and like that's that I
think set the basics of that up in most
projects it's probably half a day's work
all right maybe soft documenting API
stuff but you know it's held javadoc you
know those ways you could do docstrings
I name me a programming language that
doesn't have dr. saturday night this is
a relatively simple fix I mean you could
spike on on um it's a matter of
investing time you could spike on on
simple documentation for most of your
app sure you know very quick furniture
yeah then I guess the rest is that you
sure you know communication and yeah and
and you you tell do stuff like um you
know new people have to leave the
documentation better than I found it
right yeah yeah a new person on boards
they you know obviously have to build a
development instance of the of the app
I'm like document the process make sure
well yeah yeah does it fit together with
what the last person wrote about the
process no no this has changed and that
thing and yeah no documentation
important yeah I think we're about done
okay thank you so much problems yeah it
was a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
