everybody to the june java cig new york
java sig meeting
thanks for trekking all the way over
here from our usual credit swiss host
and thanks to Q Khan for hosting us at
the hotel here how many people here are
attending Q Khan good very much people
that's great so tonight we have two
great speakers talking with Steve and
Nicolas to talk about Java SE 8 and
Legos and other devices and Nicolas from
Mike pronounces correctly it Aldebaran
so is that named after the star
Aldebaran that's what we'd like to do
with our robots I guess yeah but also to
say that it's a new territory to come
here ok so before I turn it over to
these gentlemen my take it's going to
it's going to be a tag-team map of
presentation
how many newcomers do we have here good
we have a couple of newcomers so
normally we have the first 15 20 minutes
for open Q&amp;amp;A so if you have questions
about Java that may be some way next you
might be able to answer this is the new
york java community so we're the were
the biggest Java user group in North
America so your your colleague next to
you might be able to answer a question
so if any questions on Java that we
might be able to answer now is it time
to do that so we could maybe spend a few
times now we have two speakers so we
have the room till 9:30 any sigh are you
doing
now's the time so if you have any
questions on Java anybody all right
add some incentive to this
so as you guys notice we're also live
streaming and recording the talk here
ends folks who speak up during the
presentation get one of the night
hacking laptop stickers so you can see I
have one on my computer this is
exclusive only people who are on the
livestream can get these Wow so ask a
question about something now and you
guys sticker yeah
and I'm past the mic and also okay yeah
take this with you is on your way hi hi
um so I have a question to go around
Java 8 and hope stream well the streams
library and everything it's a basic
question so why would I use it why would
is it with let's say I'm doing some
query whatever was a filter why and I
was the difference without well with
putting a stream and not putting a
stream I should I have actually always
go for a stream okay so make sense I
assume this question is directed at me
but someone else must take a stab at it
feel free so what sort of query you
trying to I don't know let's take
something like sorting a collection for
example by some predicate okay all right
so let's take that example like sorting
a collection by a predicate so you could
do it directly okay I'll cover that as
well so the normal you do it like in
Java 7 is you would take the your list
of elements and then you'd apply some
sorting algorithm on the list and it
would mutate the object in place
probably like it was an array list or
something and that works fine and will
give you a you know fairly efficient
tree sorting of the list but if you were
doing this on a very large list and you
wanted to take advantage of multiple
processors you would have to do your own
algorithm for giving up the work to
multiple processors to do a parallel
sort
when the advantages of the streams API
so there's a new API introduced in Java
8 and it's the first kind of big example
of how to use the new lambdas the new
the new lambdas feature language feature
of Java 8 one of the advantages of it is
it has the streams API supports
parallelization of operations so in that
case if you did a sort using the streams
API as opposed to just using like a
static list sort on the ArrayList the
streams API could paralyze it across
multiple processors and improve the
efficiency for a large list so does that
answer your question
no not entirely actually I should have
to make myself more clear maybe that's
more of a backup I presume that answer
is backward compatibility I'm actually
looking out between parallelism and
being sequential I'm just looking at
just one sequela
just in the sequential world was the
difference in actually applying a filter
and a predicate between a filter and
break with a stream is there actually
any difference or is just done that I
mean why do we actually have the stream
is just part of the call ok so why you
streams instead of doing it kind of the
old-fashioned way well not the for a
little but you can just do a write
collection dot sort whatever the field
to collect this by yeah ok
no actually putting the screen before
that I mean if you put the stream yes
you can do it as parallel stream as well
but you have the stream dot stream and
dot parallel stream right and I'm just
wondering what's the class yeah so I
mean I guess the advantage if you if you
don't care about power wisdom the main
advantage you'd get is if you were
chaining operations together using the
streams API so you could have filters or
Maps or other operations interspersed if
the only thing you're doing is sorting a
mutable array then you could just sort
it on a single processor in place yeah
Barry what about the argument about the
clarity of the code I think there's
something to say there is that you can
write an algorithm that's more readable
at a glance with parallel with with
lambdas than without them
yeah I mean for more complicated cases I
think that applies but I think it's a
good fair question I get I actually I
get asked whenever I give my lab this
talks about as a Java developer why
would I want to start using lambdas and
I think it's it's a common question
because it is a lot of new API and
language feature to learn but you do get
a lot of benefits both it makes a lot of
use cases much easier and simpler to
write and the streams API is just one
example of it I think what you're going
to see is a lot of Java API source Tarko
going to start adopting lambdas features
and then newer versions of API you'll
get significant benefits for example
there's great cases of like object
relational mapping or other cases of
tools you use in existing Java EE
applications where if you used a
functional style of programming that
lambdas encourages you can get
significant kind of syntactic benefits
Oh
and the default implementation I'm a
default IP interface if I am correct
actually I have just seen it last week
is this something that that will support
kind of multi inheritance okay so it
itself it is kind of a forum yes the
question was about default you
essentially the new extension extension
methods you could add implementations to
interfaces and the question was whether
it would support multiple inheritance in
the future right so it's it's kind of a
form of multiple inheritance because you
can have multiple implementations but I
believe right now it's fail-fast on
compilation if you have multiple
multiple implementations defined for
different interfaces you implement then
it'll be an error so you have to
unimplemented those interfaces for it to
actually work but I think part of the
reason for the design was they wanted to
try to avoid the common pitfalls with
like the diamond operator scenario for
multiple inheritance because it can get
fairly complicated in general multiple
inheritance scenarios for resolution of
of which method gets called but that
would be a great question for Brian gets
who was walking around the conference
today future future Java language
questions like that usually Brian gets
in mark Reinholds or the people I asked
to find out what their plans are
so actually speaking of Brian gets we
have some things to raffle off at the
end of you can enter that talk so
actually we have a book signed by Brian
who said he's gonna be working on Java
10 features next which is that's four
years from now so if there aren't any
other questions also we have some
t-shirts or raffle off too so I don't
want to carry the box back home so
t-shirt so let me turn everything over
to to Steve and Nicolas cool thanks
Frank
so this will be a fairly interactive
kind of informal session we both have
lots of hardware and cool stuff to show
you would you mind standing there's a
model behind my laptop so I can focus
the camera Nicholas and you guys are
free to ask us questions as we go along
so don't be shy yeah that's perfect
good enough and I have lots of cool
stuff to show you so let me give you a a
preview of some of the some of the fun
toys which we get to play around with
today
okay so that's me I'm work for Oracle as
a Java technology ambassador and some of
the cool stuff we're gonna get to play
around with today includes the Lego
Mindstorms so all of these different
devices you may or may not know that
actually run Java SE embedded which is
what I'll be showing you guys today let
me take that off no go there PowerPoint
is not like me okay
aha maybe alright so Lego Mindstorms
runs Java SE embedded this is the latest
version the ev3 the Raspberry Pi I'm
going to show you some examples on which
is a really great starting development
platform the duke pad is a homebrew
tablet which I'll show you guys we built
this using a Raspberry Pi and the entire
case is laser-cut from plastic acrylic
and also show you Java running on some
devices you may have on your person
including iOS and Android so we have
lots of fun stuff and I want to do an
overlay overlay hold on just a sec while
I um modify my shot
wonderful
all right now you can see me ends the
slide side-by-side this is what you get
for being your own AV tech and demo
person and present her all in one all
right so the first one I want to show
you guys or the first thing I want to
talk about is a little about the
Internet of Things in general so I'll
refer to this a few times in the
presentation but really what the
Internet of Things is about is working
with different Internet connected
devices and this is some data from Cisco
on the number of devices per person on
average so we're already outnumbered by
our own devices I'm sure most of you
have at least a cell phone on you
possibly a laptop and you know a few
other random devices anyone have like a
where they call it fitbit's or fuel
bands or step monitors oh okay few folks
so you the number of devices for
healthcare for home automation for
different consumer scenarios is
increasing and there's also a bunch of
industrial applications for this you
know in planes entertainment systems and
planes and cars in manufacturing plants
to do more automation so there's a whole
bunch of different areas where this is
taking place and really what we're
seeing is a change from devices talking
directly to the Internet to webs of
devices where you have different devices
interconnected and talking to each other
so for example like if you guys have you
know some sort of step monitor fuel band
that probably hooks up either to your
laptop or to a mobile device rather than
going directly to the Internet and with
low power networking options like
Bluetooth le and protocols like MQTT
we're seeing more sensor networks and
meshes of devices talking to each other
and Java is a really great platform for
running on small devices like this I'll
be talking a little bit about Java ME
and Java SE Java ME runs on the
Centurion EHS 5 this is a really really
tiny chip and it basically is about the
size of your finger but includes a ARM
processor that can run Java ME as well
as a 3G antenna or rather 3G processing
and you can hook up an antenna via the
pin outs on the back you can also hook
up a battery and different sensors and
then put together an entire development
scenario like this so this is one of the
use cases that use the Centurion chips
in was to track rainforest deforestation
so they would plant the chips plus a
battery and then some sensors like an
accelerometer and a 3G antenna so they'd
know when somebody knocked over the
trees based upon the motion and then
they could track the location that the
trees are being taken away to to prevent
the illegal deforestation of the trees
and you could think of plenty of other
scenarios we're having 3G embedded in
devices like kiosks or vending machines
would allow you to do things where you
normally don't have connectivity using
Java and a small solution like that so
that's a Java ME scenario and I think
it's important to distinguish between
Java ME and Java SE in general I'll be
talking about Java embedded during the
presentation but historically there's
been a pretty big divide between Java ME
and Java SE Java ME is targeted at
really small form factors and devices
and the language level which it was
which is supported in Java 7 and prior
was only Java 1/3 or java 1/4 and the
api's were fairly different there were a
whole bunch of jsr s for mobile devices
which weren't supported on desktop and
likewise a whole bunch of desktop api's
which are not supported in Java ME with
the Java 8 release we've increased the
amount of api's available to the eme
profile and likewise pushed some of the
device specific things back into Java SE
and same thing for the language level
the language level for Java ME 8 is
includes a much larger subset of Java 8
not lambdas yet but
we're working on improving it to the
point where the languages will be almost
the same for developing Java and me and
Java SE and there should be almost full
overlap between the api's running on
mobile Ben's desktop except for the
profile you're using so Java 8 also
introduced a bunch of compact profiles
where you can take the whole JDK and
then trim it down to a bunch of
different sizes based upon which api's
you need for example on a small embedded
platform you probably don't need CORBA
I'm not sure anybody but if you think
about over the years how much kind of
api's and things have grown into the
language this is extremely important to
keep the footprint especially on mobile
and embedded platforms down and it's
also being utilized in Java EE there's a
new web profile as well which lets you
trim down the Java deployment if you're
using cloud-based services and you
haven't how if you're trying to keep
your footprint low on the Java EE side
so you mind repeating the question for
the mic is Java ME used in cell phones
okay so that's an excellent question so
Java ME actually the origin was with
feature phones so I think it originally
stood for Mobile Edition Java Mobile it
micro Edition okay but given the new
focus so Java ME was never really widely
adopted on smartphones and given the new
focus on embedded platforms which is a
really good use case for Java ME which
works well on small devices this is the
new focus for all the Java ME
developments and that's why there's a
big push to increase the language level
in the features which it supports so if
you've done any Java ME development
historically this would be a good time
to take a second look at it
and if you've done these see developer
there NEC hecklers in the audience
embedded see hackers okay so you've done
a little bit of packing on different
devices historically there are a lot
more hurdles to overcome to do see
developments on embedded platforms and a
lot of things which Java developers take
for granted like having garbage
collection having easy portability
between different chips and
architectures having a you know a big
community and user groups like this one
the C development community especially
the embedded C development really hasn't
had so running Java on small devices is
another way for C developers to increase
their efficiency and their ability to to
crank out new libraries and applications
quickly ok so more information in
general about IOT go to the iot
community site can you pass the
microphone back Mary there's a question
question is embedded you have been used
similarly to mobile so when I see
embedded does that include I can run on
mobile or is it embedded ok so I think
the best way of thinking about it I'll
talk a little bit about running Java on
smartphones at the end of this section
but all the stuff I'm talking about
embedded it's specifically for writing
applications on like arm or MIPS based
processors for embedding it inside of
other devices or using other scenarios I
think I would treat mobile computing
smartphones and tablets as kind of a
different area it's it's related in
terms of they're both used arm-based
processors but it's different in terms
of the the use cases and how you deploy
applications and work with technologies
but that's a good question and another
one on your right I just wanted to ask
this great because I just used to see it
a lot but
not recently what happened to real-time
Java I mean it seems to be gone from the
website come again that's that's an
excellent question which no no it's it's
a really good question
which I don't have the answer to so if
you're really curious shoot me an email
and I'll I'll ask one of the product
managers what what the story with
real-time Java is yeah I just wanted to
quickly come to the defense of embedded
see you were you mentioned that embedded
C is missing some things that are in
Java like garbage collection and that's
true but you don't need it in embedded C
and embedded see you typically running
on a much cheaper slower smaller
processor like a pic as opposed to an
arm so it's kind of it has a different
place than Java does job yeah no no I
think I think that's an excellent point
so if you I think if you look
historically at embedded development
really the devices you were targeting
we're very very low-power very little
memory and you had to kind of
micromanage resources at a very
fine-grained level most of the the chips
now you know they have common
architectures and a reasonable amount of
memory and they're increasingly they've
done great great things with the the
power levels and that you can get at a
given performance level so you can start
having larger processors and more memory
without impacting your power levels for
small chips and I think that's probably
been the biggest driver in terms of
taking higher-level languages and
applying them to embedded development
but that's a it's a very good
perspective Thanks so the first device
I'm going to talk about oh yeah zero
it's there a processor limit for
embedded Java there is for java SE which
is what i'm going to be talking about
really the smallest processor we support
is the arm 11 which is the processor in
the Raspberry Pi this is actually an arm
9 so I guess we support slightly smaller
and you need to have a reasonable amount
of memory on chip Java ME supports much
smaller configurations and if you're if
you're curious about like the exact
thresholds again I'll defer to the
product manager either J or one of the
guys who's in the weeds on this and they
they have exact numbers for like Java ME
requires this minimum amount of memory
and processor etc Java SE requires this
minimum and typically there's not a lot
of overlap between the two the Raspberry
Pi is the one platform which it happens
to be the reference platform for both
Java ME and Java se but you wouldn't
typically run Java ME on it it's much
too large and Java SC it's kind of close
to the minimum you can actually get good
performance from alright good question
yeah
hold on hold on for our excellent are
excellent microphone your your I think
you've earned a few stickers of your own
berry I don't know about GPU running
Java and GPU so is that embedded is that
considered a embedded - okay it's a Java
on GPU you're probably referring to
maybe project Sumatra okay so that
typically that's designed so you can run
Java applications using like OpenCL to
get very high performance it's I say
it's distinct from the embedded use case
so on embedded platforms you have GPUs
in a lot of cases like the Raspberry Pi
has a very good GPU and sometimes you
can get benefits from utilizing the GPU
but most the stuff I'm going to show you
the GPU is being utilized for graphics
not for normal processing most of the
cases where people are looking at like
high performance computing using the GPU
it's more on the server side for Java in
particular if you're doing like cloud
based computing or large-scale
processing and servers you can get huge
benefits from utilizing GPUs because
it's typically lower power
and better performance than the
equivalent CPU operations if you can
optimize it so in the future with the
simulators and emulators on PCs and Macs
be able to run with one single Java the
war would I still have to have multiple
Java SDKs on my PC or Mac okay so I'm
not sure hold on to the mic because I
want to make sure I understand the
question so you're comparing pcs PC and
Mac computers and you're wondering why
they're different versions of Java for
them right for for let's say if I wanted
to run a simulator or an emulator for
something I'm developing for a embedded
device okay would I would I continue to
use a single JDK or would there be
separate instances I would have to run
for emulating or simulating the
particular application emulating an
application okay now if I can for cost
me give me it give me a specific for
some device but I wanted to test it out
on you know whatever we see I have how
would I do it in the future when you
know both Java 8 okay are you talking
about embedded development or desktop
development embedded developments and
you're trying to emulate device a device
okay all right so I guess that's the
first part is the emulation part I know
that they have emulators of sorts for
mobile platforms but typically for
embedded platforms the easier route is
actually to test it on device rather
than emulate it as far as I know there's
there's not a lot of emulators available
for ARM processors in general and
there's a whole bunch of different
development boards and configurations so
trying to test those on desktop or
lively would probably be challenging one
of the guys on the team who I'm actually
going to show him in one of the later
slides his name's Gary Collins and he
does all of the device testing at Oracle
so his he is the coolest office in her
pillow thing he basically has like a
wall of different devices and
forms running arm and MIPS and all sorts
of different processors and he almost
treats it like a lab like people can SSH
into them and test different stuff on
them to test Java software running on a
variety of different embedded platforms
but to get them working he has to do all
sorts of quirky stuff with getting the
right system images and building custom
kernels and cereal tipping in to fix
stuff probably you're probably familiar
with this if you've done in bed
development it's quite working with a
variety different platforms is extremely
challenging at times okay but good
question yes
so demos if we've been talking for a
while I think we need to actually show
some to us all right so the first demo
we're gonna show is what's this guy's
name
Duke all right very good and this is not
any Duke this is Lego Duke he's running
Lego Mindstorms the ev3 version so this
is the first version of Lego Mindstorms
which is actually powerful enough to run
a full JVM on it I'm using lejos which
is it's been around for a while but this
version of let house actually rather
than cross compiling it just runs
directly off jar piles you can compile
on desktop so since this is a full JVM
you can actually test and compile
everything on desktop before moving it
over and just copy your Java file over
and I'm using the Eve III hardware so it
has large motors for the wheels and
small motors to move the arms a
gyroscope for controlling the balance so
this is a Segway in in essence so he's
going to balance on two wheels for us
there's a push button to get him started
color and light sensors ultrasonic
sensor as well and an infrared sensor
the ultrasonic sensor comes with the
education kit the infrared sensor comes
with a retail kit
we're gonna use the infrared sensor plus
a remote control to control this guy and
then you know that's the remote control
and a little bit information about how
it gets started with less with la house
the way it works is you load on an SD
card so you don't even need to flash or
replace the existing the form or on the
device and it runs inside of a Linux
distribution and you can basically code
in any ID you want unless you actually
want to build the let house sources from
scratch in which case the the team seems
to use Eclipse so that's the easiest one
to get started with but they have full
distributions and system images and
basically all you end up doing is you
create a application which depends on
the ev3 classes jar file which adds in
some additional API so you can do stuff
like this so this is hello world for let
house running on Lego Mindstorms it'll
prints you know first ev3 program on the
LCD screen
yeah where's the hold on that value is
house optimally seated to get to what is
the relation between lejos and java so
it's an open source project let house is
an open source project I believe it's
it's run by some folks from the
University I should know all their names
now it's just an API it's just libraries
which you can use and basically that
what let house gives you is it gives you
a simple API for accessing the motors
and the sensors and all those devices
from Java so they take care of all that
part and then we have a special Java SE
embedded build for the Lego Mindstorms
so for the demo I need a volunteer who
is a parent who's a parent in the
audience okay so blue shirt yeah come on
up you're probably wondering why I care
that he's a dad
but okay see this this is a dad hold two
hands baby holds good job
we had a little accident when I was in
Switzerland with somebody one handing do
so I learned my lesson from that and
anybody done like remote-control cars or
planes anyone feel confident enough to
use our controller yeah okay come on up
blue shirt two blue shirts all right so
I'm going to kick this off and then I'll
I'll switch the monitor so the big
screens showing Duke so you guys don't
have to all get up and crawl up to the
front of the room what's the IP address
on our buddy Duke it's the second one
should be 1001 something wait a sec okay
actually we're not going to do this
because this will kill my streaming
connection if I hook up to a second
network so hold on just a sec this is
why we always carry two laptops remember
I was talking about number of devices
per person I think I think I'm pushing
the limit
all right all right so what's the IP
address on that guy on the back of on
the back of this guy a 1001 for okay I
want the second one yep for is the magic
one okay so I already copied over the
the Java file from my desktop which it's
just a simple java application which
does the segway algorithm so he should
be booted up and running now let me futz
with the camera yeah yeah hopefully not
and anyone experienced using a DSLR
camera anyone have like a Nikon or Canon
DSLR okay so anyone else okay would you
mind helping me for a sec here so the
video camera here it's just a Nikon DSLR
this is the zoom ring focus ring and see
if you can get some shots of the Theroux
but as I explained it to these guys all
right so you're gonna be the balancer so
you want to lie him on his back on top
of the backpack on the ground so just
put him down
well his other back now
when you press the button his right hand
don't do it yet but when you press that
then he's gonna start beeping and you
want to lift him up and balance him on
his wheels at his center of gravity so
see if you can get him to stand upright
wait wait wait first lay him down press
the button and wait till he starts
beeping and now stand him up yeah and
hold onto him for a sec let go okay good
next
you don't need to take pictures because
it's it's constantly on ya
yeah but I got help from one of the guys
on the PI on the lighthouse project so
your job is to remote control the robot
so on the joystick did I give you I
didn't give it to you okay
here's your remote so other way the
sensor is in his kind of his buttock
area and when you press the buttons each
time it increments a counter so don't
hold them and just click it a few times
that one that's left yeah okay so now I
should be turning this one's right if
you want to stop him from turning just
press the center button and that cancels
his action Kia sometimes you have to get
pointed his back or it won't work or get
closer and that's forward the blue
bottom one is forward the red bottom one
is backwards yeah so just hop behind him
find a good a good spot to aim oh there
it goes nice go no faster he our little
Lego Duke actually prefers hardwood
floors or solid surfaces but he does
okay on carpets it's it's kind of a
balancing game of the algorithm you have
to use a few parameters you can pass
into the segue algorithm for like the
wheel size and how sensitive he is
yeah there's a gyroscope inside of him
and then whenever he sees that he's
leaning over he'll speed up the motors
or slow down the motors too to try to
keep his balance you might be able to
hook up like a tariff transmitter to one
of the sensor ports they sell some
third-party sensors that are not made by
Lego but made by third
companies I don't know if there's any RF
sensors though I mean really if you want
to do a lot of hardware hacking I'd
recommend the Raspberry Pi there's a
much better platform yeah yeah exactly
okay so give these guys a round of
applause they did an excellent job I
have a question yep why did you need the
IP address what was the what was the
laptop doing so all I did is I just
booted up the program I could set it to
automatically run when he starts up but
then you guys would never actually
believe that I coded anything and once
he's running it's autonomous so you
don't actually need to be hooked up to
him once the Java programs executed and
you could add it as a start up action
the INA T file if you wanted to UM you
know have them do it right from the
start yeah it is
I believe that June was is the code for
this available yeah so the answer the
answer is yes but the answer as to where
you would get it I'm trying to remember
as I rewire my second demo which has
some disconnected wires for some reason
well this program in other words you you
as long as you have an IP address that
sort of implies you can use the HTTP
with the unit is that true so you could
control it through a web page yes yes
you okay so I guess I'm not sure how
easy it would be to run a full web
server on the PI on the Lego Mindstorms
because it's not that powerful nice but
you can definitely do like HTTP requests
from the Lego Mindstorms if you wanted
to like hit a page and pull down data
get data from a rest service or
something like that that would be
entirely doable but yeah that's a good
question was the remote control
controlled by bluetooth LE the remote
control is just using infrared over it
oh yeah that's exactly what
line-of-sight only and it depends on the
lighting in the room yeah so I think the
this guy actually has full bluetooth
support so you could hook up feel
Bluetooth and do it directly via
bluetooth if you wanted to and the other
connectivity is you can use usb and also
I have a Wi-Fi dongle hook up so we
could also use Wi-Fi to control him so
yeah those are other options as well was
there another question I heard somebody
yeah so I think if you're doing is does
if you're supported out of the box yeah
so I'm pretty sure if you're using like
Wi-Fi that would be super easy because
it would just look like network
configuration for it doing stuff I even
try to do any stuff with lettuce over
Bluetooth oh yeah I've used bluetooth on
the middle version the not this third
number two
I don't remember if it was easy or hard
but it certainly worked if it works okay
that's the right answer we like stuff
which works okay so next demo I'm gonna
show is the Raspberry Pi I have a little
embedded board here it has the the
Raspberry Pi is actually the green board
on this setup I'm powering it from a
normal cell phone charger so it needs
about an amp of power over microUSB and
you can hook a full display up to this
like a computer so it has USB ports you
could hook a mouse and keyboard up to an
HDMI which you could display up to you
but in this case rather than doing that
I'm hooking up the breadboard to the
GPIO pins the general purpose i/o pins
and I have a few sensors hooked up when
it's a pressure sensor and the other is
a touch sensor so I think this is kind
of you know if you're gonna bother doing
embedded hardware you actually better to
use it for what it's good for like
sensors in physical interaction rather
than just using it as a computer because
it it's a pretty sucky computer think
about it like processing power wise it's
kind of like a Pentium Pentium 4 from
years ago with a modern GPU so what I
have hooked up here is both a pressure
sensor and a light sensor and I have a
small application which we're going to
use as a sample to show this working let
me see if he's actually hooked up to the
network or not yet
oh okay looks like he just hooked up and
you know same trick I'm going to SSH
into the board and then run some stuff
on it directly
and I need a few volunteers to help me
out
so who's the who's the strongest member
of the New York Java seg well we'll make
it up after we see how they do
anyone want to be a volunteer okay come
on up okay and did i hook it up okay
somehow I wired this correctly amazingly
okay and um would you mind helping us
out with the camera again just I mean do
the best you can to get a shot of of
what I'm holding in InFocus you know
okay so basically on the board here you
can see we have a force reading and a
photo reading yeah right now you can
kind of see it and here there's a force
sensor and there's a photocell sensor
here so for the force sensor just grab
it with your two fingers and squeeze it
and see how high you can get the number
to go up okay so really really strong
that that is amazing strength and it's
working again so you can go to second
try if you want all right and I see 1550
15 okay pretty good and then see if you
can cover the light sensor a little bit
okay so it's it's
well get a little bit lower you can
touch it yeah
700 800 600 okay so basically the way
this demo works is the pressure sensor
picks up how much pressure you're
putting on it it's not like a scale it's
not absolute weight measurement but it
gives you a relative scale and the light
sensor here is pick it's a photocell
sensor so it's picking up light from the
room so if you cover this you can get
the value fairly low and this is all
being read by the analog-to-digital chip
here which is hooked up to the Raspberry
Pi VI squared C and then it displays on
this little LCD board this well it's
probably not because you need to put
apply a fair amount of pressure to get a
reading but I do know that they have
pulse oximeters and there's some we've
been flying around that work over
bluetooth for embedded scenarios and you
can hook those up via bluetooth dongle
to Raspberry Pi Bret bluetooth to the
pulse ox and then get pulse oximeter
readings if you want to do healthcare
scenarios alright so thanks very much
give them round of applause so that's a
quick example of what you can do with
the Raspberry Pi
now the Raspberry Pi besides being used
for embedded scenarios also has a pretty
nice video card graphics card as I
mentioned and as a result you can run
full tablet user interfaces on it such
as JavaFX so how many folks here try
Java effects on desktop ok a few folks
so if you've never played with Java
effects before it's the basically the
successor to swing and AWT it's a full
desktop graphics toolkit and probably
one of the best cross-platform toolkits
available right now so if you're
building desktop applications it's a
really good choice unfortunately huh not
a lot of us are getting paid to build
desktop applications right now but it's
really good for embedded scenarios as
well so this is what we call the the
Duke pad on the back you can see inside
of it so it has a Raspberry Pi USB hub
normally there's a battery here I've
replaced that with a HDMI splitter it
has the PI camera which you can use to
take photos or video and an LCD screen
so it's using the chalkboard electronics
LCD screen so basically all the
components are things you can buy
off-the-shelf relatively inexpensively
and the case itself is just laser-cut so
we went to the local san san jose tech
shop and then laser-cut the case would
you mind helping me out with the camera
and see the best of you you can get of
this and I'll try not to move too much
okay perfect so that's the user
interface the entire user interface is
written in Java effects and it's been
open sourced one of the new features in
Java FX 8 is 3d alright so there's a
really good 3d support you can import
full models from programs like Maya use
proper 3d primitives it also gets fairly
good performance if you optimize your
application so this is a little game
that's entirely written in Java effects
and all these applications are
distributed as OSGi bundles on the
Raspberry Pi so you can add your own
applications and games really easily ok
so there I beat the first level and
here's an example of video what do you
guys prefer Java 1 trailer or Ironman
video Java 1 ok
those are hard core Java guys yeah so I
mean some people really like the job the
Java videos but um not not everyone ok
this is this is um you know full 720p
video running on the the Raspberry Pi ok
and wow that is funky and choppy ok my
Raspberry Pi is not very happy right now
for some reason but normally if this
works really well for doing full quality
video one of the common use cases for
Raspberry Pi actually what I hear people
most often doing about it when I ask
them what to do with their PI's is they
install XBMC and they use it as a home
media center for playing video let's try
Iron Man see if he's happier or it might
just it might just be my my Raspberry Pi
is unhappy and needs to be reset ok
yeah so for some reason that video is
not playing properly but iron man's
working great okay so you can see the
video in the backgrounds and then you
get there's an overlay of JavaFX
controls on top so you could use this
for like menus or doing a Home Media
Player setup and the Raspberry Pi has a
really good cheap view for decoding
video like this even though the
processor is weak as I mentioned earlier
the GPU is quite capable okay so that's
a little bit about the duke pad let me
show you some more details about that
okay so this is some pictures of the
construction of the duke pad so it's as
I mentioned cut out of laser-cut acrylic
with all the components inside of it
this is the actual laser cutter that we
were using so it has a sheet of paper
backing it so it doesn't burn the
plastic and then you just peel that off
and then pop out the different
components after it's cut here's some of
the internal components and the layer
cake of acrylic being built up with the
components being added and here's my
buddy Gary Collins I mentioned good guy
to know if you want to visit his office
and check out all his hardware and he
also helped me a lot of demos which I'm
showing and if you want to get more
information about the Duke pad you can
go to what's cut off there is JMP slash
duke pad and it has the schematics the
hardware you need to buy if you wanted
to build one as well as all the open
source software so all of the
applications I showed you and the actual
kind of operating system is all fully
open sourced if you want to try this out
okay and the last thing I want to
mention before we start playing with
robots is some examples of using Java on
iPhones ends
let me give you a hint this is the asou
strands former front so it's an Android
tablet Android tablet and oh here we go
SmartWatch yeah this is the very finest
China knockoff SmartWatch the zg packs
but it's it's Android compatible
SmartWatch you could also use the was
it's a gear Samsung gear yeah that works
that works as well yeah this one
actually has a slightly faster processor
and much worse battery life than the
steps thanked here but you get you get
what you pay for
okay so I'm gonna attempt do to do to do
to show you this on the camera okay so
first what I'm going to show you is no
no don't do that
running Robo VM okay Wow all right kind
of see that so this is a little
application that's built using Robo VM
it took all of like half an hour to get
it up and running as a little fishie
that follows your mouse as it goes
around and like half a day to deal with
stupid ice door phone provisioning and
security credentials and all that stuff
and that's from somebody who's done
quite a lot of I us hacking in the past
every time I touch it my credentials are
outdated and I need to refresh them and
all this funk okay so that's running on
iOS and then come on wake up dude okay
so if I can point it the right way we
won't get too much light on the screen
so anyone here last year for my lambdas
talk at the jug okay
Frank was here so if you were here last
year you should recognize this game Mary
huddle Oh lambda ends it works really
well on Android so we've colored oh
sheep and then we'll you know feed them
get some eggs get some chickens and
finally okay fed the Fox
alright so pass this around Frank and
the last one
try not to exit out of the application
by clicking the Return button because
you won't find it again easily uh-huh
so it looks like a clock it's actually
an Android phone and I've installed a
Java FX application called clock to
develop my Garrett Grunwald and
basically displays the time as words so
ten past three that's not the right time
so you can change the color by swiping
you can double tap it to go from words
to visual but it's a really cool
application and so you notice that the
ear passes around the devices I'm
showing the you eyes are tailored for
specific form factors so I think one of
the things to keep in mind when you're
developing four different form factors
and devices is the type of user
interface you devant design for
different applications really varies
quite a bit okay so the obvious question
is well how can I develop for these
different platforms where can I get Robo
VM all that good stuff oh come on let me
switch presentations PowerPoint okay
there we go so the iOS application is
developed using
Robo VM this is a cross compiler which
cross compiles Java code into native
code for running on is platform it's
using the open jfx libraries for the
user interface so that's the open source
version of Java FX and there's already a
bunch of applications deployed to the
App Store using this technology
so you can use this for development
purposes you don't have to jailbreak
your phone because it just looks like a
normal Java or normal iOS application
and from apples purposes as well there's
plenty of precedents for using
third-party frameworks as well as cross
compilers to develop for applications
the only thing they supposedly disallow
is dynamic recompilation of code so this
why for example you can't run a
just-in-time compiler on iOS and then
for the Android code what I'm using is
Java FX ports again this is based upon
the open GFX project for the user
interface so exactly the same code runs
on Android and iOS the difference here
is that rather than cross compiling this
runs on top of the dalvik code running
directly on the Android device so your
first question should be well if you're
using dalvik to run your application how
are you showing a Java aid application
running on the tablet and I'm using
retro lambdas for that which is a way of
back porting lambdas to Java 7 and prior
so and I this project the Java FX
reports project is run by johan boss so
he's one of the devops program committee
guys very active in the community and
very interested in seeing folks adopt
Java FX in Java in general on Android
devices so this gives you a nice
solution for developing on desktop
embedded platforms as well as mobile
platforms all using similar application
bases okay so question was thanks Mary
is this with the blessing of Oracle so
we don't have official support for any
mobile platform so you can't buy like an
Oracle support contract Oracle licensing
for this stuff both of these examples I
showed you for Android and iOS are based
upon the open GFX project which has code
that was originally developed by Oracle
engineers but is not something that we
formally support via our normal support
channels if we do provide embedded board
support for ARM processors raspberry pi
and soon mips processors we also provide
you know some enterprise support for
desktop but not directly for mobile
although you can get support from robo
vm and other companies which are doing
this
well art it work with art as well as
dalvik I guess was the question again
with their new system art yeah it works
with the new newer JVM as well yeah I
think what's the name of the older JVM
it's not dalvik but there was an
official name for the dalvik the
cross-compiler but anyway if the new
Android JVM works as well I have my
sixth version of the same question that
I asked earlier today so let's say I
write a swing app and I just dispose of
the main method and embedded inside the
oncreate method and on Android activity
will that work I have to die I realized
once I got a dot class file I have to
make it into an apk file with dalvik but
is that the kind of thing that would
work okay so what do you want to do you
want to so I want to write a standard
Java app okay and just leave off the
main because dalvik doesn't want that go
and put it inside an activity because
dalvik wants that and then turn it into
a class file well I guess a first for no
yeah will you compile it it to class
files and then use the dalvik cross
compiler and compile it to the about it
though it to compile into a class file
oh heck I'll try it on my own yeah so if
if you guys are interested to give the
Android support a try there's there's
some good guides by Johann and other
folks in the community who have been
doing this and they also have a bunch of
build scripts which automate most of the
part from getting to your java codes
into an APK file you just have to have
the Android SDK installed because it
uses obviously the dalvik cross compiler
and then a modern version of Java Java 6
or Java 7 but give it
and if you run into any trouble I'll be
happy to introduce you to Johann who can
help so the question I have is how how
serious is all about this is it going to
its use case will say you know Java or
should I develop in FX is there going to
be push to make this an alternative or
is it just a toy okay so I think it's a
fair question now from the official
Oracle standpoint we have no plans to
support this either now or in the future
personally you know I'm JavaFX book
author and Java FX community member and
I run a actually run a Java user group
the Silicon Valley Java FX user group so
this this is exciting to me but I'm not
going to tell you especially not as an
Oracle employee I'm not going to tell
you to Bank your business on emerging
technologies like this this is something
which I think works really well and it's
good for hobby projects but I wouldn't
necessarily recommend that you go and
tell your boss that you're going to
rewrite your existing Android iOS
applications yeah yeah I think this
there's lots of profetas precedents for
cross compilation across development
frameworks like this and you know this
is this is really a good option for Java
developers you don't need to switch
languages or platforms you get a lot
more capabilities than you do by just
writing JavaScript based applications so
it's it gives you a lot more power but
at the same time I mean part probably
the biggest issue with using the Android
iOS support is for phone specific
features we actually we talked about
this earlier in the session I got a
question about you know what does it
support doing calls does it support
different specifics for the phones and
but the Roma VM and the job F exports
guys are adding in support for phone
specific features but they're creating
their own api's on top of the open jfx
api's they're not all supported equally
across the platforms and
Yohann is trying to do this but they
want to converge on a common platform so
you don't have to write different
variations of your code for different
cell phones so it's I would say this is
like emerging technology bleeding edge
stuff but I think it's cool okay
so let's take one more question and then
I think I should Nikolas and I should
take a chance to introduce our next part
of the presentation
are you recommending using Java FS FX
and Robo VM to develop application on
iOS or just stick with Objective C or
something else
okay repeat the question because I was
distracted sorry yes my question yes is
to develop application on iOS so you
recommended use Java FX into robot VM or
use object is something guys okay sorry
are you a Java developer yeah so I I
think it's an exciting option but you
know give it a try first don't don't
don't don't don't don't don't fight all
your iOS developers at your company yet
okay so what I'm going to do for this
stream is I'm going to cut the stream
and then rerecord so we get a separate
presentation for this and it'll also
give me a chance to UM I want to rewire
the network hub so that we can talk to
the now from the same computer we're
broadcasting so I don't do the same
double laptop issue so for folks who are
on the live stream we're going to kill
you and then we'll restart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
