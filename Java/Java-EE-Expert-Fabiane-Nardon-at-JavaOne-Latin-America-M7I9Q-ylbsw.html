technology Network we're here at javaone
brazil and the otn lounge and we're
talking to some java experts i got
fabiana and are done with me hi fabiani
hi how are you pretty good how's your
show been so far it has been good how is
presumably for you oh just wonderful i
just loved it so much and we did the
bike ride on sunday that's good that's
good yeah it's a lot of fun i put you
guys to exercise a little bit before the
show so fun yeah and it was very nice to
get a chance to meet people in kind of a
you know a casual space so i really
enjoyed it i'm looking forward to more
geek bike rides so i'm hoping people on
the community will do that Michu i want
to do one of these san francisco so you
have to have to do that ok I'll I'll
take the challenge you set the bar
pretty high but I'm willing to do it so
tell me a little bit you've been using
java ee for a while now so how long has
it been it has been seized ejb one dot
oh they hard hard times so it has been a
while all right so you had your pain and
suffering through those times so yes yes
I've been tried to collaborate and tell
the community watch is bad and what's
good so I can see the devolution and I
think it's a much better version also
it's it's getting better it's getting
better and in no small part to you
advocating to make it better right yes
excellent so you were telling me what a
project that you were just working on
what was that it was really interesting
we just me grated our entertainment
guide a very popular entertainment guide
in Brazil to Java it was originally a
very old door tonight application and
emigrated everything to Java EE and PHP
running on glassfish with no sequel
database so it has been great the
performance is amazing right now have
zero downtime so we are very happy and I
guess our users are very happy as well
excellent and I think that's your
presentation right how to how to put up
an appt with zero downtime correct yes
my present dish is not
related to this particular project but
how to achieve zero downtime with your
java ee application because most of the
developers think that when they finish
the project they are done they work the
hard part it's over but it's not
actually when you are in production and
if you're not a consultant that you feel
if the job it just gone away you have to
keep the production going having zero
downtime is not as easy as people think
so what I'm going to show is several
open source tools that you can use to
monitor your application to do
continuous deployment to debug
applications in production which have
very different game than doing when you
are developing someone I'm willing to
show everything that I learned in the
next few we were a few years and hope it
is going to be useful to someone oh nice
cool so tell me about the java community
in brazil it sounds like it's big and
very active it's a very active community
is actually a great community to be we
have lots of user groups we have
meetings we have publications so if you
are a young developer and you are trying
to choose what language to go on I think
Java is still did the first choice so
there are a lot of opportunities for
young developers yes the market is
booming there are lots of open positions
for java developers especially for good
job developers so if you are interested
but i think you can have a job for many
years if you are job developer in brazil
wow that sounds great so thank you very
much for taking time to talk to us and i
want you to have a great javaone thanks
a lot all right Thank You fabiani this
is Tori wheel with the Oracle technology
Network
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
