physical local job news groups around
welt so I'm a member we live in a member
of the London chug along a job sweetie
for many years now what I want to do one
of the problems I had it takes me a
while to get into London so to actually
be there at physical meet up on it has
massive values in networking and talking
to other people in the job community for
me it's a lot easier if we do it online
if we went virtually so i created the
virtual job is group for people just
like me or who don't live anywhere near
a jungle total or not near an active and
the idea is having an entirely online
jug will allow people to get to get
great content from great speakers all
around
from the copper their own living room
the cookie dough from the office from
where and still still have accessibility
to the speed disclose questions nap time
so we've only been around for about two
years so about two months just over two
months we already have coming up to 900
members so so yes it's been probably one
of the fastest-growing usually rustavi
user groups that exist know what I don't
want is I don't want the virtual job
user group to in any way displaced or be
anyway conflicting with existing job you
suppose so I'm gonna I want to learn how
not just
I should be running this to make the
best out the members that we have also
to have to compliment supplement
existing job user groups so for instance
if the long enjoyed music we're doing
something that they want to expand their
audience to perhaps we could use the
Virgin John music groups breath across
the world to say anyone he advertised
this to us get the look at you know
worldwide audience involved in that time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
