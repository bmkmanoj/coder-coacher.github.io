night hacking and i'm joined by antonio
gong coughs hello everybody who is a
huge figure in the paris / france java
community and probably throughout all of
Europe now on Java EE and the things
you're doing with that box France called
you putting so much pressure on me now
he also made a huge splash at the dev ox
keynote to this morning they had an
awesome video what happened at devoxx
France last year and announced the dates
for devoxx France upcoming i believe it
was March 27th 28th 29th March so if you
go to devoxx dot f are you can watch the
video we made a a 2 minutes video about
what happened last year and what's going
to happen next year so feel free to
check that out cool and just a let folks
know how to format for the share works
you can watch the videos at night
hacking com on there as a social stream
when you type into the social stream it
will show up on the computers you have
in front of us so we can interact with
folks who are online and will also be
broadcasting from some coding from
Antonio's desktop so we'll actually be
doing live hacking and coding it goes
straight from the dev ox conference this
actually so this isn't a prop this is
the motorcycle I've been you saw me in
Paris with this monster trying to park
it if it fails I will not be able to
take it back that's what Steven says
yeah pretty much this is anyone a little
bit on the heavy side although somehow
we managed to drag it into the venue and
we're actually physically at the DevOps
conferencia broadcasting from the
pavilion area which is pretty cool so
what would even up to these days in
Eternia what's your what's your favorite
things to well you know hang on talk
about and I i have this tikka here you
see I don't know if you can see though
oh yeah we can later yeah really really
feel like I'm a real hacker like you
know I studied with a Commodore 64 and I
was doing basic and then I switched to
you know assembly so I feel a little bit
like that because what I've been up to
lately it's jolly e7 and it really feels
like hacking because the spec will be
out by April so the implementations now
are really all in our file beta respects
you know we've all we had some early
drafts but they are not final not many
documentation yet because you know
everything is in early stage so I really
like that I could write it very good
book about it actually I'm doing that
that's exactly what I'm doing you know
in 2006 i wrote in java ee 5 book it's
in French those sorry for the amateur
I'm sure that I have good translations
it's other languages which are lesser
used but then you know in 2009 I was
part of the java ee 6 expert group plus
8gb 30 plus jpa too so I wrote the book
in English
with a press called Java EE 6 and a
press knocked on my door and say hey
we've seen that you're part of the e7
expert group and the ejb 3.2 expertly do
you want to write another book and I
said yes so that was the crazy idea even
sucked back in yeah you know that you
have to give up a bike at least you know
two or three years of your life that
takes off very bookie right well it's
two or three hours sleep it you know
every day and so it's tiring so writing
a book before specification is finished
and all that you know I'm saying a
specification but java ee 7 will be
roughly about 30 to 32 respects some
haven't changed at all some have change
and new ones are coming so writing a
book at the moment about all that is
it's really you know it also feels like
a uni when you have several paths and
you try to get the you know the
optimized ones so my life is paying the
happy path it's basically chasing
specifications chasing implementations
and starting my chapters you know with
the specs that are more or less settled
so I've started with respects that
haven't changed at all like soap you
know judge WS jsps and so on so you'll
still find that on my java ee 7 book and
now i'm starting to write my chapters
about things that have been updated
mostly JMS to point Oh Jack's arrest to
control and I'll finish by the new staff
or stripped it wasn't in my book like
CDI 1.1 so it's not only I remember from
my a press books they always wanted the
book publish at the same time the
software first they changed their policy
I'm not trying to make the change
yeah they want the book to go out with
with the specification which will be
April but I'm trying to tell them that
you know may mays a good month there's
good manual business owners i'm aiming
to finish writing the book by april and
then be published by maids I talked of
it so can we get a sneak peek of any
stuff you're working a look oh actually
what I can show you is you know because
I'm part of EE 7 as an individual I've
been working with EE for 12 14 years now
and thus there are some that piss me off
a little bit in EE and I try to you know
make them happen but it's really
difficult because you are backward
compatibility you up spec leads you have
companies behind you have roadmaps and
schedules so unfortunately we've wasted
on you know wasted a lot of time in ee
seven trying to add cloud features to EE
7 and that was a waste of time because
we had to take that back but in the
meantime we haven't had time to do a lot
of stuff in seven so ye seven will be
new stuff like Jay cash will have a
caching API but just on its own je cache
1.0 will not have time to you know
smoothly bundle like with jpa for
example you know in je cache could have
been the second level cache of jpa ed
island where they make a lot of service
yep that's what most people use caching
for an e yeah it might happen but not in
EE 7 batch will be another speck
new new one JS on piece o J's on proper
processing will happen in 10 so sounds
like parts of like foundational things
you need to really build good
applications are going to get out there
but it's not gonna stop until he ate
it's not all director bird yeah you see
will add a JSON p so Jason pro
processing but not a Jason B J's on
binding so what the moment if you use
glassfish of metro you have a beam you
can annotate it with XML well I can even
show you I can show you some code if you
want see here I have an a simple bin I
call it a credit card and it's annotated
with XML root element which is a jugs
being judge be stuff so this is a soap
web service and I pass it nexon L with
judge be i parse xml it marshals it to
credit card objects and on the way back
in turn marshals it to you know an xml
we want a diet with Jason in 87 it will
not be valuable yet but it's funny
because that will actually work you know
if I write a rest service and say give
you a credit card in XML it will give me
an XML and if I say oh by the way give
me in jism it will magically happen why
because metro uses you know extensions
one of them is moxie and Mexican give
you a representation of anything so
watchu aliyu at the moment I have an art
notation
called XML root element and you can give
me Jesus which is really weird professor
and Jason being will looks like it
create new limitations so with tomorrow
I want my credit card to be marshaled in
xml and Jesus I love tulle annotations
and if you have another format one of
those days we'll have another you know
when attention so that will stay like
that in EE seven it will not change
service thing things like that you know
whatever little things which you'd like
to see ya / yeah like here I have the
Google soap web service you're using
jax-ws and WS meter data is going to be
an e7 bean validation 1.1 will bring
methods level validation meaning i will
be able to do something like that
so in EE 7 i'm going to be able to do
you know not know you know if that was a
string you know I'm faking it here but I
could do something like that
lets you know if you know if that was a
string method level validation is in
being validation 1.1 the spec has an
early draft it's being integrated
moreless everywhere but not in judge WS
so you see what i'm doing here will be
valuable mostly everywhere in rest
services in ejbs Oscarsson manage
business you know as a whole but just WS
no it's not work so things like that
that are pretty annoying why because of
resources really we've lost track of the
speculative jax-ws no not really is
doing other stuff is working on I think
nothing's on they're really trying to do
is they knew you refinish the chapter
for that so they're present a said no we
can't we can hear that evolved
annotations to tactical us to rescue a
dog you so there's little things like
that like you know soap web service you
can Webster's
the context
oops wrong I can have a context C and
then I can use it i can go you know
context get principal or something like
that oops easier either you user enroll
or something like that and again i will
not be able to inject it and for those
of you who do
you know Jack's arrest stuff at the
moment what you do is that you inject
the URI info so you can do you know you
can do stuff so this is not possible in
e 7 and this is you know what we have at
the moment and of course what we would
like to do is that to have that in a 7
not possible so that's a bit annoying
why will it not be possible because I
think you know the implementation of
Jack's arrest you know the the culture
of Jersey it's quite small actually and
if we want to have at inject so if you
want to say jax-rs depends on CD I
actually you know well as much bigger
than jersey so it's like oh you know to
have CD I injure you know in Jersey I
have to triple the size of my war in the
middle of year so looks like in CDI 1.1
we will not have bootstrapping API for
java SE so if you read in blogs months
or years ago that that will happen in
CDI 11 and 87 it's actually not true i
discovered that early this week beat me
who is the speculative they confirm that
work there yeah 1.1 said no because he
will not have time because what the one
do for CDI 240 is yes actually have a
you know a bootstrapping API for CDI in
java SE but also to split it so if on
jax-rs you want to be able to do that
just in bed the CDI call instead of the
you know of the whole lot so these are
real things that will not work with e
seven which is a bit of shame otherwise
there's you know plenty of things that
will work with isa ok so you found a
bunch of things which we started with
things people won't like he's Stefan
sorry about that the defendant really
voguing e7 and linking you know my my
emails on the mailing list about renting
yeah so this is still it is your
opportunity to get some stuff off your
chest yeah you're not very good actor
hello you're better than burgers man
waiting he is awesome he helped me out
of them Jay Paul so we did a little skit
on stage where i went to Jay Paul kina
go down with my bike and I proceeded to
talk about how cool javaone was
that's not bad and so he was so he might
hurt but it's in Chinese go for sex yeah
I didn't know I didn't you know I
inserting negative edge a fall but I
just spent my keynote slot talking to
Java so Burt took me off he ejected me
off the stage twice I'll dejected you
yeah yeah so maybe maybe next time so
I'll get you to help me out with a with
a keynote parse I think you'd be a good
actor let's do that let's do that nobody
yeah it's true that I really feel like
we've wasted a lot of time on e seven
talking about you know cloud and decent
that and there's little things like that
for developers there but i'm gonna guess
some of that some of that will help out
with e eh yeah eh we were thinking about
you know having modules we were thinking
well I'm modularity will go into SCH
soul of modules in well depends on how
long it takes maybe maybe that time he
ate comes out you go actually that's you
know that's a good point that you were
raising I don't know why I don't know
why but we have to eat as to follow the
version of se so ye seven has to go out
with SSN you know we can't say oh let's
postpone e7 let's wait a few you know an
extra year it's fine and although people
been wearing for prayer
time for you yes em yeah yeah yeah but I
think it's a good point of like
synchronization of release like whenever
you say something has a number and it's
related to learn technology the question
is do you actually synchronize the
releases or do you just synchronize the
numbers or do you not bother but for
example javafx 3 is going out with Java
8 and therefore they're going straight
from to say they're just going to call
it javafx 80 okay okay and I think from
a developer's standpoint like if you're
using EE and FX and deci it's easier to
keep the number yeah I'm synced but
don't you know if he needs more time
then just skip to EE 9 ffion then we'll
cut my leg you you are too when standard
e7 is an umbrella well he's an umbrella
specification I should put the
disclaimer there that on the opinions
expressed on the show or our official
opinions of oracle corporation do you
have any vicious lies display at the
official slide evangelism is just is
just another farce we're all clowns no
but really EEE is an umbrella
specification so meaning for EE to go
out all the specifications have to be
ready so you know we already have a long
process or are you ready are you ready
are you ready what happened with EE 6 is
a CDI split between at inject NCI so we
had to wait six extra months and so on
and so forth so we already we
in a number less Peck you need to work
for everybody and plus we need to follow
the SE roadmap so it's it's a lot of
pressures and that's why I e7 will go
out in April no matter what happens it
could skip to main so speaking of ed 7
what's a little more upbeat what's
something cool the people will get to
use in e seven if I really look forward
to something makes their lives easier
Mickey applications simpler i'm going to
show you actually i was i actually took
him a project own up close i'm not a
netbeans user on I mean IntelliJ IDEA
use of it open recent project yep if I
weren't nice raising that things just
for my behalf here if ya era 10
wine shown your spirit nope showing
white showing the shy hold hold stuff
yet and showing your stuff that's not
good so you might have you might have
lost network
oh yes actually I did yeah no expensive
if you lost your network connection okay
well you know anyway and what's going to
make your life easier in 718 je JMS JMS
hasn't changed in 2001 was still in GMS
1.1 why well because it's you know it
works you know Jonas is a reliable AP
I've been using it for decade except
it's verbose you know you always need 10
10 lines of code to create our
connections send something to look you
close everything and so on and so forth
in JMS to you can still use the
connection the topics the cues and so on
but they have a brand new API called
Jeremy's context and JMS context that
you inject so you know you get a good
injected Jeremy's context and with a
single API that follows the Builder
pattern you can go over night pretty
much much simpler JMS actually program
to JMS like a normal programmer yeah a
shame i can't show you them the stuff
but it's to send in to receive and to
listen to a message it will be much much
easier so you go Jim JMS context and
yeah let me let me just see if I can get
your network out where's your network
preferences
yeah it's in friendship yeah I'm not
good at this French stuff is this the
system preferences yeah next week here
so so just the disclaimer for folks
online is um work we're at a conference
with people who walk in front of cameras
will their life if a tech conference
Wi-Fi which is flaky at times so bear
with us and stuff will go great now it's
a french keyboard so you're like I don't
know sure oh oh it's in the wrong spot a
and he looked backward cinch keyboards
are nightmare oh my god okay so if you
you know if I can show you soon yes yeah
we're here better if you see here I have
this new API called JMS context and I
create a producer and I send a message
to a cue that I've injected here and
that's it in here it's still not
completely settled so glassfish for
which is also in beta you know
everything is in beta doesn't support
java SE 7 auto plausible but that will
implement the interface auto closable so
you will not even have to call the
method clothes so you know that we'll
all just shrink down very simple a
single on again it what's going to
happen is we're going to make more
default default administered objects to
get injected so hopefully it's not
completely sure but you will
able to do that inject me the default
connection factory and actually last
week I was talking to Nigel the
speculate on JMS to what I would like to
do is also to say inject me default you
I don't you know why i'm testing i'm
developing you know i just want to make
things easier but something like that
will mean again the JMS relies on CD I
on CD I on java SE the CDI 11 will not
stand by baby into the dependency
injection in java SE i like i like the
head of the injection and FX actually
that's you know that's another topic
yeah that's not as i mean if you look at
all the AE api's there'd be so much
cleaner and nicer if you had proper
dependency injection as part of the
platform and having it be like another
jsr something interested in clued rather
than just yep part of the core makes it
that much harder for everyone to adopt
like they wouldn't it would be
bellyaching over llantas yep and if you
have that you know injects the gphone q
whatever it is you know and its server
CD iso then you can also have
alternatives you know in development I
want this queue and etc etc so for the
queue looks like it what happens but for
the factory it will and again you know
in 86 we introduced the data source
definition I don't know if you guys use
that but oh my data source of a
definition I might go back to intellij
idea because I
much more comfortable serving in six we
could say my daily source you know the
URL so all you know I can give the URL
of my data source etcetera etcetera that
means that when I deploy this class into
an e6 container it will automatically
create a data source for you so you
don't have to go to the admin console or
the key you know enter some code to just
create a data source that's going to
happen now in EE 7 these we're going to
have the same thing but for JMS we're
going to have JMS connection factory was
it called definition so we will be able
to do the same thing and I think I can't
remember the name now but we will also
have a JMS destination no not sure about
it anyway that's going to be things that
will get simpler and simpler so you'll
have in one being you define your data
source you define your jammies factory
you deploy that the container creates
whatever needs to create and you just
inject it and all work so that will make
life easier all right so I'm switching
topics a little bit yep so I'm big
announcement about DevOps France and
also they announced devoxx UK so what
are your thoughts about a little rivalry
going on between you and the English
that's the same guy cause you know zones
deluxe the ex UK is the first two days
of the week yep and then you guys get
the you know the final three days every
day are you gonna are you gonna join the
other guys in the UK for DevOps you can
we can't make partnership with the Brits
actually you know for those of you don't
know devix is a Belgian come with
conference that was created 11 years ago
by Stefan Johnson and last year that
part of the parish drug decided to other
French version so now devotes Franz
happened in 2012 and the second edition
will happen in 2013 as we serve 20 27 28
and 29 of March they're actually the the
English now we're going to have devoxx
UK on the twenty-fifth 06 in 26 March so
we will be in London monday and tuesday
and in paris wednesday thursday friday
the way we holder is to put resources in
common one of them that was the big
announcement this morning is Oracle
sponsorships so thank you Oracle Oracle
is sponsoring the three divorces belge
France and English so that's so for an
entire year Oracle will be a premium
responsive phone yeah I was very excited
when our guys took care of that in short
notice yeah and very happy that will be
sponsoring your conference again and UK
yeah that's that's awesome and also
speakers so with you on the other side
of the world and if you want to have a
little weak between London and Paris you
know two fantastic great cities a short
differently you know star from UK France
that was part of the plan was that you
could just go straight from the box UK
and then be a dev ox France the
following day in two and a half hours
you know is just just a train that
leaves the central London
arise in central Paris I got to I got to
ride on the euro for the Collier oh yeah
you must all but if they have a
different name for the eurotunnel you're
a tunnel but essentially I drove my
motorcycle right on a train and in
another half an hour I was in France
Thanks crazy you know that was awesome
it's magic so yeah that was a big
announcement so now you'll have three
divorces a year in Europe antwerp
belgium paris france london UK cool
alright well thanks a lot for being on
the night hacking stream well you know
we nearly did that in Paris last weekend
nothing my god that was crazy even the
ghost story guys were there behind the
camera here but they were dealing with
this is well that night and and the
network just we two failures we tried
your workplace and we tried the the
university ii c EST and everything went
wrong we well we got to the part where
we knew exactly what was wrong and we
couldn't fix it and we did some pretty
nasty hockey we wait some effort which
is about a game we are forms and
everything you know taking photos of
screens and that we couldn't make it so
you can't really talk too much about or
we might get prosecuted by the Leon
French they might have let you back in
the cut shaky alright well thank you
very much thank stephen and join us in a
little time is it 20 minutes okay join
us another half an hour dan allen will
be joining us to talk about some some
great jboss stuff which i'll i'll find
out about shortly
a nice bloke
