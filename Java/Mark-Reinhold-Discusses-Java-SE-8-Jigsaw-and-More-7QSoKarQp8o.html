technology Network we're here live at
devoxx talking to members of the java
community and i have the extreme honor
and pleasure to speak to mr. mark
Reinhold hey mark is the chief architect
for the Java platform group and you just
did the keynote this morning did the
keynote this morning another session
this afternoon great and how did that go
both both seemed to go pretty well all
right lots of good questions lots of
good feedback alright so you were
talking about java SE 8 yay asea is
almost in the candy okay I was getting
close to finished we're aiming to ship
in in March yeah and so far it's it's
looking pretty good good and tell me if
somebody wants to get a build right now
can I may wants to get a build right now
there's a we have a handy short URL yes
JDK 8 java.net okay fine the weekly
built there usually shows up on Fridays
some may be on Monday if there's a
problem you know what but it's me it's
pretty much like clockwork we you know
feedback from developers at this stage
or the releases is especially valuable
you know we you just never know what
kind of obscure bug is going to show up
right when you think you're close to
done right so you know the more testing
we can get the better no now is the time
to download late februari would not be
next okay okay Debbie area would be too
late we'll fix it in an update release
so you've been working real hard and
you've kind of been in a new position
for the past few years so tell me how's
how's life in chief architect land well
it's actually not it's it's not it
wasn't really a new position it was a
new title because has a different
different title traditions then son did
but I've been in this role really since
around I didn't know two thousand five
or six or so
you know it's just a more highfalutin
sounding title but you know or organic
it yeah or you know or or glass way more
VPS and son did who knows I you know
it's just but do you feel like you've
settled in and yeah it's um you know
people often ask you know oh well oh you
work for oracle and if i was a big evil
company and larry ellison is you know
jerky guy or whatever you know the
acquisition process that was painful you
know the first six eight months of
integrating into the rest of the company
you know that was painful there was a
lot of politics but then we settled in
we got we got java 7 out the door we've
almost got drop at eight out the door
you know it's understood it at very high
levels in the company what the priority
for java is and that is to keep it
thriving keeps the community going keep
the technology going it's because it's
critical to everything that oracle does
so you know we we have a reasonable
level of funding of course we always
wish we had more management situation is
is is really very good you know son yep
there there are times i miss son for
their times you miss son you know there
were things I loved about science and
Microsystems and there were things I
loved Oracle is a much better run
company than son ever was and i have to
say just from a personal perspective
it's nice to work for company that makes
money and knows how to make money and
isn't you know ashamed of making money
in places where it's appropriate alright
so I you know somewhat to my my own been
using amusement now and then I'm
actually very content working for oracle
and it's a good steward for java yes so
far I i think it's it's been quite good
you know certainly better than sun was
the last few years of Suns existence
because well now son had more important
things to do and right that's
understandable and you've got a good
cadence of java releases so I've got to
ask and I I feel bad because I feel like
it's a little like what what have you
done for me lately but tell me what's
coming up in a future release
what are the plans for nine right so
we're trying to hit a cadence of every
two years and you know more or less we
were we were on a reasonable track to
achieve that between seven and eight but
then we got distracted with all the all
the security issues I say distracted
well that's that's a poor word choice it
was way more important to take some time
to address all these security issues in
the proper way rather than you know just
ship eight on time for the sake of
shipping eight on time you know it was
it was painful to have to slip eight but
I I think it was the right choice and I
think you know most of the developer
community understood that it was the
right choice and why it was the right
choice so nine you know if things go
well we can get that out a couple years
after eight there are lots of things you
know we not just Oracle what we in the
community sense have you have in mind he
of stuff that that would be good to get
into nine I think that the main main one
that a lot of people are looking forward
to is the monetization effort and the
module system that was you know at one
point deep you know deep in the past and
an entire stock ticker symbol ago that
was slated for seven it got pushed out
of seven it got pushed out of eight it's
really important I think that we get
this done at nine there's there's tons
of interest in the developer community
for this there there's also you know a
ton of interest from inside you know the
company for this which helps justify at
all as well and i think it's it's just
time to do it the jigsaw projects where
we're doing all this prototyping and
investigation has actually been active i
don't know how many people know this
since 2008 I've been working on this you
know on and off since 2008 it was
originally an initiative at Sun its
requirements have have changed over the
years you know son had certain
requirements that were related to you
know Java on smartphones and such that
are really not relevant anymore and
we're working on a big simplification of
the original prototype 2 to a simpler
model that will be easier to understand
it won't be trying to solve as many
complex problems and we'll have frankly
a much better chance of being done in
the nine time frame but there's there's
a there's a lot of more work to do as I
said we did this initial prototype it's
kind of the all-singing all-dancing we
knew from the beginning it wouldn't be
the final solution we'd its purpose has
been to be exploratory it served that
purpose well but we're in a position now
where we're drawing lessons from that
and I'm trying to come up with with a
more focused design and the scheme will
also beaten you going to the JCB and
spitting up an expert group to to talk
through all this stuff because there's
such immense interest in it are you
looking for community input on jigsaw
right now I was looking for it in my
talk okay it just half an hour ago I I
got a fair amount it's it is a topic
that you know in it's something like
modularity is never as exciting as lamb
but write lambda lambda is just so sexy
it's unbelievable you know and you know
and Brian Nia deserves all the credit
he's getting for the for the great job
that he's done you know the hey I think
a much smaller fraction of the developer
community is kind of immediately
interested in modularity but I think in
the long run in most of the developer
community community will benefit from it
even if they never actually you know
build a module themselves just the fact
that you can have a modular platform and
deploy just the mantras that you need in
an embedded solution you know it relates
to the right not just to client
applications but to the whole Internet
of Things story and all of that a lot of
developers are interested in a
particular aspect of modularity which is
the ability to ship a software component
in a jar file unit whatever whatever
format and hide its internals right this
is a problem we have had in the JDK for
many years and that we have a bunch of
internal classes there in packages
called Sun dot something or you know jdk
dot internal dot something you know
they've all been documented from the
beginning as you don't use this we're
going to change it and as you know if
the history has been well people do use
it which is incredibly annoying and at
bandits journey it's been a maintenance
burden for those of us who work on the
jdk as i as i said in my talk I have no
sympathy at all for library writers who
go and use these api these internal
api's directly I mean yeah I'm sorry bad
mood you know but we've we've been
careful about evolving them because we
know there are lots of innocent
developers out there who just you know
get they go and download a useful
library from the maven central wherever
it happens to use one of these internal
api's they're completely ignorant of
that fact there's no particular reason
tatian down say for the bad behavior ya
know they just assume well here's a
library and it seems to work i'm going
to use it to sell my problem but as we
modular eyes the platform those internal
classes are going to be hidden partly to
improve security and partly to improve
maintainability because we're tired of
maintaining all of this craft and by now
there's a fair amount of it so it's all
going to be a module internal it it
won't be accessible you will get errors
if you try to use it and so you know one
one of the themes in the talk I gave
today and it will be more and more
urgent about this going forward is you
know if you're if you've written code or
you're using code that depends on you
know son mis score or JDK internal at
something or come son internal doubt
something now would be an excellent time
to fix it excellent because come around
you java nine comes around it's going to
break
right when it breaks will try to give
you good error messages but it's going
to break Wow you know sometimes
sometimes moving things forward requires
requires breaking old stuff right but I
saw that lambda you guys did a really
nice job of not blowing things up so
yeah the lambda has turned out really
well and you know in general where we're
very strongly committed to maintaining
compatibility within the bounds of the
definition of the platform right as
specified in the JCP and also any
additional AP is that are explicitly
marked as you know not JCP governed but
KD case specific but still okay here's
some little thing that you know we're
you have no problem supporting it's
completely fine if you use it but if you
write code that goes and uses son mis
gun safe you know that bet bad idea
right well thank you very much for
coming by really appreciate seeing you
and we'll see online some other time oh
