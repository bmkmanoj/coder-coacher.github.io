technology Network we're here at devoxx
UK talking to members of the java
community and I have the distinct honor
of talking to Heather van cure I hey
Heather hi Tori are you doing having me
yeah so your program manager with the
JCP right yes I managed the program
office of the JCP program I manage the
community and keep the program running
and heard all the hats and the spec
leads and the expert group members and
the Java user group members and try to
bring them together to collaborate on
the Java standards oh that's a great
wonderful big community you get to work
with right it is it's very exciting
dynamic it keeps things interesting in
my life good good so you did a boss last
night tell me about that yes we had a
boss last night and it was a late night
Boff but we had a nice attendance of
folks turning up we had several spec
leads I invited all of the london-based
spec leads who are here locally so he's
a lot right there were we had a Nigel
Deacon from Oracle he leads a JMS for
Java EE and we also had an atoll Trish
here who is a spec lead from Switzerland
he works at credit suisse and he's
leading the money in currency API and he
was he's also going to lead a new jsr a
cholet co-led with oracle for java ee
and then we also had a new spec lead
from redhead mucha marcus who is based
here in london and he's leading the data
grids for java which is jsr 347 so we
had a nice mix so clean what would you
talk about in a bus yeah well we also
had members of the london java community
and leaders from adopted jsr so we kind
of started out the buff and asked what
people were interested in and we had a
mix of topics to cover we covered some
of the things about how the JCB works
and how you would get involved in the
JCP and participate on an expert group
that's kind of a big really driver
really hard to get involved with a
it's really easy actually no actually
yeah okay so tell me so we talked about
JCB next so that's really this effort to
show developers how they can participate
and to make things really transparent to
them so that was part of their question
was how do we participate in what are
you doing to make it easier and so we've
had an ongoing effort to do that over
the last three years during in 2011 we
had this thing called JCP next a
physically umbrella term for it so we
had you know focus on making the work of
expert groups transparent that's
complete and then we merge the EC's to
make things a little bit more unified
send that Java one platform right yeah
one executive committee and then we
started working on more major changes to
the JCP looking at intellectual property
and that has started to take some time
we've been working on it for about two
years and just this year we decided to
branch that off into a new jsr which I'm
leading and it's jsr 364 so it's like
JCP that next stop for and the major
revision still goes on that will
continue discussions with the executive
committee who formed the expert group to
talk about how we're going to change the
little intellectual property but we're
moving full speed ahead on j-star 364
which is broadening JCP membership so we
fixed the transparency and now we're
trying to enable the community to
participate more easily by introducing
some new membership classes so rather
than just having a full member so you
join as a full member whether you're a
corporation or you're an individual or
your java user group because we do have
a big contingency of java user groups
who have joined the JCP as members we
have about 50 Java user groups who are
members of the JCP but we think it makes
sense to have introduced membership
classes so we'll have affiliate level
membership for individuals which will be
a lighter-weight agreement to sign and
will not require employ a fee be here
right right so we'll be like a one-pager
contributor agreement that will not
require an employer signature which is
currently a requirement for individuals
to get their employees to sign employers
to sign allowing them to participate so
we'll have a new class that will enable
broader participation by individual Java
developers will continue to have the
full membership for individuals who want
to be a full member and I want to have
their employer sign or work for a
corporation that is a full member and
then we'll also introduce a partner
level member for Java user groups so
again not not as complex in a great in
agreement because some Jovi's or groups
don't feel comfortable signing the full
11-page JSP a we do have as I mentioned
50 groups who have but that will enable
user groups to be able to participate
more fully as well see more Java user
groups involved in the JCP and bringing
their unique perspective and the real
world experience that they have into the
JCP into the development of the
standards so that's what we're looking
at doing as well as waiving all the fees
so we're removing as many of the
barriers that we can to price a patient
just to make it easier to participate
and to influence the pedo let's see more
transparency and easier membership it
sounds like you're serious about this
stuff that you really want people
everyone to be joined in the community
and be part of the java community
process yes to get involved early and be
involved in the development of the
specifications right before they're fine
excellent so yeah we're talking to you
we want you I was sitting there going I
don't know I i love this java thing but
i don't know how to get involved well
i'm gonna go to JCP or.org JCP org right
now which is not jcpenney but correct
not jcp.com that's JCP org ok go to JCP
org and you can get more information
about the java community process and of
course you can join a jug and find
information there too but we really do
want you to be involved that's the
secret sauce about java i'm telling you
right
now is the community membership
diversity a lot of people that are
interested in passionate in this
technology and the ecosystem and its
people like Heather that make it all
possible so thanks for dropping by Thank
You Tori all right this is Tori wheel
