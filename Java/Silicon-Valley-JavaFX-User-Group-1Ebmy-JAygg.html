for a moment we'll have this right back
say here
all right let's take test 123 cleaner
yep okay let's play with it
now when I speak ago good enough also
ok welcome everybody to the Silicon
Valley Java felicita group today we've
got John doing a javafx 3d it's really
cool to stop following one of us plus
interesting sessions you've had in
awhile and before we start I just got to
mention our sponsors the workbook course
provides the venue and the food a lot of
give away stuff that we get every week
for every month winnowed Jade fraud
jetbrains about IntelliJ license
giveaway at the end funny money at
interest in that be sure to stick around
and easily just woke up what extra Oh
finally but actually I've been giving it
a little bit I it's workable right now
but yeah even better and also a proud to
Riley Manning get a splits from time to
time and you get a discount by saying
you're a cruise member from their
website and with that we'll let John
take away okay thank you very much yeah
I'm sure you have any to that right now
people on the street not coming out
right now
hold on just a second i think it's just
interrupt this
screen resolution
60 member my 900 is that good or a four
by three I think it once for like three
sure 1280 x 960 is that for the three
okay great
yeah thanks so much for coming back can
you hear me ok wait yeah so my name is
John I'm part of Java effects team just
to give you a little bit about my
background I'm Hannah neck is that
expected nice excellent yeah so give you
a little background I studied animation
if you see a film school come on Astro
find out what that disney animation and
dreamworks animation as a character
technical director on chickaletta meet
the robinsons how to train your dragon
and shrek forever after and a couple
other movies and then yeah I'm all is
working at remix women at son asked me
hey how did you have to join this clear
3d animation project that we're doing
and there is kind of a research project
thing and my first I wasn't really sure
but he saved me on the idea it's have a
pretty clear answer join that project
and then later transition to you working
on javafx and yes some of the idea is
that we explained the transferred over
to you what would be now in javafx 3d
and gets it's very very exciting so yeah
let me just go ahead instead and oh yeah
general disclaimer yeah you know
standard rivage okay so bitters javafx
3d actually asked her tongue you know
the guys who work under stuff to get
their opinions vote in migrating it's a
general purpose 3d graphics
for guy effects Kevin fresh foot says
John effects adds another dimension to
Jack effects track my genetics theory
has no dimension and Jasper says John FX
3d busy the ability to use 3d geometry
cameras and lights in javafx so give us
some pretty good summaries so there are
some use cases so you know visualization
charting in 3d CAD cam medical imaging
marketing architecture fancy you eyes
yep training and even big us on our
personal games and sub perhaps so we've
probably seen this actually this videos
in HD let's see if it is happy here um
let's see
do
oh yeah my computer is not the fastest
computer in the universe buy it so that
it actually seems a really good purpose
because it shows you that Java fix 3d
can work pretty well in a laptop that's
about five years old so it's kind of
intentional but this is going to show
you that Java run in the fall it was
using a prototype version of javafx 3d
and it's basically to show you how you
can use a Java fix 3d to visualize
shipping inventory and how that ship
inventory moves along getting picked up
by different equipment and dropped off
at the trucks and stuff like that and
soon yeah this was in a slightly
different API but it's pretty much the
same thing we're providing now you know
so remove the cameras meshes lighting
all that kind of stuff now we've had
time to make a real move in this truck
so it is a comment on Twitter hey to be
over the truck
with them but you know that but uh yeah
so it's a this application is actually
written by Mathis well the to depart
that it's minus the 3d was written by
Madison Kinnear and then you had three
of us on javafx added the 3d as a proof
of concept and to cut a test site or 3d
prototype at the time yeah so let you
see there it it's basically the same
kind of functionality that exists in
javafx 3d today ok so there are some of
the features of javafx 3d there's a of
course measures cameras come in there
now a note before they went to note
because for the type of 2d book that we
were being previously didn't need to be
made but now it is ignorant we also have
a sub scene which I'll describe Knights
materials 3d picking and you know okays
for controlling level of detail so the
thing you dive into the new features
let's talk about what is already
possible in javafx too so basically the
only 3d thing in javafx to those
transforms and but they're actually
quite powerful and so you actually could
transform to the primitives infinity to
get to ribbon or 3d space and when you
tell you a little bit about some of the
stuff that we do with
not enough is that you need to see up
here on basically the transforms and
dryer effects are very you are flexible
so down here you see I'm trying to
highlight this weather is this good
transforms at all so you can customize
while your transforms with any number of
medical sub matrices and it's the
behavior is actually very very flexible
so like for example I might use my a lot
you can basically mimic mimic the
behavior of Maya transform transform
groups and joints pretty much exactly
and I would imagine that you could
probably do that with any other 3d
package out there so there's a certain
matrix structure to a transformer joint
in Maya and you get the exact same
behavior in javafx this is a simplified
our transform structure basically has
transitions and then 30 angle rotations
and in the scale this one I decided the
pivot so you know you get a transition
you're pivoting so that the rotations
and scales will happen about the pivot
and then undo the pivot which is the
inverse pivot at the end and say not
apply the Venus why not just use groups
right then cam but if you just use the
default functionality that groups
provide it's great for 2d right however
we want to do something like this for 3d
and the reason is because when groups
were designed for 2d to have this
behavior that the default especially the
location in the scale it's designed so
that the pivot automatically
recalculates so that it's at the center
of the nodes lab of bounds which is what
you want for TV but it's not what you
want for 3d and so you actually want to
customize your own transforms like this
like this so that your pin it doesn't
automatically calculate if you add your
own rotations this gives which a lot
anyways because the default is only one
rotation about what access and you're
probably bought it to be something as
flexible this or even more flexible this
yeah but if you use a default notation
and the default scale inside of a group
and then as that stuff moves around the
pivot movie calculate which will mean
that stuff removal are magically for you
which is perfect for 2d you are but it's
not what you want for 3d so please keep
this in mind if you want to learn more
about if there's absolutely zero five
it's Jared 2849 but yeah basically only
read it here for a quick with any change
to a its children including physician
orientation and scale will cause a
little creep piles of change which will
move the object so you don't want to
rely on the 2d rotation and scale that's
built into a group you
why's it so you have full control over
and it doesn't do this to deem a bound
centering recomputation thin okay so
there are a whole bunch of useful
methods on know that you really want to
get to know for 3d these are some of
them my favorites are local to seem
transform and get look with a pair of
transform which you know get look with
the seed transform basically we give you
the transform from the vid all the way
down to the nerve that you're interested
in very very powerful stuff okay so
message m tree we have on user-defined
shapes you know meshes and we have
predefined shapes to make it easy for
you just put something out there boxes
soldiers and spheres and finishes
currently we just have a triangle mesh
which is you know pretty good and so you
create a trial unless you set the points
texture coordinates the faces and then
smoothie group so what smoothie groups
do is if basically tells which faces you
want to look like they're part of the
same basically share the normals so they
look smooth so but in theory if you had
two dif- fresh faces look very faceted
but if every face where the same spoon
of it would look smooth ok and let's see
so yeah basically it's pretty simple for
boxes you just specify the three
dimensions for soldiers you specify the
radius and height then through spear you
specify the arm the radius so let's take
a look here ok
when this sir let me hide that over
there oh and if you start this so I'll
tie too much it is there are a few bags
still and if you bring up a to DUI and
you have 3d geometry it will mess up the
Deaf different so there is a I'll talk
about what girls and stuff like that as
we go around but yeah this stuff is
still definitely in progress when you
sit down here oh yeah i'll show you that
later okay so these are the primitives
that are super easy to create in javafx
yeah pretty much self-explanatory also
keep band going through actually going
to show you the deep now so we also
support 3d meshes so when we made up
let's see which one should I bring up
your dick model so this is Duke with
like a Marvel style texture and then
behind the primitives the rego yeah so
this is a this is a custom mesh
okay let's keep on then looks like lose
this one give up this one okay 3d
primitives deep demo okay so cameras
sage elephants provides a perspective
camera and the important thing to note
is that because gel effects is initially
2d the y-axis is pointing down now if
you're used to finding you're probably
used to I'll talk about actually a
second but basically there are two
constructors for creating a perspective
camera when them is very useful for to
DRS and one of them is for 3ds in what
you want to do is what is the second one
and yeah the argument name is a little
bit confusing so i will explain it it
fixed our position true is basically
that you want for 3d its if you've done
three two before this is the kind of
behavior that you used to if fixed our
position is false basically it'll make
it so that the camera has its origin in
the upper left corner of the panel and
as your witness size changes in a
automatically move your car
for you so that the origin in the upper
left-hand corner so you asked why did
you want a prospective care for two
trnas well even though jolliff x2 and
whatever 2.1 2.2 was primarily to be it
lets you look at the TV you have the
perspective camera so you could you know
transform planes and stuff in 3d
coordinate space but it still is this if
it's false which is the default that's
meant for a to DUI okay so please set it
to true if we are interested in getting
a true 3d camera behavior and antenna is
now in order to see left before wasn't
annoyed so you couldn't put it under
group lives and transform it in space
but now you can and yeah you can set the
field of view if you've done photography
or very familiar with this but you know
if you have a fisheye lens and you want
to like see everything and it's going to
be you know visually pretty distorted
then you set it up to whether you
or even where many lenses probably
around 40 to 62 degrees and telephoto
zoom lenses are like you know none of
these 2 30 degrees ish yeah sir yep if
it's a telephoto lens that objects in
the in the distance and objects in the
foreground will appear in or similar in
size now just you know you can comfort
progress with the same deal if you have
a fisheye lens the difference in size
becomes much greater if an object's
really near any super huge and if an
object's fire will be like super small
and yeah you can set the near and far
clipping planes demonstrate this in a
bit and here's a tip don't sit you're
near clipping plane to be a value
smaller than your need and you're not
 trying to be a value other than
you need because it does weird things to
the map it's not just javafx it's CG
computer graphics beauty in general if
you're like you're clipping plane as I
plug 0 0
then it does bad things to the matter it
does bad things individuals so you
already show you that let's see here
okay so remember I said before about if
you bring up a 22 you are it's going to
mess up mess up your death better well
the work line is to put a texture idea
on your it can be just a very simple
texture like just a white texture or
something but that will work around that
issue for now until it is fixed and
checked into the main line then yeah if
it didn't have a texture if it looked
like that then you're the Deaf buffering
does become messed up so that even
though an issue and actually there is a
fixed foot in the sandbox but it hasn't
been checked into mainline it ok so we
turn them off I'm sure you guys some of
the stuff like this is kind of like my
cheat sheet that meant for public
consumption but this is how I'm going to
control some of this stuff tonight so
for fear the view like let's see making
that field of view and then you load up
I don't know this well some of the other
stuff I've done which me see if I have
some file that's good to them oops I'm
kind of see oh I know I know i'll go
ahead and show primitives scenes
platonic okay yeah this is a good one to
show okay so
if my field of view is like really
really small then objects in the
distance and objects in the forehead
they're about the same size I mean about
the same size in real life but well live
life in the beauty world now they
appeared like the same size basically so
you see the right you know move this
around they look like they're about the
same size because my field of view is
really really small and if i set my
field of view to be really really huge
and of course after just my camera
position okay no pretty great huh that's
like a fisheye lens right there you know
that's what you get with though a pretty
crazy fisheye lens you know okay
everybody said it cuz that's kind of a
look at what it's kind of fun okay maybe
reset the field of view move my camera
back oh I've creedmoor the wannabes okay
now yeah so let me out talk about
cooking planes a bit it'll be close the
ones I don't need so doesn't get too
confusing there we go okay so if my ear
clipping plane to qwest field geometry
then you can see it's that's clipping it
so you can see okay I'm going to do this
far back as I possibly can but the
problem is if you leave you far cooking
babe playing too far back also and
actually I set limits on it so doesn't
it's a
too far but if you said it if you set
your miracle play ready to place and
you're far clipping plane very far back
then the geometry stats vendor in kind
of weirdly and I've let me go ahead and
make it so I can do that just to show
you what it looks like
so this is more of a cautionary thing
because um that true story so that I was
looking at but it keeps on building up
at that foil okay yes it's my primitive
scenes lady tonic simulation did a turn
there if a kid been up the year so this
is true story when i was at disney was
something called me and said hey if it's
going on here and you have the Emir
cooking plane to be right down something
yeah so this my dear clipping plane is
like super small and this basically some
crazy member craziness happening it's
basically dividing certain numbers by a
very very small number and the computer
is getting confused so if you see stuff
like this it's because you're tipping
point is like super super small or your
fart complaint is like super super
father and the computer is just getting
confused its numerical gets into
numerical error if you know what I mean
so I just wanted to show you this
because it's it's happening to people
like you know they may not be aware of
the fact that it's bad to have a
clipping plane that's super small but
yet ESD stuff like this and it's not
just in Java fix it's an it's in the
multi $10,000 packages too so I just
thought you should be aware okay okay
let's keep on going yeah okay oh this is
a fun one it's going
dear to my heart why down which is why
up so ever since the dawn of computer
graphics you know people have said
what's up and of course to the packages
like you know photoshop illustrator and
all these other packages y increases as
you go down right which makes sense for
2d because you know thinking of when you
start writing on a piece of paper you
start on the upper left-hand side either
if you're in the restive over this and
it does make sense for 2d but a lot of
3d coordinate systems have more
increasing as you go up which makes
sense cause usually you go x squared
away and then y then this way and z
coming out and some cottages have z
going up you know but what's the right
answer and the right answer is yes yes
they're very well I mean didn't write
any ones right it's all good so you know
John effects by default why is down X is
to the right and z points into the
screen and but what if you want your 3d
scene to be y up and i'll give you at
least three ways to do that tonight so
lamb is pretty simply just stick
anything that's 30
read mode and then you just flip the
root node in X by 180 degrees and wise
up for anything in that in that midfield
you load or this is actually that I did
is you could take your camera stick it
inside an X form and note that I used X
form which you've seen earlier there are
X funds a subclass of grape it has my
own sin to transform so it's not going
to encounter that all the pivoting that
was designed for two DUI which you don't
want you don't have the other pending
that's designed for two DUI happening in
your 3d scene because then things will
automatically move on for you which you
don't want right so i took my ex where
am i added i basically counted my camera
x4 than the my weight and then currency
by camera to the cab 4x4 and then
instead of sit down the aisle geometry
one dvds actually turned my camera
upside down right i know it sets if it's
confusing until you think about it for
all it does work that's what i'm doing
right now I'm actually looking live up
in my own and that's stuff that you saw
so why is actually up now but you can
get rid you know I they thought about
you know we could get a navy mil clever
you could actually do something very
similar but actually add an Aussie
rotation by 180 degrees to your camera
and then turn that upside down and then
put that on your camera xforms your
comics for a stock side with clean
values otherwise you kind of x from does
have one RZ + 180 so this is a little
bit cleaner keeps your cabin tax form in
the more pristine state so you can
what around okay so but what if we want
lie up and lie down at the same time is
that possible is it possible yes it is
possible let's not checked into the it's
not have it available yet and it's being
work when they know subscene this is at
subscene is where you can have y up and
lie down at the same time how is that
basically you can have more than one
camera / seen so subscene is a special
need that separates your scene you can
then they're part of the scene with one
camera policy with leather camera you
can use this for older than you are
controls my heads up display and you can
use it to have y up for your 3d elements
and lie down for your 2d elements two
cameras one scene or more than two
Cowboys if you aren't look this is one
way you can do it so the age-old
question why upper right arm the answer
is yes okay so nights I like thanks a
lot so lets you know interact with the
geometry and you know in the material
that gives you a bigger result and right
now there's just two types of light
sources and be an appointment but of
course we
definitely open to adding more in the
future okay so yeah that's the class
hierarchy that's what the curb website
you create the night you said its color
well you can pair that directly to the
ville they can put it on your group and
move the light or the group around so
let me show you actually the talk about
this initially based together so
materials materials it's it a bunch of
stuff right now you know in a pointer
will have fall which will let you set
the ambient diffuse specular color and
map actually should have put normal Bob
it's technically mainland up
self-illumination and you can share our
materials between different ship notes
so that's the class hierarchy that's the
kraid you basically create a fallen
material you can use an image sit the
diffuse map and warm them up and
specular color and then take your
geometry and set its material to the
material okay so let me show you some
lights and stuff because it's always fun
to see the stuff and now I can play this
animation I was kind of holding it back
for low so I think we put the animation
english so you can see how you light
reacts to the material and if you look
very carefully you know let's take a
look at this guy here it looks as if
there are graves in this geometry and if
it's even nicer like that if you take
your light and start moving it around
because you know like this indentation
of it here it looks like it's it's
really there but it's actually not in
the geometry that's what the normal
does it basically gives you the
appearance of having more surface detail
than is actually in the mesh geometry
itself which is kind of rice let me
change the color of the light so it's
David you need to see perhaps let me
slow it down yeah so if you made the
head across the surface it really feels
that the surface has that extra detail
that's what the normal map gives you and
issue these surfaces are textured and
normal have a different Norma to kind of
show you that the visual effect is like
so here these are some furs and at this
way you know it appears as if the
surface has those bumps in it but
there's these bumps aren't actually in
the mesh well it's not not even finish
its what the name of that gives you to
give you your parents and you can tell
you can break the illusion if you look
at it from the side see because if you
look at it from the side it's like aha
it's all a trick that that something
isn't really there you know it doesn't
actually displace the jump to that via
this place of that which yeah it's
something else but um yeah this is that
the moment up gives you and yeah you
know you can create different effects
with that like for example this was
frosted glass kind of work the Musial's
bring it over here and you bring it more
forward that's over two pi so I kind of
do so at frosted on my parents do it
this way and this one is you know yet
another different kind of apparent that
you could create with your a few
Sandoval maps together easier it is yeah
okay so that's aw yeah if your truest
this animation is actually pre simulated
Amaya I did quite a bit well we have at
various points of that different physics
solvers 22 javafx and in fact Jasper
just took physics over yesterday's but I
didn't have it at the time well as
making this so it's pretty simulated in
bio yeah it which is fun because you can
actually make time go backwards yeah and
if you want to place a bet you know
where it's going to land nothing can
make a lotta money that way potential
truck I'm just giving it but uh oh yeah
the cpu versus GPU question since is pre
ciliated at this point it's just you
know basically cashed out and your CPU
is playing it back so there's no but the
GPU is doing the rendering of course the
gps
no the all the 3d elements the GP singh
other 3d visuals you mean like that
Jerry do you know the answer to that ok
there's no direct access yeah ok so um
let's see over here ok let me see what
else I could show at this point since
I've odm content of these two things
yeah so um think talking about this
because we're going to show the counter
one ok so for watching it thing blog
about it what so yeah Jasper said hey
you may have bit uptake and what if we
had a Duke chest said and so I thought
okay yeah I'll bottle it deep chest said
so this is just realize you know to look
at we're going to show this at John one
vote so in k2 created a deep theme chess
set in Marvel yeah and yeah he knows
around well I'm not making the promise
of Theravada you know we're going to be
too surprised if something like that
happens so i'm going to show you this
with different lights leaving the light
forward that's a little bit bright let
me turn it down a bit yeah there we go
so you know like with these lights one
thing you can do is use one light as
your key by use another night as your
failure let's see how pretty so much
about you doing photography you know
that's a little bit too obvious let me
just turn it down a bit and then you can
use one night as you're on good white
you know like let me make it yet and put
it in the back of the head you know what
kind of good you know put it up here the
turn it down a bit yeah why not saying
that well is it trying to I just have to
hook up to two monitors and I really
hope it's not trying to show it on the
other monitor that doesn't exist which
yeesh it's got a mic I landed on my
second monitor because that's what was
before oh man that is inconvenient okay
that happens sometimes okay let me just
close this up and start it up again
dippy doo doo doo doo
this happens it more expensive packages
here ok so just as reminder though I'm
under this awning a five year old laptop
and it's like you're some kinda it's a
okay oh let's see we have many brave
something else right now let's say we
have here so nice to hear the snake
house if you're modeling a snake but I
haven't gotten around to that but I took
some I took some of our pyramids no
codes code the crib it's basically
welcome to and I oh here we go yeah you
need to change the background color to
get rid of this axis
just black I'm just make it out of it
back yet so this is animated in Maya and
you know you can turn the scene as they
spin it around and stuff like that but
this is using a we're going to talk
about this X films in the beginning now
these are basically using the equivalent
it's created an ex from equivalent to a
mile joy so basically I've animated this
in violet Maya's joints and now I'm
bought into gel effects and it's
basically doing the exact same thing in
javafx because we limit that same joint
structure in javafx and the animation as
well so therefore you get this kind of
stuff happening and you know if you look
close at the surface it has have that
known about to create the illusion of
having more surface detail so if i take
my lights and I going to move my lights
around the surface you know it does have
the illusion of having you know there's
a snake scales or
of a little on the on the surface so the
back of it I just thought that might be
a little bit fun to look at okay let's
see let's see what else we have here
okay so let's say interesting something
a little more serious so um let's see
that's good let me take a step back you
talked about so that this is for example
that a cube it look like with just a
diffuse map you ready see them that a
cube looks like without a texture map
but this is just with the diffuse map
you know and this is really looks like
with the diffuse and a male amount so it
definitely enhances the visual
appearance so feels like it has those
white things sticking out of it you know
stucco or whatever it is let's say it's
stuck oh yeah you know look at this here
this is a sphere now that's just a
diffuse map you know maybe visit place
right i mean i fake plant it nothing
upon it but you know you dig up glad
that marionette you know it'll adds an
extra level of detail to admit turnover
that the notes a little bit too
turn this down a little bit as well and
I'm going to move it around across the
surface so it really feels like it has
these continents sticking up out of the
geometry when in fact you know jump is
actually very very simple it's just this
year it doesn't have that the continents
sticking up out of it the geometry is
just what you saw be fair it's just this
but you know there to be more specific
it's just this yeah so you know using
those extra features a person has to
visual quality of what you're doing I'm
going to see list we have your space
shuttle okay so this is a little bit of
10 to 11 care it doesn't have a texture
map it's very faceted and it also
doesn't have texture so it's showing
that the caller ID but my UI up you can
see through the object but it actually
can look a little bit interesting I mean
you can use the visual artifacts to our
advantage to cut up give it a certain
look better business an example of
bringing
world data into javafx everything other
mail doesn't care we could make it look
a lot more realistic ok let's see what
yeah let's see what else we have here
seasoning or by the way if you if you
get the java 12 years ago you sob Duke
doing some animation jumping around call
to us and stuff like that well that
requires something called skin which we
had in our prototype it was very faster
you actually that they're skinny
algorithm out of the GPU someone has a
question about the GPU area that it is
look for a certain number of vertices
our prototype and a certain number of
joints influencing each vertex so a very
hard coated with a very specific case
which is great for the names but left it
for general-purpose API so we don't have
obvious getting at this time letting on
the GPU but who knows you know maybe a
makes Emma you know do some software
skating by the time the next job one
comes road to bend dupe back to life um
let's see here lets you got here hmm the
Duke Blue physics rings okay things ok
this is what you saw before so to give
you the
my workflow you probably saw me playing
out this before this is a package called
Mario Mario 3d studio max blender you
know like very bizarre 3d content
creation packages you know you can kind
of think of them as the 3d authoring two
equivalent of web photoshop and
illustrator MTD it basically lets you
create content in 3d so here I have you
know created some things in Maya and
yeah let's say that it to John effects
so it keeps up I keep on creating these
little windows over here so no let's go
ahead and bring that in so its priests
well the lighting is kind of fun so as
you can see you know I pre simulated it
in my eye because I don't have a physics
engine hit that in javafx right now I'm
Jasper just picked it up yesterday but I
haven't hired his code with me but it is
going to be a 3d rendering in javafx so
you can see it's you know I can leave my
camera on it and it's running and my
lights a little bit funky because I was
trying to make the spatial in the Gulf
fancies I'm going to just kind of sit
that back to its default ish colors so
you can see the texture of the more and
I've created a textured name
kind of like a grungy kind of a by rapid
ated chain kind of look you know so yeah
and this is I am running on a five year
old laptop you know so this is the kind
of stuff that you put the enjoy effects
and in fact you can't hook up you know
if you say design you can hook up
physics directly to drive effects as
well you know and of course already
showed you for you can move around your
lights liquid it to do which is always
fun and i'll show the axes let's see
let's see you know you know i set my qik
something when you're irish bring it a
little bit more forward more even more
of a to left and a fill light right up
let's make it oh look how i should make
it any color preference oh good okay
that's kind of boring well no please
okay by the way let's see maybe green no
interesting how that I didn't raise you
scream it out well that looks too scared
well that's anymore or what kind of
looks mmm
yeah maybe something like that and then
my room right I'll make it kind of a
purplish and I'll stick that in the back
yeah it's kind of showing up over there
so yeah this is John effects 3d and hey
let me show you some more stuff so yeah
let's see what we have here picking
thousand next item in my slides isn't it
yeah picking so I'm at picking demo I'm
played out the code yet myself but it's
pretty good stuff when you go back to
here test 3d so this was written by
pavel another the mobile java fix team
and he's been some really fun stuff with
it so like you can pick stuff in 3d and
move it around it's in a sec what we
call our manipulator in 3d you know so
you can hear whether i just make it
first clean oh look like it resizes this
one but when they can drag individual
elements spin around so this is the kind
of stuff that you can do is picking in
3d so you can kind of imagine the kinds
of you as you can play with this it
could be pretty fun and let's see
there's sure another demo yeah
I have a clue helices hit so I don't
have a good answer here's in touch
things are different to the mouse as
well but how diverse and references
tutor you use a touch as we go through
the javafx is different than the mouse
uh-huh letting it to the details are
deployed in detail on or have to be I
don't know how a touch Joe do you know
anything about touch or feature that
we've been working on how now cos mi it
is there how do we think their penis to
the farmer to the food once that
essentially we just not seeing
underlying employees it wasn't fresh
agreeable removing with your fingers of
you know Persian it have to be we belong
to find out where your you don't get on
with your mouse where your cursor is but
you know when you figure is really won't
have
drag looks slightly different mm-hmm I
nothing to do that you know obviously
for the touch screen type devices but I
haven't losing myself so I don't have a
uninformed that's right to give you
probably would touch or your mouth
you're getting and so each one of those
3d shapes there is note that can be
quick basically you can click on the
screen is taking that 2d coordinates in
mapping agency with the Transformers
economic actually uses some of the
similar bound soaks into a bowl and
stuff like that to transform transform
that that's how and that's whether you
click with the mouse or touch with your
fingers and and then sit also stuck the
older java texts you never attach
something you push it jumping yeah so
maybe the older so before we have
multitouch or the feature in order to
interact with your hand it would just
count that as the mouth yeah typically
not support the effective partner each
other I want to announce touch well I
think I think it's the same library it's
a separate event so we actually i think
we had actual touch events now as
opposed to before touching with your
hand was tired amounts of them Sir yeah
huge mountain is that it's work on
touchscreen yeah
hey let's show treasure detectives
questions of the z-index war we must do
a speaking event if the mouse is always
exciting and there is a little bit of
this is a little bit kind of interesting
problem because if you have two things
that you can pick in 3d and one is in
front of another and you have to
determine you have to you know know that
the person hoodie on the one in front
and I think you can also set notes to be
skipped and picking so if you want you
to have your node the big Norfolk me so
that it'll be gone and there's something
kind of that can be picked you can pick
the one behind it it's pretty good
pretty powerful obviously with this yes
okay let's see what you guys do if I
through the picking ok so this last the
name was written by a red one half and
this aspiring was something that he saw
somewhere else and basically it's very
well following on a surface and
deforming the surface you know so it
just shows that you can do surface
deformations you know for various
purposes like for example skimming is
one type of surface deformation where
you take the geometry and your skin it
to join so it reacts to those two that
joint animation no better way when I see
I mean to do is give me I'm you like 3d
mesh skinning which is different but
yeah so yeah does anybody have any
questions I feel free yeah go ahead an
amazing life haha does that mean that
javac a dreaming API as it written a
while yet and you kind of animation
script that Maya for from other 3d happy
gently exhale one next that's a very
excellent question thank you very much
for asking that though okay so is it you
have internet for testing purposes and
stuff I mean we do have a a very good
importer internally for testing the plan
to release it in importer for at least
one 3d file format and some of us just
this week apparently has created an
importer for their file formats right I
believe it's you DJ colada STI and three
this and you can download it from it
affects there's a link to it from
effects experience com huh yeah
interactive mesh not work or something
like that you can start out at FX
experience so importers are actually
very popular you know area of work we're
gonna provide an importer for one format
if we had time you'd be great if we
could do raw
the library had in a way its own
greatest college denominator animation
you know format just the animation
script not programming animations with
transport well okay so swear that then
that wouldn't publish that anyone could
take him right something that would load
that file well that's a lot of very good
questions well yeah I mean there's some
of the compressions in there so I'm
trying to break it out ok so then back
to the info session but if they know
that's common denominator format though
that's the distal such an answer that a
film at Megiddo BJ has been around for
decades and it at least inputs your mesh
and your materials your textures but it
doesn't bring an animation I don't
believe unless someone has extended
environment within your library is there
thinking the lighting in order nah
you're importing Maya and they're
converting it you know they're
converting it to something that has been
the standard that you're putting it but
yes colonel yes okay yes so we have been
much work with yet but f xml should be
able to wait in anything into javafx and
bring in anything that tall effects
understands ethics and all is the X in
la jolla text file format the millinery
we have that much detailed animation we
have to be caveat it it merely yes we
actually just face it indirectly for the
moment but in series all the stuff that
I've shown good real disease just into a
sectional now yeah so much of it I don't
wouldn't have access to at this point if
I downloaded you know or win you know
Java 8 comes out and I get 3d oh you can
only download it if you have Windows one
of the yeah I mean you know download
that ah but the way that the 3d
animation is getting worked in as you
say probably through it perhaps I would
never have I it's one simple answer all
things that we have that reservist one
of many times I really
but a personnel in theory and other this
yeah we'll listen wanted that consider
shipping of doing in all the data
structures that you can say encourage
congela pet sentido the meshes and the
pearls or all that stuff it should
redeem it is
yeah that's funny that's what the
current understanding is it was nearly
that's the idea is to design into that
the children in the treaty as well yes
unless I'd actually a pothead oh yeah so
if you guys might have been involved you
know this review and contribute to the
community boy be so nice to see you guys
writing more employers and stuff of that
like stuff like that for example if
anybody wants to write an FBX or a koala
importer and make that available got to
be really really cool or yeah and
there's already something done that's
under some very generous licenses like
if you go to its in C++ what is it
called we're going to call Jim and asset
import yeah google all set input there's
basically some work in c++ so if
anyone's interested in you know are
there writing a Java offer for that or
you know turn that into Java I think
it's BSC licensed yeah it looks like it
hasn't been touched in about three years
you know ya see then it'd be fun to look
into that if you had the time resources
you know we do you know a bit more
available but this is where you know if
you're excited about the stuff this is a
great lady you know with that stuff like
I said import or look at your favor file
format and look up bringing that in I
think that could be a lot of fun
actually and yeah I'm perfectly I'm
personally very excited about this stuff
I think it's I think that it's a clear
new feature in javafx a point oh I'm
biased someone else will say something
else but never anyone else any other
questions should you actually get paid
to play with this or not yes I am it is
my job it is a job and that's dead I'll
tell you some true stories so Java 1
2011 yes I was we were up some very late
nights working on trying to get demos to
work which other one like God should
this going to be accomplished this
you're satisfied so we're looking at
until midnight one night and the Jasper
guys only have to keep on working so
we're going to Jasper's house and kept
on working until like three or four a.m.
and then in a tenement I got some sleep
and then I went back at 9am so it is fun
but it is also it takes effort to mixed
up turn out you know the way Jasper
wants it to his genius i give the GV SMS
the division is visionary better word
since he has a lot of a lot of great
ideas and it's fun to make them happen
yeah i mean like connecting up connect
passing idea too deep a couple of years
ago
and yeah he's got a whole bunch of ideas
for this jello and so Yahoo yeah yeah if
you ever see what we're going to cook up
a Wi-Fi blocks one thing about 3d also
signal is that there are a lot of two
integers that are available that also
enhanced for you example 2 dot 2 we have
a canvas feature that allows a shoe draw
to a teenager and what you can do that
forth with any of the images you used to
set on a free event it come from the
campus you'd have to be pretty clever to
write normal maps to dynamically because
there's actual actually some math there
but you know it'd be pretty easy to draw
some color to a texture
and then put that on
there there are some other examples to
English textures and I think only also a
good video yes you and Hillary mamiya
but there are a lot of TV features that
can kind of be energized other features
which at this point none of us have it
done what is the minimum hardware
requirements that's a question for
example how about your Android
application yeah I little support
Android but yet in general or more
currently John effects three whatever
the early access release is available
for windows only we're actively working
on a mac version um this is running on
an nvidia whatever 80-something em you
know not even do it you know the 8000
series so it's basically five years old
and it runs at in video five years ago
card little um basically any modern
similar semi modern nvidia or ati or
intel HD you know 4,000 or heard that
one's on HD 3000 so currently you can
run it you know let's say windows seven
or eight ati nvidia touch 3000 4000 ish
yeah so anything
you no matter or roughly sort of modern
hardware and then yeah we actively
working on the mac version so visit Hugh
he's max that should be coming out in
the not-too-distant future
any more questions but really like a
nude what about javadekar me on iOS or
Android or pilot report or oh wow look
us the other given official answer
cannot so we fell four types of of July
tax on in any way and remember able so
and so we're we're going to be a public
crossing those prototypes but at least
one hora code doesn't have a plan to
eradicate release and Oracle products
that got that so we've done you know
we've done surveys and weeks off with
respect to people in belapur community
there's a lot of people who are you know
eco saving taking the code and
essentially
building building fronting for for iOS
or broadway to the nbm very tight the
operation see ya so the way to so Apple
as some restrictions that you cannot you
cannot log anything dine allocate
resources and allocation you essentially
have to bundle you have to double the vm
with your application coos ohio and that
way you can you can actually post it on
for me a song actually we've done that
we've done that from from the mac OS
absol look for together black and you do
a start from on the other text you will
see
gation cold and tumble he's the galaxy
the visionary okay but just do a search
for java
well then you enjoy this crown valley ER
sequence of images as a texture for a
surface that is being deformed by
wind-ups my fire going to load in the
sign that and your
that it serves fixturing texture anyway
oh you just assigned a different thing
at the day ha and when Joe was talking
about using the canvas you simply okay
this is a node in Justin we assign that
node as the texture it might be a world
it harder than that because basically
you you would write to the canvas and
then get it you's a writable image and
get off yep that way you have a if
translated to ya image so texture could
hold again and which picture can be a
writable them right okay so there there
are there's a blog post example of that
somewhere before it is the google core
you'll find any sample
code example 2
yeah so feel free to blog about anything
you seen except for the tip just said Oh
Jasper did an innovator and I was you
know really expected for a dollar would
be good you know yeah anyways innovation
takes work yeah so I did no questions
yeah thanks so much for coming I yeah
glad to see the first so I should i said
it's this Natasha but yeah
he's in Europe 3d packages you know
speaking about the website have been
around for like yeah a decade or more
yeah yeah yeahs doesn't find out the 3d
how to kiss that's pretty neat yeah well
for a concept design and greedy so yeah
so those respiratory whispering I
doesn't try to GQ it does videos and I
say the better GPA I've heard in the
field work really yeah so as you try it
no I mean no oh yeah you would need to
you already yeah you would need a linear
set up in jail right yes all right no
higher yet I know they will try it
I know does it go on the wall in my
actually oh thanks you anything
honey and picks for the Shadow motorbike
the ham you know you're a lot of there's
a lightweight user so everybody's
talking Mario most read it to you try an
engine likely because if it wasn't that
