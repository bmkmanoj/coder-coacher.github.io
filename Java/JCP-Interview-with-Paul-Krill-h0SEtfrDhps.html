the JCP party and I have Paul krill here
who's a journalist for info world so
tell me a little bit about what you've
been doing with your articles recently
on Java topics a bunch about Java 8 that
was the java SE 8 i've written much
about that what about javafx i'm about
project panama the other day yeah what's
that I i I'm a Java kyanite it provides
access to native libraries from Java
code apparently there's gonna be so
they're gathering votes for it I think
it's gonna be they're gonna tally up the
votes tomorrow i think it was i think
was first floated in march on the
OpenJDK mailing list and now they just
been getting a lot of support for it
yeah I wrote an article out of today we
could be go on there and give you a tell
you look for them which more like more
than what i can recall off the top of my
head so all right so since this is the
sample same question I asked the
previous lady it's it's 2014 15th year
anniversary what were you doing in 1999
8099 yeah Oh still I was a dutiful world
then I just got married I mean I did a
lot of stuff a lot of changes in those
well so did then we were you still
covering Java topics back then I guess I
probably was yeah yeah so it's like 15
years off and on for public world order
yeah yeah Wow so I've been there for 19
years so that's awesome so any any
articles that come to mind in the past
15 years where you got a really good
reaction or positive or negative that
you think is worth talking about there's
there's so many of my Road survive java
SE a that's the one i just came out
right I've see ya I got a I got a lot of
reactions on an article that came out in
march on march on the day of the
introduction i talked about lambdas and
that sort of thing so it's a lot of
reaction on that
but since I don't have the website in
front of me it can't pull up the
comments I can't recall it specifically
but I don't know each other people are
passionate yeah yeah I wrote about right
and then like I said a few weeks that
ever about javafx and somebody in Russia
did like the article so people like your
glee don't say anything if they don't
like it they're sure they're sure to say
something so yeah so the javafx
community is still very active and very
vocal yeah yeah yeah but well you're not
supposed to talk to me but is it you
think javafx kids can hold up against
html5 and all the other web development
technologies that are out there i I
think it has its place I mean it's not
going to displace html5 but it
definitely solves a solves a real
problem in a very elegant way which
would real problem is jug I mean it grab
it's the best cross-platform desktop UI
framework out there I mean what are you
gonna use flash it only runs not java
though doesn't it I mean you can
packages native applications and crossed
apply using deployment tool so for
native desktop deployment I mean it's
really the best framework out there now
okay how many people are using and how
many developers are using it um
surprisingly i've got a lot more
interest over the past couple years as
swing and legacy developers are coming
up to speed on it and i think even if
you check google trends it's been rising
in popularity which is odd since you
would think it would be the opposite
really so yeah I mean I think your
reaction at the article is not just a
quirk like there's a lot of people out
there using it on real industrial
projects it's in a swing being phased
out it's not being worked on and that
hasn't worked on for a while so
it's aspect though it's part of the JCP
spec what can you tell me about the
future of javafx are probably nothing
right yeah you know the game is play
cool no thanks thanks for being a sport
and coming on the JCP 50th anniversary
interview so you can't don't get to
leave without prizes so would you like a
book I guess sure okay so we have the
15th hello world book and you also get a
night hacking laptop sticker okay that's
great okay yeah this is something I can
yeah I can it take I guess all right
probably gonna bring it to work
everybody else to look at it all right
great you want you right here thanks
very much here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
