work in the middleware team at Oracle
today I'm going to show you a simple
collaborative whiteboard is a
collaborative whiteboard where different
shapes can be drawn in multiple colors
the shapes drawn on one browser for
example here or automatically drawn on
all other browsers that are connected to
the same end point as shown in the URL
window over here for this we're going to
be relying upon WebSocket this is a
WebSocket application we will be using
the jsr 356 implementation that is
available in GlassFish folder or
promoted bills today so let's take a
look at the application first
now it says I can choose a red color and
I want to draw a square and I want to do
an instant transfer of the data so let's
see what happens when I click on this my
developer tools here says I am sending a
text input text data from one browser to
the other pair browsers and it's
basically a JSON structure and on the
receiving browser which is again appear
you know the same Red Square is drawn
and it says I received the exact same
JSON structure so that's pretty cool
let's play around with this let's add a
couple of more squares so again send
text is sent shape color and coordinates
you know a nested JSON structure is said
say means you see over here and rendered
accordingly now I could change the color
I could draw a different color I could
change the shape and the color and
whatever I draw on one browser gets
rendered on the peer browser as well now
I may say I don't want to transfer the
data right away let's say I'm going in
an offline mode for now ok then I can
continue to draw some more images here
let's say change the color and now let's
say I want to send a snapshot of this
data to the browser that is running on
the right hand side over here so I click
on the snapshot button here the exact
canvas which is on this browser is now
redrawn on this browser as
and this is achieved by using binary
data transfer using WebSocket and that
is again that data transfer is actually
done using the WebSocket implementation
layer which is built into part of
GlassFish now we I also have a curved
browser running in the background here
which is basically Safari so this is the
left is Chrome on the right is Firefox
and this is Safari now let's say third
player joins in okay I click on instant
mode here so that means we are we have
started transmitting the data again so
whatever we draw and now you can see it
shows up on all the browsers and let's
say I stop transmitting the data again
and I start adding some more shapes and
figures and then I say snapshot this
same snapshot is being conveyed to both
the browsers and in that sense they are
really true peers so for example if I
come on this browser here and I say I
don't want to transfer the data from
this browser to other browsers I can
start making some changes here and then
I can say oh now send a snapshot and
there you see you know you the same
snapshot is being sent over to all the
peer browsers now to understand all of
this how this all these pieces are fit
together let's take a look at our source
code so this is my name means IDE you
know this is my source packages here and
these are my pages so first of all is my
index dot JSP
very simple here I just got radio
buttons here for the different colors
for shapes and what kind of transfer
format you know you want instant
transfer or do you want to do a binary
transfer and then of course I'm
including a couple of Java scripts here
so let's take a look at the Java scripts
first now web socket is this is a script
that I have created as part of the
application this is the endpoint that we
are listening at and we'll take a look
at this in a second the important part
is after the WebSocket connection is
initialized to set the binary type to
array buffer this ensures that
anytime a data transfer is done you know
using a binary payload the type is array
buffer
the default is blob so we need to
override that because we are using array
buffer for data transfer and we'll see
that in a second as well now these are
my convenience metals where I just print
you know what is being said hex and
binary this is these are my callback
listeners for the WebSocket like when
something is received you just draw the
image you know you figure out where
there is a text data or a binary data
and then you invoke the write method
let's look at our whiteboard ojs now
this is what you tells me you know when
my canvas is ready well first of all we
draw a canvas here which is html5 canvas
then you get the context you add a event
listener to it you know this is gives
you a convenience method for the current
position where you clicked exactly and
this is what defines the image so in the
sense you go through the input form
figure out which color which shape you
create adjacent coordinates for all of
this and you draw the image here and if
you say you're doing instant transfer
then you send the G's on coordinates it
goes from one browser to the other
Pierre krauser's and if it's a binary
thing then on the from the canvas you
have the context already from the
context you get the image data you
convert it into an array buffer which is
a new data type introduced in JavaScript
for doing binary data you convert into
an array buffer provide a view on it for
you in eight array and say send binary
now send binary is a simple method as we
saw earlier is just saying WebSocket or
sent bytes now down here we have simple
you know draw image methods here so you
want to draw a circle Square and things
like that and this is what we have is a
draw image binary so when we get the
data back you know say on the receiving
end for example we get the data we on
the context we create the image data and
then we do use context or put image data
to draw the image back on the canvas
let's take a look at the Java source
code now
very simple this is my simple pooja and
I was saying websocket end point this is
where I'm listening
I got some encoders and decoders now as
you recall when we were sending text
data the data was coming to us in JSON
structure now JSON structure we could
read it in the callback in the message
handlers and then play around with them
or a better way is actually define
encoders and decoders which allow you to
transform data from string to JSON
structure you know using the encoding
decoding rules so if I take a look at
figure decoded encoder
here is a decode method which says okay
no strong is coming in and I'm going to
convert this to a simple JSON object so
as simple as that and once I get the
JSON object then I have my new figure
figure is my own object which is a POJO
and that from that I convert what my
figure object looks like there's a
simple will decode method which returns
from the encoder decoder okay I am
capable of decoding it and encode is
very simple anyway and that's about it
that's pretty much the application so as
you can see now if I go back to my
whiteboard I have a simple on open
callback handler on closed callback
handler then here I have a broadcast
figure now this is where exactly I am
sending the text coordinates of the JSON
structure so all I do is and I say I
reiterate over the peers you know which
are there if it's not coming from the
same flight you know it could that is
you do not broadcast to all the peers in
the network no you broadcast actually
you do broadcast to all the peers but
you do not broadcast back to yourself
and that's what this if loop is doing
effectively so you just iterate over it
and you send the object and in this case
you're just sending the bytes so this is
a broadcast figure method and this is a
broadcast binary math method now as you
can see this is handled by our figure
and coder decoder and this method has a
signature that means this is invoked
whenever a binary data is being received
so you can handle your text data you can
finally payload you can handle your
Cody Korell from client to server and
vice versa
all of that can be very easily done and
for this I am using GlassFish build 64
which has Jason 356 reference
implementation already integrated there
so I would encourage you to download
GlassFish and try it out and have fun
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
