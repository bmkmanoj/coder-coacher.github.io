technology Network we're here in Java
oneindia that's speaking to members of
the java community I've got ash Monroe
with me hey Ashwin how are you doing
hello Tori how you doing I'm doing well
so welcome to Java one thank you how are
you doing it's been great i mean it you
know it's a long trip for me from
australia it's always a pleasure to come
here but settled interaction tell me
about your role in the java community
well I product manage netbeans I'm
responsible programs with netbeans and I
be with to strip for about 13 years now
so yeah I think it doesn't mean focus
for me is to work with the java
community you see what your dalip needs
are and help facilitate that in your
tooling ok great so tell me about you
did a session and a hands-on way up
right yeah how about this well the
session was cutting edge tooling for
cutting edge Java right so you know buzz
and I think the audience er really
reciprocated to that is all about all
the innovation that's happening in Java
so the session that I have is really
focused on how you can leverage all of
that innovation and make sure that
you're more productive with the tooling
that's keeping pace so we've got a lot
of things happening in netbeans
especially in the in the new html5
developing capabilities and how you can
interact ok right and that's that's
really cool there's a lot of really nice
stuff that's happening there the people
want to leverage the java community
knows that HTML files in the forefront
and they want to be able to make use of
that so that's one part of it man of
course we support jdk 8 some of the
preview features are already available
and so you know the small things in
there wow that's cool so netbeans is
right on the cutting edge the NetBeans
development team is talking to the Java
development team right making sure that
they're in int annum working together
absolutely yes and you know that
that feedback is fantastic you know
we've got people in the community trying
things out giving us feedback we work
with the Java team and saying and you
know we make sure that the you know some
of that requirements are heard and you
know and incorporated into the platform
itself and that's that's that's been
brilliant for us right now excellent so
tell me about your based in Australia
where Melbourne Australia lovely city
okay so tell me about the java developer
community there yeah i mean it's a very
very influential one son so to speak
especially in an organization they are
really good bunch of developers out
there we got to keep in mind I mean no
stairs got 20 million people there and I
think I just heard a statistics on us on
a random note there 25 million people
that pass through just one railway
station in Mumbai Wow if you look at it
from that standpoint the developer basis
but definitely small they're very
influential they do take part in a lot
of communities and you know they're part
of many of JCPS and jrs and some extent
they have a lot of interaction with the
industry itself so there's a lot of
industry involvement
especially in Canberra which is a lot of
garment based projects and things of
that sort the jug there is extremely
active and I do believe there's a open
source conference that happens in
Brisbane every year which is well
attended to nice so thank you for coming
by Ashwin I appreciate it my pleasure
it's always nice talking to you and you
can get the cutting edge tool alright
