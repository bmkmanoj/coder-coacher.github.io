doesn't know anything about raspberry
pie filled in a few hours ah maybe
taking that ought to do I thought all I
could think of was maybe get an LED
light to light up right I'd be happy if
I could get it done so filled remote
control ah good remote control to run on
any web capable device because this
phone it's not a job it will go home you
know that this company I don't think
they'll ever support java right so
javafx oh whatever java based client
will never run on this but I really want
to use this tool to control it um so I
thought okay John do jacket
easily let us up anymore any web based
device too sweet work um and and the
thing about this robot is it's already
pre-built vini already built a lot of
the hard difficult up and expose it and
in the form of things ipi so I thought
okay maybe I can use it to communicate
with it but the right place API wasn't
that user friendly I wanted something
that I could click a button and if your
camera you want to see it so that's an
up down left and right and that's the
distance indicator to say okay how far
are you from yeah an obstacle in front
of you so so I thought okay maybe I can
do something to see if I can be a robot
that I can control remotely using Wi-Fi
on the same network and see be smart
enough to not destroy itself if I forget
to stop it right so um so I try to try
to build something from ground up and
say okay we didn't a few hours I got
something working in my browser right
the app server that i have just serve up
a simple HTML page to basically load up
a simple webpage write some jquery's to
hit recipes api to talk
they say a robot um no that that was
nice but observer was running on my
laptop what happens in my laptop's not
running then this wrong run all right so
talk to me talk to it up ver y era and
say okay what else can we do about it
right okay maybe moving run the app
server on rush paypal well turns out
that raspberry pi can run tom cat so I
loaded Tomcat he bought the war just
like that on to rest babe hot side of
the signup server and this is it so just
add illustrate how easy it is to to
build a robot and remote control it from
a fall that doesn't run any Java or
anything complex office this is pretty
complex but not no not any job Asia oh
so it's running running and running okay
it stopped by itself so because the
sensor automatically detected that
there's an obstacle in front of it and
all the logic not on a robot on this
wall okay very simple jQuery base budget
just few lines of code in a few hours
you guys can do it too thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
