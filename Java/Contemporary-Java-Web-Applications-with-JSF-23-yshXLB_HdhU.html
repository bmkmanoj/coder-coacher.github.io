new humor okay there you go
I'm very happy to be here speaking today
about JSF 2.3 so let's get right into it
this safe harbor statement is standard
but everything I'm talking to you about
has already been done so you can count
on it okay so this talk assumes basic
familiarity with JSF and JSF has lots of
flashy components and wonderful ways to
work with it there are other resources
to visit for that perspective on JSF
this talk is more a little has a little
historical content in the front followed
by some opinion on JSF and then the
heart of the talk is the new feature
review I'll be doing that entirely in
NetBeans for the most part I'm just kind
of open going in through the code and
then give you some words about opening
up Java EE and the perspective on JSF
and I intend to leave five to ten
minutes time for QA I even with our
short 45 minute session duration I think
we can do that and I kind of want to
keep it a little more interactive if
possible I know they're recording this
session and so whenever someone asks a
question I'll be sure to answer repeat
the question so if you have a question
that you'd like to see address please
raise your hand even in the middle of
the session so JSDF has been around for
a long time this is 16 years of JSF it
was announced that the Java 1 keynote in
2001 does anyone remember seeing this
slide when it was first put up right on
alright so the basic idea is still the
same you know it's the simple Java
server-side web framework thing and why
you know how can that possibly be still
relevant that's such a long time ago
well abstractions and JSF at its heart
as any specification is really it is an
abstraction and it is an abstraction
that lets you build web apps that are
quick to build maintainable localizable
it'll secure device-independent
good-looking and are fun to use so while
preparing this session I did a little
research on stackoverflow here a number
of stack overflow hits compared to some
other popular ones as of yesterday and
JSF has the most that's some kind of
metric I was talking to someone who is a
PHP developer at the party one party
last night did anyone go to that zero
turnaround party one yeah okay
have a good time all right thanks to
those folks who are throwing that
talking to a PHP developer and they said
yeah man the Stack Overflow thing is a
great measure of security because I have
a sense
Akito have a sense that uh if any
question I have there's gonna be an
answer for it so now the perspective to
give you some perspective with this
graph if you add PHP into it
all of the others turn into noise so
that's just the thing I don't know I
haven't I'm not a PHP user so I haven't
really tried to do it but that's an
awful lot of Stack Overflow
so JSF how can it still be relevant
right
JSF has a long history incorporating
proven ideas from the community living
communities indoor so it's not a dead
thing it's an alive thing and it's an
alive thing because of all the people
that I've come to know and work with
over the years that are contributing and
still vibrant and active in this
community I've had the great great honor
of working with some excellent engineers
over the years inside and outside of the
company that was sponsoring the
development first Sun then Oracle and
I've been always very blessed to be able
to take those ideas and bring them in
facelets Ajax website get pushed list
goes on and on of ideas that will you
know came in from the community and are
now in the core Java platform this is
just a personal note this is 15 years
six month and two days
from when I gave my first ever JSF talk
so I consider that a very great honor to
have such a long run and you know have
some other stuff to talk about as you
saw yesterday oh I'm I'm in the
background probably yeah that's what JSF
is right kind of in the background
another reason living communities indoor
is there are two independent open-source
implementations Arco Mahara the
reference implementation which is
commonly seen in all these app servers
and Apache my phases which is seen this
is an incomplete list and all these app
servers JBoss wildfly is done a great
job you can see it's in both lists of
making it easy to swap in between the
different implementations so when I look
at JCP standards that have been done
over the years I think JSF is the one
that's most directly and provably
delivered on the promise of having
multiple separate implementations that
are swapping it I mean JSON you can do
that too but there's so much people so
many people out there that are using a
completely different idea in the form of
jackson that you have to rewrite the
code whereas with JSF you actually have
some reasonable claim to deliver on the
value proposition of vendor independence
based on specifications so while
preparing for this talk I had a
conversation with my old friend and
frien faceless founder chuck I seviche
and I wanted to ask him since he was
most up-to-date on this how are people
using JSF in contemporary context and
you know trying anyone here using
primefaces a JSF component library okay
a lot of folks
he says JSF is still being used lots of
back office applications government
agencies banks that like to keep their
business logic on the server side where
they have probably pretty conservative
requirements about data security and
pushing business logic to the client
side another key use case which was JSF
was designed to appeal to this from the
very beginning
and this was a style of application
development that has since become less I
don't know widespread for public facing
apps but for most apps that have a
captive audience where you this is the
thing you have to use whether it's just
to do your job or it's what's your
agency that is using its lots of screens
right so any app that's based from sort
of screen based where the screens are
authored by many different people or
teams they probably share a common
template it's good for that it is good
enough many people already know how to
use it it's kind of king of good enough
in some sense and it's also knows known
quantity it's easy to find people to be
productive with it so does anyone else
have any perspectives they wanted to
share on why they're still using it even
though it's very old and there's a lot
of other choices yeah right
you can't find people who want to do
angular or JSF oh okay
so you're saying that you're saying a
contrary is assertion is that it's a
contrary point to find people who are
productive to use data okay okay no it's
that's great data that's contrary to
what jatai soul told me maybe it's a
market specific thing it could be that
you know in Western Europe part where he
is it's more common I don't know any
other perspectives
right
yeah it's your mouth very and so the
Jawas point was people pick up JSF
during school and then they come into
the workplace and it's a different
environment so anyhow there's some
opinion and we can talk more about that
later I'm going into the exhibition area
if you want to bend my ear about this or
any other topic let's do the new feature
review before I do that though I want to
point out that we have moved everything
about Java EE on to github and I have a
separate section of the talk while I
mean giving you my perspective on the
move to eclipse foundation the Java EE
main landing page is Java EE to github
data and the samples that I'll be
showing for this and every other feature
that's new and Java EE 8 is available at
that URL there so let's take a look at
the new feature of you there are more
new features in JSF 2.3 than this but
they all have the same kind of
characteristic of being you know little
incremental feature ads right so you can
think about what they mentioned at the
keynote on Monday of Java itself the
core java SE moving to an incremental
release schedule we already kind of have
that for this but not the time frame
right so we'll see if in the move to
eclipse they can get releases out more
frequently I believe they will be able
to use of servlet for Oh server push the
good news on that is that mostly comes
for free
in fact entirely comes for free if
you're using straight-up JSF WebSocket
push Ajax method invocation multi field
validation which is a really long
sought-after feature
and tighter CDI integration and then if
I get through all those I'll show you
know we can open the list up and if
anyone has any other features they want
to explore it we can look at that start
out with server push so while I was
preparing for the talk I looked into
when it was added to put this finally in
the spec for the implementation rather
and came across the commit I made for it
and I just thought it was kind of funny
here this will probably be the last
commit to JSF on Java denied get before
moving to get up so I did the same it
also be the last JIRA filed before moved
to github issue tracker many thanks to
Jeff for all the great hosting over the
years so we had when java.net first came
out you know we had this on its own
issue tracker thing and then they got a
license with Atlassian JIRA and that
like totally changed our world and in
fact the development of JSF was very
heavily improved by having a high
quality issue tracker like that we did a
lot of stuff with the community to take
feedback in the issue tracker and we
entirely relied on JIRA during the spec
development process to track which
issues we were implementing and
everything so we got a lot done with it
and I did want to give a quick point to
this blog post I made at the end of the
java.net era so long and thanks for all
the commits so this was important to me
because there was many people who worked
on java.net over the years and many
people who made the migration to github
a success thank you for that ok
let's look at the code then so the first
thing I wanted to just do is start with
a little demo and if you've seen my
servlet talk kind of seeing something
similar so in the GlassFish samples in
the servlet area they have a super super
simple server push wire that shows how
to use server push outside of JSF and
the great thing about these samples is
that they're really you know showing
bare bones right you don't have anything
else in here
so this is a simple servlet and in the
do get method we take the request we ask
it for the new push builder we add a CSS
file and then we tell the push builder
to send the push and then we write out
the HTML that happens to reference that
CSS file and if we look in the webpages
of course we'll see there's our CSS file
the way this looks in the browser is
let's reload this and let's look at the
chrome net internals and look at HTTP -
and you can see if we select this you'll
see there is the server push let's see
is it a push promise yeah there's the
push promise this is the HTTP - pseudo
headers and the path of the CSS there so
that's really simple and easy to
understand
on the jsf side because all of the
resources that JSF has associated with
the pages it knows about in advance we
were able to modify the specification
which I can show you right here this is
a little actual text and the JSF 2.3
spec does anyone actually ever looked at
any of the JSF or any other Java EE
specs over the years well that's great
do you think it's useful to have those
okay because that's another aspect for
the Eclipse thing is that every other
open-source project I can think of
doesn't bother with having a
specification
and a test suite I mean they probably
have test-driven development so they
probably have a test suite so the thing
they really don't have is a spec thing
so it'll be interesting to see how that
evolves because it's it has to be done
in a lightweight fashion I think this is
one of the things that the CDI folks
have done really well I mean ideally the
spec should be able to be generated from
the code in the same way that Javadoc is
and they've done that pretty well
they've approximated that gotten pretty
close to it with the combination of Java
doc and asciidoc in CDI so I hope that
they're able to pull that off
no exactly of course not everything
that's that's why they fall back to
asciidoc so it's not a perfect solution
and so the solution we've derived that
over the years with JSF is you know do
as much as possible in the generated
documentation but when you need a
explanatory bit of text that spans a lot
of different parts of the code that's
what the core specification is for so
this bit says here basically if you're
running on server for use server push
and we wanted to keep it very high-level
specification so as long as it you know
adhered to the HTTP requirements all of
the pushes must be started before any of
the HTML response is rendered to the
client and there's a couple other
requirements in terms of the method that
we knew we're going to be correct which
is it has to be safe and cashable so we
knew for all of the JSF resources that
would fall under that umbrella so we in
our implementation we just chose to
modify the external context class and
when it does it's in code action url'
which will be done for every resource
that's going to be rendered we end up
end up calling this method here let's
see
to search this way necessary yeah push
if possible unnecessary so we do a
little check to see if push is supported
because we need to you know JSF still
even though it's a part of Java EE eight
it's possible to run it on older things
that might not have those classes
although that's not a feature that we're
really supporting anymore we're saying
you have to run it on Java on Java EE
eight container so we checked the
attribute there if it's supported or not
we also don't want to push the do issue
another push we've already pushed this
URL because with JSF you might have lots
of different pages and some of them
might reference the same resources so
you keep track of that and we use
compute of absent to check that and then
we add the resource URLs that's and here
we actually do the push so this is the
same code that you saw in the simple
example but it is built into the core
JSF implementation and we also know that
there's no if modified since header so
if there's no if modified since header
then we are safe to push there is a
modified since header then we know that
it's in the browser's cache and we're
not going to push it so if we look at
the more complex example of the
primefaces showcase which you've
probably seen you know it has a number
of images and resources here and if we
go back to the chrome net inspector you
can see there's a few more push promises
that are coming there usually I see it
like a hundred and forty four so let me
reload this shift reload
yeah there you go
though there's just more of the same
push promises okay does anyone have any
questions about the server push okay it
is something that while I said it's
really easy it does like this is the
general http/2 concerned it really HCB
to turns on its head the way you do a
lot of the optimizations that you had to
do in your websites before
for example image sharding and I'm sorry
domain sharding and image sprites are
too technical techniques that people
used to optimize performance prior to HC
b2 and those techniques don't they
actually make performance worse with
HTTP 2 so you know you research it
carefully before you do considered
moving all everything over to http - yes
F itself had never done any domain
sharding or image spriting for you so
nothing will be done in that regard you
know did you have a question or
observation
good question great question question
was is there way to turn it off right
and so when we did this in the spec we
just wanted to keep it a super course so
currently no that is something that
would have to be added you would imagine
you can easily imagine some way where
you can define parts of your page or
some kind of resource pattern that would
match or even actually maybe in the
resource library itself would have some
way of indicating push these resources
or not so but the answer is everything
is pushed if you have HCB to on the
browser can turn it off of course and I
think you know I showed you the code
there's what you probably could do is
have a filter in there that takes that
attribute and puts it and then disables
it that way so there's a way to work
around everything okay all right let's
go now from the web server push to
website and push now these are different
kinds of pushes the WebSocket push is
much more intentional and application
level so we have an example in the Java
EE samples let me make sure I close the
other stuff I don't need any more we are
and I also want to give a big big big
shout out and thank you to my co speckly
and colleague manfred green he was my
full partner in Khost but lead on this
and it's fortunate he wasn't able to be
here to present with me and also he took
the time to put together the sample
editions here so this is a single war
that you can deploy that has a nice
title page with all of the samples and a
typical simple style we have them all
listed out for you there so let's look
at the websocket sample and if you just
click send a message you go back to the
previous window and there's a message
that it's been pushed so let's look at
the code
websocket
okay so here you have a Facebook page
supposed to make this big
also you'll see that we've got the ugly
red line of the version of NetBeans I
have here doesn't have the Java EE 8
stuff in it and I'm sorry I don't have
an answer on when that will be available
this has been a bit of a different thing
and I haven't heard much about what's
going on with NetBeans regarding Java
et8 so I can't answer that so all of the
great documentation not a completion you
expect is not quite working here so you
have let me actually pull up the Java
doc to locally no I don't have it handy
okay we'll just have to go with the code
so you create a channel that is
basically a name and you have to use
that same name on the other side of the
thing so you can see there's a the other
page that opens so when you visit this
web sockets end page by just opening up
a regular href in the new window
WebSockets and you can see here we've
got an F event and it opens up which is
not a new thing F events been around
since JSF - oh and the type is post
render view so in the JSF lifecycle
after the view is rendered this event is
going to fire and it's going to call
this WebSocket beam send method and
let's step into that so here this is
just a plain old CDI beam and we are
injecting the push context and the name
of the push context is my channel and we
are sending the alert so this my channel
thing matches up with the my channel
over here also the on message that's
going to be evaluated so when the
WebSocket beam sends this thing that's
going to call over to this guy here
function alert message and just take the
alert and
so and then we can go back up to the
index so any questions on that yep
right yes that's a different we have a
different feature for that the question
was this example is just communicating
for one page to another the WebSocket
push is forwent is a one-way thing when
the server wants to send something down
to the client so whether it's one pages
there's several different pages it's not
going out anywhere else
so the client calling back is the one
I'll be talking about next that's the F
colon command script okay question there
fill mmm question was do I know if the
autocomplete is working IntelliJ
hairclips I don't know yeah I hope I
mean usually they get it this is one of
those things where when Oracle decided
last year the big news the big donation
news you kind of see a pattern here
a lot of divesting going on so when we
did that news we gave it to Apache and
you know that's still it's a big thing
so that's still in process you got a
question
I believe it would go in all the
question was if you had multiple copies
of the same page and you did to push
would it show and up in all of them I
think it would because it's the browser
knows those connections in those
channels any other questions you know
ah I can try I don't have that zoom
thing turned on I was messing with the
resolution let me just try to do that
over here this old-fashioned way
yeah I don't know I've already got it
running at the lowest one uh you know
how you want to come up Dave and help me
but I think I may have turned that off
somehow
yeah I know I somehow turn that off
that's okay yeah I was wrecked bad and
it's yeah I know but I've got it turned
off something on preferences sorry about
that huh I don't know it's it's not
going I'm sorry yeah I'll try I'll try
to speak it out more and you know you
you can check out the samples yourself
and see them so that's the best I can do
at this point I'm sorry alright let's go
back to the next one that I wanted to
mention over here
Ajax method of vocation so this one is
implemented using the command script tag
and it's very simple so let's take a
look at what he's doing in the code
there command script an example of using
server-side Ajax invocation with JSF yes
so you can see there's no ABCD
hard-coded in the page we are simply
calling over to command script being
execute so this will cause an ajax
request to be sent to the server and the
response will you know re render the
output section here so if you've used
the F : Ajax tag this is very similar
but this just allows you to rear-end
send the output directly back from this
thing and have it go where you want to
do it there so let's look I think we're
just going to see right taking the input
lower case and upper case yet and
sending it back so again really nice and
simple example and it's you have to set
it to auto run on true.you if you don't
set it to auto run then
well you could bind it to certain events
in the page and the name I think is
optional so any questions on from an
script this is another one was community
contributed by the community okay all
right next up is multi field validation
this one is using F : validate whole
beam and I'm gonna take a little chance
again here and see if I can find where I
put this
yeah
okay
okay alright so the let's go up to the
top level of the Javadoc I hope this is
going to do it for me
index.html JSF fake I know
okay yeah if you go now it's so that's
that's the Firefox soon yeah if you look
at the jsf Javadoc that's on the public
website which is github I'm sorry
Java EE that github that I Oh slash
JavaServer faces spec there should be a
link to Java doc on here and if you go
and find that you'll come to this page
as well same thing you'll see here and
it's got this color-coded thing so you
can easily see which stuff has changed
and what's added and new so if we look
at the VTL doc if we go to f we should
see validate whole bean there we are so
this supports multi field validation by
enabling class of Lavina validation so
it's entirely based on CDI and let's
look at the code
okay
now they'd hold me here we are so we
have two text fields input text one with
value one and you can see it's got the
validate beam tag in it and then the
other input text two with the validate
beam inside it and then finally you have
this one at the bottom here who refers
to the whole beam so the key thing is
regular JSF validation is based on
fields whereas CDI validation is based
on objects pojos really and with CDI
validation when we integrated it in JSF
2.0 we had them add a feature to CDI
which was if I was to hand you a model
with this value in it would it be valid
and it would return us this enabled
whether it was valid or not this enabled
us to kind of preemptively do that check
whereas the real way CDI wants to
operate is preventing invalid stuff from
ever entering into the model so you
would give the object to the thing
actually no it's the other way it's like
you have the stuff injected in the model
already and you would validate the whole
thing and would say if it was valid or
not so what we do here is sort of turn
it upside down and push the values into
a beam and then ask CDI to do the
validation specifically during this part
right here so if we look at the whole
beam that we're passing in here he has
to find a new annotation where is this
yes he added a constraint so the
constraint this is a standard this is
how you do it you just find a constraint
validator and then it's got a POJO
values here set value one and set value
two and
just look at this code is validator
being no that's a different one okay
trying to find the where the business
logic is that's it the whole validator
it's actually gonna be just in this case
showing false all the time so this is
where you would be able to take the
whole beam here and check the values so
let's let's make a change here let's do
some live coding if we run it in the
browser list of sample apps go up and go
back to validate whole beam whatever I
put in here it's gonna give me invalid
unable to validate mean so let's just
change this to true and redeploy the
application redeploying already and if
we do this I'm hoping it's gonna work
yeah it worked it didn't complain you're
not seeing the message there so what
you're actually passed here is the whole
beam and you can inspect all of the
properties that are set and then compare
them so the most common example that's
used here is typing the password field
twice right so you have to make sure the
first value is the same as the second
value so in order to do that you need a
validator that is handed an object that
has all of the properties in it so it's
not just it could be any number of
fields that you can inspect on the beam
so it's kind of flexible like that any
questions on that okay
yeah that was literal there's a funny
thing about the issue tracker this that
was literally issue number one but when
we did JSF 1.0 1.2 we didn't have the
bean validation framework but we knew it
was coming so this is one of those
people say oh Java EE is so slow well
yes it is but if you're gonna take in
stuff from all over the place and do it
right and have abstractions go to the
right layer you know that's the thing we
we have a huge enterprise thing here and
sure we could define our own solution
invent our own api's and do it ourselves
right that's not the right thing for the
platform now that we have CDI and bean
validation you can use validation all
across the place not just for the for
JSF and this is one of the things that
the web framework Wars made JSF look so
bad because they didn't have any of that
you can call it baggage but I actually
call it doing it doing it right for the
whole platform they can just innovate
and build stuff straight into their
specs and that specs rather their
implementations without having to worry
about other people taking advantage of
it so kind of a tragedy of the commons
type thing all right let's see tighter
CDI integration now this one really was
kind of under the radar but took a fair
amount of work and it doesn't demo so
well because it's like okay yeah this is
how it should work to begin with but I
think Manfred did put some great
examples in here up CDI injection
samples yes he's got few of them okay ah
this is a good way to do it so a
non-exhaustive list of injection target
so we one of the things we did was just
make a ton of stuff more injectable JSF
has all of these objects like you know
the knit parameter the header map
application map basis context you can
just inject them in your
beans very easily so if we looked at
this page I expect we're going to see a
lot of al expressions and then they're
gonna be pointed to beans that are gonna
show us all of those properties inject
okay right oh that I went I did index
sorry yes indeed
so inject being injected artifacts so
let's look at an inject mean right so
you can see here these are all the
things you can now inject and this this
is such a great example because it just
shows everything in one place and it all
is just done with the regular CDI way
you expect it to do and it's putting
some values in here and using the post
construct annotation so let me ask the
audience is anyone still using old
fashioned regular JSF managed beans you
are okay so does CDI seem like something
you would want to move to of course okay
anyone else want to share on that does
this you want to get to CDI eventually
possibly okay
and doing Tomcat yeah right right okay
so David is pointing out a very common
usage pattern for JSF which I'd like to
pull the audience here for who is using
JSF just on straight Tomcat with no
other Java EE stuff right okay so that
just comes from the you know the thing
that's the kind of web framework thing I
was talking about earlier and this is
one of the things that Apache Tommy has
really addressed quite well is it's this
is why I think David Blevins has got a
really good opportunity to make some
great progress here
it's Tomcat but it also has open web
beans and c-d-i stuff baked in so it's a
good option for that anyhow the reason I
point this out is there's a bit of a
learning curve with CVI and one of the
things you have to keep in mind is that
when you get this thing phases context
it's not the actual real phases context
that you could just you know down cast
it to whatever implementation class you
want to know you're gonna be getting a
proxy and they do everything in CDI with
dynamic proxying so you have to accept
that because the the magic secret sauce
with CDI is let's let CDI do all of the
creating of things you don't ever use
operator new in an injection type
framework which is the same thing for
spring spring does the proxy as well
okay and let's see we have let's see we
started at 45 right we started yeah five
minutes okay thanks well that's what I
wanted to know okay well those are all
the features I wanted to get through and
I wanted to save questions so five to
ten minutes
let me put up the sessions of interest
slide current slide and while I take
questions these are some other ones in
particular I want to mention come on
give me over here the portland deep dive
tonight at 5:30 my good friend Vernon
singleton so that one's great these
these are all gonna be awesome sessions
I'm gonna probably try to get to as many
of them I probably get to all try to
push with that so any other open
questions here yes the the clips I think
Jay in contrast to Jay s in contrast to
servlet jsf is like the ideal candidate
for moving forward it's got the active
community there are at least two parties
Liferay and Omni faces that have
expressed interest in taking over and
moving the spec forward so and there
might even be more but for me picking
either of those two parties would be
great because they're already in the
community they already know how to do
the thing they've known them for a long
time and they have an economic interest
in moving it forward to let's let's be
frank Oracle does things for the
economic benefit of its shareholders and
that's a perfectly fine thing for a
public company to do and you know
everyone should remember that but in
order for other stakeholders to do it
they have to have that as well in case
of omni faces you know PR wants to be
successful and do that with and they've
got the right business plan and staffing
for that and the same is for life right
they have a business model that's in
part to large part actually enabled by
JSF so they would like to do that too
so I think it's all very good news from
that front so any other questions you
know
well if what I said my other servo talk
is that servlet is so foundational that
it's going to be a lot more hard to get
all of the existing stakeholders to
continue to play on the same way that
they did with JCP I think I don't know
but it's more of a organizational
challenge than a technological one
although it's a technological one as
well because there's no history of
swapping in different servlet
implementations different containers
it's just like kind of part of the OS
really
whereas for JSF it's always been kind of
pluggable so and I have a great debt of
gratitude to Manfred Guyler and martin
marin chick and all of the guys from
aryan that are the company that's behind
my faces and you know I've known them
for many years and it's been a real
pleasure working with them over the
years as well any other questions
uh-huh
good question if you're using JSF with
spring does it mean you can't upgrade to
2.3 I do think that we have cast our lot
in with CDI so I would think the answer
is probably yes we're kind of really
trying to promote the CDI platform this
is one of the things that I hope the MVC
specification is able to address so that
they're kind of portable as well I don't
know okay if I think Berger out of time
so thank you very much and I really
appreciate your coming to the session
and I wish you all the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
