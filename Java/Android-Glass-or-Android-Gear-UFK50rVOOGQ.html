hell and i work on working mobs and
geeks so today we're going to talk about
android be on hand hills and what I do
is I work primarily on Android and I've
also worked on a lot of different
Android devices so far like mobile these
tablets and we also work on set of boxes
and other other devices which we're
going to talk about we also do a lot of
open source work and how many of you
guys work on Android only 1230 you tried
working on android you have tried
working on android sorry you're a
sparing to work on Android all right so
how many of you have written programs
for devices that or non computers like
you you write web applications you write
desktop applications other than that
you've tried programming for the other
devices like embedded devices okay
mobile so up mobile anyone any other
devices like Arden though Michael Rosa
yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good
answer Michael you have written programs
for microprocessor microcontrollers like
8551 86 okay all right so we ever be
able to do a little bit of work on that
and to talk about our open thurs work we
have worked on some open source projects
those we have published using the apache
license and we have written a library
for validation is called as a no sorry
power and that library is currently
being used by wikipedia is official
android app so
we have quite some opens of experience
for the past two or three years so today
when I'm talking about devices that are
not of handhelds like your typical
phones and tablets what what devices
comes into your mind automobiles yeah
for navigation and all yeah we be used
android for that car see our cars then
household appliances such as television
via TV then fridge then home security
systems then set up boxes then watches
so anything else anything else glasses
glasses so Android is literally getting
everywhere right so added initially it
started as and cam operating system for
camera cameras okay that's how Andy
Rubin wanted the product to be but
considering the market size for camera
phones they squiggly pirated to mobile
devices instead so they came to know
about all the competitors were working
on smartphone operating systems and
Android eventually become a smartphone
operating system so when I talk about
watches what is this what is this
what is this device that you are seeing
on the screen in the samsung gear
Samsung gear anyone tried this was
before no one glad that you didn't so I
was up to this samsung showroom in
chennai and now this was the best
absolutely worst advice I've ever tried
you know if you want two people think
like you know it's like a James one
gadget but you know you'll be completely
disappointed if you buy this one like
it's seven around 2025 and it is not but
but it is a good initiative because
Android being open source sorry yes okay
okay so so happy ugly they are getting
the boys out right so that's why maybe
they did gear the second watch right
they did a second watch it's a really
good initiative because and it being a
very open source operating system people
started to try different things we're
doing it now they for copy and they
tried something that is really different
that is google watch though they didn't
come out very well i think samsung or
rather you have which one okay so whose
watch is that yes okay so this is also a
watch I rest thank God oh it has a
camera too right okay okay so you like
it oh that really sucks okay great so so
it's not just you know the big players
we have a lot of small players who are
doing really good job with android so of
Samsung gear right now they claim that
it's good for using phones for using you
know you can pair it with the phone and
android phone and you can you make calls
in you can also answer calls not good
for driving because you have to keep it
close to you like this when you drive so
it doesn't make a good choice well
during driving and you can also take
photographs or
you know videos if you want to play
James one but what I will I used to say
it to my colleagues that if anyone is
wearing that was I'm going to use a
hammer on that yeah it's really you know
annoying a little bit annoying but it's
it's purely my own views on that my
personal opinions on that and it can
also show you other things like the
temperature and if you have any meals
you can read the at least the subject
matter on it subject of the email and
also reply to SMS s and other messages
text messages it it also uses a voice
input which you know you can make short
replies using thought by talking to the
watch so that's about samsung watch the
samsung gear in what is that it's a
washing machine who made this but who
made this any clues samsung yeah yes am
singh actually something is doing a lot
of things with android so can you
imagine what kind of things you can do
with this you know you can control yeah
you can control the washing machine with
your mobile phone that's that's a good
option what kind of options can you what
kind of things can you do with that stop
it and run it good thing to play with
kids so what does all else can you do
with this exit taking the clots out okay
so it allows you to set water levels and
temperature of your water you can also
set profiles based on the fabric that
you're washing like is denim is it
cotton clothes or is it synthetic
clothes things like that or is it heavy
blankets and you can also check for
detergent levels and you can also set
the RPM of the you know the drums spin
rate and most of them do we don't we are
not concerned about most of the features
right again so maybe maybe we we are at
the beginning of an error
all your home appliances could interact
along with your home and you know really
build a home really smart home or smart
network of all your appliances like so
what is this what is this fridge so uh
who made this yeah samsung on together
all right so what do I put on the screen
you're going to say sounds like is it so
so what what do you what can you do with
this refrigerators make things cool
that's what you do with refrigerators
right what else what else do you do with
a fridge that is powered with Android
identify the number of things you have
yes yeah order stuff automatically for
you okay that's that's a really nice
feature but I don't think this supports
that feature but maybe in the next
version so what kind of addiction are we
talking about here okay
okay so you get one new message and you
go and look at this screen on your
refrigerator okay okay so is it going to
be good thing or a bad thing mental at
least I don't think you can take selfies
with this refrigerator so what else what
else can you do with his refrigerator
any any useful apps that you can think
about okay okay that's that's definitely
good use case you know you get any box
of chocolates then you your mom bought
you some chocolates right okay that's
that's a good thing what else sorry
recipes yeah it's good for recipes you
know okay so all right all right things
like that yeah right what okay so how
many bad how many eggs you have and how
many bottles of milk you've got in your
refrigerator things like that okay then
they'll start showing a batch that go by
butter from the new of the place that is
nearby right things like that right
right good good use cases so you can
also run common applications like
Evernote and you can also have other
recipe applications all recipes all the
cook things like that so your mom can
start watching the screen and cook new
recipes for you is that going to happen
and pushbullet you know there is an app
called as pushbullet where you could
enter a list of items in case if you are
missing some items or if something
things are running out of your stock you
can enter all those things and then the
Aspen is out right just in the push
notification and you get the list right
down to his mobile phone right things
like that so that is one use case
because it is also able to run
traditional and wraps unlike the watch
and washing machine we were talking
about right
so what is this smart TV what what can
you do with this it was anyone seen the
ad for this TV no no okay now go and
search for it on youtube it's running on
your home so you do this you do not do
that this this that you do this it is
not touch now you know a gesture based
right you do not that so you have a
smart TV okay you are not aware of the
of the volume control or you're not
aware of changing the channels using
gestures waving your hands you don't do
that you're not aware of that okay go
try it at home today right you're not
probably used to is it by a min tho is
it by winner you know your TV is by ova
know you have to do this all from here
it's not set of like that right okay
that's a good thing so what was good
about a smart TV
yes yeah you can treat white walls in TV
yeah this semin is going to score a
hundred right or this show is not good
things like that so what else can you do
using a smart TV okay so you want to buy
products while watching TV okay so
you're going to you're not going to
procrastinate you're going to do it
right then in there right away right
okay ah what else what else can you do
with smart TV okay so you can also
access internet things like that use
Facebook all those ordinary things and
the good one good thing about the Smart
TV is if you have ever program for
android you know there is this thing
called as device independent pixels you
know we have a lot of difference devices
with different screen sizes with
different resolutions and densities so
whenever you try to design something for
Android you'll have to do it in a more
prudential manner so that it looks the
same on each and every advice what
Google has done with the Smart TV is you
take your phone right you have it right
in front of you and you place a smart TV
10 feet of a far away from you right the
same the UI on the phone and the TV will
look similar got it so if you designing
an app for a television right it is
almost like doing this doing it for your
tell it what you say your mobile phone
or your tablet so that is one a really
good thing that
you
setup box yeah it's a setup box so come
on tell me what what do you think about
Isetta box what can you do with the
setup box we have programmed the four
set of boxes also Android set of boxes
change channels subscribe for channels
then download movies which is which is
then okay so what else can you do with
set of boxes what Stevie's show you
things like that okay what shape your
recordings yeah you can do that and a
lot of small players when this in the
setup box market now it doesn't have to
be Samsung Apple or Google there are a
lot of lots and lots of players who are
manufacturing boxes set of boxes I have
the same box with me I think yeah so
there are a lot of Chinese manufacturers
who are rolling out a lot of setup boxes
for different uses for different
customized to different needs also so
what is this
you haven't seen this yeah these are
your desk phone a typical desk form and
can anyone guess what this phone is
called or what the development kit of
this phone is called what no this this
product was launched some three or four
years ago and we were able to work on
this and we were doing some testing for
these guys each call as the glass SDK
it's called as the class STK now this is
a completely different product it's from
a company called as cloud TC okay this
is a really old product and it contained
Android versions 2.1 and 2.2 I think
it's a pretty old now initiative long
before long before Google glass was in
vicinity the SDK still call this class
is too gay but it's completely different
from what Google is doing so what can
you do with this desk phone typically
use cases what prank calls prank calls
what else video conferencing then think
of it yeah you could do credit card you
think of it as a phone on in the
reception what else can you do with this
you can you can confirm reception sorry
appointments right you can take notes
things like that so oh there are lot of
other use cases also and what is this
your phone it's yeah it's it's a yeah
it's a smart class it's called as m100
and this it it is unlike glass actually
glass overlays its display over your
field of vision right you're looking at
something they many turn on glass it is
right it always your field of vision
right but this doesn't do that it is
placed right below your cheekbone and
it's just like a display it shows you a
display they call it a smart glass but
it just gives you a 3 22 to 40 size
screen it places the screen in front of
you and they are a few use cases for
this device and most currently
consulting a client on this product so
it is also a glass and there are other
devices that I have not mentioned here
okay apart there are a few devices that
have not mentioned here like gaming
consoles right there I think even Sony
came out with the gaming console using
based on Android and there are also
other devices like music players mp3
players that are based on Android right
in what is this
it looks like a motherboard okay
Ethernet USB and audio jacks is anyone
reading the title on top now so what is
it in a single good computer SBC right
so what can you do with raspberry pi you
saw the demo so why what took you guys
so long so it says bzn you have images i
already made this for a raspberry pi as
well okay and when it comes to home
automation to know raspberry pi comes
into the plate you know you can install
whatever you want any enable the next
destroys or if you want you can install
android and it depends upon the comfort
level of your family familiarity with
the platform and you know you can use
this as a master and you can have our de
no boats or add our dinner
microcontrollers and different rooms and
you can route the inputs like you know
you have a infrared proxy or you have
you no other light detectors or motion
detectors you can connect them via the
arden about to your Raspberry Pi using
an ether ethernet cable yeah so the yeah
yeah you can do it there are lots of
possibilities when it comes to home
automation the different device
different platforms that are available
that you could use to build really do it
yourself home automation systems you
don't have to buy something from the
market right so these are some of the
initiatives that other people have taken
to you mean use Android in different
ways you know very innovative manners
and we have seen a lot of different use
cases in some of them or mere
initiatives but you know it's just a
start and
we know things are changing very quickly
in as we speak right a lot of peoples
are the lot of people are doing a lot of
things and when it comes to android
devices know all the android devices are
all the same you know the debug bridge
is the same so it doesn't matter that
you're working on a glass or on a
variable computer or you are very
working on a setup box or if you are
working on a camera or gaming console
whatever be that the debugging process
is almost the same right it's almost the
same so what you do is initially you
have obviously you have to connect your
device to your laptop if you if it has
an user interface USB interface
sometimes in cases like set of boxes you
may not have a USB fourth so in that
case you know there is a way to
disassemble the box and you usually get
a compote you can connect a calm to USB
converter and you can connect it to your
pc and use it for debugging so the first
thing we have to do is to go to settings
in developer options then you have to
enable the debug mode on your android
device could be any device and once
you're done with that you have to check
if all the drivers corresponding drivers
are installed because drivers are very
essential if it is plug-and-play you
don't have any problems but if it is not
a plug-and-play device then you'll have
to get the appropriate drivers install
to get it working and now there is if
you are using Ubuntu there is a 51
hyphen android rules file where you have
to enter the USB mentor vendor ID okay
and even if you do all these basic setup
you know there are times where certain
devices will not be detected by your pc
or your macintosh or any any development
device that you use for that matter so
in that case what you have to do is to
get the USB HID I the thing is you have
the drivers install you have the
debugging mode enabled you have your
device connected to your development
machine and the next thing you have to
and still if your device is not detected
and still if your device is not detected
you have to find the USB vendor ID on
the Macintosh you can do it through the
system preferences where you can go and
check your USB devices list of USB
devices and get the vendor ID for your
device that you are using for
development and in minutes you can do
the same by using a device manager go to
Device Manager and then from the list of
other devices find your device the
appropriate Android device and gets get
the member ID it the variety is
highlighted here but I don't think that
is visible you have this be an
underscore and a four-digit hexadecimal
code that is the vendor ID so once you
get the vendor ID you go and edit the
adb underscore USB dot ini which is
present inside the dot android folder of
your user folder right on any machine
it's inside your user folder and in
every line you have each line can have
only one banner ID so if you are using
different devices that are not supported
or that are not detected by a DB he'll
have to enter one man ready per line and
then you have to restart your ad be now
if you're a DB is in the path the
Android debug bridge if so added debug
bridges allows you to issue and receive
debug commands to your device ok that's
the primary way of communicating with
your device during development so you
have to kill the ad server restart it
and if you do a DP devices if you have
properly followed all the previous
instructions your device will be visible
got it so you don't have to be afraid if
you're going to develop for the m100 or
if you want to develop for google glass
or watch for that matter so when you're
developing for those machines you know
this step these steps are these steps
will help you get started ok and so far
we have seen about about the initiatives
other companies and other individuals of
me I have done to take Android beyond
handheld devices and now we're going to
say look into two initiatives through
initiative that Google itself has come
through right what what are to initiate
what are those initiatives any any cases
google itself has for android two
different aren t they do a lot of things
in R&amp;amp;D what what is publicly known
google yeah google glass it runs on
android so it turns on a folk version of
android so what is the other initiative
google has taken and ended we're sorry
yeah home automation they have this ad k
thing right where you can connect arden
oh IDK with your way I your USB yeah so
i'm not sure if they have fork Android
for that but that is a home automation
was a initiative that was taken like 23
years ago mega i think it's odd in omega
IDK that was the first device from
already know i think the boat from our
do anything so what is the other
initiative android watch what is it
actually called Android wear Y and we're
okay has anyone develop for android /
glass yes the way anyone what sorry
I I develop apps or class yeah okay so
we don't have the device actually we do
it by a team Bieber and we also do it by
one more thing you know there is only
one device that my client actually owns
he's in the US and one thing we do is we
do a development we a team we were right
he plugs the device onto his machine and
I get a remote to his machine I remote
access to his machine and I develop the
thing and the other way we do it is you
know it's somewhat quirky there is
something called a papal trial has
anyone used paper trail it is logger
pinder paper trial ok it you know it
looks for it you can write logs to paper
trail right so what we do here is we
have a syslog appender ok it is usually
a it's a lot we have log back lafurgey
and we have a syslog appended what it
does is it starts writing logs to paper
trail com right and when our client is
using the device with the google glass i
know we get log messages on our screen
life so that's the baby or currently
debugging glass app so now we don't have
direct access to class so yeah you can
ask him to get in touch so now we will
be learning but we'll be able to help
out each other right so what is glass
what does it do any any videos or any
ideas about class no ok so Oh glass
looks like that you know most of you
would have seen that I don't have a
device actually to show you how it looks
so this is the anatomy of glass right ok
I don't think this diagram is totally
accurate so this is the camera all right
and here you have something called as a
prism which is actually a display that
is around 300 sorry
320 into 260 you know 320 x width and
260 by height so that's the resolution
of the prism that is here display that
is here and this actually does not have
a GPS okay the GPS location services are
availed from your android phone or your
iOS phone right or your iphone any
device that is paired it does not have a
built-in GPS ok the CPU is actually
present here and you have microphones
you have microphones and then this is
not actually a speaker it is actually a
interface for your earphone ok there is
a in micro USB interface for your
earphone and what you see here it has a
battery and it also has a bone
conduction transducer it's called anyone
has heard of bone conduction transducer
is not actually a new technology so what
happens is when you are using glass with
speakers maybe if you're using
headphones it is a bit distracting you
know you will not be able to listen to
ambient noise things are not surrounding
you got it so a bone conduction
transducer it sits right behind you a
year right and transmit sounds through
your bone into your ear drum okay so
that way you will be able to hear the
conversation via the app that is
happening via glass as well as the
surrounding noise got it so this device
is actually the they have released
something called as an explorer edition
and it costs somewhere on thirteen
hundred dollars okay and it is available
for public purchase in the US so if you
are in the US you could buy directly
from Google what Google has plans to
release this device by next year for
affordable price what they say that's
somewhere around four ninety nine
dollars right and also they have done
some really good job with the camera
because you know when someone is wearing
glass you know you get this weird
feeling like me you know someone wearing
a android watch and I start looking out
for hammers right you don't like you
know people flew me filming at you when
you're talking at
so what Google has done is they have a
light okay the light recording light so
whenever the camera is on you could see
you will know that someone is recording
you okay that's not the genius part the
thing is if someone tries to hide the
light you know why using a paint or he
tries to conceal the light I mean they
led the camera won't start ok that's a
harbour feature and that cannot be
tampered either via software or be a
hardware ok that's one thing but we
don't know until someone really tampers
with it right so one thing when you're
writing when we are talking about
programming for android you know when
you're writing programs for android
there are certain constraints like you
still have the same set of api's you
have access to the same set of AP ice
but there are certain constraints like
when you have a tablet right when you
for example let's take a TV this screen
layout is massive right the real estate
on this TV is very massive and you can
show any number of info any any amount
of information that you want to show to
your user got it and when it comes to
tablets you can still show a lot of
information to your user but not as much
as you can show it to them on a smart
television correct and when you're using
a phone the phone has a again it has a
smaller screen size so what happens
there are the number of things that you
can do with your phone is actually a
little bit limited right and when it
comes to glass the UI is really really
sleep very small right it's somewhere
around 320 into 260 it's really small
for you know doing a lot of things so
the size of the screen itself
constraints the amount of things that
you could do with class provided you
still have access to the same set of
api's you know you can only and also the
ways of interacting with the UI is also
limited right and the side the the rim
right the side area
where your CPU is hosted it also has a
track pad which allows you to navigate
through Oh applications the glass
applications right and there are also a
limited set of guest shows that you can
do to interact with the device itself
it's not like running your hands all
over the screen to do things you want so
in order to make it efficient now you
have to really think through a lot of
things and do only things that matter
most to the users okay so that is kind
of challenging when you're programming
for glass and the UI should also be very
consistent and supportive to the
developer okay and that is where google
has come out with the notion of I say
the glass team at Google they have come
out with the notion called as cards okay
so they they have something called as a
car where you could show a limited
pieces of information like primary text
secondary text and an image or primary
sec text secondary text tertiary text
that's it right things like that and
this notion of cod is not a new thing
because how many of you have android
phones here how many of you have been
using android phones for a really long
time like like 2009-2010 okay so have
you seen the older play store
application yes do you remember how it
used to look like okay so how many of
you use placed the Play Store you use
play store okay how many of you use the
music player that is play music okay you
use play music and how many of you use
playbooks now apply movies okay you play
use play movies do they look the same
the newer version not the old one new
version they do they look the same yeah
yeah they look similar only the color is
different you know you have orange for
music player and the play is some
Green plays green and Brooks is blue so
only the color of the theme is different
but the way items are presented or the
same got it you go to the Play Store you
have an app the app is placed inside a
card it has the product icon it also has
the name description price right you go
to the you go to play books you have the
book you have the you know name of the
book and author of the book and the
price of the book and then you go to
play movies you have the poster movies
poster you have so they started using
cards because it is one of the most
efficient way to display any kind of
product all right so Android and Anna
and this triad this UI pattern has been
working very well so and the Google guys
the glass guys have adopted the same for
other devices as well like the Google
glass and as well as Android wear which
we are going to talk about so this is
how a car looks like you know it has
very essential absolutely essential
pieces of information nothing more
nothing less ok and then Android you
have a home screen and Google glass has
something called as a timeline right and
the timeline is not much different from
the home screen in in terms of physical
appearance you can you will be able to
swipe left and right through your home
screen and on Android and in timeline
you'll be able to do the same but a
timeline as you know whenever you start
glass you're brought to a home screen
where you where there is a clock ok n to
the right side you have the past events
ok events of the past and on to the left
side you have the present as well as the
future events right if you have
scheduled an alarm it'll appear to the
left of your timeline got it and if one
of your friends has posted a photograph
or status update that will appear to the
right side of the timeline and you can
navigate if you do this you know if you
not get forward you will be taken to
your history and if you navigate
backwards you will be taken to the
future like the future right it's like
pushing the cards older cards in the
front or pull
new cards to the back right so this is a
timeline where this is the this is kind
of the home screen and you can insert
cards timeline cards using the glass SDK
or you can you go you can also use a
mirror API mirror API is something
google offers you to create applications
and deploy them to the cloud okay and
the glass is sticky or the GDK is based
on the android sdk as you can use use it
to write native applications correct so
these are different kinds of card
flavors the first one is only a text
only card there's only text and the
second one is a full bleed image card
where you can have an image as a
background and you can have text on it
and the last one is a muscly card where
you can have mosaic of images to the
left right or the top and you can also
have a text along it along with the card
in whatever you see here is we have a
maximum of two lines of text nothing
more than that a primary text and the
secondary text okay here most of the
thing is the primary text you have the
subject and as the second index you have
the you know maybe the time or anything
that is second that takes the second
priority okay so this is some code I
don't think you can see this code ok
this is this shows you how to
instantiate in the card the card is
equal to new card and you said the text
set foot text ends you set a footnote
you get a card view and then you can
insert it to a timeline or if you are
running a full-scale application you get
you know insert it to your cart scroll
view where you can scroll cards and
there is something called as a live card
where you know cards or stat can be
static or they could be live cards a
static card does not change any
information at all ok and if you have a
card whose information frequently
changes you know like a scorecard of a
cricket game that you are interested in
or if it is a time or
or come if it is a countdown timer or it
is a clock I know you have to keep
constantly keep keep on updating it so
for those cases you could use a live
card live cards or like widgets on your
android phone the home screen widgets
that you place on your android phone
they have a remote service or a process
that keeps on updating them from the
background ok so you can use lifeguards
you could use study cards and one
primary one way of you know interacting
with glasses by using voice ok so when
you say ok glass ok class is like a
standby command for your last when you
say ok glass your device becomes standby
and if you want to say something like
take a picture ok kick off a camera
application for you or if you want to
record a video it kicks off a
application for you and if you if you
have your own application that does
something specific like you know it
reads a book for you you could say ok
card read a book and that will activate
your spawning application all right and
you can also get wise up a voice input
like you know I want to go to ok glass
book a ticket for example ok glass book
a book but book a bus ticket ok so you
can also get inputs from glass right so
ok glass book a bus ticket prepares your
glass to you know book ticket and a
glass in turn will ask you where are you
going right then you could say your
destination so you could use voice
inputs to just activate your application
or you could also use voice commands to
get further inputs using class so it's a
trigger i'll update this so this is how
you map a trigger to your application ok
these are all small code chunks i'll be
able to post this online so you could
get this so sorry so there is the
resolution 614 to 360 I was wrong so
whenever you design your application for
a glass you know you don't have if you
have an Android application we are
tempted to put the same Android activity
two glass you shouldn't do that because
they are used in different
is in the way of interacting with a
mobile application and the glass of
glassware is entirely different right so
you have to redesign your UI and you
shouldn't have any complex touch
gestures or controls to interact with
your applications because the only way
you're going to interact using touches
your trackpad on the sides right so the
amount of guesses are very very limited
so these are some of the guidelines that
you do in the last one is Android wear
so Android wear is you know it's a watch
that is currently being developed by
Google and it's up it's only allowed
invite only you know you have to be
invited in order to join the preview
program and most of them gets invited
once you get invited you will be given a
set of steps to follow in order to test
your you know applications on the
Android bear emulator okay so what you
can do currently with Android wear is
very very limited you can only show
notifications on your watch that's
that's the only thing you can do android
wear it is not support traditional
Android application but still it is
based on Android so the only thing you
can do now is you know you can notify
your user using notifications so you
should be familiar with these
notifications on right so you can do the
same with your watch nothing more
nothing less and there are two skins it
could be either way around or you could
have a know where that is square and if
you want to show notifications you can
either use stacks stacks or where you
one notification stacked against the
other you tap on the more and you can
look at them one by one swipe through
and look at them and the other thing is
pages where you could have at most two
pages where you could scroll slide it to
the left and see more information on the
notification so this is a code that
shows you how to show notifications this
is not much different from the same
notification compatibility
you use a notification compat builder to
build notifications for Android you use
the same code to build notifications for
your device also and at last you can
also act interact with your
notifications like if you have an
Android phone that runs android 4.4
shins when you get an email for instance
you know you can drag the notification
and you could either tap on reply or we
could interact with your notification
directly from the no defect in itself so
that is also available with added where
okay you can also interact with your
notifications so this code shows you how
to interact with the notification and
the other way you could interact with
your underwear is by using voice okay
voice has become a standard way of
giving interacting with Google devices
your phone you're you know unaware as
well as Google glass so oh that's about
it and do you have any questions any of
you
no one any information about project ara
so project ara I'm not actively
following the project the only news I
heard was that you know they broke the
screen of the class the day before the
presentation it is there was one
initiative called as phonebloks I think
I I was I heard that a now maybe a year
ago phonebloks was just a concept and
not much I am not even sure if it is
being powered by Android but most
probably yeah yeah okay okay okay so but
this device was shipped from a German
facility you don't know that another
thing is all the project ara modules are
going to be 3d printer at the commercial
scale okay ho age in every module that
is going to be produced is going to be
3d printer okay not like a normal man
fracturing here for manufacturing it's
going to be really 3d printer they are
prayer developing a special unit for 3d
printing all these mobile phones okay so
i'm not actually actively following that
project oh thank you anything else so
okay nice thank you thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
