alright so welcome to the jug ice Knight
hacking event so we have a whole bunch
of Icelanders here and our user group
leader yeah hi so you want to you want
to do introduction for the group any
announcements or no not really it's ok
let's just do this you're we're all
right so we're before we get started
let's let's let's do some introductions
of folks here because we want to find
out what you do so can you turn on the
lights for a sec so you've slightly
better legs and around yeah hey ask you
ok and so the way this works is
everything's being live streamed over
the internet on ustream I have a show
page at night hacking calm with all the
information we're going to do I'm going
to do a short presentation and then
we'll do a lab with some pies I broad or
pies that you have for the presentation
will have the camera on me so people can
see what I'm doing for the lab one of
you guys can be volunteer to be the
camera the recorded lab group that way
people don't get confused with a random
shot of a whole bunch of people so we'll
take one group and then I'll focus on
helping people actually get the lab
working rather than talking on the
street so we're both mics they can hear
us yeah I think so and this microphone
all I'm gated in a sec oh there you go
it's actually working this microphone is
the way that you guys can be on the live
stream so we'll pass this around so you
can introduce yourselves alright so once
you start just you know your name and
maybe what company you work for
something interesting or doing at Java
ok my name is Rennick hoop net I work
for host man I'm a drug leader here
obviously yeah I work with the Java all
day
nothing really fancy but I like it so
anything else no I think I think that's
it someone else hello my name is Willie
oh yeah yeah alright god yeah i work as
a developer at one year working with
yahwah but I don't have a Raspberry Pi
with me but I've been joining guys over
here yeah and we have we have some okay
very good hello my name is sicky I work
at the Vodafone Iceland and working with
java they're mostly spring some pack and
stuff go my name is sunny I work at at
vania the Oracle group and mostly using
google ATF recently but i've been using
java swing and and jsps won last year's
okay it's your experience java hacker
yeah hi my name is Kirsten I work at
decode genetics we use in jail there but
I'm mostly interested in raspberry pi
and see how gel works on a little
platter cool hi my name is Edgar I were
catatonia I'm not very much in Java now
at work and usually in.net but I really
liked each other so that's why I'm here
okay Sierra former java maybe in the
future java hacker hi my name is third I
work for decode genetics I've been stuck
with Java for 15 years now Wow
my name is are gonna work with Dakota
nika's as well folder named st.
department and have been working with
Java for 15 years as well and just
recently getting introduced to raspberry
pi so only interested in that fall for
this bacteria tonight hi my name is
Gordon like these guys I'm work out tnx
and then using Java for 15 years so you
guys all start with the Java 10 release
yeah so back in the back in those days
for performance issues and libraries
were painful to use and yeah I was doing
work at the University back then and we
had to write you're working on ide and
we had to write all our graphics from
scratch to get the performance we needed
all right my name is multimers and work
at what omniscient like shaky and
actually same stuff java screen
bacchante shorter Joe my name is Dan I
work for Parliament of Iceland I work in
Java front-end back-end docking creation
chamber operations and all that in
previous life I used to be more involved
into mobile devices
I'm my name is Bala Kamla corn and the
CEO of green cloud so we actually run
CloudStack alright so moving on I'm
emails together I think yeah so we have
a lot of lot of our developers are
working on Java i started in java wonder
so i'm a closet geek now i don't get too
good much and and i get to do a lot of
xml perfect so so I thought I'll kind of
connect back by coming to this meeting
and connecting to the Java user group
it's been I don't know 10 years since i
coded so I'm gonna be observing can you
watch out yeah perfect thanks yeah hi my
name is jakub I work for an insurance
company called freaking understand and
i'm working with java doing web
development mostly okay i gotta flip the
camera around so i don't break my wires
yeah hi guys my name and I'm like new to
java I'm interesting about the other
Java like a year ago started doing gel
like a year ago and I'm just mostly
doing this wing application with jdbc
connection to some databases oh yeah hi
my name is august i work for a company
called constant research we work on on
big data and analytics and we use javafx
for the for the UI and teleport for
everything else i've been programming
for 31 years and been using java for 13
years now oh that's the sky speechify
tail yeah there was some other language
this earlier but yeah
my name is Ashley I work out six million
using Java to make web packets mostly go
hi I'm kilometers and I basically i work
at Roxburgh and basically to the same
job as a yes we were together in our
team doing back-end programming for
websites oh all right we must anyone I
think we got it wrong let me get this
you mind helping me out by sitting down
so I can get the right on here yeah yeah
all right let's get this way yeah
perfect all right thanks no that's fine
all right so um i'm going to give you
guys a presentation but before that
let's let some check and say hi to some
of the folks who are online on the
stream i'm going to swap and it's a
little weird at first but it'll get
better yeah so that was double feedback
audio and video feedback but now i can
show you guys the chat window
alright so these are these are some of
the folks we have online for folks who
are watching the stream live we have a
new feature this time so there's now a
in addition to the social stream where
you can send messages on Twitter
Facebook and they'll show up in this
panel you can also join chat and
register yourself so we know who's on
the stream so this is the best way to be
a heckler you can and you guys can also
join the stream when I'm traveling
around to the rest of the Nordic
companies countries register pop your
name on there so we know who you are and
then feel free to say annoying things in
the background and chat with folks about
all the things which I'm doing wrong
alright so we have a few folks on here
Jonathan Giles Jonathan Giles is the
altitude his introduction he's the
controls controls guru he works in the
JavaFX controls team and out of New
Zealand and he's come to Java one and
presented a few times NBD guru I think
that's been rhymers I'm pretty sure
that's been he's a NetBeans dream team
member and then Matt cars Matias the J
focus yeah no no feedback my car is
Matthias he's the J focus organizer
Stockholm jug leader and he actually is
the man behind the store he helped me
organize everything get in contact with
different user groups and arrange it so
you can thank Matthias for having me out
here and DLO burger I should I should
probably know but if you if you want to
you can introduce yourself on the street
phila burger and that way I'll know I'll
know how to introduce you next time all
right and then anyone else who's who's
on the stream make sure that you
actually register yourself as a viewer
we have a bunch of guests and I can't
announce guests because they don't have
names so register yourself on Ustream
and then you'll show up and we can chat
and feel free to chat in the background
while we're looking at stuff and
presenting
alright so let's see if we can get the
presentation working
I think it'll be okay for this part test
test okay adios to over all right so is
that good it can everyone see the
presentation okay so i'm going to show
you guys a little bit about how to do
raspberry pi hacking so I didn't really
increase myself I'm Steven Chen I'm a
job evangelist working for oracle and
you can reach me on twitter at Steven Jo
my blog is Steve on Java calm my email
steve on java gmail so you know there's
a trend I'm easy to uneasy to get a hold
of and i'm going to show you guys how
you can do hacking and development this
guy the raspberry pi we have a few of
these for you guys to test out with this
lab so we'll do a short lab after I show
you guys how to use the raspberry PI's
and our goal is going to be to build
some sample javafx applications that run
on the Raspberry Pi so you guys will get
a chance to to build applications and
compete with each other for first-team
or great prizes that ranier has do you
have any great prizes or giveaways yeah
okay yeah so everyone everyone will get
giveaways no no though hold on i'll do a
ruffle well what contest for the
projects yeah okay yeah I have some
spare t-shirts for winning
general license intelligent license yeah
I have IntelliJ license and jailable
will be used for this okay so first a
little bit about job FX how many of you
guys have have tried JavaFX stupid
animal development with it okay some you
guys experimented with it the latest
version of javafx javafx to is quite a
bit different from the early versions of
java effects if you tried those out it's
now a entirely java base you can write
all of your applications with pure java
code and you can take advantage of
accelerated graphics pipeline javafx is
built on top of what the team calls
prism which is a OpenGL or direct3d
accelerated pipeline so on the desktop
platform you're working on you can get
higher performance 2d graphics because
it'll take advantage of graphics
elevation and do some 3d transformations
and effects with your application you
can also integrate other technologies
like JavaScript and html5 using the web
you so you can drop that into your
JavaFX application if if you're a swing
developer this is something you probably
wanted for years and there were some
third-party solutions that weren't very
good but now it's a supported part of
the platform and it actually uses webkit
as the underlying technology so it has a
similar browser experience too if you
were using Chrome or Safari and then
there's lots of libraries for controls
charting video animation and it's quite
a nice you'll get a feel for this when
you do some programming yourself but
it's quite a nice language for
developing and compared to some other
technologies all right so how do you get
javafx so this used to actually be like
a slide full of bullet points with
complicated instructions but now it's
just one step download Java 7 if you're
running java 7 it has javafx
with it the JDK has the full tool suite
java the jerry has just the runtime and
it's now supported on windows macintosh
and linux so you can run that in a
desktop platform so that's easy right
but how many of you guys now that you
know it comes with java 7 how many
people have java set job effects on
their computer computers all right
almost almost everyone very good all
right and then how to develop javafx so
this used to be more complicated with
javafx 13 with its own language and its
own tooling but now that's just Java you
can use your ID of choice so any any
IntelliJ fans who looks intelligent ok
whew 34 how about eclipse okay we got a
large eclipse 67 people and about
netbeans all right so three or four
people for netbeans as well so what
other ideas do you guys use not everyone
raised their hand any one of the
favorite ID jdeveloper ok so actually it
works on jdeveloper so you're set anyone
else all right cool at any VI or emacs
hackers just haven't picked up an IDE
all right so this is a really simple
Java flex application Oh earthrise and
let me let me show you guys just to give
you a flavor of what javafx code looks
like okay that didn't work hold on a sec
I think I know why yeah I know why
okay now we're back yeah so so I learned
something new wire casts external
display support is not compatible with
Macintosh spaces all right so this this
is probably not what you guys want to
see I've been hacking on the visage
compiler let's close let's close this
project we can do compiler hacking later
too if anyone wants to let this one go
earthrise gives us a nice error
the same platform let's try yeah
so sometimes when you have really old
projects which you haven't opens with
netbeans recently the project settings
get a little messed up this stuff
doesn't work but this is a good chance
to show you guys how to create javafx
project from scratch alright so if
you're in that paints and you want to
create your own Java flex project and
you guys will be doing this for the
Raspberry Pi development if you choose
file new project you get an application
wizard you can choose the javafx
application I'm going to use that for
the first example an F XML application
this is what I'm going to recommend you
guys try out together with seen builder
seen builders a graphical tool for
javafx so we'll we'll create a second
project using as an F XML application
and you've seen builder to build it
which is a visual tool but let's just do
it in straight java code to start with
attempting to create a default javafx
platform oh I know it's wrong okay so
when I was compiler hacking earlier I
decided to have fun playing with the
installed jvms there's this little side
there's a new feature with Macintosh JD
case where they now support
drag-and-drop installation on
installation of different jdk versions
so if you want to upgrade and get java 7
you can just drag and drop to your
virtual machines and now we should have
java 7 support
alright so let's give this another try
then
ooh
all right that's the DevOps version that
was filling around with so basically
what this applications showing you is
it's a background image this gets loaded
and then it Scrolls some text up and
then it does a clip on the text so the
text is clipped to a certain region and
i did a debauch steamed version of this
as well so that's what we're looking at
here all right so this you know this is
okay it's it's a little bit shaky on
screen here because the encoding but if
you look at my laptop screen it's
perfectly smooth that's just a you're
seeing the outfit of the video encoding
for the live stream but i'll show you
the code and then we can make this even
better let me just check which version
of it we were running okay hello devix
main perspective
alright so is that font egregiously
large
so this is pretty much boilerplate down
to here for every JavaFX application you
want to extend the application class
that's the base class for all JavaFX
applications implements a main method
which is the entry point for your
application the main method you just
call start or launch and then pass in
the arguments that will kick off the
JavaFX application threat and it will
call you back with lifecycle methods for
start and end and some other things you
can override in this case I've over in
the start method and it gives me a stage
which is the window and then we can do
things to like create a text string with
our message in it so that's the text
which was scrolling up that you guys saw
you can build your job FX nodes this is
building a text node you can build these
either using normal constructors just
like you wouldn't swing or builders this
is showing the Builder syntax so the way
builders work in javafx is you every
class has a corresponding builder so
text as a text builder if you're
creating a layout like H box there's an
H box builder and the Builder classes
have a create method on them at the
static method and then you can chain a
bunch of methods to set properties and
then when you call the build method that
will return object of the type the
builders for so return a text node so if
you're sending a bunch of properties
rather than calling you know set cash
that layout why said text origin using
the Builder can make your code a little
bit more readable but you could you
could equally do this the the java swing
way which would just be new text and
then you know do set set set
etc so you could do set set set set set
instead of using the Builder so they're
equivalent JavaFX also has a bunch of
built-in animations so i'm using a
translate transition here which will
just translate the text up over a
duration of 75 seconds all of the
builders and the methods and java
effects are strongly typed so for
example rather than asking you to just
pass in an integer number of
milliseconds there's a duration class in
javafx and you can specify seconds or
minutes or hours which is a little bit
nicer and then this this part actually
creates the scene so this constructs the
scene loads the image from the classpath
adds in some effects and rectangles and
where's our clip clip clip clip here's
the clip which clips the text to a
certain bounding box so pretty
straightforward stuff and then finally
just setting the scene and showing it so
make this a little bit more interesting
i'm going to uncomment a couple of lines
here so i was experimenting with the
perspective transform effect you can
apply different effects on your nodes in
the scene graph just by calling effect
on any known the scene graph and every
note below that has that transformation
or effect applied so there's like glow
effects and drop shadows and different
visual effects you can apply but let's
let's try this one out and see what
happens
all right now we have Star Wars esque
perspective transform on me on the text
just you have a different effect alright
so this is just a small sample of what
you can do with javafx you can do a lot
more with you know control libraries and
using different components and layouts
and building more complicated systems
but it's fairly easy to build small
applications and do things without a lot
of knowledge you can get started very
quickly so hopefully we'll we'll get you
guys programming some cool applications
today as well let's see how folks are
doing on the stream so how are things
for for our folks on the stream let me
know in the chat and we'll adjust things
if you chat back
Oh Russell joined the stream too so
Russell Russell winder is a groovy
expert and also a conference speaker and
he's um he loves out and you get in the
UK all right so
let's talk a little bit about different
embedded boards so I have a few
different devices here so we've got
what's this guy pandaboard we've got a
Raspberry Pi and I'm another surprise to
work my own bag and up no here it is say
I want to take a guess with this um what
this board is this is a tile board and
it's it's running it's also running an
ARM processor but i think it's running
with a call them cortex cortex ms I
forget exactly but it's a slightly lower
powered ship than what's in the
raspberry PI's and the panda boards but
it gives you an idea of different
different embedded platforms that Java
runs on and the comparison here is in
the power of these devices so if you
look at the panda board the panda board
and this is a picture of the vehicle
board these are both boards which are
primarily designed for developers to
test out applications that they're going
to use an embedded devices so it has a
lot of expansion ports headers for
hooking up LCD panels serial outputs
that you can do low-level debugging on
this and this is if you were developing
mobile app or small embedded
applications with the ARM chips this is
probably what you'd be using it actually
is a similar ARM processor to the
Raspberry Pi it has a arm v7 I believe
it's a quad-core processor but the
graphics hard run this isn't quite as
good as the I say that the graphics card
or and this is good the BeagleBoard
graphics isn't quite
good as the Raspberry Pi although I in
my experience these boards are quite a
bit harder to set up and develop with
because it's not as easy to get the
right drivers and distributions and
everything set up the Raspberry Pi is
similar except it was actually created
to be a general computing platform for
kids and folks to start learning
programming on so it can be used for the
same purposes as these boards for
developing applications but it actually
in itself can be used as a small
computer a lot of people use it for Home
Media Center's but the the basic idea
with these embedded chips is you can
develop on boards like this but then the
chip itself is really tiny and you can
embed that in small devices and the
Raspberry Pi itself is I believe
twenty-five or thirty five dollars us
but the chips are extremely cheap to
mass produce and use and devices so if
you can create a cool application then
you can mass produce an embedded
platform that takes advantage of it and
the Kyle board takes it even a step
further it's an even lower powered
processor that's less expensive to
produce it doesn't run full java SE both
of these boards you can run a full java
SE distribution because they have quite
a bit of RAM on them the Kyle board has
less Ram less processing power a lot
less graphics power but you can run Java
ME and you can build applications off of
this for embedded devices as well so
this gives you an idea of the range of
devices we're going to focus on the
Raspberry Pi today so I'll show you some
applications running on this and you
guys will get a chance to try building
applications and just as of December
javafx is now supported on the Raspberry
Pi with a preview and with an early
access
so what we're going to do in the lab
today is we're going to do a lot of this
over VNC to your local laptops as a
display what I recommend if you guys are
trying this at home is to instead follow
the instructions on my blog for how to
setup a Raspberry Pi using the early
access build that's publicly available
you'll get better performance using this
build that's what I'm running on this
device here which I'm going to show you
because it uses the egl the OpenGL stack
instead of going through x windows so
it'll give direct output via HDMI and
take advantage of graphics acceleration
what we'll be doing today won't be as
fast performance wise because it's going
through x windows / v and see to your
laptop's just so we can have a use those
as cheap displays or I guess very
expensive but convenient displays but I
documented all the steps on my blog for
how to set up your SD card with the
latest distribution downloading the
JavaFX Java Java FX 8 preview and
getting that setup on your on your
Raspberry Pi and then deploying and
running applications so give that a try
alright so we'll be primarily focusing
on the Raspberry Pi today which I talked
a little bit about how many of you guys
are familiar with the Raspberry Pi
either have one or you've played around
with one before okay few folks let me
let me just go over the basics of what
the actual boards have on them so the
processor and the memory are right in
the center they actually have a nice
fabrication process where they sandwich
the memory and the processor chips on
top of each other to save space this guy
here is your hard disk SD card so you
can initially set this up on your
computer just by putting it in your SD
card slot and formatting and installing
a distribution and then plug it up to
the Raspberry Pi and it serves as your
your hard disk the onboard chip for the
latest version the Raspberry Pi has 512
megabytes the slightly earlier version
had 256 megabytes both of which are fine
for running java in you can run java and
java effects and a relatively small
footprint i talked about this on my blog
when you set up the Raspberry Pi you can
choose the split between video memory
and ram so if you're doing graphical
stuff you probably want to give slightly
more video memory than the defaults have
I think the default is 64 kilobits you
might want to up it to 128 and it has a
bunch of outputs on it so you can output
via HDMI a little composite output an
audio output jack has two USB slots you
can hook up a keyboard and mouse to or
other USB devices and Ethernet jack for
network and so this is slightly obscured
by the the box but there's also a bunch
of pin outs here you can use for
controlling motors or servos to do
mechanical devices yep
these these little guys are fairly
robust I have yet to destroy one but I'm
going to try my best at on J focus we're
gonna we're going to see if these flowed
in on coffee java all right so let me
let me show you guys how to use the
scene builder this is what we're going
to use as a rapid application
prototyping tool and it's it's fairly
nice for getting started with javafx
because it lets you try out all the
controls and components and build a
quick application and it has a nice
separation between the the presentation
this outputs XML and the code you can
write Java code to then interact with a
as a controller class to interact with
the the xml and let's see how our focus
on line are doing
Oh Russell just got back from greech
2013 in Madrid that's cool I actually
I've never I've never been to Spain
anyone here been to Spain yeah is that
it is that a popular vacation yeah i
would say yeah probably the most popular
nice i guess it's nearby it's probably
has nice weather well relatively ok
alright so let's go back to NetBeans
how about a nice f XML application this
time we'll call this shy guys
okay so by default NetBeans has created
a few files when we chose the effects ml
project it created a java file and if
you remember I showed you guys the basic
application step at the top of the file
it it should look pretty much the same
right I mean has the extends application
it has a little main method and then a
start method that gets called back the
only thing this class does in addition
is it calls the f XML loader to load the
f XML file off the classpath so pretty
much boilerplate code for loading f XML
as your your main you i know'd it also
creates a f xml file now i'll show you
the XML first this is what it looks like
if you open it as text and you can see
it's it's pretty declarative you have an
anchor pain which is a layout and then a
button and a label inside of the anchor
pain and then some properties for
positions and alignment but we can also
open it in scene builder
and then seen builder what you're seeing
is a visual representation of the same
thing but it's synchronized with the XML
so if we make changes here and save it
for example if we add a text title label
controls label and then there's
properties here on the right so controls
and things on the left to drag in
properties on the right side you can't
you can't see the top of the properties
window but basically I'm just typing in
hello jug eyes and you can even test
right in right in seen filter so this is
a non-functional view of the application
it doesn't actually do anything but it's
a quick way of seeing what it would look
like visually and okay so this is one of
the problems with them graphical layout
tools is they don't really resize your
your stuff properly all the time so a
good way of dealing with this is if you
go to layout okay let me drag it down so
here are the anchor pain constraints and
so we can say that this button we'd like
to be to resize with the window let's
see what happens
there we go now we got a big one let's
just make them resize horizontally I do
the same thing with this guy actually
will stick this guy the top and sky the
bottom
two
ok
it's now you can see he's only resizing
horizontally in keeping with the window
so anchor pain is an easy way to do that
you can also set constraints for
centering items inside of another layout
if you want to line it to the center of
a window but let's let's try saving this
to make sure it changes show up in
netbeans okay so you see we have a
second label here the netbeans now set
automatically refreshed and if we run
the project we should see our new
version
alright so hello Joe guys we click on me
it says hello world alright so that's
nice and you're probably wondering how
the buttons wired up so that's the third
file it created for us in the template
which is a controller class you can
interact with the controller
bi-directionally with the f xml so if
you notice all of these variables and
methods are annotated with a def xml so
in the labels case since label has a def
xml in it it means that the item inside
of the xml file with an FX idea of label
will get injected into the the class
here and likewise when you click the
handle button action you can call this
method from your f xml by
or is it
label but in your pan out here it is by
putting a nun action handler which
refers to the method so it has pound
handle bud in action and that will call
the handle button action in the
controller class and then the controller
class gets wired up by using this FX
Colin controller tag and I'm showing you
the xml version of it all of those same
things are configurable and seen builder
by looking at their properties so if you
look at the properties on the right so
here's the IDS that's the CSS ID the FX
IDs up here ok so you can see this one
has an FX idea button and then the empty
text element here is an FX idea of
labels that's the text which was getting
set with the message when we clicked it
and then the button handler let me get
to the bottom is down here in code so
you see under code there's a non-action
handler and it calls pound to handle
button action to same thing alright so
this this look pretty straightforward
you guys think you could pack your own
applications okay so let me before we
get started with um packing lebby well
let me see if I have any more slides I'm
supposed to show you okay native
packaging app stores all right so I'm
going to talk a little bit about
packaging of apps then I'm going to show
you some stuff running on the pie the
reason I'm doing the pie last is because
when I was testing the video stream
earlier I realized that the moment I
pull this out and swap to the pie it
works great switching to the pie and
then I switch from the pie back to the
camera it doesn't work I have to restart
the stream so we'll do this very last
because
so we do this we're going to lose our
camera for the folks online what I'm
thinking will do anyway is will kind of
record the this presentation as one
snippet and then the lab with one group
will be the second snippet so we'll have
to separate recordings and then you guys
can test on the stuff out okay so a
little bit about packaging of
applications so JavaFX applications can
be packaged as applets on the desktop
web start on the desktop and now the App
Store my opinion is that you really want
to be closer to this side using native
packaging because it's easier for your
end users to download and install
applications do you guys do you guys use
the native packaging stuff for quant
cell can you where's our mic here
what do you guys use for packaging anh
quan sell I'm curious yeah we've been
we've been trying to work with I think
it's called the FX / packager yeah and
using web stars and that but mostly we
just use its user regular Java and and
and don't use the FX package sir it has
some are still some issues we have with
it okay all right well more will fix
your issues all right but you're still
you're you're calling a java application
directly on the desktop you're not going
through web start or the M applets yeah
what web starts pretty good in my
experience deploying applications you
get a fairly high number of ends users
who can just run your application
without any configuration and if they're
missing the latest version of Java or
something it does a fairly good job of
updating them applets are the most
problematic in my experience actually
getting it deployed to a wide audience
so if you like you have a controlled
setting where you're deploying to like
an intranet or a company where they
manage Java running on machines it works
fairly well but just putting outputs on
my blog Jim Weaver and I've tried before
and dealing with all the complaints or
issues coming in from the twenty percent
of people who don't have it working for
whatever reason is more trouble than
it's worth so web starts pretty good the
new packaging stuff is really good and
it's you can now deploy your apps to the
App Store the mac app store is the first
one which is working and hopefully other
app stores in the near future so any of
you guys have max okay so if you haven't
already you should go to the App Store
and you should download ensemble
app store now here it is app store
why isn't it coming up okay let's try
and sambal I've already installed it
let's see if it boots alright so this is
ensemble I've downloaded from the App
Store the more people download at the
higher the page rank and the ouster is
so we want everybody to try it out and
this is also a great way to test out the
different javafx controls so you can try
two different animations and transitions
and it gives you both little samples and
also the the source code for the same
thing except give it a try this is the
new canvas element which lets you do
particle systems and all sorts of
immediate mode graphics high-performance
stuff there's lots of cool charts area
charts pie charts a whole bunch of
controls different graphical demos you
can you can test out 3d like I mentioned
if you have a graphics card you can get
3d effects in your job effects
application so you can do a lot of stuff
this is also a good place to get ideas
for what you can do with your
applications are going to try on the pie
okay so and you can also do cool stuff
like this this is a screenshot of the
demo we did at devoxx on the pie for
having some animations of the schedule
this was run off large 1920 x 1080 hdmi
monitors with full graphics rendering
downloading stuff off the internet and
had very good performance
alright so conclusion is you can you can
build graphically rich applications
deployed to the browser web starter
native packaging use seen builder and
run it on beagleboard or panda board or
raspberry pi and we're going to try try
this today alright so let me let me show
you a little bit on the pie and we're
going to we're going to lose our our
camera unfortunately
you
