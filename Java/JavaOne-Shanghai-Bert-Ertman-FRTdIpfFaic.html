technology Network we're here on the
floor and live at javaone China and
Shanghai and I've got Bert Bertman with
me all right are you doing I'm good
thanks so tell me about your role in the
java community um well actually I think
I've tools I am the joke leader for the
Netherlands your user group okay which
is a well countrywide jerk which has
3,500 members okay and one of the things
we do is we run the J fall conference in
November every year it's a 1200 person
conference so it's pretty huge it's a
community-driven conference and the
other thing that I do need your
community is I'm a Java champion since
2008 congratula and as part of that I
try to give you know feedback to stuff
that's Oracle's been developing with
Java and try to engage engage as much
with the other job champions as as
possible because they are our wealth to
to tap into great so tell me about your
sessions that you didn't hear a travelin
I did one so far which is the migrating
spring applications to java ee 6 okay so
right now in China there's lots and lots
of people doing spring developments
because they stopped looking at Java EE
and around the j2ee timeframe and it was
very painful yeah and so Java EE is
mostly new to them and so there's lots
of spring development going on but
people are now curious what this java ee
thing is and which e7 just came out
recently ready 6 is more mainstream EE
technology to me because it's supported
by multiplication service now and what
people are really interested to see how
they could benefit from you know a
migration path to java ee 6 for example
is it a painful migration path is it
really hard does it take years
in I know it depends yeah just generally
yeah the answer an IT is always it
depends yeah but then what the thing is
you shouldn't run to your desk and start
migrating everything from spring to Java
you right away you should have a
business case for that obviously ok
reason to do it yeah and the reason to
do it from my standpoint is that people
who started building spring applications
like six to eight years ago they have
created but I'd like to call it spring
legacy using older operate relational
technologies using older web
technologies which are now mostly dead
or no longer supported or no longer
continued and if those applications have
to go for another five or ten years then
you're facing some seriously some
serious technical depth and if you have
to upgrade those technologies anyway
right why not put in a little more
effort and take everything to the
standards oh and then and then things
get much easier you make great leap
forward in terms of the technologies
yeah because you have compatibility
insurance so I hear a lot from people
that well ja ve being a standard that
doesn't say anything well I think the
standard is about compatibility so if
you choose technologies from the
standard right now that you aren't
insured that those technologies you'll
be continued for a number of years from
that one they will still be there in
five or ten years right and that's kind
of interesting because people say oh I
want this new feature i want java to do
this or that and a lot of times the
community has to say no because we're
not going to bring backwards we had a
villain yeah right yeah okay so um is
this your first time to China yeah
actually it is so tell me about it tell
me your impressions it's been an
interesting experience so far it's it's
it's really hot and humid out here so
it's yeah so that's that's hot if I mean
the minute you step outside your soaps
right we're calling it the great wall of
heat yeah yes it is so somebody told me
that's China's passion for java
embracing us that's the better way to
work we're feeling very embraced yes and
what a good thing is there's a lots and
lots of interests from Java developers
here at at javaone Shanghai I mean the
rooms are filled up pretty nicely
and what people are really engaged so
far and I try to do my best and interact
with them as long as you see it's in
English it's doable but you know right
my Chinese is just very limited to Nia
how and JJ yes it's like most of us yeah
so thank you very much for coming by
really appreciate that you're here and
all your work is a java champion a judge
leader all those things and I look
forward to seeing you Jaffa wine with
San Francisco and when is Jay fault tell
me and november six november six so if
you're in the area it's an excellent
excellent java conference so you should
check it out thanks a lot for thank you
