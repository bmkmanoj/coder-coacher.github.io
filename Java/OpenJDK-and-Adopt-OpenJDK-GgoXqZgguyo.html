Network and I'm here today at devoxx
talking to Cecilia bow hi hi so you are
working on openjdk tell us about what is
the program openjdk is a way to drive
the implementation of a java platform in
the openness open source and so son was
doing this and now Oracle took it and
took it over and we've been doing this
since 2006 so what is new in the OpenJDK
right now we're focusing on getting
information out there so that developers
can join the open source the open source
project and the Java platform is huge
and to a lot of people I think it's too
big to start but it's really divided
into 20 different groups and for the
different projects so it's easy to and
to just come onto a mailing list and see
what's happening so what can what can
developers do I think the first thing I
developers should do just to see what it
is is to subscribe to one of the mailing
lists on openjdk java.net all the
mailing lists are listed and it's easy
to just subscribe and then to see what's
happening on what is being discussed and
then you'll quickly get to know all the
others people on that project or on that
group and you can see if it's something
that interests you and then what is the
next step one and go in and you can
actually do some contributions through
the mailing list suggest smaller things
the smaller bug fixes and then after
that the next step would be to
contribute something bigger and then you
need to sign up for a contributor
agreement and then start checking out
the code and start contributing real
features and bug fixes can you for
example a suggest new project or we can
do
it and yeah I would say start with the
discussing on the mailing lists and then
start to contribute and talk to the
others and after a while we have a good
set of game rules to understand how to
level up in in this thing and as a
starter if you have new ideas and
discussing them someone else will pick
it up and suggest just as new projects
and I and ideas so how does it relate to
open so to other program like contribute
to jsr or two to other activities that
yes and so when the community are
driving to brilliant programs adopter
jsr and the adopt OpenJDK to make it
easier for your user groups and
individuals to get closer to these
projects so for example adopt OpenJDK
and are driving hackathons or hack
nights or baaga thumbs and something
that you can do in your java user group
and to make it easy for people to try
openjdk out so gather 20 developers for
a night or a Saturday set up the
infrastructure and get some just find
some trivial bugs and build warnings for
example and fix those and then submit
them and and during a couple of hours a
developer says try have tried it out and
they've seen the code source they've got
to learn how some of the processes work
and seen the code and got familiar with
it and see that it if it's something for
them so it's a very simple way in at
just a couple of hours to get the hang
of what it is what else can I do what
else would you like to share with with
the community you had a session today
what did you cover during that session
yeah I try to explain the basics of
openjdk and to make sure that people
understand that it's it's not as
frightening as it seems we have 400
registered people on openjdk but a lot
more people are actually contributing on
mailing lists and so on yeah and and
that it's divided into smaller groups
and projects so even if it's a huge
platform you can still find the area of
interests for you and then also to point
at the brilliant community programs that
it can actually lead you into this like
a doc open yay a venir de que anda jsr
at any company is also contributing or
so right now and we're heavily focusing
on infrastructure to make sure that it's
easy for developers to to build i would
say in a year ago building and setting
up your configuration was for advanced
developers but now it's as easy as
typing make and that we have been
working heavily on that to make local
build really easy now it's all the other
things how to test your code when you
how to see that your code actually don't
break anything that's also important and
that's a community project and that
we're doing together with individuals
with the young user groups with the
other companies like IBM a red hat and I
think all the bigger companies and
everyone is seeing how important this is
for Java survival in the future so
everyone that everyone's in on it so in
what is the the website where you
openjdk java.net great thank you for
talking to us today no problem thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
