calm I'm doing live javaone interviews
with different javaone speakers the Java
one conference is from September 22nd
through September 26th in San Francisco
and today I have with me Hans doctor
who's the creator of Gradle hi hon hi
Steven nice to meet you so um how you
doing are you all prepared for your Java
one sessions yeah still a little bit of
work to do about her I should be fine in
a couple of weeks yeah very good very
good and what's what's what's new and
great Island what have you been working
on recently yeah I think so our current
focus at the moment is pushing the whole
Android story getting all the kind of
features into cradle that that enables
the cradle android plug-in to be you
know even better and any other thing
we're working on right now is kind of
yeah what we think will Class C C++
support including binary dependency
management for c++ and stuff like that
that's our current focus would say cool
and yeah and I will talk about that at
javaone so so one target Java one will
be about the Android build system um
which is maintained by the Google
Android team by the way the Grail
android plug-in but we cooperating with
them or kind of adding all the features
to cradle that will be helpful to them
so when I would present Android from
both sides on the one hand for Android
developers all the stuff you can do with
it on the other hand showing that the
core cradle features that depth that
made great land and peeling choice for
yeah that's a big upgrade for Android
developers all for the old ant build
scripts they had to deal with yeah and
what's your what's your other Java one
session if the session is about kind of
its you ought to do to do the polyglot
nowadays reality and then how cradle
support our technologies like Ruby likes
Carla like javafx cool and still
providing kind of unified boots
experience even in a pretty pure genius
environment yeah I've been swapping over
my skull effects project from we
originally start with SBT and now we're
using Gradle so oh it's been working out
okay so for folks who don't know
anything about Gradle can you give kind
of a quick elevator pitch on on what it
is and why they want might want to
consider using it yeah so so so cradle
is a next-generation build system which
is doing much more than just building
your code so one thing it has a very
heterogeneous approach so it kind of
embraces the reality that the software
stacks of the current and even more so
of the futures are heat over genius
right and include many different
technologies javascript android java etc
and and then that the challenges for
build system have increased a lot in
terms of scalability the software stacks
getting larger and larger and and you
still want to have fast feedback and the
other thing is you want not just not
just to build your stuff you have
challenging dependency management
requirements you have challenging build
promotional requirement how your
software travels from QA to capacity
testing etc you have a you want to have
a really deep sea I integration you have
configuration management issues and all
those areas we call kind of beyond built
functionality that's also a key focus
for for us that that greater becomes
real or kind of a platform at the heart
of you at your continuous delivery
process nice nice okay so anything
you're interested in showing us today
yeah I want I would like to show kind of
some generic services of cradle that
makes life of the build master and the
developers using the built much easier
so the first thing I would like to show
is the greater rapper okay so if you if
you look here this is just normal java
project it's called Java standard and
it's built with with Gradle this is the
greater script you need to build that
but that's not what I want to talk about
you can add a record task to such a
project and then you can take cradle the
build master usually does that hey
cradle executor rapper task and what
that rap artist is doing in in contrast
to what a build usually is doing
producing output in your bill directory
this rapid house is producing output in
a root directory creating a creator w
script create a w that's
script and in a creative directory a
rabbi directory with a credit record jar
which just has a couple of kilobytes and
a creative rapper properties file and
those files you would be now committing
to version control and then every
developer checks out from version
control and has those four files this
person doesn't need to have cradle
installed person can just use trader w
as to create a command and then cradle
is automatically downloaded from the
distribution URL you have specified here
and the build works and if you upgrade
your new grated version you just upgrade
your creator Robert prop create a rapper
properties file committed back to
version control develop a dune update
and and so you have zero administration
on the client side yeah and the
disability that's pretty nice I mean I
think we get all our questions on build
systems and my open source projects and
that would make it a lot easier for us
to get new people to just build the code
quickly so one of our members is no
build wiki's right I'm too hard for the
for the developers to work specially in
or with larger enterprise builds and we
try to invest a lot of stuff to kind of
get some of this kind of maintenance
burden from the developers and then
automated and that's what also what my
next what the next example is about it's
about init script so so here we have
another simple Java project it's called
testing with Gradle and I just I just
her and i want to show you now how you
can inject behavior into a cradle build
I skip the very first example it's
pretty it's pretty simple and so so what
you can do with Gradle you we have in
created a concept of init scripts so
let's start here and so in cradle you
can create a script which you can inject
into any credit bill that is running on
your machine for example and you can
then tell cradle hey cradle give me an
object that represents the build runtime
of the built or that you're running
right now where you've injected the
script and then you can get access to
this built on time and you can tell the
build runtime hey after you've evaluated
all your build scripts please notify me
and then give me again the cradle object
and then you tell the cradle object hey
give me the route project and it will
iterate over all the projects in this
greater project if you have a mighty
module built right you have a single
project bill it's only the root project
and then you can for example do stuff
like okay cradle now if me all the tests
tasks and for each test task please
inject the following behavior I want to
get notified after you've run a test in
real time and then please pass me the
result of the test execution and then i
can calculate for example the time it
took to execute that test and can issue
if for example it took longer than 20
milliseconds to run the test i can issue
a warning that this particular test is
long-running a lot of cool stuff is
going on under the hood I mean you have
to imagine it was very clearly am
running the test right and in the JVM
running the running the cradle built
itself and is inter pros inter-process
communication but you don't need to
bother as a developer and now you can go
to your to your project testing with
Gradle and you can inject this init
script right and you run this build and
you see in real time you now have that
behavior and you can do a lot of good
stuff with these init scripts you can
for example inject behavior or please
check whether you have any you've used a
repository that you're not allowed to
use and you can say that you inject this
behavior only on the CI because law on
the local builds you should do whatever
experiments you want to do I don't see
how you want to make sure and so
creative provides you really deep API to
to learn about to build and enforce
certain rules and things like that well
that's pretty nice so and then and the
last thing I would like to add is that
you now can add such an init script to
the inner door d directory of a cradle
distribution and then you can point your
Creator rapper to such a great
distribution with with free delivered
init scripts that are Auto applied to
any bills you're running on on this
machine so the developers can get a
completely auto configured built
environment
that you know with rules specified with
all the infrastructure stuff already
specified without reading any build wiki
cool all right so on the stream some
folks have been asking questions they're
curious about different technologies and
using them together with Gradle yeah
cool so I'll I'll call out some stuff
which folks are interested in and let me
know if you know either you've had
experience with these or you know folks
who have tried using these together with
Gradle or whether you see any any issues
or complication so Mike was wondering
about using creating build scripts that
use robo vm and OpenJDK robo vm is a
cross compiler which generates IOUs code
for job applications and it's commonly
used with javafx as a UI all right okay
so would be in that would be an
interesting a question for for Richard
bear to ask so I I don't know in general
uh-uh it is now in general cradle is
it's the first class kind of citizen and
cradle to deeply integrate with external
tooling and deeply integrate means
really deeply integrate so for example
rep rep this with a greater task and
then enable incremental build for for
this kind of stuff so so that way you
can you can you can always proceed but I
don't have experience with that
explicitly so if you if you send you can
send me or your email address and I'm
happy to do some you know to us some
folks whether they whether a day they
have experience with that and then could
get back to you okay and another
question about whether you know if
anyone's using Gradle with ADF ADF is so
so it's a it's a jsf like framework for
for doing web you eyes oh wow hit all my
blind spots no I wouldn't I wouldn't
know again the thing is um so what is
from a build perspective what is there
so do you do you have then a kind of
precompiler and stuff like that or what
is it from Abby
perspective what is the what is the
special stuff you need to do for for ATF
support um you know that's that's a
really should know this since it's an
Oracle technology but I I don't know the
builds construction for ATF offhand but
maybe we can get back on this one as
well yeah I'm not more than happy so uh
just say we oh there's a question in a
cradle for room yeah so about that ah we
get the answer your ADF used to have oj
meg and oj deployed CLI tools to build
ADF applications that and then our guy
said that makes it a good opportunity
for the community to step 27 and create
an ADF plugin so we don't have an
out-of-the-box solution for that but but
you can you can as I said you can easily
integrate existing functionality for
example created ships with end we
consider and an integral part of cradle
the end tasks right because its wealth
of task author so someone else asking do
you support deployment to websphere 20
from 1935 or something like that shall
we say well I'm sure there's an anti out
there so yes you can you can call the
answers to to accomplish the same thing
yeah okay so it's probably it's probably
doable but it doesn't sound like there
there's direct support from the oracle
ADF to team to use Gradle right now yes
exactly cool alright well I look forward
to seeing you in san francisco in a few
weeks Hans yes me too and good luck good
luck finishing up all the all the work
you have before then I'm sure you have a
pile up both granel and also session
prep I'm sure you will be all so busy at
a conference and have to do some
preparations right you know cool okay
yeah looking forward to seeing you there
by a but ok so I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
