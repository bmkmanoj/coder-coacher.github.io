mm-hmm what are you gonna be speaking on
at the conference oh yeah speaking what
will you you're talking about at the
conference today let me bring up your
laptop yeah thank you i'm certain i
would talk about architecture design so
it's a I design motor about IT Service
Management so now it's my job it's a
engineers job is change it means all
type i TS it's a fixed stack and light
code and compile it go yep and now
we need a feedback not fix back
staircase will change so and it's it's a
long time is very important yeah and
then now I designed that IT service
management model on the screen so it's a
it's complex elements in IT Service
Management and the first and therefore
let it's a for actor is a dead ops bees
and plant well yeah it's planned like
product management or or fixed budget
and the business planning create
business planning also like maybe
project project not only logic a bit
business or containers yeah yeah yeah so
they've worked us they not focus only
one so Deb focus to the feature oops
focus to the IT service this focus to
the just service not only IT service and
the plan Jim focus on the satisfaction
customer satisfaction so they're not one
element they don't focus on one element
and they asked their has a different
opinion yeah so there but they're all
working to together together to create a
product yes that's why so how does how
does this model relate to agile
processes or DevOps yeah so our
hypothesis is dev to feature and the
DevOps meaning is ops 2 ID subs and it's
will connect now connect dev and ops
see different things but now it's time
to see same thing DevOps is and Asia is
a its meaning let's see same thing yeah
okay that makes sense how do you decide
if if this is the right architecture
yeah
potent because for work to see different
and then my my job connect Lowell and
the actors of peoples and the discuss
with many low in the company so like
that picture is through discussion by
people okay yeah makes sense okay so i
