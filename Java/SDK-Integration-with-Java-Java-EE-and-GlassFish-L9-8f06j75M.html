Network and I'm here today we've site
they just say own what do you do okay
I work in a biomedical company I work
with integration with an SDK that was
built in C and C++ and I work in the
Java team so I integrate the simplest
plus SDK using Java so I use J na and
Jane I for that that's something that
Java has from native and we use
GlassFish server to expose that for big
companies for the web so glass which has
native support too so that was really
good for health for us and basically I
work and the team that integrations as C
C++ SDK using Java for big companies so
what are some of the applications that
you use this integration for basically
any SDK building in C C++ or other
language that can make a dynamic library
or dot ICO you can use that so that's
important for something that you maybe
you already have
no no assist and SDK build on that so
you don't have to rewrite and you can
expose for the clients that use Java so
that is important because you can get
some client new clients without big X
force big well not a long time for
develop that and you can get something
that you maybe maybe you have better
support for better performance instance
if I split and we expose that for the
client so the client don't have to to
worry about that so what are you excited
about about new features coming with
Java so the new class which has a better
performance for that first so that was
important for us because of the new
features of Java so we're here in on to
the C and we'll learn a lot about the
Java Java 7 and Java SE 8 so that was
important first because we can develop
with less force so for us it was really
good and use the new features of Java
platform that's solid G and consolidate
with the market so that's important
because the client all them were clients
once you have a platform suffers that
was important the support of the
GlassFish in support of the platform
excellent thank you so much for talking
to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
