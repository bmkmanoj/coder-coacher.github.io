calm and I am inch going to interview
James Ward who's one of the speakers at
javaone this year the Java one
conference is from September 22nd
through September 26th in San Francisco
if you haven't already signed up there's
a really nice promotion for group
discounts and also through the local
user group you can get a pretty nice
discount as well and i'll be live
streaming all day today and next
thursday and friday so if you miss the
live streams you can check it out but
also all the interviews are on night
hacking calm so let me flip over here to
to james how you doing James hey hey
Steven thanks for having me so um I I
mistakenly thought you were in in Denver
before but apparently you don't live
there anymore nope I'm now up in the
mountains in Crested Butte Colorado the
home of the java posse roundup and the
Scala summit which was just last week
and bunch of other events that brew
cycle puts on I've been trying to make
it out to the java posse roundup for the
past couple of years but that that
that's always sounded really really fun
like geeking out and then skiing that's
a good combination it is such a good
combination it's highly recommended and
I guess for the Scala meetup it was
geeking out and mountain climbing
mountain biking by hand some hiking and
yeah it's just getting out in Colorado
in the summer and enjoying the beautiful
weather it's it's interesting because in
the the winter we do the sessions in the
morning and then the skiing and or
whatever you want to do in the afternoon
in the summer conferences we do it the
opposite because you want to get the
cool know that and we get it we get a
lot of afternoon thundershowers and so
so it's better to be outside in the
morning before the afternoon
thundershowers and then got it another
come inside when it's when it's raining
out so yeah so we flip flop but it's a
lot of fun either way it's pretty cool
and then you can do nighttime hacking
you can keep working as late as you want
we do yeah at the roundup we do a lot of
group activities in the evening
and we're like we do some lightning
talks we do a progressive dinner and
this year at the at the Scala summit
most people just wanted to kind of hang
out at Bruce's house and write some code
and drink some beer and pizza and stuff
so so it was it was a lot of fun all
right so we're supposed to be chatting
about Java one so I I heard a rumor
you're going to be out in san francisco
in a few weeks what would he have us
looking forward to being at javaone this
year I'm doing two sessions this year so
one is the play versus Grails Smackdown
with Matt rable and so this is one where
we're playing Grails go head-to-head and
we try to one-up each other and see
which one outcome which one comes out
ahead nice so every year you Guinea are
you guys gaining ground on Grails do you
think or uh yeah I think so and you know
it's interesting is the we've we've done
this smack down twice already and both
times so we built a pretty extensive app
is the basis of a comparison between
play and grails so Matt built the Grails
one and I built the play one and then we
take a bunch of measurements on like
lines of code and performance and all
sorts of things that are they kind of
compare something kind of real and the
the one that the play one that I wrote I
wrote in Java but I'm now working on a
scholar one and so now it'll be
interesting to also throw a skull in the
mix and see see how that does against
the others so yeah I bet you can I bet
you can be on lines of code with Scala
and play that's right look at skol you
could you can do everything in one line
of code I here pretty much yeah it's a
really long line but yeah I'm not yeah
cool cool and do the second session yeah
and then the second session is web
fundamentals what I realized is that
that me included and a lot of Java
developers haven't really touched the
kind of underlying HTTP stuff you know
we live at this high level where we deal
with abstractions and as rest becomes
more
popular and prominent I realized it's
important to understand some of the
underline pieces of HTTP like how does
session work like how does that actually
implemented on top of the HTTP protocol
and some of that stuff so so it'll be
fun to kind of dive underneath the
covers and talk about item potency and
other things I understand but by the
time job one rolls around you will be
local expert on that's right I've got
three weeks so yeah plenty of time
plenty of time I've to start on one or
two of my talks in the next I don't know
like I way two weeks before actually
start preparing that would be about
right right exactly yeah you know
there's there's some Wikipedia page that
I can learn everything from pretty much
pretty much okay so we we have a bunch
of folks in the live stream and we got
some questions so one of the questions
was about the reactive manifesto so I've
heard about this and apparently um the
play framework is a good example of some
of these principles so why would
somebody want to care why would somebody
care about this that's a good question
so the reactor manifesto was written by
Jonas banare and a number of other
people partner darsky and eric meyer and
gilbert the guy who created play for a
mark and their motivation for writing it
was that there is a bunch of different
terms out there right now that we're all
kind of converging towards something and
terms like like a sink and non-blocking
and real-time and event-driven and
there's just kind of all these things
kind of seem to be changing or emerging
and they aren't necessarily new things I
think that what's what's new is is that
they're becoming finally mainstream and
so what what the authors tried to do was
to was to take those ideas and and put a
name to them first of all and that's the
reactive name and then actually drill
down a step further and actually talk
about what react what the elements of
reactive are so the four main element
are resilient interactive scalable and
event-driven so put another way
applications that react to events react
to load react to failure and react to
users and and so they they wanted the
the reactive manifesto this this kind of
description of reactive to be something
that was technology agnostic to talk
about technology and talk about how you
deal with failure and how you deal with
load and all the sorts of things but do
it in a way that was agnostic to the
technology so that's really where the
reactive manifesto came about is just as
a way of putting together some emerging
things into a bundle because i know i
know you notice for example he did a
whole reactive programming framework for
scala but he's that's kind of way of
taking the concepts and the ideas behind
what they're doing and putting it in a
non non implementation exactly exactly
so so Jonas created akka and akka i
would say acha handles the the react the
well let's see the event-driven the
scalable and the resilient parts of
reactive and then if you throw a play on
top of that then you get the interactive
piece so so Jonas was was looking for a
way to describe what the heck this acha
thing is all about and and reactive is
what he came to what's been interesting
is there's been a number of other places
that we've seen reactive emerging from
there's the the RX Java from the netflix
folks which is a reactive implementation
for Java there's the reactive extensions
the eric meyer created at microsoft and
then there's a bunch of other things
that we've seen coming out lately
there's reactive for javascript and so
we're starting to see reactive kind of
kind of pop up in a bunch of different
places and so so I think you know those
guys of the manifesto just wanted to to
try to pull together all this all these
different ideas and into
nice package okay so just to wrap that
up can you give folks a quick pointer to
so where they could find out and sign up
for the reactive manifesto yeah so
reactive manifesto dot org is the
website you can read the manifesto there
you can sign it there's over a thousand
signatures there now so so a lot of
people are getting behind it and talking
about it and and you know we just saw a
report come out from gartner talking
about reactive so you know once it hits
gardener kind of seems like like it's
it's actually real or maybe it's gone
too far I'm not sure all right very nice
you're getting compliments on your own
on your microphone on the in the chats
whoo you're all right you're busy I 80s
microphone is um is working out quite
good sweet um okay so another question a
little lighter what what are your
favorite bands and genres well sort of
music do you like listening to that's a
good question um gosh my my favorite
band I think of all time is modest mouse
and I'm probably my second favorite band
of all time is but that's a great band
name so that's that's a good starter
right there that is that is definitely
and then Alexi Murdoch I think between
Lexi Murdoch and and modest mouse which
is to kind of very different genres but
but uh but yeah both are awesome nice
nice so Jim Jim is the the expert on
different genres and music he always
likes to weave that into his
presentations so he will I'm sure he'll
be very glad to find out what you like
and next time you see him don't be
surprised if you get a little present oh
thanks Jim looking forward to seeing you
and talking about music exactly so
anything else you want to mention about
what you're going to be doing at javaone
or or what you're doing with typesafe in
the short term you know one of the
things that that I'm doing the week of
Java one which
put on an official invite yet but we
will soon is we're going to do a little
hackathon at the typesafe office
building apps with activator so
activator is a new tool that we've
created a type-safe to help people start
learning how to build reactive
applications and start learning
different pieces of the type safe
technology and and so that's currently
in Developer Preview and we'll be doing
a hackathon to help people get started
building apps with activator the week of
Java one I think it'll be on Monday
afternoon and and we'll we'll be posting
information about that on our twitter
twitter channel at typesafe so cool that
should be very cool and folks who are
watching the stream get a head up on
signing up for that that's right yeah
yeah yeah so that's that'll be fun and I
think typesafe is going to do a party
also we're still trying to figure out
all the details which we better do soon
since we have three weeks to get that
done we have three moneys plenty plenty
of time plenty of plenty of time no time
but you know my favorite part of Java
one is just hanging out with with people
getting beers and all the great
conversations that that we have there
sitting in beanbag chairs and yeah write
code yeah no I mean it's it's really the
meeting place for Java experts across
the world and there's a huge
international posse of folks who comes
in for Java one each year probably more
international that even local folks who
attend so if you're going to go one
place to meet folks in the java space
that's it yeah it's definitely true it's
amazing to go to Java one and just see
the diversity of people and and
nationalities of Java developers so you
know here up in Crested Butte there's
only one other Java guy Bruce a cold so
it's fun for me to get out and see some
see some diversity yeah oh yeah Bruce
but yeah Bruce is a good guy alright
cool thanks very much for the the short
interview and I look forward to seeing a
job one in a few weeks yeah look forward
to it too thanks
okay so I managed to get my mouse to
stop the recording it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
