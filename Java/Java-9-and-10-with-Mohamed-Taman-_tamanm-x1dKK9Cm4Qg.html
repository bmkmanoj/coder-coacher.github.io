we're doing a lot of Java projects
especially especially we have product
called price to spy it's for retailers
it's way affari if you are a retailer I
would like to compare some prices to
offer a better price we have a tool for
this which is compare a lot of crab a
lot of websites like Amazon and other
websites to get the best prices we do
machine learning we do image processing
and every stuff to crowd and give you
the best comparison prices to offer for
your customers in your country Wow so is
it a start-up a big company it's it's
have been there for 10 years now it's
very big company it's not small but it's
it's good to join some sort of such
company with the new products when you
in the new lab new idea even a new
culture - for me
it's an adventure also you involved with
Java Java SC yes so what do you think
about Java 10 what is yeah what is what
are you interested in Java - yes I'm
very interested in Java 9 really because
it's very big change in the industry and
bring modularity to that to the java
community and programming language like
java which is very very old language and
it took too much time because the
compatibility issues and we'd like to
modularize not just module RS the code
we modularizing the GDK itself so the
benefit is we can scale down our GDK and
our application to work correctly and
performant way on scaled-down devices at
the same time it's very relevant for
cloud computing and like if you would
like to deploy your application micro
profiles and cloud and serverless
it's very amazing their java 10 is
continuing to improve the compiler
compilers getting very smarter than
before and the same time we trying
always to reduce the polar plate code
that available have to write for just a
couple of
sentence it's like you know it's dynamic
language in the compiler level but its
commitment to be statically typed
language which is strongly take benefits
of the memory and handling all the other
stuff so Java temp it will offer
variable local variable in fear ins
which is it's like any dynamic language
we type just far var X equal whatever
you want then it will interfere at
compile time that type and at run time
it will aesthetically get this type so
you can change it but it will make you
very protective it to provide this the
other enhancement goes to the JVM and
compiler to make it better
performant and at the same time handing
the memory issues and wither startup
alongside the modularization and
enhancement and bug fixing and all of
this this is very good also to note that
we are going to release Java every six
months with the naming of Java 1011 and
so so forth for this why because we need
to give you all the feature at your hand
at the same time not waiting for a long
long long time for the release but it's
your at your hand maybe sometimes it's
an incubation features so you can try it
and give us the feedback so we can
enhance it and give you the other
release so you get touch with that
content with the GDK IDs
this is also reflect Java EE which is
based which is now a Java for Java for
EE
after acquisition and donation to
eclipse foundations but Java EE 8 which
is released now it's a very relabel for
cloud computing and serverless functions
and all of this and Java 9 and 8 bring
modularity which is variable for Java EE
so its ecosystem can you drill a little
bit into like how is Java is he going to
help people
I mean Java EE or people with web
frameworks the concept of modularity
which comes to JavaScript world
and the other modular programming
languages for Java is very important
because we trying to develop and not
moneyless and now it's server
micro-services architecture around us
it's it's microsoft services
architecture is not a solution for
everything but when you come for big
very big project it's better to
modularize it for better productivity
for maintenance of your codebase and
everything Java 10 provide modularity
alongside with Java and I for sure it's
will get benefit from the other the
other frameworks would get benefit of
this especially Java EE frameworks and
the specification itself so it's very
easy to just develop a very small sized
component to be deployed on micro
profile and docker based containers on
cloud and even the server list functions
you can use using modularity benefits
from JDK 10 on your Java EE site did you
I mean did you implement or did you
migrate any project to Java 9 yeah and
and my company I tried to do this as a
part of my there is a monolith project I
tried to use Java EE and gdk9 as a proof
of concept this is what I am going to
introduce in my course I am doing for
Peck publishing that will be released in
this March it's about gdk9 modularity
and I'm going to talk about JDK 10 also
and there is another volumes so it will
get benefits of transforming this to get
inside how we do migration for old code
and how Java 9 also provide us a very
good tools is it facilitate the
migration of your old code base to the
new ecosystem which is based on module
arity and the module pass system that or
any tips that you have it's the main
type don't afraid from the module system
it's very easy and we have saved the
compatibility we have now the class pass
and the module pass and we have a very
good tools I as I have said for
migration that will help you from
matic module unnamed modules g-dub's
tools that make an analysis for ugric
classes so you can understand the
dependencies and how to migrate and all
of this we provide to smooth migration
to Java 9 start now because we are
developing for every six months you have
to be very informative with what's in
you and follow us on the our channel to
know what what's new and the industry
and take the chance of migration and the
new systems and the benefits of the new
very good performance compiler and
systems and modular system that you
bring so do you recommend that people
wait maybe for the for the bigger
releases the ones that have like a
support as well I think I I think that
we don't have to wait for this we can
get we can get earlier migrate yes you
have to get your handles with this with
the code and understand what's going on
so we are prepared you're prepared your
thinking your design or everything once
it's released because it's very short
release time so you don't have a long
time to plan so it yes plan and be
prepared once it's released you can use
it normally so it's just six months is
so you can migrate your codebase very
very early oh thank you so much you're
welcome it's my pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
