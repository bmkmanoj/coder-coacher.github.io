joined by sam tsui Salman said housing
subsys Wilma Samsa sulaiman food is here
in Turku Finland you're from Helsinki
though you're just you're just visiting
for the wonderful vaadin cruise which
takes you to jay focus tonight right
yeah that's my original plan and then
you guys took me on these all right well
very glad that you can join us and you
work on life right that's your yeah i
i'm quite new wife Lee employee actually
and I started in a third of December
congratulations on your new gig okay
yeah I started on a person first job was
first day was in Los Angeles then a then
one night two nights in Finland and be
January and then Germany now I have been
infimum to like one on half week cool
so for those of you who are new to the
night hacking stream you can watch the
videos on night hacking com you can join
us on chat we have an open you stream
chat window either the social chat or
the IRC style chat and we keep the chat
open here while we're talking so if
folks make comments or ask us questions
then we can see what sort of stuff
they're saying and respond to them
directly so join us in Chad and you can
you can be one of the many folks
heckling us while we're trying to to do
some hacking so we're actually we're
going to we're going to do some coding
on stuff today too right you got some
liferay yeah I was actually first to
think about the I could tell you
everybody what this is my life right I
assume that not everybody actually knows
what it's a life rate even though they
are quite popular in the world that's
good what was level set what will serve
and then I was thinking actually as we
are here in the body premises as I've I
being invited we could actually code one
portal online cool and see how it works
ok I know that the guy running guys did
the release today what in seven but I
have to be sorry that we are going
tonight 46 forward so so so you didn't
get the advanced super early yeah build
so you could just ascends advance
actually those 1 in 6 is it's part of
the life report also we are living in
part and boring also provides that its
top control panel tool kit control panel
application so you can upgrade your body
stuff inside line frame oh alright so
when we get started so that the trick
with this is an apologize for focus on
chat we won't be able to see your chat
messages while we're looking at his
screen because we're we're using VNC but
we will do our very best to to try to
balance out and make this all work ok so
your desktop is
my desktop + V and see when we connect
to your machine again as your IP address
change I don't please because I'm looked
up okay that's all right I have made
some slides for us and few slides it did
change at the Medici what I did it well
my name is Samson Suleiman and I work as
senior consultant for life ray I've been
community member since 2007 and somewhat
active and Ben I considered myself as a
lightweight enthusiastic but in looking
like Ray around how to do things study
the source code done some Pixies I have
a word with the community edition and
all but mostly with the enterprise
edition oops sorry I have oh you are a
confrontational here i can tell you then
hahaha access i connect my bad sincere
no because i was gonna have the over
life idiots if people could see us and
then I accidentally yeah you escape on
the presentation i justjust go ahead i
will try not to hit anything hahaha ok
yeah well slinging which slightly place
I big dots so what is liferay portal
wife a portal is a I would say it's a
web application platform it's a place to
run late applications and we have been
in business since 2004 but the wife a
project our our father Brian Shawn did
start here 2000 to do open source portal
and company has grown since almost 400
employees we are supporting the quarter
standard the older one 168 and also 26
286 and
and we are also supporting boring on our
application platform then the liferay
currently there's like estimation
there's like half a million installation
in the world most of them of course our
community edition which is free SL
ability so you can change the code and
it's also free SMB air so you can
download it so for those of you who
don't don't know the original pro javafx
book website and also the jf extras
project home page and my open source
project widget effects were all hosted
on liferay yeah so we use liferay as our
portal engine so you are like a fan also
sign you know is fun at times yeah but
it's pretty good I'd rather be runnin my
websites on Java than some silly PHP
well absolutely you can harm be it to be
with the portal 2 ok I don't know you've
crushed my there's a support for PHP
portal sinner wife right ok I heard that
people have used that I'm sorry now we
actually have a two editions of the wife
a portal you have a community edition
which is this open source and we develop
them github and if you follow us and
github and you go to github.com lot at
the liferay and then reply to a portal
surfing you can see our changes and how
the development are is happening you can
blow our source code study compile it
and run it but when you download the cee
edition its community supported so the
company doesn't provide support for to
see it is the addition if you
if you need a support you can of course
use our forums and ask questions there's
and our engineers they answer will
answer your questions sometimes
sometimes they don't but many times they
do all right what I've gone to the forms
they've been pretty good at answering
you know if you if you had a really good
question that with all its almost get
into sir yeah that's true and if you
have to do the IDS because we are into
sitting about life right so we are
interested to know what you are doing
with it and then we ask this enterprise
edition and this is the addition
actually that is our salaries so so
that's why i am able to sit here and
choice salary from the liferay there is
actually a gold edition and platinum
edition with the support and there is
this cheaper edition which doesn't have
a support but it also has sets fix packs
so if super edition your way also will
have a fix packs for five years so when
you buy Enterprise Edition you don't
have to be part of the liferay you don't
have to upgrade your life a CD edition
always to let this variation you can
keep the 60 61 maybe 62 and you can run
on that on five years and you are you
are getting super for mass and now
there's with there will be also
enterprise only plugins that we will
provide since you're letting us guys
escape be honest the avada and the
Varden team had a busy week releasing
abundant seven so I think this is one of
the more laid-back days in the office
here well actually yeah I'm growing at
home office from Helsinki and i also
have a soul on there and paid very nice
so so you guys can compete on who's his
offices and more cushy yeah
so we are actually compatible also with
your IP and so basically you don't have
to give up your IT infrastructure and we
run probably run on your application
servers and we can use your database and
we we have some several development
tools that you can use we have a seat
for see that developers we have a
library I de an de developers do you
have a lighter a developer studio for
both versions we have block in a state K
and we have we have also made them few
money use made with a lightweight you
can do that but if you want that code
anything any ID what you like you're
going to use my maven a plug-in SDK and
use any idea what you want okay idea is
fine also so what do you what do you say
what I'm going to haircut today I will
you we will use like radio / studio okay
and in the press edition version just
happened to be in my computer all right
most of all forgiven we can actually
then also look 6.2 if you have time
Becca and when you develop for life
raised we call these exchanges as the
blockiness and we have different times
blockings Oryx themes hoops Oh set error
in my slide noticed I'm just checking a
chat to see if anyone has any questions
and go ahead layouts then don't don't
mind they're blocking we put basically
go to see portal
and if you go to photo you have portal
blocking it's basically generate for you
these kind of orbits and portlet is is
is a responsible only for this small
area in your application so basically
it's generous only this area and at the
time type of plugins that we have there
is
where it is
pretty me with the liberal of its so T
basically defines the look and feel how
to a portal looks and layout is how
these orders are layin on the page and
then we have a plug-in which is for the
extension something like if you wanna
put to life a example to connect us all
search engine this Tessa by plugging for
it and there is also good for plucking
for it oh and this is our architecture
the picture is made by our vice
president of engineering or heavier and
they see this picture is very good
description how to live a application
looks like so we have a if you look go
to our website and look for a terrorist
plots you can you can read our help lock
his blogs about the architecture of the
liferay but when we do this coding this
picture we can come back here and then
look more carefully what these people at
this picture actually means it'll make
more sense after effects of actually
seen some are we going to develop a
portlet what's the plan yeah make on the
devil portal and when you're done you
can axel eat and come back to slice so i
have here a Wi-Fi running quite
perfectly with our portal it's already
running this is life or enterprise
edition it's a 6.1
and it's basically the same as a 6.1 CD
but it has enterprise support and it has
been has been lil bit of the optimized
and there's are some lot of fixes done
for it and this month or next month
there will be a we also do see addition
or sixth one coming up so when we login
to live a portal login in and then you
see portlets we can drag and drop
forwards as we can change the
it's leo
you can say change the layout this is
the layer plugging if it generate
layouts for the library we can create
this content and layout so other layouts
are coming to portal so now we have
different layout here
you can go also for the H
and we can chase the team right now I
don't have anything here anything
anything just that you can install
themes I can install themes and actually
you can go to our marketplace and
download something ready made tea yeah
start worry about themes and a wrap
portal is divided we have actually can
run multiple sites inside liferay and
sites ex illis erica users users / tail
they have their own content but you also
can circ on the bit inside if we create
the new site here
you are missing my mouse sorry
side so you can bring your slides
and when we go to sites we can
for the sides we have a public pages and
private basis so if you create your site
and put private places they are more for
external internet because they are eaten
by default and you also have a
permission management here so you can
have fine grained permission we have
like education and also in a library so
you can create a fine grain or mission
management you it's very easy actually
to create or you sitting in life
application so maybe we have a time half
an hour for coding so maybe get started
I I took a chance here and I don't have
anything ready yet okay that's good we
get to see it so much so this has really
scratch so let's see if you have a demo
effect or not so if he is in development
studio we can we have this resort and
these kind of events the developers to
you it's great so
Oh night body
I've it's late
portal
where things
a few fellows in the u.s. do publish
leaving here Oh actually the
configuration here yeah I think right
now folks in the US should just be
waking up yeah I wait no no games
backwards I think they're sleeping
they're just know they are waking up
there waking up yeah yeah seven hours
after us yeah all right so good morning
folks in the US who are on the live
stream
ok
and be great affordable
and then the basically the wiper
devilment studio is using blocking esta
el behind degree in the project so it's
basically created project structure and
when we want to create a wall import
portlet we have a here our own
unimportant and maybe a bit
controversial it's costco tonight
package and then
let's create a portal application the
screen resolution it made its grace
creates us the ball in application so
nice so we have a body an application or
liferay what it actually does in a
boarding and what's pretty in a warning
the same application is very easily
configured and you can run just a
standard loan application so if we we
could change the liferay display so we
can create here our
nightcat a career
porta light it would be to be great day
quickcheck
yeah we did great two points
okay that's another
Oh
so we have a nice boy and you have a
boring portlet and this is a portlet
properties this is a standard for the
older or palace the world Nina see you
are working for oracle this would work
prob'ly these settings on oracle portal
also and this should be running
application already so if we drag and
drop fear oh yes change please so it's
going to deploy it to the running server
it's going to deploy here and you get it
here became we have our core list now
there's
there's no right about that yeah yeah no
that is actually the evening demo
application which they're actually to
remove one city to move yeah well so I
get to see the second one on the cruise
tonight on the bottom yeah you are going
to see the second one and cruise that's
a another watering application all right
so we have one implicit it's like hello
world nothing special but as you know
the voting is very easy to level and
actually create the window that's the
class
my window
window and we choose bar in you I know
my prince
was accident one thing I forgot to the
wider implications so what we're doing
we're doing about and hacking here yes
you want to help us you are learning
right are you so much in business right
now ready in case in case you want a
heckle us that Mike's on you can yeah
say hi heckle us in the backgrounds it's
a big mike complain when we um when we
misspelled stuff yeah the bottom
applications maybe you want to just to
create them so so for those of you
either didn't watch or catch the first
the first stream we we did a video for
the bottom seven announcements and we
have yonas sitting here on the couch
behind us who's the CEO bottom what's
your title yeah it's sucio CEO and
founder and promoted so while we're
doing a life rate presentation if we
have any modern questions it's very
convenient that all of our engineers and
you actually there's more water
engineers here Pema all right there's no
wife Regina I don't actually I also were
part of the engineering but my catalyst
consultant so and I'm two months so
let's see where's my carries taking me
silent library so we just make it very
simple
application here
mm-hmm
I start to feel a heat about this video
let me test that component here you're a
fan of underscores remember variables
actually this is brian chang coding
style maybe it's a library source code
base so we can take a look at number two
so you see i like at one time before ids
existed it was kind of helpful to have
coding conventions like that but now i
don't i don't even trust when people do
that because if you forget an underscore
then you can trick people by having a
coding convention that's followed being
consistently but the ides are better at
highlighting and telling you what's
members what's apoco all those things
that are having coding conventions
because IDs don't there's no exceptions
there's no the code doesn't lie actually
I agree with you in this case I calm and
my ten years past history I used to be
repeat the tool called sideways power
peeler mmm they're used to have a coding
convinces and if you go to saw sports
and look my old code ten years ago you
see some pretty horrible Cody college
there's actually my own idea of the body
and also there at any funky rod encoding
conventions that you guys power nothing
that I think of we are using pretty
close to Java proclaiming the Java the
bush McCall they did the Java code
convention standards yeah yeah those are
actually pretty good i've seen most
companies the industry just follow it
really with minor changes to number of
like spaces for indentation or other
random things they decide to tweak but
there is a really long tutorial in a
departing home for contributing callback
that kind of both you through setting
all kinds of my new properties in
eclipse how you're going to format the
code exactly as its formative involving
but it's pretty close to what the java
defaults yeah
maybe now we have a better hell over
here yeah there you go you get a button
it does something yeah this is the one
thing watering many people they are
actually I'm piloting here that they are
creating a anonymously dinners mmm
listeners and actually what you can do
with the bottom seat us right here can
name and the window reference the window
where you are and then just the fear the
name of the method that's very nice
quite right shouldn't be button clicked
and so button clicked yeah people would
have looked at and said next five hours
so next thing is for for us is here
actually change the code a little bit we
just use our night
no here
with the code actually I usually also my
call in a bar in the window and as now
on insulin is coming out they have this
UI so you wait don't have an application
you have a UI so and we extend that and
we just read it below these know you can
do here sorry also one comment about the
code you are you now referring those
button click listeners with strings we
actually duplicated that from boarding
seven if you had tons of coal with does
freakness things there's a bit of thing
stopped it okays also for well you saw
why we actually had a coding error as a
result of the ID and not being able to
help us yeah that's true the string is
it I got it makes the code a little bit
meaner actually yeah and we just refresh
the page it might be actually with the
manual running for application you might
have to do that
tonight wanna part didn't avoid
I'm going to build the project before
you redeploy it or something no this is
the subsidy below should be enough
maybe the first table
you shouldn't have been really helpful
this is my project I know maybe this
life coding is not the my best thing and
do you see any errors here three yeah
his views is slightly delayed this is an
ID window and I said my window all right
let me let me help you out here guys I'm
going to borrow your control first all
right so the whole time we've been
broadcasting here I forgot to do that
okay is that a little better all right
so now he can actually see a word get
what we're doing live instead of the
latency I should have done this before
when we were doing the bought and sold
me because we all the guys sitting here
and say they were looking at laptops
instead of at the screen but then this
is this is behind my head I'd even
noticed it was like okay easy for you
think of something no it's fine she'd be
fine yeah i think the code the code
looks fine it has to be a deployment
deployment issue would be my guess so
maybe be just well the cut was fine yeah
yeah that's better naughty drip off with
it and the people are they gimme 20 some
10 deploy on
they won't prevalent at the volleyball
complete
still
but does the does the drive try this try
unda plying it now container and then
redeploying it the way you did before by
dragging it
yeah now it's gone like I know what's
won't be a problem actually we had to
these ugly face yeah nick is referring
to the other yeah oh yeah yeah maybe
that's us yeah
yeah quite important there is a boring
class inequalities mind oh sorry wrong
XML file yeah
actually what's happening this is our
bottom product you are better looking
only on liferay portal well at last the
team online failure and be with me you
can keep in booking my boarding for
developing AXI library MVC port and it
says hello and actually what stinging
usually what important a please refresh
before or what importance could share
please hello there bit more polite them
and she had a
ok
how'd I do
ok
yeah now we have one important nice
price you get bad okay so just to just
to prove the redeployment case is
working why don't we change the text
well should we stay instead of hello
world actually we could improve the poor
look well would you have done full 15
mins dinner it makes us might make a
quick change and then we'll wrap up yeah
because I think you're right it was the
xml descriptor files not the actual
redeployment which was the issue yeah so
let's prove prove to everybody that how
easy with redeployment is well
actually I've got something for both of
you I'll be back in just a sec alright
so meet us here
maybe
three
Oh same same as oh thanks so we read it
below all right big drumroll and nice
cool all right good job good hacking
thanks I don't know if these probably
wasn't much all right so I'm going to
I'm going to give you a notice official
night hacking thanks laptop stickers
come on come on come up here bring your
bike so maybe see you guys I need a
sympathy to each stanville so the rule
the rule about um stickers as you you
only you only get one of these if you
actually I'm do hacking on the live
stream so you qualify both qualify I
told it's don't rule is that you only
get it if you glue it on the live stream
this was a good example at evening okay
you're not you're not on camera you
gotta come in the middle here or hello
guys let me be possible to right over
here oh yeah video shot okay and let's
let's quickly see if there's any
questions on chat okay so we've got a
couple questions from gold stiffed what
comments looks like sonar is a nice tool
to manage and check coding conventions
so you use guys you sooner nope okay it
a grits a bunch of the wheat ecstatic
and static analysis tools and also
things you can run against the code base
to check like code coverage and code
duplication of things what's it's quite
good now we are you get a lot of em THX
dielectric looks like three we are using
that actually you have a seat you guys
using solar yeah you have a solar I
think spanks paying the guys out of them
and there is actually when you go to our
source code the github and you look our
build properties you can find birds
owner there that's a proof see that
later on we can we can chat with
you're debs about a build processes that
was one of my jobs in my last nice kick
yeah all right so good recommendation on
to lay and I think I think that covers
it for anything else you want to mention
about life right or which are chatting
down on Jeff okay actually I will be
getting only in at the bolt okay we
aren't on in the boat yeah that's that
the boats important podium for ya for us
and actually when you're not doing these
morning applications we also you saved
my screen still no but I can okay
see ya aquia so when you are developing
bought in applications at liferay we
have a gig because party an application
is very easy to run on five a platform
and a very easy to convert on life the
platform we have this by three
marketplace here you can actually
distribute your applications and in
future you can also sell your
applications so if you have applications
that you have you are creative and you
want to do develop and even a distribute
and do you wanna that they will be run
live free platform please bring them to
our marketplace so we had torial there
already actually I mean do notary the
forum platform implemented in warren
follow fray you have it yeah we have one
of those but i don't know if it's
something i want to get answers say
what's okay what's hiding spot t 0 re
sorry Tory yeah submitted already know
it's not there not yet we have actually
the approval process on our marketplace
so it goes through that and is it ear I
it just stop it correctly but if you
want to see if you can go the one that
comes last story so I basically gonna
drop in replacement for the message
boards in life right use the same back
end but kind of replace the front end
with the bottom base you why all right
but it's it's not like fully ready pro
applications it's almost there cool
that's fair okay so this is cool purpose
if it here are yeah it should be that oh
it's a it took some time yeah cool yeah
it's pretty nice so this is what it
would look like when you put him inside
yeah probably if you have it on longer
tread it's actually kind of lays a large
everything while so you could have like
really really really long tread like
like this one with 12,000 hey DJ so it
kind of there and work while scrolling
it load more rice messages over there
okay so you had another life for a thing
to try yeah well in the future we will
release library 6.1 ca3 it's coming and
coming weeks the day hasn't it checked
up there if they're coming we are also
working in US and 6.2 and there will be
lot of exciting stuff like OST I you
calendar application templates one more
cool cool alright thanks thanks for
joining us unlight hacking yeah so for
folks know what's up next i am going to
be on the stage at devoxx interviewing a
whole bunch of apps including chisels
thank you mmm on stage at you go grab
you will be on stage have the crews meet
up yeah Chris made up first then J focus
so on the rock on the list we have been
cat's super may mian Holly Cummins Heinz
kibbutz gnome 10 from Jay frog and I'm
also going to see if I can get more
tained to come along because he was
supposed to be on the stream today but
he still hasn't arrived in turkey yet i
think this yeah he has some little bit
floods yeah but i'll see if i can snag
him at j focus and get them up on stage
so join us for those and if you're
interested the j focus embedded track is
still available so you can still sign up
in at NJ focus tomorrow alright so see
you guys then and thanks for joining us
on the live stream okay thanks thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
