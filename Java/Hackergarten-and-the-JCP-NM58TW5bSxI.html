stage during Java 1 i'm heather van
keira and we have here with us today
Ivar grinstead and Mohammed 2mon thanks
for joining us so we're here in the
hacker garden and what have you been
doing here this week at the hacker
garden so far we're a day two of the
hacker garden what are some of the
things that you've been doing at the
conference and here in the hacker garden
area I were ok so here at the hockey
garden yesterday we had a hacking
session for embassy the new
specification for Joey e8 and today I've
been looking at the amazing stuff around
there like they do crush and I'm the
show machine over there it's pretty cool
stuff so yeah all right you muhammad i
have spent though the day yesterday at
hecka garden area socialization with
java champion the other stuff and seeing
what's going on behind it's always it's
amazing at the same time today we have
hecka garden sessions about java 8 and
line features and tomorrow we are going
to see how we can make a TDD in Java one
of the most develops topmost topics
right that is needed by the developers
cool yeah that's always a great place to
meet people and learn about new projects
yeah and have a chance to look at some
code and one of the things we're doing
with the JCP this year at the hacker
garden is we're having a membership
drive so we've been encouraging people
to come and helping them sign up because
with the newest version of the JCP it's
even easier to join we added an
associate level of membership and i know
you are both already JCP members but i
wanted to ask you since you have been
members of the JCP for some time why did
you join and what are some of the
benefits that you've seen out of joining
the JCP out of the fact that you're a
member of the JCP and you've been
participating on some of the expert
groups
start over yeah sure well i joined DJ
speak to be able to be a part of an
influence the technology that i worked
with every day and and it's great
opportunity to actually be be able to do
that so it's not just something you get
thrown at you you're actually a part of
developing it or by a Muhammad for me
first of all the same I shared opinion
was ever and this yes we are using the
technology everyday day today and we
would like to participate and spread the
word about that what's new in the Java
all because this is one of the biggest
platform you working with and at the
same time as we are the North Africa and
the Middle East we need to spread the
word about Java because we have a lot of
developers now coming from the
universities and learning about this so
it's a win-win relationship I have
joining a very big organization like gcp
let us understanding what's going behind
the big vendors and the market at the
same time we can understand the future
so we can evangelize the future for the
developer so they can get benefits from
the tools and technology when it comes
out to the market instead of waiting
long time to to just get in touch with
this technology so he's speeding I'm
getting feedback to the spec needs extra
good member for this reason we signed
for gcp membership thank you for the
assistive see it because this is allow
most of the people if they don't have if
they cannot sign the GSP a probably I
would like to contribute even by their
opinion ranges this is will work for
them right so now we've added the new
membership agreement which is a simpler
agreement for individuals they can
become associate members they can
complete the agreement online it doesn't
require their employer to sign anything
they don't have to have the JSP a it's
simply the associate membership
agreement and lately too we've been
talking about when we do our JCP talks
we talk about the skills that developers
need these days as the marketplace is
changing and the fact that
more and more developers are having
excellent coding skills but the JCP and
other projects that you can work on in
the open source environment can help
your career by giving you skills like
communication collaboration learning how
to work together with a team and
communicate and expanding your network
and getting the visibility in the
community so can you comment on you know
your experience with that and how it's
helped you in that regard in terms of
developing the skills and growing your
network yeah it's a great experience to
work with people in different time zones
and how you collaborate and using the
different tools available it's actually
the same tools as we work within or
daily business but then we're often in
the same room so it's the difference in
the time zone and yeah for us and my
environment in my ward because we are
working together in the specifications
and the communication and the periods
that we have for the specifications and
everything like this we are using a lot
of tools for source controlling the even
even the documentation the spec the tck
is the reference implementation that is
getting fuels in my my department and my
daily day-to-day and this is get in
touch with the others when we talk about
the process because of this we working
and spread the technology and open
source we were helping open source and
open source most of the projects are
robust now so you can depend on them
build a big project on this and this is
the benefits of collaboration yeah right
and it's also great to be part of
something that you build actually a
platform a specification that's that
many people are going to use so you need
to have great care in what you're doing
so you don't get it wrong it has to be
right from the first time it's not like
your project at home where he can fix it
next week probably it takes a little bit
more time so Celeste specification is is
is more thought works and actually
programming most most of the defenders
of contribute to think about the
reference implementation
playing with the specification in this
area and the most important thing that
the passion behind this because no one
would be committed unless they have a
passion about the work because it's
there is no money there is nothing
that's learning and dilip java right and
that's why it's so important for people
to join the JCP and participate and
follow the discussions like as I've our
was saying it's not something that can
be changed overnight so we want to get
the real world developer feedback into
the jsr says they're being developed
before their final so that's why we're
making a really big effort to come out
to conferences like Java one and
encourage people to join and let them
know about these changes that make it
even easier to participate and to join
and be active and I know both of you are
now becoming even more active by running
for a seat for the executive committee
so the JCP has an executive committee
the EC and every year in the fall we
have elections so it's currently
election time for the JCP and we just
actually closed our nominations period
yesterday yesterday the nominations
closed and both of you are running for
seats on the executive committee so I
wanted to ask you a little bit about
your motivation for that we're
definitely going to have a public call
where all of the candidates can discuss
you know why they're running and what
they hope to achieve but since we're
here at the night hacking stage and
talking about the JCP and the hacker
garden and what's going on I thought I
would take this opportunity to ask you
about why you're running what your
motivation is and why you think people
should vote for you and what you hope to
achieve let's start over yeah for me the
the expert committee has been kind of a
a a distant board a we have we don't
have very much contact with them and I
want to just join it to see what's
happening there I know it's more
political things going on and then than
the technical things Issa individual
member will be able to join the EC with
no corporate policies behind myself so
my voice is actually my own
invoice or other voices from the people
who vote for me so so I want to be the
the community representative in the EC
and make sure that but also the
community's interests are taken care of
yes I think that's important that we do
try to do that encouraging the
nominations we like to have all
different types of members right so we
have you can be a member you can be a
company you can be an individual like
yourself you're an individual member you
can be a Java user group so we like to
have a balance in the representations
have a few people who are individuals
some companies some Java user groups so
we we do definitely encourage that so we
have all of the different community
representation there on the executive
committee so it's great that you're
running this year Mohammed you have been
on the executive committee in the past
so you have a little bit more experience
there but want you to tell us about that
so when you served on the AC how you're
running and what you hope to accomplish
by being on the executive committee
again in running in the selection yes
i'm running the selection as
representative of morocco jug this is my
my favorite Jack I working together and
from Egypt you know that but morocco
jack is one of the biggest jug and
middle east and africa and doing a lot
of very very good and active stuff like
working with the kids working and
finally recently you know that we have a
change it GM a trip to d books ma maroc
one of the amazing conferences these
guys we are specialized in North Africa
especially we would like to spread the
word and in filin's our developers also
up by this representing jug for this
area is very important because Java is
very now critical and important in these
places and we found a lot of developers
as I have told you before coming in this
area java java become just not just
after after graduation courses no it's
part from the education now even
institute or universities so it its
basic in the learning
and we like snakes going to universities
to convince people you have to put job
or not just as a syllabus in different
areas graphics embedded systems
everything because this is very huge
platform and the world make this I'm
running this year because two things we
would like to get back to represent that
the community and because we are them
from the community and you are to the
community and the other thing as ever
see its political issue because last
year we don't know about the Oracle
submission and support for java ee eight
and after java champion summit that we
helped but this is one of the most
motivation to join easy exactly to to
keep track about the future of java
because this is our future is not just
the future of their vendors all right
all right well i wish you both luck in
the election so like as mentioned the
nominations period is closed now but
we'll have about a month of time in
between when the ballot opens valid
opens november first so the open for two
weeks all JCP members can vote in the
election and you can still join the JCP
and participate in the election you can
actually join the JCB all the way up
until october 27th we extended the date
that we're gonna love people to join
just because we want to have as many
people in the community active and
involved in the election and voting for
the executive committee as they serve in
the next term so be an exciting election
period coming up yes so thanks for
taking the time to talk with me and
we'll be doing another meet the
candidates call in October we can hear
more from you and I hope you enjoy the
rest of the conference thank you thank
