vidyadhara and he'll present the session
stage is yours
check yeah let's see I hope I won't make
you sleep okay
I don't have slides instead we will
directly dive into code and we will
develop a app so anybody work with
angularjs one two three
okay hey anybody here hear about
angularjs okay
few people okay let me introduce let me
tell short summary about angular shape
it is a single page applications purely
developed on JavaScript so Google
develop it is a open source project like
GWT so here what I am going to showcase
is we will develop a rescue service with
the backend database using any for demo
I setup with MySQL so using that we will
consume with the front-end angularjs we
will design a very lightweight single
page application which we easily render
into your mobile or any devices okay
this is our little agenda so we have
very short time only 30 minutes so I
need to ramp up with all the thing so
after that if you have questions or any
source codes I will give you after the
end of the session so first one is
develop rest service with the jax-rs
in few mostly people use for hands-on
with the jax-rs
anybody not used
thank you okay jax-rs is nothing but
it's a reference for the restful
services ap4 in java we use jax-rs there
are different
jax-ur as implementation in jboss we use
rustici and there are much many aps for
defining the rest APs
anybody use jacks be binding for ya it's
a jack swing is nothing but Java API
poor XML binding so here we what we do
is we will fetch the data from database
and the transfer with the JSON object
Jason you know right yeah and vice-versa
XML
then we directly bind the services into
our rest sorry
angular AP let's see we will develop
rest EAP from database without zero
coding ok let's create a one project I
am fan of NetBeans so I use NetBeans
so we are going to develop a Jack even
tap next
so I learned web application with the
GlassFish only so I so case with the
start with glass face anybody used the
glass face before no one two three okay
it's our application server so now there
are reference implementation for all
Java EE spec will goes to classes so
first implementation will be verified
and tests developed will be in the
glasses okay let's run and see what will
happen
Wow that's it we dollop yeah okay next
we will create a restful web series from
databases okay I go for new okay before
so Jane DNA
so this will create a connection with
the mysqldb so automatically fetch the
available tables from the mysqldb
here I use two only numbers dB let us
see the structure later so I choose two
members so if you have more than one
tables which which is interrelated with
the foreign keys if you choose a
particular data in tables it will
automatically select the corresponding
tables so next step so this is the main
step entity here by default
I'll choose Jack's piano tations so what
it will do is it will automatically
unbind our members schema into this
service so I do
this was packages
okay so this will generate the
appropriate code let's be very fine
so this is the table and patient from
persistent Java mr. P
points
I never used
um
no I think it is
I forgot the sake
I do this a lot
it's a good fun
console s there
Oh
much better okay so this is the Jax P a
notation for the member bean so the
these class are automatically generated
so this is the application path so we do
not use web dot XML so instead we will
annotate with the application path so
usually we will contacts give the
context path in the web dot XML so this
will automatically take a this is the
main class okay
like the
a little better
okay
so I simply change the path to numbers
itself okay let's wait so before that we
will check the database and its values
so we create this one
this is entry and this is the structure
of the are you able to see okay let me
tell a male name company and attend it's
a boolean variable so let me see I
already feed a few data's based on your
registration so these are the people who
register for the event and those are
checked here are all attended here so
okay let me see as I said earlier so
this is the resource Park so I run it
web browsers
and members is the rest service part so
let me run again that's it we exposed
with the XML rest service so you can see
without zero coding I can expose the
data base into rest service so
everything will do the magic so let me
see
with the Christa client so I used to
fetch the data why I get method so this
is the method HTTP method I used okay I
said the earlier so Jack's B will
annotate XML as well as JSON so here you
see only the XML so you can ask where is
Jason how I can get okay so I will say
accept application slash J son
okay that's it so you can see yeah I
will tell you how it will so this is the
accept header so we there the rest of
service or basically Jersey so it will
wait for the accept header by default it
will respond the XML so if the accept
type is a application JSON means it will
respond to JSON so you if you code for
devices or even thing you can send this
header with the wire requested so
automatically this will send the JSON
response
so this is the post method so this will
consume here we annotate XML application
patient
so here so for Fitz so path is number
particular resource we will get only one
gate type only so which is returning get
find
so let me remove this
and remove this
so
so we remove the annotation and tell
always written produce JSON so this will
do the math magic so how this will
happen how this annotation is bind so
this is our number D so here your schema
is email name company and that end
so like ways you have to define a pure B
name and the appropriate column name
sorry email and name for up with name
and company column name boolean so this
so at the root element XML root so this
will automatically bind you are based on
your requests where XML or JSON this
will do the magic that's it okay
so now we develop the Resta service
based on we expose the databases arrest
service the next two thing is we will
develop an angular app and consume and
render it in a different way okay we
have limited time so I have to go fast
he went app so NetBeans have a
tremendous support for html5 development
and angularjs officially they support
angularjs so you can choose HTML file
and give next here the template I choose
angular JC so it's provided wonderful
template so we do not want to waste time
so these are the available libraries
from the CDN so if you want jQuery or
bootstrap you can automatically choose
and select
okay
I took Phaneuf
any doubt so far
kay this will download with a high
internet access
okay
so this have automatically create your
directly structure for html5 so no need
to care about that so let me run this
one let's see what will happen
Oh God okay I need to clear cache is
staying about the same problem we closed
it
so for the sake of demo I will use the
embedded browser so html5 support see
all the browser in NetBeans
you can choose whatever the devices you
want if you target for Android device or
anything
iOS so I to same better so I play okay
that's it single page application okay
for the sake of demo I already used a
few codes let me copy that one
okay don't care about the browser log
I
oh I don't have time so that's why I'm
skipping those steps
okay
something happen
I will explain those things go
hmm
okay so before going to this
Wikipedia
no actually this will trigger the
debugger usually so that there will be
the wire between chrome tools few people
will easily debug with the chrome tools
and easily point out the CSS and the
Edit in the chrome developer tools
itself so I want to show you there is a
once we run there is a connector we'll
start in the Chrome browser itself so
this will whatever change you do in the
chrome development tools it will
automatically change the CSS in the your
source code itself so that's one of the
main feature feature I used to toe and
know why it's not working okay let's
move on maybe it's problem in my row sir
okay that is to me okay
so these are normal HTML tags so angular
app is initialize here so I want to say
it's a single page application whatever
you clicks navigate everything will be
load in your browser itself that's why
it's powerful so for the way is
everything you use it will irritate if
you click more than page it's will move
means so angular JS it's a single page
application you can do whatever in your
dorm and place in itself so I say so
this is the starting point index dot
HTML so I say angular it's ng-app
it's exact even tap so here I to
bootstrap and responsive bootstrap CSS
for Lucan feed so these are links
hyperlinks I used so usually so let's
say home let me remove this thing
so ng-view
so this is the app that J s will be
triggered initially to tell angularjs
this is the name what we give in the
index dot HTML so ng app so app name is
say even Java event app and so these are
the filters modules I used so I use ng
app and fill let's see later what is
filter services so I say this is the
model name and I configure route
provider this is one of the main feature
in angularjs wherever I click it will
navigate to so here when I say slash
register here I say register Fi
so register so you can see in the be
below the hyperlink is simply register
so that's what we give in the register
so it will go to the route provider so
route provider then if it is registered
so the template URL entry it is a new
entry dot HTML so here what we do is we
will for demo a sample dot HTML we will
create a sample HTML and render what
will happen sample ok
Oh God
oops
so I click register
okay
no no
I have to tell
now hear what I tell is sample and the
control is register member controller so
this is the controller controller is
nothing but it is a particular function
which will works on the particular page
itself
so this registered member controller
will work for sample dot HTML so I have
to tell what controller I am using so in
G
controller
so this is nothing but a function we
will see later so that's it so let's see
oops
okay what
stinking
ah
don't know what going on
sample
it's register
that's it
no hassle Smith
maybe okay
I think that there is very large
let's see sorry I think Heather hides
the entry so automatically this will
comes
so let's gone to say so here I say
register so funds and sample can row
older so this is the scope is the
angularjs variable which will inject the
HTML back variables so in here says
sample controller okay
type should be same and same should give
here okay so our control is here so let
initialize scope dot what we say member
each cult
let me slice this
okay
sorry
okay I just in Isla sorry so remember
let me render here in the sample
so let's say label
so this is the binding for
oops
Sok number
we gave member
so this is one of the main feature in
binding so wherever you declare variable
so same thing will you can represent the
JSON object and you can immediately
print why are this binding so this is
the we will bind using this double
parenthesis so I I want to print only
the member email so let's see ma
oops it's an array right so what I do is
I do ng-repeat
so member in members so I change it's
more than one - I think so member
so that it's a email alone printing so
let me copy the entire thing
we assume that this is coming from rusty
service I will show you how the real
data so I have no time so f5 so so for
doing in JSF for any GWT to printing
this thing we need to write tons of
coding so with angularjs you can easily
bind automatically because it's not
easily man played JSON objects so here
whatever you want you can print name
company
so I want to
okay
so we have running out of time so I
developed a sterday a simple app I just
know I just want to slow it down
hmm
okay
so I hosted this app in the open sift so
here you can search quickly with the
filters
I couldn't cover so maybe one of thing
that Jackie went I will explain it
clearly so so our is centered so I
choose he is that so immediately it's a
clay it will post the put a call the
service back-end so it will update
he is attended so who were so this is
will risk whoever attended here this is
the all the members who are registered
here so any members new members he
automatically register so this will
automatically validate itself so all our
basic HTML code if you have mobiles you
can enter this URL this will responsible
the same so you can see their
differences okay that's it I will host
this code in g-dub soon you will later
consume that's it any question
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
