event at javaone this is in hilton san
francisco it's a beautiful day sunny
California but the best part about this
event is there are 150 kids which signed
up for this event and we are doing lots
of different technology focused
workshops the kid ranges is from 10 to
18 but you can see you know they are all
excited you know different levels of
excitement they're running around
between workshops so yeah lot of fun our
focus is really to give a man as part of
devoxx for kids our focus is really to
have them a fun experience for kids and
we're going to train our kids in
technology have them stay engaged in the
technology at an early age our first
class we had this we did this minecraft
thing where you got to make different
mods and make these little witches and
everything like that say different
things will make it hurt or something
like that and we had a second class and
Matt he just learned how to use Java and
it was pretty confusing there was like a
lot of words and thought we had to type
and keep having to make new ones and
stuff so it was kind of hard to stay on
point but kind of got it
well the first class that I went to his
Python the beginners Python course and
that that one was really fun and got I
learned a lot at that class
I've never done like anything like
related to coding or anything so it was
like really kind of opening a new way
like behind the scenes of all these
programs that you like seem like they
look like it's really simple but it's
actually not so that you can make
furnaces or things like that craft they
smelt things faster
I'm going to do a robot class and Lego
masters which is playing with LEGOs I
think Java is a program where you can
change things around games such as halo
or things like that I've learned how to
create mods and minecraft and also how
to program a compare for to do degrees
celsius in fahrenheit wow I've been
learning coding with Python it's been
really cool it's been really interesting
never cuddle with Python before only
with java i really like it and enjoy it
I want to be in the technology field
somewhere within engineering or anything
around that but I really don't know
because the door to opportunity is just
so open to the point where you have a
lot of things that you can do not just
engineering you can be a doctor you can
be all this but i think i will be an
engineer i just really need to find out
my true passion within technology
I've been learning about coding and we
played Minecraft and we tried to and we
use Java to try and edit a Minecraft and
change the formulas of the game how was
that um it was it was really fun it was
really fun because I didn't really know
anything about Java and changing coding
so I've never worked with that and it
was really fun i love jelly yeah it's
really it's really cool we show them as
fun we show them as possible they won't
be scared and hopefully you know some of
these kids when they grow up they
actually take up technology as their
profession so as a technologist maybe
I'm selfish but yeah I want these kids
to kind of keep working for me hopefully
in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
