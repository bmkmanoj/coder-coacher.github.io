one of the most important things in my
vision is that other women and
especially young women they get a know
what others are doing you know
everything is the kind of inspiration
right when you decide with what I'm
going to do when you grow most of the
decisions are based on other people you
know and you think they are successful
or they have a good life or things like
that so I think it's very important to
show to other women what women are doing
you know and Fabian which is very
technical you know very good architect
and all that is results important so
other woman know that they can do that
the scientists had found Titanic and he
said that phrase
no cell science and engineer cell
scientists and engineers so I think
that's pretty much what you have to do
it's not just saying that technology's
interesting you have to show the girls
that women in technology can be women a
good IT professionals we have the
Duchess session that was such a devil or
women in Java bottom and I had a male
friend coming to the session to talk to
me and he didn't know it was women in
Java session so he was the only there
are only two men in the session he was
one of them and after that he wrote a
post about how he felt being one of the
only man in the session and all of the
things he says that he understood how
women feel
because he was very shy and it was
afraid of speaking anything because he
was the only when you
and this is a situation
we have to overcome her shyness yourself
program while the importance of
diversity right having different points
of view having you know people on
different ages men women the diversity
is very important for the innovation or
the evolution on projects conference we
made when I asked it women to stand up
they were kind of you know I'm here and
I was no you know we need to stand up we
need to be proud of that so I really
believe that is important to stand up
not you know life and career and so we
have been interfacing with government
with universities on the things we think
we found important participating on the
java community process and all every
meeting we do it's online is streamed
online so we try to include everybody
woman
you know they're so the idea is to
spread as much as we can the knowledge
and make people interact no no matter
where they come from send email from a
woman and she was telling you know hi I
was there the day in the next day I was
there and I feel bad I couldn't you know
the hundred percent programmer I was
taking care of my kid so some some in a
while they would make some noise and I
too bad and not one hundred percent mom
and I'm not a hundred percent student so
when I saw that I sent an email to Bruno
showing the case and feeling bad the
women you know she was doing the best
but even doing that she feel guilty and
this is something that I think it's with
every women you know guilty guilty
guilty on everything they should we give
especially moms you know when you're a
mom to beauty and then Bruno gave a
great answer I told you know not she's
totally wrong at this moment doing that
she was exactly being a hundred percent
mom and a hundred percent programmer so
you know keep doing that so this touches
person in Brazil if you are Brazilian
a.m. para no so people speaking
Portuguese
we have a page on Facebook but yeah we
have to Jay Duchess be our page on
Facebook no matter if you are Brazilian
or not if you have a good story to show
a woman that the thing would inspire new
people come to our page and share that
it's our pleasure you know anything
inspiring it's welcome there thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
