is the last session of the day actually
and I'm you're not buying from Oracle
technology Network and my guess is
Rafael Gomez Rafael hi hi so Rafael you
are presenting on dev ops right yeah I'm
present about docker in the infra
increasing threats to the as you and God
through a track okay and so so so what
about the darker so what is your
presentation about yeah my presentation
about docker is using docker has a
command we we call it super comment the
ideas use docker instead use docker is a
service you stalker has a comment but
it's another haggler comment right
because we installed other requirements
that comment inside darker and run that
container has a super comment because
and doing that we provide a possibility
possibility auto many of developers the
developers don't need to ask us from
infrastructure from upside to install
anything inside the agent they do inside
docker they can do what I want okay so
any other any any tips any any insights
that you share in your presentation yeah
we have a triple to toxin here in the
event that did this was the first one
the second one is about the docker a the
glass bat is a new product of talker
jeezu provider integration with docker
inside a de blas called the idea is you
use only dr. binary and key do some
configurations inside the a SS service
for example when you publish some parts
from container if you publish that we
don't need to go in lb Ellis's Ellis's
elastic load balance and do these
manually when you publish they
automatically publish that parking elb
for you
the these are first integration is a
small one but it's a beginner above the
integration in the future maybe we can
make some integration with dynamo DB and
ultimate scaling some like that you
should be amazing to only words only was
dr. binary to provide these access just
service right and this is something that
we give we because we need to fight
against locking vendor locking yeah
because amazon provide a lot of service
but sometimes these okay sometimes we
have a lot of problems lot of
interlocking because i want to provide a
lot of service but this service is so
specific for amazon if you need to leave
from amazon you need to have--you talaat
of stuff you fused ochre using that you
don't need to change nothing as dr. is
the open-source a standard you can move
to another service they provide dr. to
it should be a good option for that okay
so this was a tips for migrating your
project basic yeah yeah the possibility
to be great that she's amazing for my
opinion so anything else yeah I am
agonizer from the Bob station oh yeah
yeah okay nothing else for this session
okay so you also are so you you practice
devops obviously and i'm assuming with
the talker yeah and you are a talker
cancer captain ah yeah at vaca captain
yeah what is it dhaka captain is a
program of talker the idea is a kind of
evangelist but they call it captain
because there's something he later
through talker ships some these I think
these subject and in that case a nurse
ships yeah a captain is how to do that
and dr. it is a kind of evangelist
together the people from is a heifers
and they countries and the idea of
soccer captain is providers and the
product they will release to the public
they provide access for us before
because we can test before the people
and provide some feedbacks and prepare
some talks to present that
that doctor at the Blessed better is a
good example for that they will prob i
will present these today but these
buttons Gillies five days ago okay and
they are every people can asking for
these access but they only will have
access I mean two weeks I think so and
then you become like a trainer also of
the dog oh no this is not tight we don't
need to be a trainer it only need to be
a heifer ins we we can you can train a
WoW but they these training project
program is a separate program from
Captain that the captain program is all
about to be have friends to talk about
that test about that and give some
feedback so early access basically yeah
yeah so and then you also organized
DevOps days yeah so locally then Brazil
yeah yeah several cities actually in
Brazil right yeah in person I organizing
now and put a library yep and we will
happen in these weekend and I'm tend to
organizing and some pollo too we already
have a crew to help me with that and I
am trying to to get to do that event in
huge a janeiro and Belo Horizonte too
but this is not a not fine with now I
will find some people to help on that
but somehow we are aware almost 100
percentage you happened here so what are
some of the topics yeah the topics is is
specifically about the future the web's
future this is a main topic of the pups
days but we talked about the other
technology around the develops creature
right because we have a cute cute
develop future you have a technology
that make this future either write a lot
of tools yeah automating students a lot
of live about the delivery continuous
integration containers and we talked
about that you the idea that
haven't I what a lot of what I like in
that event I like because this event is
about the community a technician event
we don't we don't allow that I don't do
allow seller presentation we don't sell
anything you only share information
about the day that the project is
basically right of you it's really okay
so it's very end zone and yeah technical
yeah okay and so it's one day and impose
alike will be because we be a MVP one
and I will try that in porto alegre and
give it some feedbacks but in sao paulo
maybe we may be with you it will be
reached and you're following like the
developer develop stays in that are
deployed around the world yeah yeah we
have a lot of guidelines they provide us
they provide this help the professor
website is from there they provide a lot
of help on that this is up is an
international event but organized by
local community with help of their of
them excellent yeah so and so you have
so you have like a CFP yeah we already
already have this gfp we have a lot of
good speakers will have us because about
Bluegreen have a speaker about you to go
nine time to produce showing the day the
hackerspace talk we have a lot of
presentation about docker we need to
have a specific event about dr. in the
future because we receive a lot of
presentation about dr. need to deny this
a presentation because it's not a darker
event we need to be more broadly and to
help talk about x-bow have a talk about
to the vibes cuter we have two talks
about that and will be have a a panel to
talk about to what is the verbs what
yeah so is it is it really for for
developers or four operational people
who just deploy so how do you see that
split because me to the in the in the
community yeah other the same people are
they
like their crossover how does it work
and my grass my or idea is should be to
both these people because we need to
make these these people to work together
but I think normally the majority people
that attend that type of cave-ins is
normally is developers normally yes okay
yeah but we are interested to have a lot
of ops people to because we need to
integrate that James Ray anomaly
developers are tender more than ops far
to me okay excellent so good luck with
the with your the event I know it's
always a lot of work to organize events
so yeah I have a more water thing to
choose to show I'm writing a book about
dr. Joe that's right yeah i'm i'm right
on a book in the limb pub plata phone
now is only portuguese yet but when i
finished that i would translate to
english and i already have a help to
translate to spanish to that book is to
developers okay and my idea of these
books it provides the basic information
to that developers can use docker to
talk arise your application and we don't
go deeper in the darker infrastructure
because that we only okay we we only
need to know about run mapping port
mapping volumes only the basic needs to
the current application when I finish
that I can I can make this book more
broadly write this book is in a github
if you have any any suggestion tool to
that book is only send my poor request I
was cepted excellent and that that book
is that book is a limp up you you can
pay what you want Oh with any field if
you don't pay if you can't we don't have
money we only we can only download it
don't pay nothing okay well and it is a
license and a Creative Commons Oh
perfect yeah so very available for
anyone who wants it yes
yeah well thank you for that I mean
thank you for making Manta that
knowledge available to anybody yes I
know books are a lot of work so yeah yep
any any career tips that you would like
to share that's something that really
helped you in your career yeah what's
helping your mic in my career is a car
racing right we have a curious to
discover new things right don't be don't
be soft right I need to discover them
out using because what I see now and
need a lot of the conference is people
if fighting with new stuff fight against
me stuff ah several eyes oh man don't
tell me that I can't I don't know I
can't I don't know about that right why
take a look on that you need to read
about that and if some a lot of people
are doing that maybe it should be good
right maybe you should take a look
because if you don't take a look they
will pass and you go away right and my
tip is that don't be soft be courageous
yeah look village yeah this is my type
because i am up upside i'm from since i
am from IMC's a living but now i'm
trying to learn more about the Vela /
because my mifi quest if if a seated me
in five years in brazil this isn't me
don't know developer they'll be lost I
don't know it outside Brazil but here is
not normal this isn't me normal this
isn't me don't know developer anything
only the only smile scripts bash scripts
this is my type is that if you are Cesar
to me please learn developer development
