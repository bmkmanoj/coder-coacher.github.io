are at the vaadin headquarters here in
turku finland hmm and I have yonas and
Archer doctor doctor young boy and
almost not the roster I'm only a few HD
sort of and today's a today's a very
special day can I can I tell people why
is a very special day actually I'm going
to show people why today is a very
special day today is a very special day
because it was the graphene oh please
i'm working on it is the release of
Vodun 7 yeah yeah hmm so congratulations
team you guys have been working very
hard to get your bod in 7 release out
and had a nice a nice little party this
morning to celebrate the announcement
been blogging and tweeting and trying to
get the word out like mad about the new
release how many how many years has
Weldon 7 been in the making uh actually
we started I think it was 16 months ago
we're hoping like all the clothes were
here okay yeah so we started 16 months
ago working on what in seven and well
the platen project or I think no toolkit
as it was called before that and Neil
stone before that that started already
two thousand one thousand one so so has
been in making for quite a while nice
nice I know it's huge yeah there's a
huge community around bottom how many
how many users are you guys tracking who
ah it's really hard to say how many
users we really have egos you don't have
the register oh you don't have its US
open source but we have 40,000
registered members already okay in the
community so a lot of a lot of Java
developers yeah using vaadin as a web
framework alright so for folks you know
nothing about vaadin may be a good place
to start is can can one of you talk or
maybe show a quick demo of yeah why not
the Varden framework so maybe I showed a
new demo derby just released
tweaked about one and seven let if I
result if I so a local copy over here of
dashboard so this is let's start from
the basics right so one it's a framework
for being rich web applications in Java
basically means that you write the
application java language and you do it
on the server side and outcomes motor
web application built on top of html5 so
for example this application is built in
one in seven so typical that you kind of
occupied whole screen you might have
like intensive graphic elements around
everything you see over here it's
actually just written in Java and it
runs in any any web browser or any
modern web browser which have to drop
ie6 and ie7 out of the picture but
basically you can do pretty great stuff
with it that like drag and drop and
showing like hundreds of thousands of
lines on screen and other one who loads
more data on the screen while I'm
scrolling and all kind of pistol details
that they can carry automatically so you
don't have to do anything to do that you
just put the table on the screen and it
starts showing your data on the back end
this yes sir programming model it's well
it's not typical like how we would
design a wearable clothes well it's not
tired typically we design a web page
using HTML and JavaScript it's more like
how you would design something like and
that was a girl's application swing
application more in the direction of
this yeah kind of like drop effects a
little bit the starting point in two
thousand we actually he became we can
start or before we were starting we had
this huge website project the real
programming / 1 and the tools of the day
and basically we want to copy ready
proven paradigm from the nest of
programming and print out the web yeah
cool so we're actually a little bit
later we have a bunch of javafx guys on
the on the chat here Jim Weaver johan
van
Gold stiff so a little bit later we're
actually going to try to see if we can
get brought in running inside of a
desktop application using Java effects
no that'll be our that'll be our hacking
but before that what what other stuff
should we talk about so we can do we can
to help more about the bottom seven
features yeah that we can do that or
actually I could show konica Shelby from
the history from morning I'd have to
just choose I tomorrow I also do you
have that on visualization you showed
this morning about the bottom oh why do
I do okay so so during the release party
this morning yonas was to using a tool
called what's yours Myra source wat BG
yeah joris and then my google guy so
that's the reason for g so it takes a it
takes a github or git repository turns
the history into a visual graph or
animated visual graph and then you can
see a kind of the history of the project
over a so let's see if in a long period
of time also if your folks on the chat
you'll notice a new feature I added to
the to the stream so in the upper right
corner it shows you the current logged
in users and comments that's really nice
so this part is ancient history they're
basically me coding something in 2006
but let's fast forward to beginning of
the one in seven projects somewhere
around around here so it's that ok
Henry's alright later I speed it up a
bit and then it starts a look like chaos
what other one he just won't be so I
think it looks like ordered but it's
really cool tool it is how many how many
classes and files do you have no valen
framework wow that's a good question now
inviting 7s we have integrated google
web toolkit also we have
a lot of classes and a lot of files the
gold line called was 1.5 million first
1.5 million lines of code right now and
well thousands and thousands of classes
actually for what in seven we added
something like close to eight thousand
classes and that's now stuff them coming
from google web toolkit but still that's
a lot which was hurt and it actually
could call statistics from the morning
was that 29 point of the code is testing
code and the goal of to them that theme
is to move that 200 prevent yeah of
course or maybe ninety nine point some
function a really easy way to do that
yeah that's really nice visualization of
the project overall is it almost to the
current yeah it final four in time yeah
weird no no 13 I know it's ready no
we're done this is what in chef industry
so that's that's the route in seven
cotton time yeah on Friday right so
pretty much the same that is in that
release package yeah so how much how
much did you guys did you guys get a
break over the weekend or you ever
always oh I'm saturday i was building
the release the final release and on
sunday doing a lot of stuff related to
getting it out so yes it was a very
relaxing weekend yeah the deadline I
mean we had a good target we will be
able to release last week's wednesday
okay or maybe thursday okay at latest on
friday and then where was always some
minor detail that needed some updates
but still it was documentation not
coding at this stage anymore cool
alright so that's the Varden map and
then we were going to share something
else before this you're getting ready to
share something yeah it just kind of one
show why do I have it basically
kathmandu lugano sorry Joyce in history
I ok yeah the history of the fun project
good yeah so basically because it's so
old I think it's fun to kind of show
where we started so badly released 0.1
in 2001 and then open source the whole
thing with an MLS Tony 2002 and that
then it was 2 version 3 then added HX in
2006 and Google deck to get google web
to leave us all actually integrated
already in 2007 but we were basically
using that as a rendering engine behind
the scenes and now it's like in a really
prominent place in the in the framework
part in 6 in 2009 and basically the
framework was pretty unknown before that
point so we really start in Java 1 2009
and since that it has been getting
traction quite well so the first time it
was called yeah it was called warning
back then so we chased the name and we
changed how it looks and maybe more
little reindeer you raise your logo yeah
oh wow yeah yeah but basically this is
the should we be discussing the feet a
little bit you can get a little bit so
this is the reindeer that the reason why
we are speaking Rangers is that one is
the Finnish word meaning reindeer or
female reindeer so that the main themes
in volatile is basically to be completed
the whole stack now you can also program
on the client side in Java because we
integrated whole google web tool in
there and also we support javascript
quite a bit better so that you can build
widgets in javascript and so forth
that's one side of the story another
side of the story is that we basically
renewed the whole framework there is 12
ESO 10 years at least of dirt piling up
in the corners of the framework and
these guys cleaned it up and I don't do
any comments that Dutch bro the reason
why it's now what's more clean yes oh it
was almost backwards compatible for like
10 years and now finally we started
doing some
think i'm getting rid of the most ugly
parts but they also added quite nice pot
like we added sauce compiler in there so
it is actually quite crazy idea we
wanted to have some kind of abstraction
top of CSS and SAS looked like the best
alternative over there and then we
didn't want to integrate Ruby to the
framework so we started from scratch
sand and we implemented sauce compiler
last summer I don't know whether that
was a good idea or not but yeah you can
well at least it was a bit larger
project than we initially a bit so what
that's one thing basically that means
that the theming is now much simpler us
as you can build a theme in clear models
and reuse those also all things in
JavaScript em I don't know I could have
life speak about them but sadly he's not
here unless he wants the times he's the
one who has been doing most of it
jumping stuff welcome thank you am I on
screen yes I am hell yes we integrated
quite in my opinion quite fancy
JavaScript integration which means that
you can you can call javascript from the
server that's a known feature but then
you can also call server side code
directly from JavaScript if you have
made it available from the server I'll
publish yeah you publish a function s
and then you can call it and then also
we made it so that big part of the
framework can be used directly from
JavaScript so you can take some existing
JavaScript component library and just
the integrated wait well if you know
what you do and you don't want really
much really fancy features it just
requires aims yeah tens on lines of
JavaScript code
and that's all you need to integrate
your javascript widget and then you can
also skip the widget a compilation part
because because it's pure JavaScript
sorry you don't need to use any GWT
features at all not he will be combined
in GWT modules so what's next we have
also 805 ooh we have been saying that
they are on top of 805 for years and now
we actually are operational five so we
taste the doctype yeah and actually it's
quite interesting because changing the
doctype feels like a simple task and I
think before two months to get
everything to work because we have been
relying had been relying earlier in
translation transitional doctype and
also you budget for that minor change
especially Internet Explorer be here is
quite differently certain aspects you
don't like into exploring much do you
it's a nice browser yeah I think
somebody that I correlator one I think
was first word favorite stuff I can't
exploit very much yeah but i guess that
take on more important than change the
doctype was that we basically redesigned
the layout in part in in one in six we
have been supporting I using ipod is the
reason why we don't really like internet
explorer especially eight the
performance it's not really on par with
other browsers yeah yeah internet
explorer 9 is it's really nice okay so
they're gradually getting there but by
the time the next big framework comes
out you'll probably looking at the
oldest version of IE of support the time
is still cursing yeah i mean in bottom
six we still support ie6 and their their
recourse ie6 and praise i ate because
it's so nice now we have dropped support
for ie6 and 747 so now we start cursing
ie8 instead yeah so the another thing we
taste no file was dubbed basically
because we could drop ie6 and ie7
support we didn't have the kala kala
daughter layouts by hand anymore in
involves if you basically doing all the
way out in in
was Krypton that was pretty slow now we
let the brother do the layout thing and
that's not too hastily javascripts fast
enough for you can actually push water
that's the client side now yeah it's
it's not about speed it's more about the
browsers we have more coherently yeah
okay so the layout features we have
inviting six for instance they are
really i would say impossible to
implement in ie6 without doing a lot of
manual calculations and of course it's
also a bit faster because the browser's
native naething is implemented in native
good whereas the javascript is always
slightly smaller okay so you just use
the built-in CSS and layout so no worry
why have they work heavily on HTML and
CSS and tri-annual gods of CSS hacks
instead of waking our own JavaScript
code yeah well the the javafx browser is
actually based on webkit so it should
give some reform is to feel everybody
should be based on webkit now another
thing actually we get for free from this
is that people have been complaining
involving six that some of the CSL
attributes are not can properly followed
like borders and and margins and so
falling layouts and now when the browser
is kind of taking care of the layout
inside the adult automatic so so the
next big thing for us is still with T so
this is actually quite interesting
because we have been building a double
google web toolkit for a while already
and now we actually are like fully
committed we basically took a copy of
google web toolkit or saw the gong
maintain a branch of google web toolkit
put that inside warren so it basically
means that whatever you can do with
google web to read you can now do with
volume and it also i think it's a bigger
chain sin in our attitudes and kind of
recommendations done in in on the
technology side now be having kind of
trying to keep everybody on the server
side because if this is more of a rapid
development model but sometimes you want
to go the client side sometimes you
actually want to do
hacking on under there under the browser
so now you know how these are fully
supported and you can even build like
offline applications with body man fully
client-side applications with Wally cool
and there is a lot of cool stuff coming
from from google apt only 2.5 like
elemental library where you can access
all the newest leading-edge api from
browsers as well as super day of modern
many many other things cool so what else
could we have a communication mega names
is it something that it's like well
hidden under the surface but this is
something that you have to be using when
you are building new what volume widgets
and there we totally redesigned the
whole communication mechanism after this
guy is provided here by an architect for
that so do what I explain that as well I
would say that the communication is well
if you do a normal life website to do
the communication based on your let's
say data or your operations what you
want to do how it differs involved in is
that the communication is basically
between the client and the server part
of a component so it's more like how
component communicate with between the
browser and the server to another
application note your application logic
is not involved in this so we always
have to come but we have the cleanser
widget and servers are component and
then there's a connector in between
these aunties to classic appsync yeah
well anyway I think the state it's an
interesting feature it's based on
basically a shared javabean the server
is kind of the owner of this being
writes some state information based on
how the user configures the component
and then this state is automatically
replicated to the client side so the
widget on the client side can use it and
well we had this pretty much involved in
six except it was based on an XML format
this wasn't really type safe for
anything else to just strange going back
and forth it was pretty classic edition
that in two thousand
too and it was actually meant for
rendering static web pages throughout
the xslt translation pipelines this is
the backwards compatibility her
mentioned earlier it's good that we got
rid of so now the you do i dl language
is dead with what I seven finally this
so what else they feel how couple of
things over here yeah I thank you I so
this is I don't know how to kind of put
this in words to be basically that the
idea that we had in 2002 was that we
wanted to do generic you I frame but
that could use web as one of its on
rendering targets and then we had all
this crazy prototypes for reading swing
and j2me and Bob and whatnot so because
of that it was pretty generic and now we
recognize that the web is the only
meaningful rendering target so we
basically redesigned everything related
to web pages and putting the user
interface on the web page accessing web
browser and so forth so it basically
cleaned up the API a lot but there are
many many many features that live
related to that and we don't want to go
through those not all of those yeah all
right so we had a question from gold
stiffed and he's wondering what way that
an offline applications are different
than pure html5 offline applications are
no difference in enduro so basically
involved in being right offline
application is saying is it's exactly
the same as you're writing that in
google web toolkit so you can write that
in in java you can compare that in the
JavaScript and you have the older
offline capabilities over there okay so
it's going to be exactly the same as GWT
applications but I guess you're reading
it in Java which is different than
traditional yeah javascript CSS on the
clients and in many cases that require
is not to kind of put the whole
application to offline yeah more than
it's more like design the most of the
application on
server-side with warden and then add
some views that can be also executed
offline when you are out of the reach of
the network okay are there any other
reasons you want to use offline other
than just being off the network I don't
know I don't know any other basically
you might want to be on the client side
if we want to do some really low latency
stuff like gaming but they haven't seen
anybody using bottom for gaming any for
most purposes you recommend people stay
on the server side mostly door for I'm
say that the basic difference is that
when you are writing on the client side
you have the right client side you have
the right the communication layer and
you have the right the server side that
communicate with the client side and I
think I think we got one year one of
your guys here letting us know the
answer so touch kit has special offline
support yeah this Adam products that we
have for for mobile devices like this so
basically there is a bit of helpers for
writing of one views for these
applications cool all rights I keep keep
keep going on fun features one more
field I don't know should a vehicle that
form I actually was forming there but
the progress that form is not contribute
we've renewed everything around forms so
basically in 106 we had really i would
say automated form support you just give
a beam to a form and it binds
automatically as hosts everything on the
screen and that was part of the problem
yeah it's really a really cool solution
and you get started very quickly with it
but once you start to customize things
it gets a bit tricky as everything is
handled for you you basically get like
long list of exceptions that hey I don't
want to show this field with these
validators and so forth yes order the
whole idea how you do forms has been
redesigned for one in seven so that it's
now it's more based on like you doing
your own layout you're using the visual
designer or you're creating by java code
the layout and then you have just the
field group component embodied that you
can use to bind your fields to your data
so instead of having one huge form
component protects
care of everything you have a way of
binding your created layout to the back
end and then you can get of course also
automatic validation for like based on
the type of your data that you have an
integer and you get being validation and
stuff like this so just to kind of go
back a bit we have had this data binding
frame looking warning for since 2002
already where you can buy an aiding UI
component to the backend transplant
volunteer one in in the face and it has
been actually quite powerful and we even
also going to just put the data inside
those components so there are two
options but now it's much much more
explicit it's not kind of doing things
implicitly and trying to guess what you
want you actually can define what you
really want to do oh and I guess those
were the main fields are abundant if you
want to see more features were born in
Teresa if you let me show that the
linked webpage where it could go so it's
volume that comes last seven so there is
some of the top fits our warning what
that like really really really long list
of new features also listed so if you
want to really see what this new
involving take a look of that yeah but
this is really if you know what in six
you might get most out of this if you
have no idea of what it di Stan you're a
better starting point is probably the
book of warden or actually before going
to Orioles yeah I guess that the best
tolling going at the moment might be if
you go the one homers last learn this is
there is a new video that I recorded in
soccer day that come steps you through
building a new application I wasn't
going to show to you how to peel and
also there is a new tutorial that shows
you how to build this kind of the case
and line by line it's actually cool
pretty cool so if you go to the source
graph it shows which parts of in what
part of the screen it's not the nicest
applicator it's it's quite badly
designed and so far
it tries to be as simple as possible
there are so long another point is
showing how you create an interface now
not how to design a good-looking
application yeah and kind of introduce
the basic point of like data access and
I'll and handling and so forth cool but
then there is a book of boarding so
there is a 700-page book it's completely
free over here so you can go and
download it done and it basically
explains everything you want to know
about water and even a bit more I guess
yeah and you guys you guys give up those
books at conferences yeah quite quite
often so if you bump into our our guys
in a conference ask us for a book if you
really want to have a really well yeah
so speaking of conferences you guys are
going to be a J focus yeah tomorrow cool
so what are you guys going to be showing
off at j focus are basically discussing
about one in seven and i'm hearing what
what people want to get developed next
and giving out lots of aden books we
don't have that many over there at four
hundred so if you want to have a book be
quick come cover awaits at the bottom
this but they will be having more we are
published in both the boxes devoxx
france and the books UK and you have a
huge power books i hope in those
conferences cool so for those of you
guys you don't know j focus is
conference put on by the swedish
stockholm user group java forum Matthias
is the Wrangler of that conference and
it's a 2-3 day three day conference has
lots of Java content and even though
it's sold out it's been sold out for the
past week yeah it's a legal conference I
believe you can still get in by buying a
Java embedded conference ticket and
North America like six parallel tracks
throughout the conference towards it's
pretty extensive conference yep
cool all right what else should we cover
let me check there's any other any other
questions for the M from the stream and
then if not we'll try a demo ok goal
stiff got his at javaone 2012 ok see
your books are quite popular yeah it's
it's pretty nice thing with the books is
that people are not throwing them away
so often read those they give them to
fair colleague and then they can go
around and you can see like many
generation of different books in some
offices because we have been changed
their cover author of the book like once
a year or so so they are like five
different colors already 04 yoni alright
cool so what I was thinking we we try
for hacking and you guys can help me out
with this ok yes we're going to try to
get rotten working inside of a javafx
web view and use this as a way of
deploying to the desktop so creating a
bundled application so like whole
sharable we wanted to copy digital power
on the web and now really going back to
disco yeah exactly everything has to
come full circle yeah oh there is my
chat crashed ok I apologize for anyone
in chat we can't actually see what
you're typing right now because I lost
it alright so let's switch to my desktop
to old a tough question child and chat
tomorrow
full span okay no got a nice picture in
a picture in a picture Wow yeah it's a
great effect all right and let's see
hold on a sec
different desktop
there we go all right so I've all prod I
pre created a couple of projects here
before because I was playing around with
this you can she's on and so basically
what I did is I took the embedded
version of glassfish jetty and Tommy and
packaged it together in a little FX
applications this is an epi ends with a
bunch of FX applications and if you open
it up what I was doing ok so this is the
embedded jetty test and I got some I got
some help from David Blevins well jetty
Tommy I got some hope from David on
Tommy one the jetty stuff I figured out
myself but basically you it starts the
JavaFX application by launching invokes
a call before that to actually kick up
the app server and it's going to start
it in process all the application has
inside of it is where's the app itself
ok it just has a webview hooked up to a
local server so i was playing about the
mobile mail app and shows the scene so
it's a single webview with mobile mail
sitting inside of it and i think the
version of baden knows you saying let's
check libraries here ok here's all the
jetty libraries i imported it's one of
the english english because mobile mail
hassle p dishonor to only work on tops
devices so rest of devices also aid
works all about it that's right on
internet explorer ok so that was all the
jetty jar files and i believe i also
sucked in the bottom libraries you over
maven if i remember correctly let me say
ok jdk jetty where's my project
properties
better Jenny test okay here's the mobile
mail water file and I was loading this
using the so this is the part which was
a little different for each the app
servers in jetties case I used their
api's for the web app context set the
context path of the noir and for example
if you looked at the code for Tommy it
was a little bit different this is the
one I got David Blevins help with not
all these AP eyes are really well
documented because some of the app
servers have embedded modes where they
they document it quite well but other
ones you're calling semi internal
classes ok so hint hint for um I think
glassfish was one of the ones were a
little bit funky too should you have the
show cuz it slows it somewhere yes I'm
going to push this all in github
probably after my Nordic night hiking
tour finishes yeah so by next weekend at
latest hey speaking of github maybe we
should announce also that more than
seven is starting from today and github
oh nice yeah so it are you guys actually
all the internal commits are gonna show
up immediately and get hubbers at a
clone of d yes I suppose so we are using
Gary does a code review two for the
great then pushes to do whatever goes to
Garrett them and something to github
okay something with just one dog review
internal why she passes stage goes to
get top equation so it should be pretty
current okay I'm sorry there's a couple
of seconds later my thinking our
interview in the rainbow uh I gonna sign
out the results so we have a our copy of
google web toolkit in github because we
are maintaining our own brands so it's
pretty handy if you want to have just a
reason copy of google web toolkit you
can for Captain on github that's cool
alright so that was jetty and Tommy and
then here's the equivalent glassfish
code
that maybe that was it oh yeah no I was
I was playing around glassfish and
trying to get at work in different
contexts and I the last attempt I um did
some nasty hacks okay but anyway here's
the GlassFish code so to start the
server use the GlassFish runtime
bootstrap get a new glassfish started up
get the deployer out and then deploy it
and then I'm pulling it as a street and
this is also one of the tricks was to
figure out in each of the app servers
how to pipe in data via stream so
glassfish was nice in this respect where
you can give it an input stream and pipe
it directly but for Tommy we did a
little trick hey released a good
question over here what was the reason
for you to use all those three different
servers why didn't you use just choose
one of these because I could almost have
a question answer yeah now well actually
something I was interested to find out
was what the overhead was for each of
the service because the app servers used
to be pretty heavy weight but now in
their modern incarnations they're very
light the startup times are quick and
the footprint is low you can even run
these on small embedded devices like
raspberry PI's or panda boards or
vehicle boards so if you're applying to
the desktop you really want as low
overhead as possible from the app server
because you're running the server and
the clients together on the front end so
i was checking memory overhead for each
the servers to see how much memory they
consumed in addition to the application
and also checking for performance so do
you have any onion on boosted your
spiegel ah died i was playing around a
little bit with it to see which one was
better performance wise but one of the
tricks with java is difficult to find
out how much memory is actually using
versus what's garbage collected so i
thought one app server was using less
memory than the others but then I looked
into it further and that was in the case
so I don't want to publish okiz results
okay so let's try the Tommy one for
kicks and see if it works
see if it still works at one time it did
work okay so it's actually starting up
Tommy you can see in the log file and
now this is the JavaFX container okay
and we've got mobile mail okay it
resizes that's good inbox it slow I
don't know why well do maybe maybe
because I'm streaming on this yeah yeah
it was it was quite a bit faster when
I'm my computer was not at one hundred
percent CPU but i think it's
functionally yeah it's functional is
doing everything it should well and of
course this would be like really
low-hanging way of making offline copy
of your application toughbook the whole
application locally has on a local data
store and dancing yeah so i guess the
the reason the question is why you would
do this but one of the things you can do
with this is you can create desktop apps
so once you have it working in job FX
javafx has a packager which will let you
bundle up and create dmg files for mac
windows executables and linux bundles as
well so then on all those platforms
suddenly you can take the same
applications running a web browser and
you can now have an installer for
desktop and then the other thing you can
do is publish in the App Store's the
desktop app stores so usually the app
stores have restrictions on publishing
web applications they don't want you to
publish an application which is just a
browser front end for remote application
but if you use an application pattern
like this and bundle up your baden app
as a client app have a light layer
communicating back with the server may
be talking to web services or something
to collect data and exchange it with a
some sort of database or cloud database
in the sky but suddenly you can put your
apps in the app
or with relatively few code changes so
it gives you a good option for having
both the best of web and also taking
advantage of storefronts yeah I need to
go bring these two building exhalation
of 5 based offline mode in the
obligation this is so much is a way of
doing that yeah so it might make sense
for some applications yeah but I mean
even if you are still using the vaad and
server component with this packaging
your whole bought and server ends up on
the climb so here your back-end server
components running inside of your
favorite application server plus the web
rendering which happens in JavaScript
and then the only thing is if you are
accessing a database well you'd access
the database locally if you're on the
server when you deploying the client
here you'd replace your direct database
access with some sort of remote web
service calls yeah well it will make
sense to run the local length of us life
it's due or something yeah well yeah I
mean to do caching and store local stuff
so anyway there's actually the first app
that's published to the App Store okay
you do pub something yeah is ensemble
mail okay I didn't post a vada nap yet
we will we will get there but this is
straight out of the App Store this is
the javafx sample app okay and there's
actually let's go to the App Store
there's that there's actually a couple
javafx apps which people don't know
about that are already published in the
app store let me see if I get was on the
screen so one of them is money money
tree money I mean I forget
okay the other one was all right I just
want you even had to kind of begging's
last but you did have a he with the
britax it I actually I have the ending
or less when it ends in three ok goodbye
money free yeah not quite I think I
think Jim actually remembers this stuff
so let me let me poke him a chat
to the App Store apps
okay so if he comes back later we'll pop
those up and let me we got some
questions in chat while we were showing
this stuff off so let's swap to chat
quickly all right so gold stiffed was
wondering are there ways to connect a
Vodun server app with a javafx client
yes no I don't so how do you do alright
yes the system is to do it through the
body server side that runs inside your
application server so it can okay you're
just running it locally in your own so
you can put a static variable somewhere
and then through that static or static
variable static object somewhere and
through that access okay well y'all are
so that's that would be like if you were
doing what I should see you're running
java fection Vanya on them yeah buddy
felines a normal environment then you
attest embedding it that's an applet
inviting application so my my guess is
he was thinking about the server case
where you're running button on the
server you might want to communicate
with the javafx talking about using java
effects as a you are client-side as a
component yeah you are which is where is
it java running in body running inside
javafx or javafx posting avoiding with a
webview kind of thing or even as a
former yeah these normal cases that the
test that you are using javafx to build
some part of the screen on a web page
and for that you can actually use the
new JavaScript wrapping classes because
you could call javafx component through
the JavaScript API sand actually this
rubbing should be quite straightforward
yeah because basically in that case the
one in server side will give your well
it will give your JavaScript components
like the state that has been set on the
server side and what you have to do then
is just use the state to configure your
javafx component
simple way okay you could probably also
boudoir inside July effects like you
desire and then gotta mix these like
like Martha Scott simple way not a good
idea yeah perhaps not okay so i think
we've we've covered a lot we've been
talking for almost an hour about about
in new features javafx maybe two ends
I'm gonna I'll show some pictures or a
movie from our snowmobiling yeah that
would be awesome in turkey yesterday so
oh it was awesome it was pretty good
oops so at the expense of possibly
making things not work hold on a sec I
have windows open I while while we were
broadcasting I was actually rien coding
the UM the video to see if I could
import it properly and if that fails
then the second thing is we're going to
stream it through desktop presenter
which is probably not advisable what may
work as well so let me see if our green
coatings finish that looks like it oh I
think it worked so went from beacon move
to small move yeah okay so we have a
rien coded file playing of us
snowboarding yesterday or snowmobiling
yesterday so this is actually taken off
of a helmet cam I had a contour camera
attached to my helmet and we were on a
lake no no this is that these actually
see the person Rosie I thousand oh sure
yeah and the kind of interesting bodies
we are going through that almost the
same place later 2nite with the boat oh
yeah it says like I'm say one kilometer
or 500 meters from that place okay but
hopefully they've broken the ice so yeah
safeway and it was it was interesting
because this particular portion of ice
you can you can see poor Eunice is stuck
because it was melting so it was
slippery enough on the ice where without
good traction and two one of the
snowmobiles had almost zero attraction
it was very difficult it has a little
traction in that front skis didn't go
anymore very nice very nice kind of you
spitting the motor and trying to try to
get the place but we also after this we
went to the sand pits to and did some I
guess that's off off-roading and for
automobiles perhaps some flood that in
addition to the two snowmobiles out
there you go you successfully bail
yourself out we also had an ATV you're
using on the ice yeah but that was
really under Pollard when you come bring
to this snow mobile yeah well these
deals you could go really fast the one
I'm the one I'm riding I think with what
times for I think we could get probably
refigured over 120 140 km/h blood that
slower one was hundred kilometers per
hour but the faster one was like double
power the solo one yeah it was fast
enough you could probably kill yourself
and we didn't up gots to try it out
how fast it goes quite easily but it was
a lot of fun yeah so thanks for their
you're doing some donuts and that thanks
for joining us in the snow and i'll post
highlights from the full snowmobile tour
after the night hiking tours complete on
the java youtube channel ok excellent
alright so what we're going to do is
we're going to take a short break here
and then we will come back and we'll
have an interview on liferay comin up so
you know join us in about 15 minutes on
the stream and in the meantime I will
keep the video stream live for folks who
are on chat so feel free to ask
additional questions and the bottom team
will answer tonight but we're going to
we're going to be off air I'm going to
cut the recording for a bit so don't
don't go away when the ending clip plays
but thanks for joining and you can catch
more
videos on night hacking calm thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
