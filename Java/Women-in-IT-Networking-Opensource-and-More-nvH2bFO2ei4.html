assessment of where you are in your
DevOps journey with the main goal of
helping you prioritize what the one or
two things that your organization needs
to accomplish to become a
high-performing organization okay so and
you have is actually a indice fuck when
was it yesterday yes yeah we had all day
there's 10 speakers last night okay Anna
what do you know about ignite talk so
well I know it they are very short talks
right you have to be very fast you pick
a topic and you try to make it very
interesting in what five minutes that's
exactly I have like 20 slides if you go
through and you need to rush through and
yeah yeah the conversations very
engaging right very much so and so the
slides auto-advance
every 15 seconds and so it sort of
forces you to be very succinct in your
messaging and build a nice story arc
within five minutes but I found it
insanely challenging compared to like it
is right yep having that control of your
own clicker as you're talking through
and doing yourself but versus it just
Auto dancing and holding a mic so what
was your topic
I call it why so angry soon because
people ask me all the time like why are
you so angry and one I think I have one
of those voices especially when I'm
excited that I found very angry and it
sounds like I'm shouting at you when I'm
actually not but sometimes I'm actually
really angry and it's really about my
journey as a woman in tech starting back
in the year 2000 I did my first
internship in 98 and how that has sort
of transformed me if you want a Kate
public speaking and then to really
tackle the topic of women in tech but in
a way that is a bit more from my
experience that you can understand and
maybe empathize like some of the things
that contributed to a very challenging
environment just to be part of an
open-source community
so so my next question is really so what
are some of those challenges that you
really face because I know the open
source community can be tough absolutely
some communities don't necessarily have
like rules or I mean like an ethical
also how behavioral rules
yeah and the code of conduct and that so
do you remember you I remember code of
conduct
I feel like have been an amazing enabler
you actually make it safe and for people
of color or people of diverse
backgrounds and well whatever gender you
decide to identify with to actually a
turn because I've been to conferences
where those like blatant harassment
report it to the conference organizer
and their first reaction is well it's
not illegal so are you going to call the
police they're like they want to talk
more about the repercussions versus
let's talk about it from the systemic
perspective and I know a lot of my
friends who are in fact that our women
will not attend a conference it does not
have a credit contact right so so do you
have answers do you have ways of I have
suggested but so many are incoming so
some of the things that we've done so in
the Java so I work on the Java community
and some of the things we've done is
like to create for example a group and
so making sure that there is not just
one the women developer that goes to a
conference but more than than one so at
least if something happens then another
long write to address very important but
do you have that from a safety
perspective also I mean we should send
as many people who want to attend
conference as possible in my viewpoint
and I just know a lot of what I've been
asking of the source communities to do
which have not been accepted really
lightweight but it is more of the idea
of the thought exercise of what if
any woman that decided to go to your
conference can enter for free yeah I
mean I feel like there's interesting
sponsorship opportunities and also like
just what would happen and it's become a
very interesting dialogue of the
reaction of it but if you want to up
your numbers like let's just drop the
barriers maybe that's not the right
barrier to drop so let's talk about that
ya know this is an interesting idea
I think O'Reilly has been doing also a
good job like for example it's important
also to make sure that there are like a
launches where only women attend for
example they reserved like tables and
for for women to have these discussions
so they get to know each other and then
that they grow their network they more
comfortable they attend more sessions
together they'll be more comfortable
attending also like parties at night yep
because often if you a woman alone then
maybe you don't want to go to an open
event where people have alcohol we know
immediately what happens yeah right I
think that's completely enjoy and those
are things that people forget about like
common sense to you it's common sense to
me because we've lived it we know when
things start going pear-shaped quite
quickly but anyways to combat that but I
feel like you have this an open dialogue
about that is step one and maybe not
find all of the solutions because it's a
complicated issue but I love the way
that we're just bringing a lot of
different things and seeing what
actually works well with with the Aussie
goal of inclusion and diversity and also
including man right yeah I mean often is
like and someone sometimes they are they
think they look like they are adept or
so they drink a beer and then they say
like the inappropriate things and it's
also like to call them because sometimes
they don't even realize why they think
this is funny or you know like depending
on what the culture is right there is a
level of comfort I mean we always know
that if we all over to open then we open
like spectrum where you have this we
feel guilty because we opened the wrong
door and they won't comment right but
it's also like for us to be I mean to
just say no this was not appropriate and
you know and I think this is a whole
discussion it definitely I think that's
right and like I'd love to have
conferences where you could just be
yourself you don't have to worry about
editing any of who you are from a
personality respected because you're
worried that somebody is going to take
that as an open door for a sexual
advance right that's the nightmare right
this MPEG might start not seeing
yourself while you're like but you got
to get to a place where you can be
yourself and not worry about such a
thing
and I feel like dialogues like this
conversations like this help sort of
tackle a really complicated problem and
I think also you know I get the the rest
of the community doesn't really realize
that it's the barrier for us to have a
bigger network right because we are not
comfortable like breaking into a group
where they are only men for example in a
party right I mean I use do you go to to
do the entire room where are you going
to talk to anybody
yeah I'm not always comfortable doing
that I am ready there but I'm not either
and and you know serve people that are
sometimes introverts kind of thing I'm
definitely not an introvert
shego tell but it's used to there's a
moment of pause where it can be
dangerous and well I just can't wait to
the day where it's not where that isn't
the reality anymore and I hopefully you
can get more people on board to
understand that there are some things
going on that well sort of as a barrier
to be included
you know like networking events like of
course you want to network in your peers
and other developers that are working on
Java are like so we're like super
excited about JVM it was people exist
and it's like but we've gotta figure out
a way I said well that's it so yeah so
any other advice from your
a experience like on what people can do
are you in research I mean Alice is in
the research environment that mean is it
easier and I think that every industry
right now within every subsection is
taking a closer look on systemic issues
that women have either unfortunately
have been processed or have not been
treated the way that we would want our
employees to be treated and I think
there's a great awakening that's
happening currently
my advice is like talk about your story
I feel like us older like I could speak
to myself but you know there will get
that specific I don't accept that and
all that a bit in this industry for a
while instead of talking about some of
the things that they say say where does
a badge of honor and I don't necessarily
think that that is healthy I'd love to
talk more about that but I'd love for us
to talk about all of the things that
have happened to get it out in the air
and to get people to realize that it
wasn't like this isolated incident but
pretty much every woman that I have
talked to has a conference Horror Story
or has a work drinking Horror Story or
there's always a story that they are
maybe embarrassed or ashamed about a
talking but let's make it great to just
put it out there so we know that it's
actually happening and then let's talk
constructively about ways that we can
make the place better for people to
enjoy conferences like this and the
network and I mean this is a great
learning experience overall but how can
you learn when you're in a constant
state of worrying about and being afraid
right right like how do we get you out
of that set mindset and I was asked
where sort of work on that and to get it
out cool thank you so much that's really
thanks I having me yes it was wonderful
conversation thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
