going to talk about Internet your things
The Riddler international internet of
people you have a person of device an
internet connection and advice he used
to be a tablet a laptop a desktop
television even a game consoles access
internet intellectual things is almost
the same thing but instead of having a
person you have a thing plus a device
plus an internet connection and more and
more things are being connected to the
internet like trees house cars drones
and objects are part of the internet
nowadays internet your things is a
really big market and you can take an
advantage of that more than funny a
billion devices will be connecting the
internet your things in 2020 in 10 years
actually I like this picture here we can
see a lot of good opportunities to make
the world better and it smarter like a
monitoring water wasting like monitoring
your health your your heart can be
monitored all the time with internet
your things
some examples like this is mark then it
actually runs java and we can think
about Jesus mark pen accessing the
internet you translate some text that
someone writing a language and want to
translate to another language we did
this popcorn machine is a very
inspirational project to show how you
can have a very simple and regular
device like a popcorn card machine
connected to the Internet so you can
control using voice you can tweet when
you have a fresh popcorn and you can
think about a lot of popcorn todaro
ideas we have this nice turtle it's a
wireless turtle and we have many
different countries monitoring animals
and make the world better by monitoring
animals and taking care about and
studying
and preserving some types of special
very special animals and in us we had
forests with trees that they used to
monitor actually using a java board with
a jam out to cheap and 3G connection and
a salido meter sensor so if someone just
cut the tree the tree is able to send a
message using 3g saying hello i need i
need some help someone is cutting me so
it's kind of smart forest which is a
very very nice idea and even this funny
example of international things like to
eat be imagined that it can be the first
user job the next generation of the
internet so if you think about our
computer computer for people they are
very powerful they used to consume a lot
of energy are we don't take care about
the energy consumption in our regular
computer we have large amount of memory
Bluetooth connection wireless internet
connection and so they are very complete
you can run multiple tasks you can
install multiple software's and you can
plug USB devices like printers scanners
cameras but the computer for the things
they are very very small we take care
about the energy consumption because
it's a very important thing because we
will have thousands of that type of
computer running in a forest to monitor
thousands of trees and we use to have a
single-board computer single-board
computer is a board with all the other
boards that you need to have a complete
computer or eating we can have a
microcontroller as a computer for
internet your things if you just want to
open and close a gator door you don't
need a very big computer so a
microcontroller can solve your problem
and sometimes most of the times actually
we have dedicated computers and
sometimes we don't have even the
operational system running that and
different from the computer of people we
want to blow sensors we want to control
motors relays appliances in our house
they aren't USB device so in the
internet your things computer we have a
special kind of input and output
interface color gpio we will be talking
about gpio soon and we can have these
special types of sensors plug it in the
Internet of Things
computers but we have new challenge we
need a new architecture paradigms
because we have the embedded in one
handing in the other hand we have the
cloud computing so we want to have all
the sensors and other control about
embedded devices publish Adam the cloud
computing system database it's a lot of
data that we need to take care we need
to process that data and we need to make
some conclusions to have smart device
Rio a smart device security is more
internal important than ever we also
need massive updates dynamic updates of
our software if you just have a software
with a bug and you need to update you
have thousands of devices and you need
to think about it more than ever and we
don't have a standard for the computers
and different from the personal
computers the computers for things they
vary a lot and we have different branch
different types of architectures
different operational system so it's a
really real big challenge some facts
it's a big and emerging market we have
new opportunities if you are creating
your own business you can think about
many different ideas will improve the
do it your self future that is very
popular all around the world and it's
even more fun than the regular internet
because instead of talking with people
you are talking with your help with your
plans you are feeding your animals so
you can have a lot of fun at the same
time that you can create a business
project and most of the cases you will
need some electronics or embedded
knowledge and we are help we are here to
help you with that so to finish I would
like to share some useful turns around
internet your things like SOC
system-on-chip these are integrated
circuit with the computer inside that
cheap so it make easy for the industry
to create single board computers based
on system-on-chip integrated circuits
machine-to-machine m2m is another time
it's very similar to IOT and I believe
that is kind of a business term or more
cooperative term about IOT but it means
almost the same thing and IOT gateway
think about some infrared device that
you want to control so infrared isn't a
protocol
allow it in the internet we cannot
connect something with infrared in the
internet so we have some gateway that
translate the infrared commands to
tcp/ip so by this way the Gateway can
help the infrared device to be connected
on the Internet so that's our
international things introduction and in
the next video we will be talking about
Java and how Java is prepared for
Internet your odd things marker thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
