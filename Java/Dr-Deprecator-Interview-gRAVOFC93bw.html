technology Network we're here alive on
the floor javaone you can tell with all
the noise going on behind us getting
more more exciting as the day goes on
and I've got Stuart marks do it delight
to have you here explain to me the law
firm I'm a little confused okay so this
is my doctor deprecated ur persona okay
okay i need a lower than alright so the
Java platform has had a i should say
thanks for having me here Tori oh it's a
delight know you're here okay so so the
Java platform has had this notion of
deprecation for very long time as
introduced way back in gtk 1.1 in
nineteen ninety seven or so implies so a
bunch of things have been deprecated
over the years but it's kind of it's
kind of confusing and disorganized and
so my emphasis is that there needs to be
some effort put into this to get that
background in excellent I think it's a
book concept it just hasn't been
executed here okay so things have been
deprecated but they're still floating
around and they're still functional
you're still summarize we all very
dependent yeah there's there's a lot of
things that have been deprecated that
people are still depending on but there
have been a lot of things that have been
deprecated for completely different
reasons and so so the meaning of
deprecation has been heated ah master
dies I suppose so i can use that we're
on as a family show it's still all right
okay so right so you you are going to
single-handedly do this I have some
ideas I think we need to need to we need
to create some better organization
around what it means to for something to
be deprecated there's a bunch of
different reasons you need to
pick them all apart for them again they
say things make more sense and i think
there's this notion that something is
deprecated it's going to be removed at a
certain point and that's true in some
cases but in fact nothing has actually
ever been removed or no api is relegated
api's have actually ever been rumoured
to a certain extent that's a good thing
because i'd like to say that that
removing something is the ultimate
binary compatibility it's the ultimate
source incompatible yes true so that's
that's why we're very reluctant to to
actually remove things at the same time
having something deprecated saying we're
going to remove it and then never
removing it just it's essentially very
dissonant position yeah that's kind of a
mixed message isn't it so you see
there's there's some things some dynamic
tension here so if you want to move
forward you've gotta you know sometimes
you have to throw a few things off the
chill right so there are some things
that really do need to be removed and
got some ideas for some stuff that
actually some API is unnatural e will be
removed in GDP non-pilots right yeah
this is this problem this is the sort of
pre-announcement it's actually an
OpenJDK okay the early modularization
work actually removed some AP is in
order to break dependencies across
modules so that was necessary because if
you want to an API dependency is almost
impossible to I mean the only way to
break it is to remove it right right
right the only way and in order to
separate modules you need to have--you
dependencies under control okay so
that's really a jigsaw ah ok so to
enable modular ization there's something
so Oracle or the java community really
needs to take out yeah right hello and
if you go look at openjdk they've been
taken out already ah ok so you get JD
canine the current development bills
that stuff to be taken out so what's the
best way for a developer to get a sense
of what these bad boys are going to be
how to get involved again no no you
absolutely can't this going well all
this stuff is in the open but there's an
immense amount of information about
opportunity came so I think how do you
how would you find out about this stuff
I know that there are well one is we do
have the preview bills right so okay
earlier this year we ship to GTA right
and so we immediately pretty pretty
close to me in fact even before Jayde
engage we started opening the source
repository for GD 9 and we've been doing
builds from those and pushing them out
pretty regularly okay so you should grab
those really builds run your ass or you
yeah even try to compile and then there
yeah so it's the same thing the builds
we have binaries out there sources of
course in the repository also complete
javadoc sense and you know the thing is
I don't know if there's any really good
place you can go that says we have
removed these api I don't know if recent
release notes yet okay so that might be
difficulty um it's kind of obscure stop
it's like dependencies of javabeans on
ewt do you think about it beans is sort
of a that's a component architecture so
why does it have a dependency on this
user interface light rock right so it's
those kind of thing there's a good
reason at the time yeah yeah well either
wise thought of the system as one big
monolithic a big ball of mine right then
it doesn't matter where the dependencies
are try to modularize it and what
happens is you get these dependencies I
gave them but with the client stuff in
one module put beans in a different font
right you know right there are these
dependences going across that's one that
comes to mind they're all of that flavor
where you look at it's like oh yeah that
is a very audio entity and so they are
kind of on the obscure side but if your
application uses them you'll get
compilation because yeah if you
recompile cuz those aprs are right right
okay so I see your twitter handle is
down here dr. generators Stalin
deprecated so that's a great way to get
information right is to follow your
twitter handle yeah yeah i am you as is
typical on twitter there's it's mostly
smart and clever clever i enjoy watching
that but it would be a good person to
talk to us terms of getting more
information about this yes i think so i
could certainly find that information
out for it and certainly if a developer
has a you know hankering to help you out
with this right join the community and
i'll clean out some of these weird
dependencies so Java can move forward
certainly with jigsaw and get that
modularization which will allow a lot of
good things yeah I think so yeah yeah I
think mainly overall it's this idea that
the I think there's a lot of so that so
i'm going to talk on this on wednesday
okay here we go toss me a lot ready come
six 377 debt and deprecation and in my
mind that's what dr. deprecated ER is
all about death as in technical death
right thank you if you look at this
right we were talking earlier about this
idea of deprecation and say we're going
to do something that never
stuff hangs around it's pretty cool this
time I really mean it well maybe for
some things I think what we need to do
is normalize things and make things come
through it it's like if we're going to
take something out we should say so and
then take it out and have a consistent
process but there there are some things
where you know it's deprecated but we
actually don't intend to take take it
out and you should say that too so and
the fact that this is unclear they're
confused things r de sparked that's a
part of technical death right there's
messiness in our API right that needs to
be cleaned up so that's what dr.
deprecated is all about so to wednesday
three clock right now somebody some of
you play yeah yeah you somebody a okay
all right you can hear me talk about
that in more debt yeah and I hope that
that's going to be captured I think so I
drink that every every talk at the
conference is going to be reporting on
it will give you more information about
that's it but thank you stuart you're
here at javaone come to the hottest or
it'll be here then good-looking man in
the law coat look at work oh yeah no I
don't know if he's going to go up to a
seat no no no this is actually real
stethoscope although it's not luring I'm
gonna use it in anger it recognize me by
my doctor deprecated may involve
excellent excellent Hey look for me
around the hub or on the you know
conference rooms or I'll be a java
brother one all week great thank you
very much for your ability to talk to
you this is Tori wheel with the Oracle
technology Network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
