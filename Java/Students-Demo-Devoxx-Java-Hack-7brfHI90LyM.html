technology Network we're here at devoxx
and we've done some hacks with raspberry
pi and other applications so I'm talking
to members of the java community tell me
your name my name is Glenda Rekha and
where are you from I'm from looting in
nice and your name I'm Benjamin pitted
islands I'm from here our van huh nice
and you guys are students students at at
the University of filkins in Austin nice
so tell me about your hack what you work
done we worked on a distance sensor that
is based on fuzzy logic it will tell you
later on it will tell you if you are far
away from its that based on a sound and
you will see the the meters in it okay
so let's take a look at your hack here
can you walk us through it first of all
this is an are doing board this will
this is the distance sensor is connected
to it and this is the distance sensor
and the alderman board is connected to
the Raspberry Pi it runs totally on
local and be if if you do this on the
screen it's very visible because it's
small you will you will see the
centimeters you are away from the sensor
and later on it will say a text if you
are far away and or close and also there
will be a sound that will tell you how
in approximately how far you are that
was a really cool hack so tell me before
this hackathon did you have any
experience with raspberry pi not really
just using it as a media center the
okay Wow and you said you're going to do
something with this project yes we will
be using it as a project formats at our
school it was a project based on fuzzy
logic Wow very cool so we've got fuzzy
logic new technology Raspberry Pi Java
all going together so thank you for your
time I really enjoyed it thank you all
right the story wheel with the Oracle
technology Network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
