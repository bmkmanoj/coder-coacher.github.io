alright so welcome back 2nite hacking
this is part three in malmo and we are
going to play around with the Raspberry
Pi so quick introduction for folks new
to the stream the way this works is go
to night hacking com watch our live
streams or sign up to one of the events
in person and you can also watch
recordings on the java youtube channel
and today we have pardoned martin who
did some really cool demonstrations of
web view and javafx demos and their
their future bicycle tour presentation
yeah we saw a preview of something which
which might actually do not actually
happen but the only way you're going to
find those see those is if you go back
and watch the recorded streams yeah that
I yank on web site X acting all right
and then now we are going to play around
with this guy well this guy's relative I
have to unplug him to hold them up to
the camera alright well we'll live
dangerously here when you have
everything set up that's when you should
unplug it right we did that's once
everything was working then we decided
to reboot the computer I decided to
really be mature and nothing ever work
again nope so yeah good luck alright so
here is a Raspberry Pi in a very stylish
transparent case that was custom laser
cut by one of the guys on a DevOps crew
so this is this is another you had to be
there in person to to get it and for
those of you don't know much about the
Raspberry Pi hardware well I should I
should probably just I actually I've
been working on on my slides for forge a
focus and they actually describe this
stuff better than I can so you can just
put them up there and we can see it back
in redox for what exactly nice hopefully
but you guys you guys are the testbed
for stuff which I'm trying
and first we get the nice picture in
picture picture and picture and picture
okay here's my slides are they showing
up somewhat
okay now they're showing up in a window
and there is a raspberry pi that's how
raspberry PI's are actually created you
take a little coffee you take a little
raspberry sprinkle some magic wrinkle
yeah sprinkle some magic so this guy has
on him these are all the jacks listed
but he has an audio jack audio out
composite composite video to hook it up
to a TV or hdmi and the hdmi supports
full 1920 x 1080 the hard drive is an SD
card so you can have up to 32 gigabytes
but four gigabytes is enough to run the
basic linux distribution it's powered
off USB recommended to have seven
hundred milliamps but we're gonna we're
going to live on the edge and run it on
500 because I don't have that many USB
ports on my computer USB ports only
surprise supply 500 milliamps each so
you have to use a while if you want to
get enough power for a PI off your
laptop most cell phone chargers are
quite good enough for the job though
ethernet for network connectivity a
couple USB guys mush I on camera yeah
and there's quite a lot of stuff on the
board so you have GPIO pins you can use
to control servos their motors you have
some I don't even know what these guys
are are for but um which we call it jtag
headers sure sure actually on my board
they don't even have headers so they're
just places you could solder your own
headers to Wow yeah okay so nobody
really uses those there's a reason you
have yours in a case speaking speaking
of things nobody use there's anybody
have a pie ya know okay there's a couple
there's a couple extra slots on top here
but I have them highlight on the screen
back there
and so the question is what are what are
those for do what do you guys for you
guys for dodger yes connecting to the
public most descriptive answer adding
some kind of display maybe yeah yeah
display any other ideas no no so it's
actually one is one is a camera port and
the other one is a displayport so i get
a sticker well almost but because
currently neither of them are actually
supported so I way to get the sticker in
the future so they're all miss deacon
yes I guess I guess the deal is the they
to use either port you have to have
access to some of the GPU code that
broadcom which makes the chip would have
to do proprietary stuff with and they
haven't released an official raspberry
pi camera or display that works with a
port soon so they're entirely useless
they look kind of good I mean yeah now
others what somebody asked me once what
those ports were for it I didn't know
but my answer is probably that as good
as it gets because they're really not
good for anything okay so that's the
Raspberry Pi and this is incredibly
inexpensive raspberry PI's are you know
35 USD so what's that in swedish crowns
30 is 200 nice turn joy trick okay oh
yeah probably yeah so so that's like
that's like the cost of like a lunch
here yes I guess maybe I'm gonna hang
out in tourist traps to do the problem
ya know or maybe not yeah but it's a
very inexpensive device and it's great
for experimenting because you can
actually you can run java on it so I i
have full instructions for how to set up
your own pie on my blog the URL is back
there nicely obscured by my head but um
if you go to Steve on Java comp which is
my blog you'll you'll find it's one of
more recent entries and it's really easy
so step one install Linux there's a nice
distribution that comes and then you
install and burn it onto your SD card
from someone as standard images and
you're good to go I mean yeah slightly
more complicated than that but not too
bad step 2 download the java EA and copy
it over to your SD card so as of
december there's now a java 8 army a
that's available for download on the
oracle website and it supports well
raspberry pi and javafx so we could we
could you could try writing your demo
sure on the Raspberry Pi cool I would
love that let's let's do that sure again
it's funny because this is so much more
powerful than the computers we head back
then yes in this format which is
interesting here popular option pop your
jar file on the USB stick then we'll
give it a try and you can deploy well
it's ready deploy and run javafx apps on
this this level this little guy
okay so that's that's how to set up the
pie and there's a little bit of info i
had about java effects like how to get
job effects but you could be talked
about this java 7 comes with javafx now
yep and then how to develop javafx and
you saw these guys using NetBeans what
both much beam sender kips at eclipse
okay yeah so and you can use IntelliJ
and any jdeveloper fans okay well we'll
we'll edit that out add some up roles
like yay yeah and you can build
applications visually which um you guys
showed that as well yeah okay but I
think showing cool demos this is
actually one of the demos we did at
devoxx for the signage so we had this
animation running at full 1920 x 1080
with flying ships and the latest
information pulled down off a REST API
at the at each of the rooms in front of
each of the rooms so you knew what
session was going on at dev box and this
was all run off raspberry PI's hooked up
to TVs there's lotsa and it's also cool
I don't know it looked really good yeah
I mean with a cool perspective and
things moving back and forth you
wouldn't guess thats whats run of a
computer this big yeah it was pretty
good ok so we're we're going to see if
we can get the sky up up and running so
hdmi out sure why not power so I not
recommend it at home but I'm powering it
off of 500 milliamp USB socket hopefully
that demo doesn't you never know doesn't
tax this poor little processor and you
can see the status lights blinking here
so one's kind of power one is activity
on the SD card and then 34 network
random things
just like when you plug into a I'm
socket on a computer and if we're lucky
let's see if we're lucky oh wow it
actually it came back up we've got high
output not bad
okay so you can actually you actually
see it's actually booting this is the
the pie booting up just like a normal
linux machine we can log into it very
secure login here can anyone anyone want
to take a venture a guess at what the so
when you're using the PI and you're
using a keyboard it helps to pop that
was a durability test it helps to
actually plug in your USB device okay so
the user IDs pie hi now there we go
oh that's cute okay I know what's
happening so we have a cute little
wireless capture card here a tarot deck
and apparently there's a bad a 10-second
delay so it works just a little slowly
there we go so be able to find the oh
you're putting your pudding you're
putting together a jar file as we speak
all right while he's doing that I can
show you some other hi demos which I've
been playing with it the other user
groups
okay so what do we got here java forum
UIC with the java forum guys what we did
a java forum for some live coding so the
way you you run pi applications is the
job of commands and i don't have it in
my path but it's under on this machine
it's under ops think it's JDK 18 wait
for 10 seconds wow wow that's really
painful yeah okay jdk 1.8 point zero
then Java you need to run it as root
because it uses the OpenGL egl pipeline
so I'm just going to put sudo at the
beginning so it runs his route and then
you have to pass in a flag for what the
platform it's running on right now the
only supported platform is like i
mentioned egl it doesn't support X
Windows or other ways of writing it so
it takes over the whole frame buffer but
oh shoot that's really bad I didn't
click left far enough so pseudo end up
in the middle my commands but what you
need to add to the commands is most
control see you again sudo hops shady
shady
hey
shift javafx you have to add JavaFX dot
platform equals e GL FB and then I'll
run it in the OpenGL pipeline and
finally give it your jar dash jar and
we'll run the close java forum tests
ok
so now I got to get the cursor back and
fix the opt udk 18
see I'm killing time for you guys to
catch up with the jar file oh it's going
to be like half an hour so don't worry
I've got your back so this is a good
exercise like this would be fun like
doing a coding contest where your screen
is 10 seconds delayed from it would be
it would be a good challenge for folks
to see like every how how good of a
hacker you really are so how's it going
nothing not so good that's so good I'm
failing miserably here but this is you
have installed job application Assam to
this before no can you talk a bit about
how to do that Tori's that's something
you know that's a that's a trade secret
all right okay so you have to buy them
from you yeah yeah now so there's two
ways you can get stuff onto the
Raspberry Pi one is you can use a USB
stick like what we're playing good now
the other one is you can hook up a
network connection and then you use
secure copy or secure ftp to do files
over all right that command looks pretty
good let's try running it and actually
something else you can do this is
probably where I should have started
with this rather than trying to do this
on terminal you can hook up ssh to a
window on your desktop computer and then
type the commands and a terminal and
that way I wouldn't have any delay okay
so there you can see OpenGL pipeline
start up welcome to Java forum
Gothenburg it was so fast I mean
did you see how he does it and there it
is yeah that it was it was great but
that's cool I'm not gonna all right so
so just to just to prove how much fun
this is do I have a volunteer for
somebody who wants to try to click the
button with a 10-second delay on a track
pad oh we have a volunteer here thank
you see just yes aim for the button
let's go I'm gonna get back to you on
that but I tried to cheat I tried to
press ENTER but yeah yeah I was right on
spot pretty good I didn't kick though so
oh there it is oh okay you did it you
did it yeah it's actually that that
button yeah sticker for you that button
was wired up to exit the application
because one of the questions I got in
Gothenburg was how do you quit out of a
javafx application control C doesn't
work because javafx picks up all the
keystrokes in your application and you
wouldn't you wouldn't want someone's
accidentally hit ctrl-c and like you
know exit out of your fancy GUI
application but what you can do is
either put a menu or a button or
something in your application to quit
and wire it up to wire daddy how do you
quit in javafx you just quit oh you mean
no in the code yeah I medication will
add terminates something I have also
complete I don't have to think its
application notes XXX exits oh yeah
sticker no no nothing but it's yeah and
the other way you can exit is you can
actually kill the process from another
you know terminal window all right
speaking another terminal window I'm
going to hook up an Ethernet connection
to this so we can terminal into it and
then show you guys how to use secure FTP
and ssh
alright let's see what our IP address is
so it's a full linux distribution you
can use your favorite commands like
ifconfig okay internet address is 1001
seven got my desktop again SSH Oh
question yeah so ask the question I'll
repeat it for the stream since the i'm
using this my gun stream okay so
question is if you can open up a samba
share on the pie too I guess blue files
yeah and yeah you that's one way you
could do it ftp is probably easier since
setting up samba especially since i'm on
mac yeah yeah samba would work no now
you can you can absolutely do it oh and
i forgot the number does anyone remember
the number i said before no no no
winners oh wait wait sticker here all
rights right yeah sorry i hope i hope
they have a good insurance policy 1001 7
alright so now I get our SSH we're going
to say yes to the M fingerprint type it
in alright and now we actually now we
can actually work on the pie recently ok
so how to do on that drawer file 20
minutes 20 he's having a bit he's having
some platform problems it must be that
USB stick I gave you is defective needs
very formatted sure had a virus huh yeah
inside like do you want to run this and
he was like yeah sure always yes all
right for example i have used are doing
for i/o like the GPIO pins okay so
question is what you can do with IO with
the Raspberry Pi and so I believe if you
want to use sensors or hook up something
external there's two options for how you
would configure it one is you can use
the GPIO pins which are on the board
here and you can you know hook up a
connector to censor or have it so I
think you can read the voltages or you
can set the voltage you can oscillate
the voltage on those pins to either
control something or get sensor and put
back in and there's a Java library
somebody wrote for accessing those which
jonathan Giles is going to help me out
but on a previous dream I mentioned the
name of the library since he he typed it
into chat for my benefit the other
option is you can also hook up sensors
and devices over USB and since as a full
linux distribution
you can get access to USB devices and
install drivers for you know different
devices if they have support or will
write your own device driver but that's
another way you can get access to an
external device that's as complicated as
you you can get so whose answer question
yeah so the question was oh so thanks
Jonathan the library is pi/4 J so you
can use PI for jay to access the GPIO
pins and I'm um excellent wellesley well
you already have a sticker okay but but
I I think there might be a sticker on
the floor over there which is on claims
no he's got a sticker he has his things
how about the guy who got the sticker in
the head the services to that is right
you that's your sticker I'll toss you
another one if you want for everyone
else nearby you cuz I'll never hit you
what I mean the i/o pins on the on the
pie it should be a teeth desk of this
that was some are do you know I guess
it's pretty much yeah so I think part of
the reason people use our do we know
well first it it came out sooner and
it's a lower power processor so it's
technically cheaper to like mass-produce
but the other thing is there's lots of
expansion boards and you know existing
modules people have written for the
Arduino so what a lot of people do is
they will use arduino to interface the
hard work but they'll still connect it
to a Raspberry Pi that's actually what
they did for DevOps they have thumbs up
thumbs down monitors and they had
Arduino to control some of the you know
lights blinking on the signage and then
to read the RFID but then they had the
pi actually transmitting data and
talking to the rest interface although
they told me that they would problem
we just do the whole thing and raspberry
pi next time because you if you write or
complicated application with Arduino
it's it's mostly single threaded and you
use the funky processing library so it's
hard you get weird I guess you can cut
around this but you can sometimes get
weird behavior where it's doing
something so it ignores other inputs in
it yeah they had some issues that's how
it is okay so there also was a question
on the stream about LCD support for the
pie and there's actually one company in
Israel fault chalkboard electronics
which makes an LCD panel that works with
the pie I could touch display right like
a touch display that's cool so so guess
how they did it because I mentioned the
the actual display port is broken on the
pot they what I use any want to take a
guess this is this is a sticker a
sticker worthy guess guess opportunity
which are the GPIO pins close close but
by Dwight don't use the hdmi output sir
no alright alright so that's part of it
but you're you guys sticker so you can't
buy it now and the USB port all right
yes I don't know that's right save them
for so they hook up to the hdmi port and
the USB port ends so I haven't this is
on my to-do list for my next train ride
but actually I have one of these just
sitting around surprise surprise
surprise and let me get back on camera
ah so this is actually what the little
display looks like wow and it's a
touchscreen display comes with a well it
looks exactly like you know the front
side of a tablet with all little fragile
components inside of here and it has a
little daughter board this is really
what chalkboard electronics put together
was the daughter board which hooks up to
the LCD panel tvs and then hdmi here and
USB here and auxiliary power for the
display here so you get enough power to
run the display and you get your touch
over USB and you get hdmi for the you
know pixels what what are these this is
nice I think this is a light sensor yeah
cool and you can actually you can see on
the front of the display here they have
cutouts where is it oh yeah here ya
little cutouts for camera and light
sensor so this was this was clearly
designed for a tablet and they just
decrease the tablet to make you see ya
cool okay so if someone wants to play
around this later take a look at it at
some point actually have to sit down and
make that work with Java ok so speaking
of making things work with Java you guys
have something for me sure do God amigo
gonna shrink ax and this dist folder and
the jar sure felt good
okay and we're going to use cyberduck to
copy stuff over to the pie there we go
we're back open a connection to 10 017
thanks 17
now I know quick next it's not going to
work because it does let me select
Protocol secure FTP username is pond
very secure password and when I guess
that's weird no go what do very close
very clear yes all right snicker that's
the default password for the Raspberry
Pi distribution when you grab it from
the foundation blueberry was a really
good guess I mean that was so close to
see here yeah yeah you're thinking too
hard all right so I got the amiga jar
file and let's try running it java well
wow this is much better oh yeah i may
want to do sudo first if you don't do
sudo you'll end up on the forums
complaining that stuff doesn't work not
that this happens platform egl FB and
hopefully the amiga jar has like a main
something it preloader
okay so that was the first issue amiga
preloader amigo freeloader not found
that's your this is kind of a tough oh
you know what it you know it might be so
give me the main class that should get
called and I'll adamant on the class who
have said you I geeks built amiga doc
demo one okay because what it might have
been doing is it might have been trying
but it's come right call me I guess sure
oh sure communicate what happen those
okay but i think this you're not on a
graphical terminal oh right yeah so i
wanna well I want to run it on for real
but it should start up at least javafx
top all right let's see if we can get to
start up first and then I'll deal with
one hour at a time so calm that you I
geeks
no class stuff found java flex ok ok I'm
going to add in Java specs are thr from
the javafx directory up she can't 18
java fairy Gary no yeah Jerry lib ok
effects RT and I thought displacement
map or difficult no this is yeah
go to light javafx that's good those are
interesting
okay Colin not semicolon oops
okay so now we're doing something doing
something that's good so to see the
output now you swap back over to a pie
out oh well well it's really fast on
here all right this might not be
optimized for this hardware I don't know
anything well there's um two
possibilities here so one is you were
doing a lot of you were getting a lot of
things where you were doing
transformations pleasure pixel
transformations those might not be
optimized on the egl frame buffer
pipeline the other possibility is i'm
using this capture device to capture the
pie and send it to the computer and then
the computer is then encoding it for
online streaming so i don't actually
know what the frame rate going through
all this hardware is but i assume it's
not very fast so we're probably losing
both for the stream because of I don't
have a direct hdmi out to monitor and
also perhaps the JavaFX program on pie
but we have to test by hook a monitor up
and seeing what the actual oh well we
have a monitor what I mean you're kind
of spoiled when we were working on a
computer like this because everything is
fast basically it's you don't have to
care about optimizing things yeah so I
guess here that's a bit more important
so what I should do is I should get you
guys a price you can optimize your
program definitely yep I think maybe
that's what it should be the the pie
demo contest I don't worry yeah it
raises the challenge a little definitely
it's a much more of a challenge and then
you actually have to be a bit creative
and work hard I mean half of the
I mean half of the or a big part of what
made this so hard back in the days was
that the hardware wasn't that powerful
you have to known you had to know all
these assembler tricks to shift memory
round and so on so maybe I mean maybe
that's maybe creating a graphical demo
on a pie is as close as we'll get to
what people did back in the days yeah
yeah so more pie to the people we need
to the pie yeah rather than doing it
yeah I assume that hits the CPU the way
you've done them yeah because you can
also have differences i guess on this
board you have a certain certain set of
opengl hardware accelerated i guess
maybe have everything hardware
accelerated here and not IV is usually
the fin software and the binder wine and
the optimizations are entirely different
on the bottom they are said it's an
early access as well so I think some
folks had questions they were trying on
Oh to ask so just shout out ok questions
if you can run window manager on the pie
and actually you can the the default PI
distribution will start windows well you
can choose whether it starts X Windows
or not and they don't run full no they
run a lighter-weight window manager but
it has a full menu and windowing system
and all that stuff on there so it's it's
quite functional ok mom
run we just did okay can you run look at
the question is you can you run javafx
inside of the window manager so there is
a gtk pipeline which the team is tested
internally but it's not in the early
access because it's well not as fast as
the egl pipeline and also they haven't
done as much testing on it so I'm not
sure what the plans are for releasing
the GDK pipeline but it's possible
that's actually for the lab we did in
Iceland that's what we used was the VNC
into x windows using the gtk pipeline
cool good computer but does it run a
generic and then it's
University specialized you're saying yes
some type of OpenGL destruction this
distribution why do you have all pushed
out all right so the question the
question was whether it runs full linux
distribution or not and about the OpenGL
support so well sir all right so for the
Linux distribution it uses debian linux
and there is special drivers and some
special things which they've done in
that distribution but it's in it's in a
repo and it's public and you can
download and then update off of the repo
using the standard on app to get ins and
aptitude tools there's no Ubuntu
distribution because the arm uses a v6
rather than a v7 processor and xubuntu
didn't want to backport to be 6 although
they might they might change and create
a v6 sport since the Raspberry Pi so
popular for the OpenGL stuff the the
hardware uses a power vr processor for
the GPU and really the the support for
optimization is more on the javafx side
so what acceleration we're putting into
the graphics pipeline to take advantage
of the egl pipeline rather than support
of the graphics chip whatever the power
v r sub chip supports which is going to
be the full egl spec supposedly should
chip work you just have to tune it for
the the GPU hardware to get the best
performance and we found this when we
were doing the dev ox demonstrations on
the screen so it was running at 1920 x
1080 and we were able to get a pretty
good frame rate I think we were up and
definitely above 30 I think we got it at
60 frames per second at some points but
to do that we had to be careful about
the size of textures that we were using
because it has limited memory in the GPU
so if you if you cash images which are
too big or if you do certain things
you you tend to you tend to below the
GPU and get weird artifacting or stuff
bad stuff happens so they fix some bugs
in javafx code as a result of the work
we did on the demos cool there's another
memory it's like a memory rather than
transportation memory yeah i mean i
something there's things to do the
texture sizes and what optimizations
what graphics optimizations are faster
on different GPU sets and the the team
working on stuff knows a lot more about
than i do but i know we broke it for
them oh wait wait we forgot 20 stickers
yeah Finnick can you um help me out here
because I I've been capable of it's a
broadcom amazing design oh okay maybe
I'm all right let's get you this get you
guys because i was i was looking at this
this morning to get the right
information for my own usually did all
my our shoes on white right information
we have power PR is used in in the apple
devices ipads and iphones it uses a
broadcom chip set but the graphics was
different for the for the Raspberry Pi
so let me let me find out what the video
video core that's what it is so it's not
a power vr it's a video core so it's the
broadcom chip and it's a video court for
the mega misunderstood but is over can
we do official story time yeah now we
there there specifically I mean it's a
general distribution which you know in
the future we'll work on a whole bunch
of different embedded arm based
platforms but they're specifically
testing with and doing things to make
sure that raspberry pi works really well
so the question was whether whether it's
just raspberry fire support talked about
exercise its focus with DM specific
yes it's very it's very similar to what
we do on desktop for javafx as well so
to support different graphics cards for
hardware acceleration the Prison
Pipeline they need to test and make
optimizations and essentially different
cases based upon your your hardware to
get the best performance and that's also
limitation OpenGL ES that has to be
followed to let me to the ground that's
an OpenGL in general isn't it right
there ok alright so somebody here who
knows more about cheaper than the rest
of us yeah you just accept it like yeah
ok you earned your sticker yeah but you
also use to the pandaboard rights for
the Java one day kiosks I mean no yeah
we yeah I was helping Jasper enriched
with the call for the kiosk as well
because that that was not the Raspberry
Pi right yes we use well more Shantell
all right so this guy slightly larger
than the Raspberry Pi but it uses the
same or similar chipset it uses an arm
v7 processor this is the Panda board and
he is more powerful graphics well
processor was this is power BR ok
alright thanks and this uses a power
rizzy you guys are miked so i can look
good by repeating what yourself that's
good so this uses a power via our
graphics read me chipset and it's what
it's what we were using for the kiosk
demo we had the schedule blur hooked up
to a touch screen and then this was
driving it off of javafx talking to
back-end servers to pull the schedule
back and then you could interact with
the schedule running on this hooked up
to a touchscreen which was a really cool
demo I think of embedded javafx yeah it
was it was a lot of fun to to build Jim
Weaver and I assisted but we were
torqued by the the graphics prowess of
Jasper and who isn't I mean enriched at
some point Richard bear the chief
architect for javafx he just hero be
wrote the whole athens like me at all
like pretty and clean its performance so
yeah those guys are monsters alright
cool well we've we've I think we've
overrun our welcome here at food cafe
that they're going to close the doors oh
it's probably not but many people have
people either get things to do but
thanks a lot for for coming out for the
light acquisition yeah what'swhat's a
fun keeping and before oh yeah we
actually have something for you we've
been thinking yes that's it traveling
around the world and I know that you you
you've been away from the family for
four days now that you're going to be
away for like no you mean my relatives
who live in the Bay Area yeah yeah yeah
yeah and i have ever wife who I visit
occasionally yeah yeah and kids and you
have a kid and you have a motorcycle yes
so we know what's more most important
wife kids and motorcycles that's kind of
why our talent this is our way of saying
saying thank you for coming and
and thanks for having us and we know
your purchase a chocolate motorcycle as
for wind you can eat us supposedly it's
actually good chocolate as well it's not
nothing in this actually this is really
well done this list not too far from the
one I was riding on my night hacking
tour it looks like a BMW nice yeah we
buy quality stuff alright thank you
thank you guys for being I'm sorry thank
you right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
