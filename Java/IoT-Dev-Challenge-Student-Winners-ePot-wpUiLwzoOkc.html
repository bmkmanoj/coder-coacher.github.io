Network and I'm here today with the IOT
developer challenge winners from the
students category and so thank you for
being with us so Maddie and Maddie so
how how was the project what is the
project about so first of all I want to
say thank you to open for this
opportunity to be here today as the
winner of ITA challenge 2014 students
category so our project is about small
garden name it eport how that works
really it's so easy you see this box
users just should put it beside us and
all things going everywhere so this
system will control it remotely
automatically via verde plant this is
the first mode we have also another mode
so so that I'm clear accuses with plants
with their smartphones so and for that
we have created mobile application that
until I automatically with the system to
provide features to users to control
remotely their plans from their
smartphones what else you know when we
talk about the plans three they are a
huge difference you and difference
between them so for that we have a
database contains more than 4,000 kind
of plants and this system will take on
consideration each point each type and
provides the the main feature two ish
past depends to the coin so how easy was
the project to be developed and Reba is
first it's so difficult to find the idea
after that we make
some firm we collect some information
for us we work with on antair Kelly
doable for this birthday there are no
information so we developed a nappy for
this world to connect gpo the pins with
the data then we used this a P so it's
so that's the flea difficulty for the
displeasure so it's a nappy that you
developed exactly you know first of all
as you said the most difficult and the
most important is the idea it's not easy
to to ready to find an ambition this
first of all and second of all the API
so we have we used until gala to pour in
which they are java email a but what we
have seen that they are some pins don't
exist or the communication is not exist
in Intel Galileo board so for that we
have created an API to make the clinic
when the communication between them this
is the most difficult part of the whole
project so how did you learn about the
project the challenge we are students

lot of challenge
