technology Network we're on the floor of
devix talking to members of the divx
community and today we're talking big
data so i bought the big data experts
Nathan Nathan tell me your name hey I am
Nathan balance yes and and his fellow
million okay and your company is it's
called data crunches and we are a big
data consultancy agency located in
Belgium okay so big data is hot but I'm
not sure I know what it is so give me
albida is mostly defined by 3 v's by
volume velocity and variety being hanged
the V of volume we see an ever
increasing volume off of data around us
we see a trenta from from going from
terabytes into petabytes if you have a
look at the velocity there is a neat
wing companies to analyze data when it's
coming in or flowing through your
organization why because you want to
have a competitive advantage of being
able to get the insides first if you
want to increase or decrease your prices
of your projects and so on and then we
have the variety meaning that we are
also enters the next to the structured
data that we find within relational
databases we are also getting more and
more interested in seeing or getting
inside out of unstructured data like
Word documents PDFs web content images
video and so on right if you are calls
API called you like Excel who the techie
is here great so tell me if I'm a Java
developer and i'm interested in Big Data
where's a place to start I think to a
lot of big data communities
being created I did Hadoop user groups
or in Belgium we have a big data of
being community and everywhere in the
world are rising fast and if you want to
look at the technologies but there's a
bit a big hype i had no sequel well
actually a couple of years ago to hide
fuss about no sequel now now it's more
about no and sequel right but I think
good starting points to really get into
big data is of course Hadoop and the
whole a dupe stature right right so tell
me a mistake you see or something when
they first get in what's the thing they
do wrong that you can prevent them from
doing I letting them know ideally you
should start with a with a simple use
case that will will actually solve a
business a business problem and to enter
will create value that's a typical a
dupe adoption pattern that we see start
out with something small with a small
data set well small big data set try to
get it into production get it in
production and then naturally what we
see is that other departments get
getting with their IDs with their data
set so that the ID is growing and
expanding throughout the DD organization
so you just did a session what was the
mayor session I did a session about a
real time art architecture using Hadoop
and storm so in my talk I presented the
combination of using a batch system like
Hadoop combined with something for
real-time processing called storm to
create a system that's boast accurate
scalable
and in real time well so tell me one of
the best questions you got at the end of
the year say what the motivations yeah
the limitations of and I think the
limitations of our of course that II
country hey why you can do everything in
your bachelor we can do any calculation
but you're in your speed layer your
limited because you don't really have
all data available you just have a
limited window of data and because of
this you might need to do some
estimations or other tricks to get to
get a working and scaling wall well
that's cool well thank you very much it
gives me a good taste and it sounds like
the thing to do is find a big data user
group and go out there and check it out
right thank you for dropping by Dan
Fortuna thank you for having us this is
