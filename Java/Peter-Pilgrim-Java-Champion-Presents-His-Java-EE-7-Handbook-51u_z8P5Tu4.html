doing for us Wow okay and so it's all
about EE 7 and how developers can get
the most out of it yes right so give me
one tip that's in the book well one good
tip is to look at I guess like jax-rs
and some of the synchronous input and
output for surf nets and restful
services yeah so there's a lot of good
stuff in there so I talk about how the
the applications how you write
applications in the new way I'd rather
than concentrating on the older
traditional j2ee the ejb big stuff for
ya i do cover ejb and so yeah I do when
I concentrate on the newest stuff a lot
more yeah and there's a world exclusive
I am ok i do a second book which is a
working title which is still fuzzy in
the end yeah but that's going to cover
more Webbie stuff so that cup of things
like javaserver faces which isn't in
this book at the moment right now so so
