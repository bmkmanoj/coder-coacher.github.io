aura dev and this is my first interview
of hora de my first time attending or
dev and I have here with me my friend
Ivar grimstead hello I'm are hello
thanks for joining me here on the stage
and appropriate that you're my first
interviewee since you are from malmö
and we are here in Malmo you're living
in Malmo that is yeah because you're
actually originally from Norway yeah yes
I live in Sweden for quite a long time
now raise all right so tell me a little
bit about why or dev is special to you
I'd like to know that first since that's
my first time attending this conference
just arrived here at the conference menu
this morning still getting a feel for it
just keep tell us briefly what what's
special about or a dev yep first of all
it's special to me since it's here in my
hometown what I really like about this
conference is that it's it's so diverse
it's not a Java only a conference that
we usually go to or at least what I
usually go to it it's any technology
it's microsoft technologies its agile
sirt it's everything so it's very
diverse conference and it's cool venue
it's um yeah it is hey that's good feel
like a violin yeah it's true I've been
here less than an hour in the venue and
I'm enjoying the vibe here and the
atmosphere the menu really cool and talk
to some speakers I've never spoken with
before do some interviews here
throughout the next couple days so I'm
looking forward to it what are you
speaking about here a torrid of this
week or this week I have two talks today
we're going to talk about oracle jet
with you which is a java javascript
extension tool kit from Oracle which is
open source and we will actually show
how to do this with Java technology so
we were doing JavaScript application
with Java and that's pretty cool it's
joint talk with the Tony apple from dig
script so I'm looking forward to that
hey tomorrow I'm doing a talk on a JSR
bear arm in Walden which is the embassy
chase or okay it's gonna make sighting
right now is this the same talk that you
did in Morocco no it's not that
different time yeah okay so this is
actually our second conference together
this month we're at devoxx Morocco
together last week so two new talks that
you're doing here yeah this week they
sound really cool I mean I'm gonna be
here so I'm not gonna have a chance now
see you then you can you can probably
watch them online up for it but yes i'll
watch the online afterwards so also this
week the exciting thing that's happening
is we have the JCP elections when he
tell us a little bit about your
involvement with the JCP and kind of
what you've gotten out of it and how its
evolved over time yeah so yeah I'm a
member of the JSP and I've been a member
of the several extras groups for the jrs
and this year it oh this week it's the
dr said the the elections for the
executive committee and I'm running for
one of the associates it's there and so
the reason why I'm in the JCP is that
the technology will working with this is
yet it affects your daily life all the
time and and this is a good opportunity
to actually influence how the technology
evolves and be part of the community
that actually drives a technology
forward mm-hmm well I just think it's
really interesting that when I spoke to
you that you said you've been a JCP
member for quite a while so maybe just
maybe just share a little bit of insight
into kind of you know your motivation
for joining and then kind of how the
benefits have grown over time from being
joining and becoming a JCP member and
then you know participating on an expert
group and now making the decision that
you're more involved you want to devote
more time to it you want to actually be
on the JCP executive committee the you
know kind of like the board of directors
of the JCP and that kind of a
evolutionary path that you've had i
think that will help other developers
who maybe are thinking about maybe i
should join the JCP maybe I shouldn't
what exactly is it yeah well first of
all I join the JC page because I had
some some friends that were involved in
jai Soros and I was just curious what is
this about and I
joined creating my profile and and
signed the papers and everything and
become a member and then I kind of
forgot about it I knew about it but I
didn't feel I was kind of mature enough
to actually do something in the expert
groups but after a while when I worked
for the technology for a long time under
this new embassy specific engine came up
and I've done my fair deal of
development with several embassy
frameworks and I said it this is
somewhere I can actually contribute to
something so I just fill in the form to
join the expert group and there you go
yeah so give your experience and kind of
make the technology better that you're
already working with and provide your
real world feedback yeah okay and now
writing for the executive committee one
what we have six more days for JCP
members to vote so I always encourage
once you do join the JCP actually
participate in the elections it's really
important to determine who is going to
be on the executive committee for the
next couple of years so encouraging able
to do that yeah and when you do vote
then vote for me and of course don't
confuse this with the the other
elections going on around over a pulley
those are over there over here but we do
have lots more interviews going on here
today and tomorrow morning we're gonna
have a special interview here early with
some of the members of the netbeans
dream team and we're gonna have some fun
here on the stage about four or five of
us talking netbeans yeah that's gonna be
really fun it's a party in the morning
so looking forward to my next couple of
days here thanks again for sharing what
you're here to speak with us about it or
a dev and a little bit more about the
JCP I really appreciate your comments on
that thanks for having me ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
