calm I'm doing live javaone interviews
with different speakers who are going to
be at the Java one San Francisco
conference from September 22nd through
September 26th right now I have with me
Reza ramen the Java EE evangelist Hayden
Reza hey good man so everyone hi
everyone i'll do so if you're on the if
you're on the chat feel free to ask us
questions and then we'll answer them as
we go along and we're just going to chat
about some of the things which what
you're doing it at javaone Reza so what
what do you what do you have in store
for us at the upcoming event a lot of
stuff actually you know this is
obviously going to be a big year for for
EE and lost fish with the e7 release and
the and glossary for release so we're
pretty excited about it lots of content
hopefully people can see what we've been
up to you know these past few years and
finally see that is also what we did in
our Java I guess it's a big deal so that
was how about how many years was that in
the making oh it was a quite a while it
was almost three and a half years Wow
with the of course that includes the the
you know you can imagine the realignment
time to figure out the chemistry between
Sun and an Oracle and whatnot but and
there was some delays due to due to
figuring out and finally referring the
cloud features and the like janna late
ic7 took quite a while but it was great
to see that Oracle finally pushed it out
to the the open because it was taking
forever and her son to actually get the
release out sure but I mean the e7
releases is actually a very very nice
release I think you know looking back it
back at the history and you know I've
been around the ecosystem for a long
time and this is by far the biggest
release in terms of total content and
it's a timely release because it's so
doing things like aligning with the
html5 specs as well as doing the
necessary things that we need to
continue doing with the namely
you know making it a lot more productive
adding some filling some gaps that we
needed to do for example the batch API
and things like the concurrency
utilities and the like I'm really
actually most impressed personally with
all the refactoring work we've done
increase productivity like JMS to is one
of my favorites but that guess just a
phenomenal change cool so what sort of
stopped reading a Java one I have some
websites which you wanted to show off to
the UM to the viewers yeah so first we
should start with the aquarium because
you know basically if you go to the
aquarium you can keep track of all of
the stuff we're doing at javaone and all
the other stuff that's coming up right
now basically all of the links that
we'll talk about in the next few minutes
you know you can get to all of those
links from the aquarium so that's
definitely worth looking at so there's a
little entry here that says why join the
java one last wish community event we'll
talk about that and second there's an
entry for for example you know joining
the GlassFish party we shouldn't talk
about in just a sec and also but
basically if you want to find out
anything about Java and Java one and
glass fish you know that's your go-to
psycho it's a blog store tour achoms /
black barium and I maintain that stated
all right so second site you want to
talk about was the Java the GlassFish
community event absolutely so if you're
a fan of glass efficient job ie this is
really the event that you should go to I
think most people already know about
that anyway you know it sort of been a
tradition these past few years sort of a
rallying point of you know everyone
thats related to the glass fiction java
ecosystem to get together and kind of
kick off javaone it's a Sunday use a
group event and it's a little bit more
laid back in your general session that
we've got lots of lots of content packed
in if I can have you go through this
page a little bit browse through the
spate of three what does what those are
so first and foremost word I'm John
clinger who is the basically the head
honcho product manager for
glassfish and ee will be presenting the
roadmap so he'll be talking about you
know what we have accomplished with the
e7 and loss before and what the way
forward is a really good place to find
find out and get involved with the
future of EE and find out what we've
been what we have been up to I'll be
doing sort of a five-minute brief intro
as well you know some kind of I guess a
shepherding if you want to call it that
shepherding the event beyond that though
if you scroll down a little bit further
down this page the two most exciting
things that we have in this event is
really the executive panel as well as
the Gloucester stories so the executive
panel is really one of the few places in
Java one where you get to talk really
face-to-face and very open very direct
fashion with the people that are
ultimately the decision makers for eem
glassfish so we've got an excellent
panel this year and by the way the you
know you can pose any questions to this
panel even if you didn't even attend the
event so I've got a link to my email
address up there Reza doctor manette
oracle com send me an email mean if you
wanna if you want to ask any questions
around e or glassfish you send me an
email and i'm going to present exactly
those questions to the panel so that's
the general idea and we will video
record the panel and make it available
and highly to highlight it on on the
aquarium later on too so as I said we've
got an external panel this year so
there's John Klingon and then I
mentioned him already it gives a
principal Bharat project manager for
glassfish there's Mike Lehmann he's a VP
of Product Management again on the
product my product management side head
honcho for for for everything glassfish
weblogic EE he's basically Jones boss
and then there's my boss of course his
onion VP of software development again
the guy that's kind of got his head down
in the ground game and day-to-day deals
with E and lost fish weblogic issues and
of course my boss's boss in my my head
boss Cameron Purdy I think he's a pretty
well-known figure in the community a
very good guy to talk to and
very good the i-team cameras a good guy
and he's made quite a reputation for
himself oh yeah very well lizard well
does the repetition no doubt about it
not just saying that because he's what
sexy is generally a good guy I mattress
magazine heater is a real or is a real
hacker oh yes for sure cool alright so
that's the glass efficient than anyone
we want folks to tens and that's
happening sunday 915 to 1115 and what
were you doing at javaone I'm doing a
bunch of other stuff too but I wanted to
mention that the glossary stories as
well so this year we've got four four
stories lined up people using laceration
II in the real world again shoot away
you know to ask him whatever questions
you wanna you want to ask you know add
the event and we've also got the
GlassFish party to get after after the
after the event and whatnot it's sort of
a nice fall one and you can talk to us
in a more informal setting it's at 8pm
at the thirsty bear it's a pretty
well-known bar close to the venue as
well so there's a little little blurb
there on the community page about the
about the party and how you can sign up
for that we've got a ton of people
signed up and it's basically a who's who
of the java community honestly speaking
we've had you know people like Gosling
and whatever you name it a show for the
party and this hood looks to be no
different cool so that's the GlassFish
event what about sessions you're giving
a Java one so I'm really giving to two
different sessions a job one I didn't
want to do too many sessions this year
you know principally because the people
that are you know the spec leads and I
ruin and whatnot they're doing more of
the vanilla ye sessions if you will you
know introduction to EE and taking a
deeper look at all the API so I'll talk
about that in just a second what I
actually wanted to focus on is more
along the lines of how are these e
technologies fit into the real world
real world demands if you will so it's
it's a bit out looking outside of e to
see how he fits in the bigger picture so
that
then I'm most excited about really is my
my talk on Thursday it's sort of the
towards the tail end of the conference
you know where they have actually really
the most interesting talks in my mind so
it's about how to use android and iOS
with the e7 principally using rest and
the newly introduced WebSocket protocols
and basically i'll be showing code on
the server side and shrink code on the
client side and doing an actual demo how
to use the e7 as a back into android on
iOS i've also got a above I you know
this is a basically what i wanted to do
here is a take a look at bean validation
and nal and cure this sort of underdog
api's the people don't talk about much
any a7 and showcase those and showcase
specifically what those two api's mean
in the larger context of e 7 and things
like jsf and below so what else do you
want to feature about what's happening
at Java honor in the class fish
community lots of stuff honestly I could
go on and on about it but the two things
that I want to really highlight is due
to more URLs namely the report to the
other pages just highlighting you know
our footprint the class efficient job IE
footprint on on Java one right so we've
got some highlighted sessions you know
the principal one being e7 what's new in
the platform sort of a broad overview
talk Arun is doing a 50 new features in
any e7 in 50 minutes that's pretty
interesting some of the key spec leads
are going to be in the GlassFish Boff so
that's that's worth attending you know
there's a there's a another gentleman
yet again is talking about why you would
switch from Spring Framework to e7 and
you know what his reasons for that is
that so that's kind of interesting
there's an e eight and beyond session is
actually organized my mark littell of
red hat and that's a great place to talk
about e futures and talking about what
you could go into the specification
going forward we've also got demo
grounds I'm going to be a
at the e7 demo ground so we've got some
cool demos that we can show and tell
people on a one on one on one basis for
e7 and also a little bit beyond e7 all
of you obviously be talking about the
ISA Isolde stuff this place this
Michigan has stuff about the community
and the party of course and you know all
of the people key people that are
involved in job on it or glass efficient
on EE 7 and finally we have a focus on
page and again you can get to all of
this from the aquarium so you don't have
to remember these girls necessarily
focus on page 44 e 74 e in particular so
this guy de it's basically in any index
of all of the interesting sessions for e
7 inch of one this year again a whole
bunch of stuff so you have of course as
like the cheat guide session set up here
um conference scheduled for javelin
basically yeah that's what I'm using it
for you know the one I I really liked
your highlight here is the lab is a
hands-on lab basically you can go to
this levin actually Cody seven and get a
real feel for what EE 7 looks like as a
developer experience so that's I think
that's a just phenomenal cohort as I
think we've got all the all the Bob
sessions and of course our demos and
user group session that's a lot and you
know I really hope people look at this
stuff in in you know come see us cool
come c seven come see glossary how you
doing personally on all your your
session prepping getting ready for java
one are you completely swamped or you
have things entirely under control uh
you know i'm a i'm a pretty fanatic when
it comes to preparation so two guys to
do i am pretty prepared so everything is
is ready to go for the loss of event i
think it came together very nicely we've
got some pretty good registration
numbers so if you haven't registered yet
do register for it same thing for the
part here you know really looking
forward to that my session is all ready
to go I've got two other co speakers
that are worth putting the finishing
touches on the on the Android and iOS
part the
actually the the the server side code is
actually up there already i put it to
put it out on github if you want to take
a look at that i don't know if you can
pull it up real quick my github account
is let me get you the URL Fred yeah I'm
going to send it to you real quick Steve
so you can you can show people where it
is here we go and if you see you'll see
the link a project called Java e mobile
server so yeah yeah so all the server
side code is up there as soon as my
quarters are ready hopefully you know
end of end of next week we'll be posting
the Android and iOS code as well so you
can you know run take it and write
yourself and slice now he looks like in
in a mobile in a mobile environment cool
all right well thanks very much Reza for
taking time out of your busy schedule
and i'll i'll see you at the upcoming
javaone conference I'm sure thing I've
does your head and yeah thanks for doing
the interview and I think this will be
great and I hopefully get the word after
a few more people yep ok so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
