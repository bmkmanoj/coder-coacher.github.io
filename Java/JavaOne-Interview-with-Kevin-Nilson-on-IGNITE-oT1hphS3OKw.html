Java technology ambassador for Oracle
and also the job one content chair and
i'm here with Kevin Nelson who is
turning going to be leading a new ignite
format evening session at the Java 1
2014 conference so Kevin how you doing
yeah doing great Steve thanks for having
me on I'm super excited about Java one
and i think the addition of ignite this
year will be something people really
enjoy great way for folks to relax in
the evening and learn a little bit more
about some of the famous names that are
out there in Java and I believe this is
the only javaone talk we have which is
actually going to feature beer for
participants that's always important so
it's good for the ignite to let folks
relax and enjoy so so beer is their pups
who who have no idea about the ignite
format or what it is can you give them
the quick debrief on how ignite talks
work absolutely so so the way the ignite
talks work is the the idea is have
something that's a quick five-minute
format it's designed to ignite the
audience it's designed the audience
comes in and they see this really quick
presentation about something that the
speaker is very passionate about so for
this series javaone I know people have
been sitting in talks all day long about
technology looking at code learning all
kinds of things and I think by the end
of the evening the brains are going to
need to relax and rest and so what I'm
trying to do is go out there and find
speakers who have huge passions that
aren't super technology focused so some
of the people that I've got lined up to
speak for example many people know van
riper very very active in the community
and he's going to be speaking about yoga
so one of the things that he does a lot
is you know good he likes that I've also
got a vacancy at different side of n
update night talk absolutely absolutely
and I hear that he's actually planning
to do yoga
in his session Bobby speaking I should
be a lot of fun arun gupta is going to
talk about things like running her first
marathon and some cross training stuff
so I've heard it'll be doing like
push-ups and things like that but during
his talk ya know I could see her in
doing that he um he's very well known
he's actually doing his what is it X
miles every day before javaone I get the
tweets every day I can't follow it I've
got Dario laverne from New York
evangelist at HTC he's going to be
talking about IOT and wearables and how
wearables can change your life so it'll
be super exciting I've got a friend
who's going to talk about hackathons so
he's sort of a serial hackathon
attendees does one almost every weekend
it seems like he's always got an
interesting event to tell me about it an
interesting event that he's won his team
is one and they they actually travel
around around the u.s. to go to
hackathons not just those here in the
Bay Area I've got Patrick earn from the
JCP he's going to talk about African
music so most of you know all the the
great work he does with the JCP but he's
also really passionate about African
music so I think it'd be good to hear
that then finally the last speaker that
I just got confirmed about 10 minutes
ago Vivian's going to talk about
technology and education so she's
running a kickstarter while she's
running a company that just got funded
under Kickstarter that does a 3d based
math game for kids and then finally
Steve maybe you can laugh a little bit
about what you're planning to do oh yes
I great to do something I think night um
so I will I will try to give people the
fastest motorcycle tour through Europe
they've ever seen with some video can i
put video you and mike night sessions
are cool absolutely it'll advance yeah
with Vinny oven slides from my recent
motorcycle tour across Europe you know
giving presentations and doing
evangelism for the night hacking slate
so
no you know one of the things you just
said was fast and that's one of the
things it is kind of unique about the
unite ignite talks is basically the
format is five minutes and what happens
is the slide decks are timed and so that
you're on each slide for 15 seconds and
it's sort of the speaker racing against
the slides in many cases and other times
yeah you know it's sort of you know
hopefully it's well rehearsed and
sometimes folks stumble a little bit and
it can be a lot of fun to watch folks
keep up but one thing I notice of my
experience with ignite talks in the past
is some of the talks are really suck are
dramatically entertaining and how bad
they fail and how quickly the end what
yeah so that's what's great is you don't
have to worry about somebody hanging on
a slide too long rambling on they've got
15 seconds and then they're off to the
next topic so it's a really great format
for the evening you know at javaone
relaxing you're not necessarily there to
just cram more information to your
malaysians it's more you know hanging
out relaxing learning about some of
these folks that you already know and
then basically we'll set it up it's a
two-hour time block and I don't expect
the the talks to to fill most of that
you know it should be it should be sort
of half the time watching the
presentation the other half the time you
can mingle with the presenters or mingle
with those in the audience and you know
if you want to hear more about Steve's
bike tour you can go up to them
afterwards and here and if you want to
know where's the best place to do yoga
you know you can go talk to van about
that cool alright sounds like an
exciting evening so to to give some
folks more information about the Java
one conference you can register for the
Java one conference at javaone com it's
the largest Java development conference
in the e you asked and it's currently
this is actually the last day today is
the last day of official early bird reg
but if you're watching the recording of
this I've heard early bird regimented so
I'm check for tweets or relevant social
pings about
pricing for John and the Ignite talks
which we just talked about but are
scheduled for I believe Tuesday evening
on the schedule it'll be part of the
content catalog and you can join the
ignite talks in the evening after the
normal sessions end yeah so Joe between
7-9 p.m. is when the talks are and I'm
actually still out there looking for
speakers I've got a call for paper up we
probably won't be selecting the folks
who will be speaking up until about a
month before the conference and the URL
for that is tinyurl.com / j the number
one ignite so it's like java one at
night so it's tinyurl.com / j 1 ignite
and if you want to learn more about the
ignite format and watch some of the past
videos and things from where they've
done them for various conferences and
various events around the world you can
go to ignite show calm and you can see
that this is a format that was created
by Brady Forrest who's from O'Reilly are
used to work at o'reilly and so you know
there was a big movement of these and
they're real successful at rileys
conferences and then have grown out to
other things and that's why we're
bringing the content here to java one
cool alright thanks very much for your
time Kevin and I hope to see the viewers
at our Java one conference in the end is
it alright thanks everybody temper all
