Network and i'm joined by Charlie Nutter
how you in charge hey good to see stila
glad to be back yes of this you were
telling me earlier this is your first
appearance at devoxx since the name
change from Java opolis I guess it's my
it's like my first time at devoxx as if
we don't count Java pause kebap allah so
that's really that's really surprising
given how much you're a fan of of
belgium beers yes exactly and this is a
this is one of the sad things about not
having been here for so many years is i
haven't had a chance to explore and
there's actually a lot of new belgium
breweries as well not just classic one
so I'm glad I'm back this year yeah so
we got some excellent beer is provided
by Tom who's a local yes it's really
good grant chiming what were you
drinking it I drinking the rush for ten
nice nice and we have our audience
members tricky as well so the beer
protocol here is if you hang out for an
interview then you can join us for beer
and stay longer there you go because we
have even more interviews for you guys
to watch it seems like a good deal ok so
you had a really cool topic which was
Ruby and minecraft so tell me a little
bit about what the connection there is
right so we've been working on JRuby for
years plugging it into different sorts
of applications Java is obviously a big
part of jruby and of course minecraft is
there so one of the things i wanted to
show in the JRuby talk today was
basically building minecraft plugins and
Ruby lot less overhead in ceremony a lot
lot more fun I kinda got a slide deck
here with yup I got a couple slides here
so the first thing I wanted to point out
is that there's tons of folks that are
actually using JRuby for rubyconf last
year we asked for company logos and
within a day we got you know probably
100 different companies that we're
willing to say they use JRuby for real
stuff NASA BBC news for all their
election results visa has sites on it so
lots of stuff out there in JRuby now
that's that's the business side and that
makes the case for folks here to maybe
get involved and start using JRuby but
the fun stuff is if we get into the
gaming realm talk a little bit about
plugin so plugin is tom n fo the other j
beko leads project to basically plug
Ruby into minecraft so anywhere you
would be writing a Java plug-in to do a
minecraft extension you could write in
Ruby code and have all the benefits of
Ruby but still be in the Minecraft world
nice so his example that he he built for
this is called egg madness and so here
we're in our minecraft world we run our
plugin and with the chain what it
changes here is rather than spitting out
one chicken from every egg it spits out
a hundred every time so very quickly you
can have a massive amount of chickens
Tom's fond of saying this is an
excellent way to kill your minecraft
server now just can't handle all of
these chickens around but then you can
have the fun of going and killing all
the chickens and doing whatever else
that's and a lot of fun my daughter
would get a kick out of it she's doing
way too much in Minecraft see it's great
and this is one of the coolest things
about this is that the Ruby code for
this is so trivial this is the entire
plug-in so you have the plugin jar
somewhere in your minecraft environment
you throw this ruby script in there and
that's it it's available and it'll run
as a plug-in in the system yeah that's
that's a lot less ceremony than most the
plugins I've act on exactly exactly and
Tom's even built a little dsl some nice
API wrappers around the minecraft stuff
to make it easier so here we've got the
player egg throw event that we're
handling in our plugin we want to make
sure it always hatches so we set that to
true yeah we want to make sure it's
always going to be set it to a hundred
chickens every time and that's about all
there is to it now we've got a plug-in
that changes the way chicken eggs hatch
in Minecraft nice nice so looks super
easy to use absolutely yeah it's little
stuff with this what are the sort of
plugins have you have you built using
this or tried building is so there's
there's a there's a community of folks
that are building some small plugins one
of the more interesting ones there's
throw go which is actually a logo
implementation that runs on top of
Minecraft so you can send it a little
yep it's three in the logo basically and
so instead of a turtle we don't have
Turtles in Minecraft so it's usually a
chicken but you can tell your chicken to
go left and right and up and down drop
certain types of blocks you can
basically write a logo program
that will craft your whole world live as
the chicken runs around on top that's
awesome it's pretty cool that's pretty
cool there's some other plugins that
provide interactive Ruby console with in
Minecraft so you can actually script
things while you're in the game just by
sending messages and it's everything
that you can do in Ruby and it's all
interactive and dynamic really a lot of
fun cool yeah so alright so that's Ruby
in Minecraft what else were you talking
about or doing here well so I I also did
my talk on how to get involved in open
source it seemed like it was well
received my basic plan for the talk is
to try and give people the tools to get
involved what are the steps to start
becoming a contributor of the project
what do you need to do to be a committer
what do you need to do to release your
own source license considerations and so
on that's a good way for folks get
started there helping out with Ruby or
other open JRuby other open source
probably any open source project just
trying to get people to start getting
involved in open source and make some
contributions so hopefully we'll be able
to do that talk more often I think it
needs to be done I think every
conference needs to have a talk like
that yeah the people involved and from
somebody who actually has a good sense
of the open-source ecosystem and can
give people practically right I mean
I've been lucky enough to do so jruby
full-time for nine years and there are
there are difficult tricks and tips that
you need to get into open source and do
a good job of it and hopefully I can
pass that on alright cool well I
appreciate you taking the time to
interview here at the DevOps conference
absolutely I appreciate the beard and I
hope you find some more beer before you
have to head back to the States I will I
will do alright so enjoy and thanks very
much for watching the live stream here
at devoxx you can watch the rest of the
interviews at night hacking com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
