Network and I'm here today at the jvm
summit and i'm here with nigel then who
do you work for ok i work for a war
attack and i'm doing a combination or
product management and technical sales
here in the west coast of america and so
what is the your company about because
you talked about a lot about the
security of the jvm suppose yeah so more
attack were a small company
headquartered in Ireland clearly I'm
over here in the US with poor presence
in America on east coast as well in
London and our core product is roundy
virtualizing Java Virtual Machine we
containerized Java and we do this for
two key reasons the first is to secure
Java to introduce rules to hire people
to monitor what's happening to our
application detect issues and also to
respond to them we also have a
capability of looking after legacy Java
so those older JVM is that everybody's
got a ton of in their enterprise we can
run them on a more modern JPM and at the
same time or containerization lets you
really drive up the workload per machine
and help reduce the costs of your whole
jar of operation so any any insights
that you learn today or that you shared
with the audience today oh well um I'm
not the most technical person or company
or the true geniuses are working in
Dublin I cellular this is a very very
technical conference and I think those
guys we've gotta roll
from the presentations I don't know ever
i got the maximum benefit from them but
i certainly able to share the approach
we've taken to delivering the solutions
we delivered with the audience and i got
a lot of questions so i think they
people here responded to that and we're
really interested in what we don't too
so what were some of the questions I had
questions will a mission about why we're
virtualizing an already virtual machine
that sounds like a really peculiar thing
to go and do so I did touch on this
allows us to injected security allows us
to drive down the cost of operations so
I touched on those things for people
what we inject into the class libraries
when we when we're making calls on what
we call sensitive types sensitive
objects and how we trap some of the
things we track them and we get to see
smoother the data or information flows
that we can monitor so is it open or is
it a closed system because security is
sensitive subject yeah so our core
product is a proprietary product so that
is a closed system having said that we
have published api's into it and those
are open a POS we've also published some
extensions to je viens so we can make
java or behave in ways that according to
the java spec it's not supposed to but
we can do that in a java legal way so
it's still TCK compliant and so i talked
about those and we can do tricks like
virtualizing application servers
changing your file system to be
encrypted on the fly all sorts of fun
trick final big is will be presented at
javaone so you've been a java one before
i think last year so tell us what was
your feeling about java one owns and
technical questions we got our java want
radios off
talking to the other delegates and then
towards the end I was speaking I talked
about multi-tenancy in Java our house
and what capabilities support band which
was good again a lot of good technical
questions there a lot of good audience
interaction very much enjoyed that this
year I think our CTO speaking at javaone
so he's going to be talking about more
about our security features and the
capabilities there and generally about
what we're seeing in the field of Java
security be prepared for a lot of good
technical questions though the people
attending javaone tend to be really good
hands-on technical developers they
understand Java very curious people are
so make sure you're armed with our
information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
