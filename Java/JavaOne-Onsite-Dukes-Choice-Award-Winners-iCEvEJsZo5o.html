messenger i run the java SE and Java ME
development team spirit Oracle I really
appreciate coming out I know it's a
dating for the conference first I wanted
to give a Thank You dat junipers buying
our beer tonight so thank you the focus
of this award and purpose of these
awards is evening it's all about
recognizing innovation in the community
it's one of my favorite things actually
I've been to juggling several years I've
never been up here on stage either as an
innovator in or as a as a presenter but
I'm very happy to be here and have all
of the folks here again a little bit
before the show starts who are going to
represent the best of Java arrest best
of java community best of innovation so
with that I have some awards
we have I think II may be the first two
are in absentia so I'll kill through
those quickly and then we can move on
together to the real meat so the first
one is in a category about innovation in
green technology and the winner is do
app inside a French company has been a
really interesting to Java solution for
measuring air flow air leakage inside of
residences and commercial buildings so
you can sort of measure what your what
your environmental footprint is and and
where you might be able to save so the
other one the second in absentia is for
innovative Network program this is
something i'm actually very familiar
with looked at the code myself and it's
the neti project which is a neo based I
owe server model and really really
innovative pre-work so
and now on to folks who are actually
here so in the category of home
automation we have J home who's built a
home automation API it's open source
then it's built on top of the GlassFish
platform so thank you and welcome Jay
home
don't worry don't worry we'll say
everybody one don't have to carry it
around while you're here next up another
one I am actually personally familiar
with this is for innovative programming
framework and I say lmax disruptor which
is a really interesting multi-threaded
open source platform for concurrent
programming really low latency really
interesting work so thank you very much
ok
alright so next step it's a developer
scratching their own age always the
favorite kind of projects when people
wanted to fix something fix a problem
that they had themselves and that's a
innovative tool for developers and J
frog which is a binary
ok guys now Thank You Academy know
this dude is for the j for guys that
worked like crazy for the last three
years to provide you guys with the great
tools and i hope you enjoy at the
factory thank you very much
so another in similar category developer
is making tools for themselves and
that's a compiler for java code called j
rebel and j rebel lets you skip the

I
this next one I think is is actually
really interesting to me partly because
it lets us extend the java community
much further than it is today and that's
a open source project based on NetBeans
that makes java code development
accessible to the blind it's called side
beans so thank you very much for for
being here this evening
so our stories in the area of industrial
software and this is actually I think a
really interesting growth area for job
moving out of the server area into an
out of consumer devices into industrial
devices I think it said something we're
seeing increasingly happening and this
award goes to inductive animation is
both a java-based web app sort of that
builds as Java partner that builds a
business scorecard for their automation
machine so please
and then we have one more here in the
community award exception and that's up
a project for integration testing which
I think your many of you will be
familiar with and it's the equivalent
project which is a really nice super so
we'd like to accept this award on behalf
of the jboss community I red hat and
jboss we feel very strongly that
innovation and the conversations around
innovation come from the community and
so a kaylene is very much community
project and we want to encourage you to
help us innovate to make integration
testing simpler
and how we have a one additional award
in the customer category and for that I
welcome on stage by calling in the Java
sales organization Jeffrey more so this
is the first time we run an award for
business innovation using Java so stress
rain we are running it it will be a
regular feature in the Innovation Awards
going forward so for the inaugural
winners of the innovative additional
automation award I'd like to invite
rockwell automation onto the stage
who've built using Java for a human
machine interface that allows really
automated communication and data
exchange what will our automation are a
giant in the initial animation field so
stop you can't come on stage
okay well thank you very much I have to
be a little bit coy about accepting the
award because we haven't announced our
product yet you know it's I know it may
be a little bit strange but we actually
sometimes run behind on our software
development projects I think that
probably
I just want to say that you know we will
be announcing our product is the next
month or so in our automation care you
just wanted to thank everybody here at
Oracle for the hospitality at this event
obviously is a great great thing
beautiful night but even more
specifically for our company that we
just wanted to thank the folks out there
that are provided all the support it's a
great technology that we're adopting for
the first time really our company and at
this point the quality of the code has
been fantastic and we have nothing but
good things to say thanks everybody
involved all right so that wraps up the
formal portion for right now I wanted to
give you a few leaving with a few
forward pointers for the rest of the
week first a little stats on attendance
we're way up this year over prior years
I think you'll see it in the in the buzz
and I can go see it in the keynote
tomorrow lots of great announcements
coming this week and then a lot of
really interesting community
presentations we have over a hundred
different companies are partly 180
different companies represented who are
giving presentations are and so many of
you here I hope are giving presentations
and we've got a ditch toys Bach coming
up and as well as a Thursday keynote
which is all
community members coming and presenting
what they're working on in Java so I
started that community Kino shared
everyone sharing what they're working on
so that's the lineup I hope everybody
has a great week and stick around and
have some be wrong Jennifer please take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
