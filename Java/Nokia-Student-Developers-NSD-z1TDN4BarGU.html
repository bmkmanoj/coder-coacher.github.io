University cooperation in India
Australia and Singapore and we have seen
a great movement in India with the
student not get developers basically it
has come out from the student and it's
for the student the whole community has
has formed by themselves with orders it
was not our plan to create this group
and some of the student leaders like
Rama Kashyap has been quite active
passionate and has been innovating in
the space learning teaching each other
and the basically the stroon ok
developer group has come out as a
surprise to us and Nokia and so they've
been teaching each other and creating a
programs by themselves helping each
other to program and experiment on
making mobile applications and
innovations as you see in India most of
the students are most likely having a
mobile computer than a PC and a faci
computer area and a lot of consumers
there in India and the amount of
students learning computer signs and
genetic and best practice their skills
on a mobile device so we've seen this
whole big moment coming in from the
students by itself initiative and and
we've seen a lot of programs the
students have created and this is
excited us in okay and we've been
supporting and working with the certain
group and lately we've seen that the
group has been growing quite active
using social channels like Facebook and
and tweeters and so forth and the
movement start in India a little bit
over a year ago and now it has expanded
beyond yeah it's gone to seven different
countries there are about 2,000 students
and we're seeing a huge potential of
this group what they can do and
basically they've innovated about
different kind of applications gaming
the productivity tools and different
kind of entertainment applications
coming out from them and it's not just
learning they're also actually
practicing the work by really putting it
to the stores trying to connect this
provide this group to different programs
of our
University wings and even the developer
wins we have in nokia so you see the
potential for this group to grow beyond
kind of just a social group but actually
to even turn into viable business so
there we are seeking out for mentors
anyone with a business background to
help them even take an apron or track so
we see that the students are potential
they have one incubation now within the
student program themselves and it's not
driven by no key it's all the student
forming their whole initiatives so we
inviting the student group together I've
been writing you know experts designers
anyone across the board does not need to
be India it doesn't have to be in a
specific country to kind of come join
the group help the students learn and
guide them through even entrepreneurship
type of track and a lot of potential
solutions which can come out of this
innovations happening here and the
potential to you know turn them into
real business as well so we are
exploring with the group with the
student leaders like Rama shop there are
several other stars the young stars in
the group we really see that they have a
bright future in either in joining into
industry or taking their own
entrepreneurship type of track to start
up their own initiatives interesting
thing is I've been seeing from the some
of the students getting excited as their
application hits a store they start to
monitor now I have 100,000 users now I
have find a thousand users and cheering
when they have 1 million users using
their kind of simple applications but
still it matters for them so it's
becoming a carrier kind of a star for
themselves to showcase this work and
innovation they're doing so we're all
excited me being in nokia but also being
involved with the student group as as my
own passion as well to see
in the students learn and and innovate
on these platforms so we are hoping that
we have more contributors we expand
beyond these seven countries across the
globe and inspire a lot more young minds
to come out showcase their work not just
do the projects in the in the studies
but actually realize their projects
while delivering it to somebody who can
benefit from their work so that's where
we are and we are all excited to get you
on board and this is about the student
okay developers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
