my name is Alex Buckley and I write the
specification of the Java language and
the java virtual machine i've worked on
the java platform since 2006 so i've
seen the full life cycles of JDK 7 8 &amp;amp; 9
I worked on project coin and invoke
dynamic in JDK 7 on lambdas and type
annotations in JDK 8 and on the modules
in JDK 9 that we'll be talking about
today first we'll talk about what
modules are and how they improve the
developer experience second we'll talk
about how the JDK has been turned into
modules and third we'll talk about some
of the things you need to know about
migrating to JDK 9 one of the core
features of any programming language is
the ability to reuse code so the large
programs can be built from small
programs in Java the basic unit of reuse
is traditionally the class Java has
wonderful mechanisms for promoting reuse
of a class such as inheritance for
reusing behavior and interfaces for
reusing abstractions
however when your Java program gets to
be 5 10 20 packages in 2 4 8 jar files
it becomes difficult to visualize how
all those classes and interfaces
interact which means it's hard to
control who is reusing what just imagine
how difficult it is to control reuse
within a really large code base like the
217 official packages shown here from
JDK 8 the only way to share code between
packages is with the public modifier but
then the code is shared with everyone a
package is a great way to organize
classes but most people wish there was a
way to organize packages to modules let
you do that a module is a set of
packages designed for reuse this is a
long-overdue building block in the java
language
in effect modules recalled to the
structure of your program so that the
parts you want to be reused can be
reused
while the parts you don't want to be
reused can't be reused a program built
of modules will be more reliable than a
program built from a loose set of
packages in jar files that can access
each other freely and that exposed to
many api's to the outside world here's a
module that everyone will soon be
familiar with Java base it's the
foundation of every Java program like
java.lang object is the root of every
class in blue are the packages of Java
base intended for use by code outside
the module these are its exported
packages in red other packages internal
to Java base they can be used by code
inside the module but not by code
outside the module these are its
concealed packages a module is declared
in a new kind of file called module info
Java it gives the name of the module and
its exported packages by exporting the
java.lang package it means that the
public classes of java.lang are
accessible from outside java base a
package that is not explicitly exported
such as calm sun crypto provider is
concealed it's public classes are not
accessible outside java base this is the
first feature of modules in jdk 9 strong
encapsulation a module isn't just a set
of packages it's a set of exported
packages and concealed packages
this means that access control is more
powerful in jdk 9 than in jdk 8 in
jeddah q9 you can arrange for public
classes to be accessible to everyone or
accessible only to other classes in the
same module or accessible to classes in
the same module and a limb
set of friend modules so if you're
looking at public on a class declaration
it no longer means that everyone can
access the class access depends on
whether the class's module exports the
classes package when you write your own
module you specify the modules it
depends on this is the second feature of
modules in JDK nine reliable dependences
a module isn't just a set of packages
it's the set of packages that reuse the
packages exported by other modules here
we have a hello world module that
exports a package of its own and depends
on Java base with the requires keyword
this means the code in the HelloWorld
module can import any of the packages
exported by Java base but there is no
way for code in the HelloWorld module to
import any of the packages concealed by
Java base there are quite a few benefits
to putting code in modules for a starts
the HelloWorld module can be run with a
simple Java command that points to a
directory of modules the minus P and the
module to be run the minus M you don't
need to set the class path the modules
themselves say what they depend on JDK 9
checks the dependencies both when you
compile and when you run it checks that
every module that is required is
available that's a big improvement over
the class path where you don't discover
missing jars until later it checks that
modules don't require each other in a
cycle cycles lead to code that is hard
to understand and maintain finally it
checks that a package is exported from
exactly one other module this means
there are no split packages split
packages are the mess you get on the
class path when two jars contain the
same package and you load some classes
from one jar and other classes from the
other jar avoiding split packages is
also a win for performance because JDK 9
knows exactly where each package
which is much better than repeatedly
scanning every jar on the classpath
looking for a needed class by the way
modules are not mandatory you can keep
putting jars on the classpath and jdk 9
supports a gradual migration to modules
so that you can choose the trade-off of
how much work you're willing to do to
modularize versus the benefits of
modules let's turn our attention to the
JDK 20 years ago the Java platform was
small just a few hundred classes and the
organization of the JDK wasn't a problem
but every year the platform grew bigger
and now it's tens of thousands of
classes the JDK is huge and worse its
monolithic in reality the Java platform
is not one thing it's more like 25
separate frameworks including the swing
UI framework a crypto framework a
scripting framework multiple XML
processing frameworks and so on there's
no reason these separate frameworks have
to be tightly coupled in one download in
fact it's an impediment in developing
the JDK the overly tight coupling raises
development and testing costs which
turns into slower platform evolution
plus the larger the surface of your
platform the more difficult it is to
secure and it's an impediment to a lot
of users both those who want to run
their applications on smaller devices
and those who want to run more instances
of their of their application on large
systems even if you only wanted a part
of the JDK you've had to take all of it
that all changes in JDK 9 we've taken
the monolithic JDK and broken it up into
a few dozen modules some of these are
part of the Java SE specification some
are just part of the JDK implementation
here's a graph of the Java SE modules at
the bottom there's Java base which
everything depends on and which depends
on nothing itself we've broken out the
various frameworks into their own
modules instrumentation logging XML
scripting desktop which you can require
or not require as you'll need to dictate
there's a Java SE module which has no
actual code in it but just has
dependences so you can say requires java
SE and be guaranteed to have all these
modules available it's worth mentioning
that merely finding these module
boundaries which might be obvious in
hindsight was a tremendous engineering
effort you'll find in your own code that
decoupling a monolith is much harder
than building a loosely coupled system
from the beginning
the good news going forward is that the
discipline imposed by modules will
prevent all of us from accidentally
recreating a monolith I'd like to
quickly review the expectations of
compatibility from JDK 9 first up there
are various technologies from Java EE
that ship in the JDK as well as in app
servers the list of Java EE modules in
JDK 9 includes Cober Jack's B jax-ws and
common annotations these modules are
deprecated in JDK 9 and will be removed
in a future release because of this they
are disabled by default in JDK 9 if
you're running code on the classpath you
may need to use the add modules command
line flag to enable the Java EE modules
second a lot of tools and libraries try
to access parts of the JDK that are
meant for internal use only
unfortunately it'll take a while for
tool and library developers to move away
from this practice so JDK 9 temporarily
allows access to JDK internals but
prints a warning when it happens there's
a command line flag to avoid these
warnings so please check with tool and
library developers about how to deploy
on JDK 9 finally there are miscellaneous
changes in JDK 9 that are unrelated to
modules but might affect code that ran
on JDK 8 notably code that assumes the
Java version stream begins with one dot
or assumes that the JDK lives in a file
called RT jar will fail on JDK 9 again
please
check with tool and library developers
about which versions are needed to run
on JDK 9 to conclude JDK 9 is important
because it enables modular development
all the way down the java language and
the java virtual machine understand
modules very deeply so that the
applications you write and the libraries
you consume and even the jdk itself can
all be developed and tested and packaged
and deployed as modules with clear api's
and well protected internals making
everyone play by the same modular rules
has great benefits for reliability
maintainability and security though it
may take some time for popular tools and
libraries to catch up you can download
JDK 9 now and follow what's happening
with JDK development at open JDK also
follow us on Twitter at open JDK and
hashtag Java 9 and with that thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
