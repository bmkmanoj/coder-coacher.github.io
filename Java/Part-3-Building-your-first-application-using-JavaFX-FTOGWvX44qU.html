Angelica Sarah and I'm a I'm a Java
evangelist at Oracle what we want to do
is this is going to be part three of the
linear first Java Tex application using
NetBeans 7.1 so let's get it started so
far you've been able you have been able
to add components to your own
application we actually introduced event
Mouse events we use some binding we
associate the x-coordinate of the image
with the mouse movement
so let's now in this part we're going to
focus on animation and effects very
simple but it still give you an overview
of the great power of Java FX so let's
get it started first of all what I want
to do is I want to bring into our our
application as take on image so far
we've been working with this one with
the blue C now what I want to introduce
is a yellow C okay so we're going to be
playing with these two ones so pretty
much to start with I wanna just copy
what we have for C 0 so we're going to
create a second image that is going to
hold the new C the Orang C and it is
going to be Z 1 we also have the same
clipping area for C 1 because we just is
exactly the same situation long image we
don't want to see all of that so we're
just copying and pasting this
information C 1 of course the image that
we want to display is C 1 and then we
create a clipping area pretty much the
same size rounded corners we associated
we set that clipping area to the new
image that we created ok and we added
into your scene graph okay now we know
the down here we have some events when
the mouse get drugs so let's copy and
paste these also for C
one so the C one also will move along
with the mouse movement okay with the
mouse tracking so C one will mouse is
press C one with is move and we do have
the binding functionality also for C one
so let's run this and pretty much we
have the same thing we're going to see
the image but by default because we
added the yellow one the new image last
in my secret is going to be on top so
what is happening is the blue C is still
there is just underneath we won't be
able to see so what I want to do is I
want to play with the opacity I want to
show and hide that way we can see both
images so when we run the application
what I want to do is I want to hide this
yellow image that is on top we want to
hide it so we're only going to see the
blue see when we study as the mouse move
over the application I want to show the
yellow see when we get out when the
mouse get out of the application we're
going to go back to the blue one so
we're going to show you an high C one
let me close the application let me go
all the way to the top where we create C
1 so we would what we want to do is we
want to set the opacity of C 1 to be
zero at the beginning so we're not
showing it we are adding it to the sink
graph but we're not showing it now what
we wanted to here is we're going to add
some event handlers so when the mouse
we're going to actually define Mouse
enter and mouse exit when the mouse
entered we're going to show the yellow
image when the mouse exit we're going to
hide it
okay so this also c1 we're gonna set on
mouse enter a case when we mount when
mouse enter
wanna have a new event handler okay that
is going to be a mouse event and for the
handle method what we want to do so I
want to take c1 and I actually want to
set the opacity to one so we want to
show it so when we enter we want to show
now when we exit or mouse exit we have a
new event handler okay we want to hide
it again so when we exit we're gonna hi
c1 okay so now let's see that what is
going to happen so we're going to see
both images as we define but it's not
the desired behavior because they are
just gonna either show it or hide it so
application is started fine we're
looking at the blue image that's fine
and when we enter we switch back to the
yellow one where we exit we actually see
again the blue one so yes it is working
but it's just changing rapidly from 0 to
1 the opacity is changing from 0 to 1
and 1 to 0 so what I want to do instead
of just changing it right now is I want
to take and what I want to change it but
I want to take a second to do so so
we're going to show a nice transition
between images so what we're going to do
is we're going to introduce animations
in Java FEX we have a fade anim a fade
transition a fade transition back object
would allow you to create a fade
animation that will last for the period
of time that you specify so let's create
animation using first this fade
transition so I'm going to create a new
very transition
okay and it's called a phase transition
okay and down here after we create the
images we are going to instantiate it a
transition is going to be a new phase
transition and this is that definition
so we're going to specify the duration
how long we want this animation to last
and what which node is it going to be
affected by this very transaction so the
duration we want the duration to be in
seconds and we want to be one second so
it's going to take one second to do the
animation and it's going to affect c1
okay now for the fade transition we need
to specify where is the original value
the front value and we want to specify
the two value so the PHA will work with
those two values the fade animation so
they transition set from value so it's
going to change from zero to serve a
transition set to value to one so it's
going to change from zero to one
okay so remember is an animation so we
need to be able to play with animation
you can either play forward or you can
also play back or so we're going to use
the same transition first forward to
show and then backward to hide so with
the mouse enter case I'm going modify
mouse enter and mauls exit so now it's
not going to happen abruptly which is
going to use the animation so we're
gonna play the animation okay
how is it going to play so the first
time we want to play it um so we want to
play forward so we wanna we wanna
set the weight to be one okay and now
when we hide it and we copy this we're
going to do is the rate is going to be
minus one okay so let's see now how your
animation work so we see the blue one
and as we enter we have a nice animation
for showing and we exit we have a nice
animation to hide okay so fade
transition to create fade animations
very easy we're using the rate to play
it forward and to play it back okay now
what we want to do we want to bring a
shark into this application so it's
going to be a shark image now let me
just show it it's a PNG image and this
is the shark so we want to do again
we're going to create a new image view
for it so we're going to have a private
English view and it's going to be shark
okay down here when we create create a
new shark new image view is going to be
on image and it's going to be an
interest rate is going to be more see
application we're gonna take a class
when I get string our resources stream
is going to be anxious to actually and
it's called shock the PNG file okay now
we want for the shark eyes a little bit
we want to make it a little a smaller so
we're going to use this scale or
property for it so we're going to take
short and we're going to set scale to be
0.8 so it's just a tiny a little time
smaller than they predefined size so
said scan one also point eight now we
want this shark shark at is yellow so we
wanna also um behave as the yellow sea
so what I wanna do is I wanna set the
properties bind the opacity property of
the shark to the opacity property of c0
c1 so we have the opacity property we
bind to c1 also the opacity property
okay because we're going to be playing
with shark a little bit I'm gonna take
this shark and I'm going to refactor it
and I'm go and create a new method for
it so we factor a new method with this
new method I'm gonna call it set shark
okay just to organize a little bit D
code okay we have the shark here so we
created we scale it smaller a little bit
and we bind the opacity to be the same
as they see one finally we need to add
it to my scene graph okay now if we run
it we should be able to see a shark okay
so nothing we show it so now we have the
new shark that is actually B
gave us to see one okay let's actually
apply some effects to these sharks a
list for example apply some shadow to it
so for that we're going to use the
effect drop shadow okay so let me create
that rival drop shadow and let's call it
a sharp shadow now if we go down to the
shark we're gonna take sharp shadow
we're going to create a new drop shadow
okay and we're going to use this second
constructor where we're gonna tell the
X&amp;amp;Y coordinate the displays the offset
of the shadow related to the X and y
coordinate of the object and then the
color for that particular shadow so what
I want to be is I wanna put it m five
point five for the X 5.5 for the y
coordinate
anything for the other one and the color
is going to be black okay then we want
to actually apply that effect to the
shark so I want to take the shark and I
wanna set the effect to be the shark
shadow okay so we associate that shadow
to the shark that we just created so let
me play one more time to see if the
shadow is there um there's a small bug
that I already filled in and I'm gonna
show you exactly what it is so as we get
in we have the shark and we have the
shadow I always get out the shadow also
disappear the effect that is this shadow
is associated with the shark and you
should be
fading in fading out exactly as the
shark and you can see that it doesn't
really do it properly as I say it's a
little bug that already fill it with a
with the team with the FX team but you
can say that it's actually pretty nice
how then the sharks are also associated
with the last place of the exercise is
we want to and do some effect when you
click the shark you want the shark to
swim away so what we're going to do is
we're going to do some translation in
the x and y coordinate and we of the
sharks and we're also going to be
scaling the sharks so they look bigger
it looks like they are swimming towards
you so let's do that
so let's create some properties that
we're gonna use so we're going to move
the sharks in the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates so we
need those two variables we need to
scale the shark so we need a third
variable and we need also M at the same
time that we move the shark we move we
need to move the shadow of the shark so
we need a fourth property for that
because we're going to be doing binding
so as I move this property we're going
to update the X&amp;amp;Y property the scale
property and the shadow position we are
going to create some double properties
okay so in this case it's going to be a
simple double property simple double
property the first one is going to be
the eggs offset is going to be simple
double property the value is going to be
zero so originally there is not offset
same second one is going to be the wire
offset
simple double property again is going to
be zero simple double property this is
going to be the offset of the shadow and
in this case the shadow is 5.5 away from
the image and finally the scale value
and the scale originally this point
eight okay so we created the variables
that we needed let's go down to where we
create a shark okay so we're going to
bind some information so first we're
going to take the scale property of the
shark scale X property to be fine to
shark find observable object is going to
be that scale okay then we do the same
thing for the Y property scale Y
property is going to be fine to scale
then we take the X property correlate X
property and we gonna pointed with them
eggs offset that we're going to be
moving along and then the right property
also don't not be bounding in this case
to the y offset okay last we're going to
be playing with shadow okay so the shark
shadow is actually going to be also
we're going to
change the offset X property to be bond
to add offset okay on the same thing for
the white one say Y property is going to
be born to s off okay now what we want
to do now is we want to change the value
of the scale X of Y of and s of those
are the four five values that we want to
be changing and the way we're going to
do doing it is through animation so
animations are going to be created using
a timeline the timeline will provide the
capability of updating a property values
over the time so we're going to specify
how these values are going to change
over time and the way we specify that is
using keyframes okay so let's first
create a timeline okay
time line is going to be short swing
away okay
and in the Sharpeville we create a shark
where you're actually going to half way
okay and then let me show you exactly
what I'm going to do just copy and paste
some code that I have so there is a
bunch of error let me fix that we'll fix
import yes I'm going to take their
animations from FX so what we're doing
is again you do animation through a
timeline and you're going to say how the
values are going to change over time and
the way to do so is through the keyframe
so we have two keyframes the first
keyframe is going to happen in time zero
where we set up the values of the s of
scale X off and Y off so this will be
the original values and the second
keyframe is going to happen five seconds
later and we'll tell where they offset
the scale and x and y coordinate and of
this chart is going to be okay now you
do have the animation you do have to
play the animation when is the animation
going to happen well the animation is
going to happen with you click the
Sharks so we're going back to the shark
and we're going to set on mouse click
okay we create a new event handler for
this and in the method what we want to
do is um we're going to take on the
shark swim away animation and we want to
play it okay so once you click it this
this shark will swim away one last trick
is the size of the screen so I want to
make the scene way bigger so the shark
can actually swim along the hole
Queen so I'm going to put it 1,300 by
let's say a thousand doesn't really
matter I just want to make it bigger so
it actually swim away there's one little
thing um that we're still missing would
happen please if you pay attention the
shark was placed on top of c1 let's go
down to see one of the events associated
with C 1 C 1 we have mouse press and
drag the doesn't really affect we have a
mouse enter on your mouse exit what
happened is the Sharks are on top of c1
so whenever you try to put the mouse
over the shark to click on it we're
going to trigger this to effect when we
enter the shark the on mouse exit is
going to be triggered because you're
actually living this step to see one
image you're entering into the shark
that is on top so he will receive the
event this is totally normal but this is
not the behavior that we want we do not
want us fire mouse enter and mouse exit
unless I really quit that area meaning I
do not want to fire these two events
enter and exit if what I did was when
that I went over the shark that is
actually still part of the c1 so I'm
going to put a small if condition to at
this um app to these events here so I
need to check if I really leave if the
mouse really left the application area
no just mouse over the shark so let me
create a boolean at the top okay that is
actually going to hold if we really exit
or not
by default it is true when the
application started we are outside that
area we're outside it on the screen okay
now we only want to play let me go back
to see one mouse enter so I only going
to trigger them off oh I only gonna do
the transition if I really exit so if
I'm really out and I'm entering I do
want to play this animation so if exit I
really exit then play this okay so I was
really outside the application okay you
do a little bit of formatting here okay
and then of course if I really enter I'm
not outside anymore
okay okay just make sure when we said
that and now if I exit what I want to
check if I really if I'm really outside
the coordinates the area the whole area
of c1 so and we want to do if another if
condition in this case we want to try we
want to check for c1 the clipping area
okay
and we want to know if this area
contains the values associated with the
mouse okay so we're going to create a
point to D that actually have the mouse
information mouse x coordinates so we
are going to get the same X and X in Y
so what it says is if the area for see
one doesn't contain this if it does
contain it means that you are on the
sharp you haven't left the window if it
doesn't contain that you're outside the
window we do want to perform this okay
so if I really quit the application
please do this let me just format a
little bit the if condition and again
you want to make sure that yes you left
so this is true okay so let's try to run
then the application one more time and
hopefully everything is working okay we
do have Danny made the application when
I enter with - see - are when I exit the
shark is there when I enter and a step
over to shock I do not see the mouse
enter and mouse exit for c1 if I click
the sharks will swim away okay so with
that I conclude your first application
of how to your first session your first
collection of videos of how to create
your first JavaFX application again a
little bit of everything a little bit of
animation effects binding functionality
components again this is Angela etc and
I hope you enjoy this set of tutorial
