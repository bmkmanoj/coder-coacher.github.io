things at Java 7 features you probably
didn't hear about in this edition we'll
deal with eight new features that our
graphical user interfaces that occurred
in JDK in Java 7 some things that
possibly you did or did not hear about
the Nimbus look and feel
now Nimbus is a polished cross-platform
look and feel that was introduced in the
Java SE 6 update 10 release as designed
to be a replacement for the metal look
and feel and is now part of the standard
look and feels which you can find in
Java FX swing swing PL AF for a
platformer look and feel the screen
capture that you see here is from the
swing set 3 and it shows the Nimbus look
and feel now for compatibility purposes
the metal look and feel will still be
the default look and feel Nimbus however
uses Java to V vector graphics to draw
the user interface rather than static
bitmaps so the UI can ask it can be
crisply rendered on any resolution that
you're dealing with now Nimbus is highly
customizable and you can use the Nimbus
look and feel as is or you can skin it
and customize it to the look of your own
brand now when it comes to setting the
Nimbus look and feel there are three
ways to set the UI to the Nimbus look
and feel first of all you can do it
through the code the first line of this
code retrieves a list of all installed
look and feel implementations for the
platform and then reiterates three lists
to determine if Nimbus is available and
if so then Nimbus is set to that
particular look and feel a little bit of
caution here is that obviously if you're
running a a version 6 implementation
that did not have Nimbus look and feel
installed and actually was installed in
a different location you would probably
want to use some exception code here if
if you did not find it now you can also
set this on the command line by by
specifying the swing default
look and feel and then finally you can
set it in the swing properties file by
adding the following line that you see
here to Java home Lib swing properties
file a little bit of caution there if
the swing properties file does not exist
yet you need to create it J layer
component the J layer class is a really
flexible and powerful decorator for
swing components it enables you to draw
on components and respond to component
events without modifying the underlying
component directly examples of this are
the progress wheel that you see here on
the left or highlighting only the valid
choices in a multi choice component as
you see here on the right now if you
take a look at the code down here it's
fairly simple to implement this you just
need to create a J layer and then you're
going to create some type of UI for that
J layer on top of that and then you're
just going to add that to the frame
mixing of a WT and swing components now
there are two types in an explanation
here let's go in and understand why a WT
and swing didn't work and that was
because there were two type of graphical
components in the java programming
language that's heavy weight and light
weights a heavy weight component is
associated with its own native screened
and so examples of that would be all of
the AWT components had their own native
screen there now a lightweight component
has no native screen of its own and so
the lightweight component relies on the
screen resources from an ancestor in the
container in the in this containment
hierarchy possibly an underlying frame
object it could be a variety of
different things
now components from the from the swing
packages things like J button and J
level those are all lightweight
components now in the past mixing
heavyweight and lightweight components
in the same graphical user interface Cod
problem cause problems when those
components overlapped one another for
example as you see here the following
screen captures show menu bars that
contain both lightweight menu and
heavyweight menu and the frame contains
a heavyweight button well that
heavyweight menu behaves as expected
when selected but the heavyweight menu
is displayed on top of the button
but when the lightweight menu is
displayed the heavyweight button takes
precedence where they overlap that is no
longer a case and it works now that's
work since 6 update 12 and 7 update 1
there are a few caveats however non
opaque lightweight components that have
translucent pixels 0 less than alpha
less than 255 are not supported if I
partially translucent lightweight
component overlaps a heavyweight
component the heavyweight component will
not show through secondly embedded
heavyweight components must belong to
the process that created the frame of
the applet the heavyweight component
must have a valid peer within the main
process of the of the application or the
applet and then finally advanced swing
key events such as those events
maintained in an input map might not
work correctly where lightweight and
heavyweight components are being mixed
then that contributor case there are no
no there are no known workarounds
translucent windows as of the Java
platform standard edition 6 update 10
release you can add translucent and
shape windows to your swing applications
these functions this functionality which
is part of a public ADT package in the
JDK 7 release takes on 3 forms as
follows you can create a window with
uniform translucency where each pixel
has the same translucency or alpha value
screen capture here shows a window with
a 45% translucency or you can create a
peer-to-peer translucency where each
pixel has its own alpha value and with
this feature you can for example create
a Rendel that fades away to nothing by
defining gradient in alpha values the
following screen capture says it shows a
window with a gradient translucency from
the top fully translucent to the bottom
where it's fully opaque finally you can
create a window with any shape object
that you can define so shaped windows
can be opaque or they can be uniform or
per pixel translucency and the following
screen capture shows an oval shout oval
shaped window with the 30% translucency
now not all platforms will support these
capabilities an unsupported operation
exception is thrown when code attempts
to invoke this set shape or set opacity
methods on the platform that does not
support these capabilities X renderer
based Java 2d for modern x11 now the new
X renderer based 2d rendering pipeline
is supported for modern x11 based
desktops and this offers really an
improved graphics performance the
pipeline is disabled by default but
enabled by sending them the command line
with a property - T Sun Java 2d X
renderer equals true now you may find
that some on older x11 configurations
may not be able to support that extra
render and so there's this rule there's
a verbose form it's got - D Sun Java 2d
X render equals true can be used to
enable the message to STD out indicating
whether the pipeline was actually
enabled OpenType compact font formats
compact form
compact font format also known as CSF
font format type - font format or c FF
type - font format is a loss less
compaction of type 1 formats using type
2 character strains it's designed to use
less storage space and type 1 fonts by
using the operators with multiple
arguments various predefined default
values more efficient allotment of
encoding values and shared subroutines
within the font sets or a family of
fonts now the Java platform really has
to be able to support these type of true
type fonts 4 and other font technologies
as it is in an implementation dependent
form so in Java 7 the JDK now enumerates
and displays Paulding installed open
type CSF fonts through message such as
graphics environment get available font
family names and these fonts are also
recognized by the font not create font
method better support for linux fonts
for Solaris and Windows the logical
thoughts for JDK are statically
specified in the font config properties
files now on various implementations of
Linux there really was no assurance of
the presence of particular fonts to
support these particular locale and this
required that you would probably have to
edit those the edit the fonts in in the
font can pick properties now on Java 7
linux and solaris uses the system lib a
font config reflecting what can what the
genome and KDE desktop applications
actually use HSB HSL CMYK tabs in the
color chooser these are new options that
are coming in now the default color
chooser provides five chooser panels to
chooser panels that you see up here
swatches for choosing the color from a
collection of swatches which you
actually see demonstrated here HSV which
is hue/saturation value representation
now prior to JDK 7 or this was called
HSB for huge saturation brightness so a
minor change that goes on there HSL for
choosing color from the hue saturation
lightness color representation this is
new in JDK 7 RGB for choosing the color
from the red green blue color model and
then finally CMYK which is the color
using the process color for a four color
model and this is new in JDK 7 if you're
looking for more information on the GUI
changes that occurred in Java 7
I've got a few tutorials that are listed
here the Nimbus look-and-feel tutorial
the how to decorate components with the
J layer class mixing heavy wave and
lightweight components how to create
translucent and shaped windows and how
to use a color chooser well thanks for
listening and watching this particular
skink screencast we'll do another one of
these where we'll cover some information
about the changes that were related to
the virtual machine and some other
miscellaneous changes that we're in JDK
in Java 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
