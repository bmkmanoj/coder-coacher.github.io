the box my name is synonymous with our
champion and doing here the interview
for for the night taking thing and next
to me is a young can handle yep part of
the de vacas Belgium team and I he's
here in special role he's doing the nice
sweet wall and information displays in
the big cinema rooms and I thought will
continue a bit more about this but first
they probably tell a bit more about
yourself yeah so I'm your case from
netherlands been with death walks now
for i think five years six years
something like that I'm not sure it's
actually working that there is so yeah
I'm building a tweet all right now
that's my site role in the team apart
from doing cfb stuff and building up to
the venue and the things that other
people I'll do as well which actually
got a lot of fun because you do at least
me i'm working on a typical office
application stuff like that and to
pricey stuff which don't get displayed
on big screens and stuff like that so
that's actually kind of fun yeah and so
you you inherited the code I think you
had a predecessor and you you got it as
a kind of a legacy yeah not sure if
legacy is the nice term but I I did
inherit it from javadekar built the
first version in angular and I more or
less built on that expanding it adding
new features changing the team every
year so it fits in with with with the
global dev ox team so it's a it's a
JavaScript html5 client application
running in a browser yeah yeah through
at first it was like using jQuery for
animations like the pure JavaScript
approach but now mostly CSS which is why
smoother and nicer and basically runs on
your GPU and yeah it's you saying
angular as the framework behind it do
for doing API calls and the logic
but for the rest it's like a static one
page display so on you have to integrate
every year new API is new stuff the
schedule things change from year to year
or how does it work um we have a couple
of back ends with the most important one
being the CFP and see if be basically
holds all the data for the whole
conference for devix Belgium us for all
of them and it also contains the
schedule and contains api's to access
the schedule access speaker information
their photos the profile stuff like that
a couple of separate endpoints and I
just invoke them all combine the data
and try to fit the data in slots so you
know these are the tracks that run at
the moment these are the talks that are
going to run next and this is the
speaker and all the stuff like that yeah
so now yeah for this you did something
special we saw those those Batman I can
display that's some deep learning very
advanced stuff so tell us about it yeah
it's actually really complicated stuff
but not for me because I just used it so
I use IBM Watson for that the with the
alchemy language client or API sure what
is what you call it service alchemy
language service sorry haha and
basically you just throw in a bunch of
text and it does the analysis for you
with us kind of technol taxonomy
classification extracting words
importance relevance and also sentiment
and sentiments what I use for the Batman
icons on the tweet wall to to see if it
we dispositive less positive or neutral
or whatever or a negative one and then I
display the smileys accordingly but it's
not always correct in my opinion so what
are the problems that I heard about a
language is an issue so if you're
posting in French you might be not
evaluated correctly yeah that was
actually a bit of misinformation from my
side which Stefan then broadcast in the
keynote
my mistake because it's true some some
text that I throw in are not analyzed at
all because it does an order detection
basically texted that i'll throw in it
tries to detect the language that is
being used and then does the algorithm I
thought it didn't work for Dutch and
French and a lot of other languages but
apparently it only didn't work for Dutch
because it's not supported I thought it
was so I was like oh maybe I'm making
books or stuff like that but it was just
not supported feature okay that's good
any plans for next year already or the
more in the short short term what'd you
do what'd you change or typically I
didn't do any planning on this thing I
do have some ideas but it also depends
on what we're going to do like for
example this year we have the huntley
and I will display a leader board of the
people who are at the top of the game
but if we don't do that next year we
have we don't display it and also but
what I do want to do is make it a bit
more interactive so speakers can have
maybe some interaction with the with the
audience X not maybe with Twitter but
maybe with a special API something like
that or a ticker or something like that
maybe only show tweets that are either
conference global or belong to a
specific room and then only showed it in
that room because they might be more
appropriate to those people then and
what we also do we personally I find it
a bit of an information overload but we
have a lot of information so that's a
hard problem but if if we can manage to
to differentiate between rooms and for
example show tweets for different rooms
and segregate those go there we can also
say holy show the next slot or maybe
highlight the next slot for the current
room so you know if you have to stay in
or you have to move to another one
because I think most people don't
remember which room number they are
currently in like am I in five or eight
I don't know where did I go I came in
from that side so
I agree i don't remember the room
numbers yes neither do i so I'm son
sounds a good improvement yeah
absolutely yeah okay so um some some
refresh may be coming for next year
that's good that's great news yeah
that's always good to maybe a different
technology this time I've been building
on this angular app for like five years
now and it's getting a bit of messy it
might be nice to do something else this
time maybe also javafx like you do maybe
something like more of a game engine or
something like that so you can do 3d
animations or stuff like that I'm not
yet sure I want to do something else at
least okay that's good some will be very
interested in what's coming up so nice
that we're here yeah thanks for joining
us for the interview thanks four ever me
and then my pleasure so thank you have a
great conference so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
