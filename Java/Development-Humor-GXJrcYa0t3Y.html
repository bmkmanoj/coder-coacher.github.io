I have a special guest on bran oil and
so I was thinking of your Twitter
account yes in English my twitter is
programmers life but it's very easy to
open and no ok ok so but Andres yes so
you are you were developer and now you
actually change career and decided to do
a lot more like a humor about the
development and I mean development and
developers yes I'm still developer to
but but it's for me so it's only for
personal eating etc but I'm focusing on
humor yes and drawings in videos so how
did you come to the idea to actually
start this career about like doing like
drawing I worked on software houses in
developing about nine years and ever
ever company I work we have the the
programmers room yes with some
programmers and I always thought it was
funny to to be among programmers and we
have a special way to talk to to get
funny and and that became something
funny on twitter i created the program
under hell it's real programmer
translate and like I started to to tweet
tweet some funny some 20 quotes and
funny things about programming and and
then I thought why I why could I could
do some comics with stories that I leave
it stars of friends of mine and
then I i started comes in and sooo many
people from brazil send me stories so I
have many stores that I didn't draw yet
because many people send me stories so
it became a great community among this
and so you basically built your own
community around like humor it's because
I always thought that programmers are
funny okay we like this and we like that
the jokes that other people don't even
understand and it's a nice thing to to
have come specifically by programming
and programmers in our strange lives
okay so you so you have a website so
which is called programmers agreement
that live ya life and we are showing it
so it's a it's like here and so I know
you have like a drawing specifically so
on specific topics so so could you show
us like the one about like the weather
programmer is often like am asked to do
ok as programmers and I think you had
one about like the fear is my first
comic is about I think that all
programmers leave when we are
programmers the other people think that
everything that has buttons is our
responsibility everything everything
microwave everything that has a button
it's the developer the programmer so my
first conch is about it's about a
printer the guy's guy dude they taught
me our programmer right yeah that's
great cause my printer is not working in
the programmer
which part of programmers have you
missin programmer not not the support
not a tech guy I'm a programmer I don't
fix printers actually I hate printers so
uh and you had another one that is
pretty cool about protect productivity
in Java yes yes the people say that Java
is very hard and have a low they're
pretty productive served by my English
okay but a friend of mine leave that and
send it to me when the company I were
merging with another company the new
boss while I was interviewing everything
everyone and they asked do do do you
program in what language I'm java oh but
to be productive you using job but the
programmers need to be very good and my
friend oh true but tell me in which
language bed programmers can be
productive yes Jordan the productivity
is with good programmers in like in
every language and you need good
programmers its Chavez vital pitch p
everyone you have to to you need to have
good programmers and the last one is
about the the caricature of like what
people think about programmers what is
