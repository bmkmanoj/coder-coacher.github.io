sanger direct from ubatuba bless you one
of the most beautiful city in this
country and today we are going to visit
my my lad myspace that I am very lucky
to have this space with different tools
available different components and it's
my my kind of a playground and I going
to show you a little bit more about and
today the idea is to talk about some
projects that I did in the past talk
about about some experience that I had
using different types of boards and
migrating projects from Arduino to
Raspberry Pi and I'm going to talk about
my I'm going to show a little bit ah my
space and my my tools my cnc machine so
let's start having fun this is a place
that I have all the resistors and now
the types of components that I i need i
have some a box is many plastic box is
when you start doing a working with
embedded and meet yourself you start
buying a huge amount of plastic box and
I have different projects here on top i
have my my computer code computer
collection it's a z8 computer and so
here i have more tools that I'm i use
and some projects that i put here today
to show you I I have some cool projects
like the this robot Steve that we did
for maker faire we have this very nice
panel with raspberry pi and this you do
board is very new
four times more powerful than a
raspberry PI's a huge amount off a cpu
and GPU acceleration is very nice board
and here we have the famous and data
panel that we use to explain different
types of boards that people can try can
use this panel during some hackathons or
workshop that we use to promote with
Oracle so here I have the some basic
tools to cut things like you saw here
you can just turn on e and and cut your
material like a wood up or plastic tube
dude you around prototype so I started I
start with these geez machine for Kurt
my my robots and the finish was not that
good but equality is not that good but
you can you can make many coo coo store
if you just print the the drought that
you want to cut you just glue in your
wood and follow the path using your hand
so it's kind of a CNC manual and here is
a to make hole is this very nice one
very very good to have and i have here
my legal we wish out the legal
demonstration is a linux is the ev3
that's a cool project and to finish I i
have here my my own a stock of component
raspberry PI's and relay boards and
everything and now i'm going to walk in
my house I'm you one room just for
electronics so during a software
development and I don't usually do the
dirt part of the work like when I crush
these panels and I'm going to produce
and I need you I make a lot of dirt so
I I go to another place in my house
downstairs and here is the place that I
have my own cnc machine this is very
nice is a kind a medium size of CNC
machine we use to cut cut would I like
to work with wood this is a prototype of
Steve's had the first one and make very
cool stuffs like a coaching and get
graving and engraving and and so we use
stamps to make our finish and this is a
pretty cool machine very very nice i
love to be working here as you can see i
have all the the wood pieces that i
already cut it here and so i can i can
use it to make some fire and so uh such
a lucky thing to have a cnc machine in
your house because you can produce
different types of prototypes with very
good quality for that which yourself
project and i'm going to regard showing
something with raspberry pi java and a
lot of do-it-yourself spirit ah that is
jeans raspberry pi camera this is a
camera that i did by myself so i have
here the top is acrylic but inside you
still that i am using plywood very thin
plywood 3 millimeters plywood and the
plywood is very good for do-it-yourself
because the screws can go very strong
and you know you can you can make even
an index size of of ply you'd i can make
holes and without breaking the the wood
internally and very strong a holes for
this
so very nice and the camera stay right
here and here we have the SD card and
here you can use the GPIO came here if
you need you to put some sensor we have
the the video composite in the audio and
here we have the hdmi connection so I
used to measure and and I make the
cutting plan in using a software and so
everything can feed very very well
inside and you can protect and I love
you would but you can put stamps and it
will be very acceptable acceptable led
followed it yourself projects and so
here we just have one button the idea of
this camera is to take our pictures
every amount of minutes like a soul this
is a cool project that I'm I am
producing to a friend so I'm working on
this project and using asbury pie java
and bedded and the s java sea and i'm
using 54 g to trigger the camera the
camera we don't have a java api for
using the raspberry pi camera but you
can call a comment line using using java
very easy and called it a raspy stew
current line to take pictures and if you
want to reproduce these nice camera do
it yourself Wi-Fi Wi-Fi raspberry pi
camera you have all this first school
available in the java.net is like
Chaplin just go to the challenge don't
you developer challenge website and
download the pi camera project and I
talking about this project in the video
lesson number four about by four JM gpio
you can also watch this video on youtube
in Portuguese and in English so next
project i am going to show you is a
project where i started to change you
know that three years ago we didn't have
all this amount of variety of boards
like a pc doing or raspberry pi a
BeagleBone black me no board Intel
Galileo at YouTube for the Rio Chi and
many other board we have a huge amount
of options to Renly not inside a single
board computer that will not consume a
lot of power energy like raspberry pi is
actually much more than a matter
controller but it's not bad you can run
Raspberry Pi on battery I try an
experiment here in New ketubah to
rediscover a I amla's with a solar panel
like the size of a 15-inch up 15 inch
laptop distal er petta was and I could
power on I just plug this solar panel in
a voltage regulator because the solar
panel can give you like a 25 votes and i
put in a voltage regulator 25 votes and
turn and plug the 5 volt regulator into
the Raspberry Pi and so no batteries in
the middle and the raspberry pi could
stay alive how works under descent so it
was awesome and so but here in the past
we didn't have this amount of of options
of words actually we have much more
things like her doing your stuff and the
Linux own on single board computers was
not very popular so I started doing the
J home automation project which we we
wondered Luke Choice Award in 2011 so
three years ago and at that time I was
up
making a java a gateway for house so i
was using the gps to to control relays
and schedule applies in our house is
like every every time I every 10 a.m.
you turn off the light or something like
this and everybody thought that I oh you
are crazy to use Java for doing that and
today we have lightning overt computers
the capability to run a Java EE
container very easy like if you watch
you run JD or you want to run tomcat you
can run anyhow javon better switch which
is a very nice article a stack of
product just have a very lightweight
every container running with good
performance on Raspberry Pi but this
project I used to produce this hardware
we far do we know basis and relays and
LED control and sensors like temperature
humidity lights and sir and uh I used to
integrate with please oh I have a Disney
of my background in the past them ah one
experience that I had we heard we know
bad experience it was driving relays
with four wheels very basic stuff but if
you have a some types of appliances like
fans when we stop it generates a type of
coolant and noise that just locked it
microcontroller h mega microcontroller
sure you can isolate like using optical
isolation or you can put some a future
between the the appliance and your relay
but is very inconvenient to do that
always and and actually the it made the
project more complex so this is the
first time that i really i was in a
really bad situation I was in vivek's
and memos was crashing all the time
because our
you know was freezing all the time that
I try to control a certain type of land
that generate the noise and lock the 80
mega so fortunately the Raspberry Pi we
can drive the release in a very nice way
used by for Jay and raspberry pi it
doesn't have this instability you can
use regular relays without optic
resolution so this is such it practical
stuff that we just just learn by doing
and it's kind of situations that I am
collecting in my last six years we far
do you know that are reasons why you
sometimes you must use something more
about more robust than do you know using
Java and we using operational system and
these boards they are very more easy
going with different types of handsome
so this project i am happy to do the the
j home automation project because now we
have many options for doing home
automation Jane Jane Hamid project is
just part of history you know and now
I'm going to show let me think your
robots so here I have his cool spider
Jesus spider I have raspberry pi and a
control board to drive the motors and
I'd like to chew III was I like to oops
to try to use up works like a more than
being an LED so the first thing that I I
like to do when I I just buy a new board
or we see this upward sample I like to
put the board you drive a robot and see
what is happening and how does it
perform how will be the connections the
power supply for the board
pardon for the robot so it's very nice
to do robot because you have many
different challenges including some
types of boards can be sensible with
this equipment also and sometimes you
can generate noises with the motors in
your wireless connection like radio free
things can be affected by by that so
this kind of stuff that is very nice to
try to make a robot because you learn a
lot about that dead bird huh so I did
many robots just using Arduino and when
i started with raspberry pi I just up
ahead the Raspberry Pi as the the the
internet interface to the robot so I can
have the Raspberry Pi talking with my
older mean project and using the serial
communication and uh I could I could
make us a gay to each of the robot so I
can commend the robot using restfully
TI's and I just starting doing this
gateway that you talk that can't help
with any serial device so and use your
prosperity by any serial device
connected through the USB and we can
expose any serial device using Java
embedded server rest to the tcp/ip word
so it's very nice way to integrate
things that are not ECPI p with amity
TTIP word like a infrared components if
you have a air conditioning you can use
the infrared remote control to a meet a
delight to your equipment and automate
your air-conditioned and uh so like
robots very much I did this other one
what is it older looking to do
I have this other one i am using java
and this is the Intel Galileo so I am in
the robot test piece do we think they'll
Galilee I like this chassis I talked it
in our robot hang out that you can watch
on youtube channel also and I like to
see because it's very easy to to mount
very strong very fast and you can make
line followers with a very good
precision and I i'm just using
valleydale here and i have a star doing
a shoot because Galileo is a it has his
army no compatible actually it has a v12
Arduino is not a physical
microcontroller so if you two allies
they're doing a site which is not that
good not yet I think but I I was trying
and I am dealing with some issues to
make the communication with the Arduino
and the linux and Chapman said so I
don't you spend more time here but just
if I I want to build robots with the
sample boards and here we have this
panel up Despero i'm using the child the
chalk chalk board screen this is type of
ipad let me see if I am in the right
place yeah I and replace this is a iPad
touch screen interface if you look in
the back of this banner we have here a
Raspberry Pi connected to that using
this board here jeez board that just
make the ADG mi connection oops let me
see here is not easy to be a cameraman
using a laptop here we go so this is the
border
chalkboard that connects the interface
and it also has a USB cable for the
touch command and here we also have a
camera attached to this panel and we
also have a make him a keyboard they
make you make you can build your own
keyboard using a conductive and
resistance so I can put the alligator
clips liking the water and once I touch
the ground at the same time that I touch
the water the water will be any key of
your keyboard like arrow keys space
return and right click left click from
the mouse so the makey makey is a very
nice way to make different keyboards and
the idea of this is we have a Java
effects application running this panel
and we intend to use this panel in
conference so the people can take group
self pictures in group so the idea is
the pivot the people will need to give
the hands or to hug each other having a
skin contact and one will touch the
ground and another one will touch a same
thing and this it will close the circuit
and it will activate the raspberry pi
camera and it will take a picture and
send to a social network and so this is
a funny project just the javafx boat is
very simple and uh and the just having
ideas with a existent resource that I
have in my hand and disks guy here is
the you do board this is a pretty new
board with is four times faster more
power than Raspberry Pi
with wireless Bluetooth SATA connection
for hard disks HDMI internet USB you
have a and he also have an appt beam
gooey inside the board so you can have
the best of both words like you can have
the microcode educated microcontroller
just to drive the GPIO sy square CSPI
things like that and also you can have
the power of the linux running into ah
come inside a computer that is four
times faster then uh then the Raspberry
Pi so if you want to check for more
informations youtube.com and up you you
d 00 Ark double 0 and here we have the
another panel this panel uh we we are
using a lot the last year so we have
different boards raspberry PI's your
mouth contact board that we produce a
video about this board is very nice big
open black Nino board so you can ruin
java in out those kinds of ports make
your gpio connections start reading your
sensors and and and you can use actually
a of those boards to to to make your
project for the contest let me just play
start because i prepare demonstration
gerbils just notice that the wireless
module was not on and ah and ah if you
start if it start happening with you you
are using raspberry pi and the wireless
just turned off check your power supply
sometimes you don't have a power supply
to give Quint and off to have the
wireless module running so just let me
check here
i'm going to show you something ad is
the last one just let me see if I have
ah yeah this is right and
ok
back again so what I'm to do now is to
about make a connection we might end of
the embedded parallel to make up this
demonstration for you today and just let
me
my screen with you sure mcqueen full
screen right oh so now I'm going to
start a buddy session with these IP
address which is the embedded panel and
Lord owners rep I raspberry okay and I'm
going to start
server for exposing other boards and
sensors through the rest costs
cause and now what we have here is once
it started we did our automation concept
based on minecraft so we produce that
just check if it's working yeah it's
working perfect what we did is this
beautiful word and we have these levers
it's colored levers and behind this guy
we have some Java code running on
raspberry pi into a server inside
raspberry pi that is to create
modifications mods for Minecraft and so
here once I click in this lever it will
turn on a light inside my my offices I
will show you the light turning on and
off but I can I will not be able to show
birth things delight and also the lever
here but trust me is working and this
lever I can't have the control of
mischievous head so it's an interactive
way a collective project that connect a
view to a word with the real world and
if I put my hand in the front of robot
you will see some fireworks here so take
a look I'm putting my hand in front of
Steve and so I'm having the fireworks
again and I can use the humidity sensor
to make it rain side digital words so
these are very nice it's very nice to
see that minecraft is a fever and it's
all about java minecraft is all done in
java so he's a very nice implementation
with a java engine and also behind the
game and also a raspberry pi server java
server running on Raspberry Pi a Java
modification plugin that integrate the
home automation system with your
minecraft game so you could replicate
that your house inside minecraft so let
me return to the
the to the real world now let me let me
show the things in the real world here
and okay so I'm back and so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to try to stay
like this and I'm going to the Minecraft
and I'm going to the levers let me walk
here and oops no guy bad boy so uh here
we go
oh ok so here we go with it is taking
some time because i'm using the Wi-Fi
module and my machine is very overloaded
here so i'm turning on and with some
delay we are turning on the lamps here
we go the labs using minecraft so this
is very very fun and it's very useful it
could be a product actually let me show
you a cheap again the hills behind is
chief this chief is a complete robot
with star falls articulation for his
head with a articulation for his hand
and different types of sensor it has
also a camera in his eyes and the camera
if you click in the wall you can take
pictures and we use it as chief to show
the java technology end to end
implementation at the during the last
Maker Faire this weekend and so it was
very very crazed fair the last weekend
very fun so now here we have some
project so we have some idealist Emma my
experience is my grant migrating project
from from Arduino to raspberry by some
reasons why we are doing that and we are
available to I answer your question at
the the Oracle community forum I will
remember again the address so it's very
easy to get there just go to the
community at oracle.com and go Rachel up
to the end of the page and you will see
Javon Bennett here we go click here and
go to the eye
she developer challenge and here we go
just connect you using Facebook to
either and make your question here we
will be supporting your project the
deadline to submit your iot java project
is the next thursday so don't don't
don't as long as your time and you just
have like seven days to finish your
project remember that a under important
thing is that i am here to help you i
have time tomorrow i have time sunday i
have time a monday i know that it will
be a holiday in us and if you need my
support is not a volunteer actually i am
doing my job since oracle just contract
global code to help to promote so i will
be very happy to to help your project
and see your iot implementation with
java even it is a very simple thing like
we relay using some sensor just meet
because you will have your name in our
least you will have your project in our
project least at our website it will be
good for you and will be good for us to
see different ideas and different
products on this challenge so thanks a
lot and see you in the next hangout ok
thanks for watching us alive and thank
you for thanks for you that will be
watching us offline uh after the hours
here ok so thank you so much our
community see you there and ate my
twitter is at this singer s ii and ger v
SE and GT r and my email is VI and I see
I us at global food cannot be our and
but if you have any kind of technical
question or steamy
support we are trying to make all the
support at the Oracle Java community
forum okay so thanks again and have a
good night or good day bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
