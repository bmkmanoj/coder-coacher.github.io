two of night hacking at Jay focus we're
gonna have another fun set of interviews
interview Farook hi and panels and more
interviews and more interviews and yeah
my panels the only one panel only one
button okay and so all right let me
introduce my my guest here so Baruch
Sutter gorski's from jay frog yes hi
and he's their evangelist and flies
around the world talking about
artifactory and Ben Tre and the stuff
around the kind of stuff around there
yeah yeah so we're gonna show us today
promise something cool OSS and now Smith
yes are you gonna are you gonna
disappoint man I know I never disappoint
what I want to show you today is a set
of tools that all of them are
cloud-based and all of them are free
that allow you push software from a
development from source code to a
distribution platform so we're going to
take some source code from one of the
cloud-based version controls it could be
github it could be a any other one and
then we will use agin hop in our example
build it with a cloud CI server again
there are a bunch of a Travis CI drone
i/o we will use code ship for this
example from that we will use a free a
artifactory instance for open-source
developers oh it says jefra gorg
which hosts snapshots and we will
promote a snapshot to a new relatively
new distribution platform called bin
tray this is what you see on the screen
now from bin tray you can use the
release or even sink to maven central if
you feel like doing something legacy so
all this is open source free for open
source projects the entire workflow
you're gonna share it in ten minutes
you're gonna do this whole thing
hopefully will take even less what we're
going to do now is a releasing live a
new version over to factory a client
java this is small library we
provides a Java API on top of multi
Factory this is I found it more fun than
than showing some hello world this is
actual product and this is your product
this is one of our community released
during it push a new release of
artifactory yes and we are going to
release a new version of a factory
client just now so let's verify you can
check me that I'm not lying this is
Megan central and the latest version is
0 12 here's my source code I have a new
commit that I made yesterday I added
this cool button to be able to download
the latest version from the entry and
this commit was built in courtship this
is the build it took 2 minutes I won't
show it live because it's precious 2
minutes but I ran it about 9 hours ago 2
a.m. this morning and it was a success
let's just verify this is the commit it
takes us to github to the same library
actually to the same commit as I
mentioned I updated the readme with the
new bin tray button the build was
successful and the last thing it does it
deploys to artifactory
OSS j4 gorg as our dimension this is a
free artifactory instance for a open
source product in order to get a look in
to this to this instance you need to
create a package in bin 3 it's ok give
us some examples of some open source
projects so here in a ssj4 gorg we have
the Netflix OSS packages we have red
pack which is extraordinary a web
framework from from groovy guys and
there is a new tenant in OSS jeffra gorg
which called groovy o which is a groovy
programming language that we know all
laws I think I think some of us might
have heard of groovy yeah groovy it's
cool one so yeah basically it's also a
nice area for work in order to get a
count here
all you need to do is register on bean
tray create a new package and inside the
package
issue a Request well the interent here
is working i think you're competing with
the other thousand people who just came
out of the session or trying to check
their Twitter
now let's said because this is a
cloud-based demo it should have the
clouds available so here is about
onstage snapshots on algebra gorg once
you click this button there is the
request comes to us we take a look to
verify that you are actually good a
behaving open-source project and if
that's the case you will be able to
build your staff and deploy your
snapshots to OSS Jay frog org like I did
with the artifactory Java client so this
build the latest build is the result of
a the last build I just saw on code ship
so here you see this is the link to code
ship let's verify that we are talking
about the right build yeah that's
exactly what we saw earlier so now after
we have it snapshots in our artifactory
and we can build as many as we like
once you are satisfied with the quality
and here the quality is superb the new
ABE entry button is just perfect so I am
actually ready to release my build it
has three modules each and every one of
them have a bunch of jars those jars
currently are snapshot we can see in
artifactory
they are all in the snapshots repository
here you go
oh it says snapshot local now I'm going
to run a promotion it will take the
snapshots from myself
jefra gorg convert them to be a releases
on-the-fly
change all the palm files or name of the
jars files do all this kind of stuff and
push them to bin tray hopefully we will
have enough internet to do that so where
is my cheat sheet here we go
well this is not violent I didn't enter
the build name okay
so I'm also super gorg plug-in build
promote I want to promote snapshot tube
entry of the factory Java client I need
to specify the build number this is the
build number I will add it to it and
we're good to go now I need super secret
password time super secret password mode
just a second
yeah here we go okay back to there yeah
so I enter my password and now what's
actually happening now the jar files
that are part of this build that we
build in cold ship are getting converted
from snapshot to release and upload it
to bin tray one by one again we will see
how the Internet will manage with that I
think we already can see the new files
going in let's take a look the new
version should be created by now here we
go
this is the new version and now it
should be populated with the files that
being uploaded let's see if we have some
files you see the files are starting to
get in here what we have built out the
factory Java client has been
successfully promoted which is
outstanding with our network connection
so now we have a full version on a on
bin tray it's already fully usable you
can configure your maven or Gradle to
work with bin tree directly and this is
a highly recommended because it will get
a much more out of fact under than maven
central well super set of it and we can
tweet about the new air release so I can
say version has been released live on
night rocking stage
grab it from bin tray and we're good
so now after we have these successful
release if we really want to do
something legacy style then we can sync
these relays to a mail in central yeah
for that we have a couple of
requirements first of all we need to
sign all our jar files ok so we're going
to the future of signing is building
inside bin tray
so we'll actually issue another arrest
request this time to bin tray to sign
our package it's this one and I think
we're good
super-secret password again ok good
yeah okay so we're back or back perfect
now let's see what happened we have now
we should have new files inside yep here
are the files here are all the signature
files automatically generated by bin
three oh so now we will publish those
and all we need to do now is go to maven
central provide password again this time
for a sauna type mm-hmm not only again
yep wait wait wait I am I'm double
clicking when I should there okay good
and so I was waiting for your tweet to
come through you you misspelled night
hacking oh my god I don't beat the game
anyway well caught it and fix it yeah
can you put back then put back the what
what they scream OH
oh yeah yeah okay there you go wait it's
double clicked again okay you're back
okay I'm back so we have everything
ready we can sync now
it issues a rest call to a maven central
and it will be released once the moment
central will reply that everything is
good very good let's see
it's not surprising that the slowest
part has something to do with those guys
yeah yeah
everything else was quite that's best
not in your control what can you do I
can wait for it to over let's see if we
have a new version here already not yet
okay any news
well anyhow once they even think how
successfully seeing the ice now let's
see now it should see a new version in
maven central as well not yet no
congratulations we have our first
product release on the night hacking
stream yeah this is real hacking thanks
very much for thank you thank you and
what's the pleasure soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
