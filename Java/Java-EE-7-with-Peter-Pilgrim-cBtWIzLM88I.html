Belgium I'm your employee from Oracle
technology Network and my guest today is
a Peter pilgrim Peter hi hi nice to meet
you amber nice to meet you too happy to
have you here yeah I'm good to be I'm
glad to be at devoxx again yeah how many
time have you been at devoxx I must be
seven times so my first time is Java
polis 2007 whoa 2005 actually yes and
then the last time I was here was I
think dev rocks 2013 and I just had my
book published yeah yeah I said my first
book java ee developer handbook and last
year i completed another book Oh digital
java ee 7 so it I've done to java ee
books seven books yeah great yeah so you
are a Java developer yes I should act as
well I yeah a little bit I I know about
architecture and I'm an independent
contractor I tend to get to do hands-on
development and by the time I'm brought
on two projects the architecture and
there and the design is already
completed they're not thinking about
moving to micro services in where
occasions I have been brought in early
in the software development life cycle I
see so what kind of the challenges that
you see with working with divine or the
new customers I mean it's a mixed bag of
technology it's it mostly monolithic web
applications which you will use either a
combination of older technology ee 6
and maybe spring framework yes a lot of
clients do you spring framework and I
used to work in investment banking so
you know things like weblogic an IBM
WebSphere but now I think the biggest
thing that's not java ee s4 is that we
have a mountain of legacy software that
makes it hard to upgrade so i can think
of a particular client that uses a
particular technology such as seen and
they're trying to move to a more EE
standard architecture i can pick another
client that used IE 6 with spring
framework and they are stuck with it for
the foreseeable future so so and that's
what the projects I I help out so so
cold so so called digital transformation
projects it so so so because there is a
lot of buzz words right we talk about
micro services and so so all those
trends what what is your I mean on the
ground let's say you know in a practical
project so how do you see those trends
actually being translated into real
projects well yes so from microservices
it's difficult to for to get
organizations to transform because there
there's a to do it in the same way as
next flicks or body like that there has
to be cultural change you need developer
operations mindset and you need to spend
money hye-rin enough resources to cover
your targeted microservices and and an
organization's will find that
challenging I think and the other thing
that in my time as the independent
contractor there's a distinct lack of
tests that I've seen in encode such as
unit tests or very brittle functional
tests where you have fixtures that are
so heavyweight that it is impossible to
mock them or or their impedances like
there are not enough development
databases because they're shared between
multifunctional team so there are none
of this is java ee s fault and and of
course this time pressure cut a time to
market these architectural tour so I
terms and you know as you know as well
as availability of security and
delivering the software that customers
actually need and so it's no wonder that
engineers have forgone any sort of tests
or the tests I've been so weak and
there's just not been enough focus on
getting or doing agile correctly so and
said it's a multi-dimensional a multi
fashion faceted difficulties I that I
see not just with java ee it could be
any other technologies such as peifer
Norse Carl or whatever or you know or
Android or whatever it is that you want
to progress with yeah so did evolution
of the platform is really like having a
path to evolution is really the
challenge in many cases yes so it's the
right idea to make developers life
easier I think yes I that was java ee
free or ej being free we're making it
eat what what was it called at javaone
ease of development we can do a lot more
especially food David Delabar sees talk
about delivery microservices by making
testing easier if you think about it if
services developers are going to write
code to that is targeted on machines
they done on they better be able to test
these services locally on their own
machine on their own private clouds and
that's assuming you get through the
dysfunction of companies that allow
these sort of environments to be set up
so a lot of the testing also is being
pushed to not you a QA a team anymore
but also to the well pushed our QA team
but also to to the engineers right who
are responsible for some of the day's
testing so yes so that would be correct
so in organizations like neck flicks or
the goth UK Home Office project that I
was involved in you have to build
cucumber or behavior driven development
tests as part of the sprint and so
that's also that is needed but it's also
the infrastructure that is needed to
support the engineers I'm sorry of
course it's a lot of work and a lot of
expertise but so yeah so that's the main
thing I see there so what would be your
recommendation then to to those
companies or to those teams like one so
to focus on testing to what would be
like a concrete steps that they could
take my second concrete step is that
there are lots of organizations that
want to modernize they don't know how
and one way to that they should look it
is to modulus their monoliths and
be prepared the IT director should be
prepared you must throw away cold you
must invest money in not just in
delivering code and product features to
customers you need to eat your own dog
food and take care and have a core
platform team because if you don't look
after your core business and you don't
allow developers or engineers to come to
conferences like DevOps and to learn
you're causing your you're leaving
yourself exposed I wouldn't say that's
the end of your business because if you
have a monopoly in the market you always
sell software to wait to the clients but
you're leaving yourself long-term with
customers or fast competitor who will
suddenly appear at your door and the
other thing as I said it was multifamily
faceted dimension is you've gotta think
of the technology always changes i say
this is a industries is a moving feast
so you've got java 9 with modules coming
along so does your software which is
still compiling against java 6 will it
run against John 49 and and of course
the pressures with the modern Java
hipsters who are going to be really
interesting pariah micro or Oracle cloud
their customers out there that will in
the future want to take advantage of
these new possibilities and they like
the comfort of a standard should
something go wrong with Oracle cloud
they could go to cloud foundry so this
is standardization and a balance with
innovation so yeah I hope that helps
yeah it sounds like a very concrete
steps you and thing to think about even
if you are in still using Java EE 6
yeah so and so you mentioned the two
books but can you remind us like what
what the latest book was the latest book
was called digital java ee 7 digital be
probably means being more aware of not
just been coding you you're working in a
team with a lot of skills it's it's a
book about the website of java
technology so there's javaserver faces
there's angular version 1 and even a ee8
technology which is in beta or call
model-view-controller and it may or may
not appear in the next edition I hope it
does but but it points the way the point
is is that you're not just a Java
developer you're working with JavaScript
developers and all sorts of clever
people content specialist and an you and
user experience people and also other
experts so that's really where we are
and I think that's the future as well
you write a blog as well i have a blog
here you can find it at zenonia co uk
slash forward slash blog so good and I'm
also on Twitter at at Peter on to score
pilgrim great so you know where to find
expertise thank you thank you so much
better thank you thank you enjoy the
rest of the books appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
