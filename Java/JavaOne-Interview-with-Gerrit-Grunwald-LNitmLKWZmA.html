hacking calm and i'm going to be doing a
series of java one interviews with
different speakers and noteworthy folks
will be at the upcoming conference from
September 22nd through September 26th in
San Francisco the first guest I have on
is Garrett Grunwald let me introduce
Garrett I have him here via Skype how
you doing Garrett hey I'm fine thanks so
Gary is better known as han solo that's
his Twitter handle he works for canoe as
a um what would you what was your
official job capacity there well that's
a good question so it's it's something
like javafx offender list cool so you're
looking they're like my peer since I'm a
java javafx evangelist at Oracle you're
like my peer over there at canoe yes I
try to okay and you're giving like a
huge number of sessions a job one this
year so you were your last count was
eight yeah it's around eight I have 71
my official list and one is on the list
that I can't see so but I know that I
have one more that's crazy yeah it is it
is I didn't like that it was just yeah
talking to many people and trying to get
something in and suddenly nearly
everything was accepted okay so speaking
of what's accepted give us a quick
rundown of some of the sessions I have
your screen up there yes okay so first
of all we have the Raspberry Pi javafx
showdown which is a session that I have
with a guy named Stephen chin yeah I
don't know he's he's crazy that's for
sure and yeah that would be really a fun
session then the idea came to me last
year during javaone so the idea is to
involve the community and showing their
stuff at a session most of the times you
you created something at home which is
not worth
for a whole javaone stage but maybe 14
10 minutes just showing it to others and
spreading the word so and the idea is to
give these people the chance to show
their javafx related stuff on Raspberry
Pi cool we will see how that works out
yep that's that's the first thing on my
list which is that's an easy one for me
the next one is something I never
expected that it will be accepted it's
used the Force Luke or tips and tricks
for using very appropriate title apropos
type yeah it's yeah it was really just
an idea I can't really tell you when I
put in the proposal I was really sitting
on the you know where I'd with my iPad
oh yeah that might be a good title and
send in the proposal yeah that's fun and
I'm not done with this so yeah I have to
figure out what makes sense to show the
next one will be a session that I have
together with Todd which is touch
Costello from Canada and it's about
visualizing embed data from embedded
devices and visualizing data with javafx
so this will be about using a raspberry
pi measuring data somewhere else and
visualizing it either on a desktop or in
the browser or on a on the other
Raspberry Pi so that's Aisha's yeah that
would be fun it's again a session that
came to my mind during last year's
javaone during the right to appreciation
event we discussed that idea and here we
go so yeah that would be fun then the
neverending story about custom controls
now that Jonathan won't be at javaone
unfortunately I thought I could skip
this session but now that he's not there
he asked me I'm free to do this create
your own job FX 8 controlled session
nice thank you I mean that nice that
Jonathan's not going to be there we are
yeah we're all gonna miss Jonathan but
but there's a good reason for him to be
not each other one yeah yeah we're gonna
get lots of good control and code and
yeah yeah if need be so what else do I
have then I have there's a real
technologies and frameworks panel which
is with more people I'm just one of my
very well which will be fun I think this
is also nothing I have to really much
prepare for and then something that I
have together with the Simon Rita its
embargo you leap Motion's Delta Simon
yeah yes so for folks who don't know
what leap motion delete motion devices
can you describe it in 30 seconds in 30
seconds so it's something like the
Microsoft Kinect so it's a controller
for your baby bear can use your hands or
your one hand move it over the
controller and then you can get the
coordinates of the fingers the the palm
and the position of the power and the
fingers and all that stuff and it's
really a sensitive so that means if you
move fast you will get all the events of
the each finger and the other
coordinates and you can use it to
control whatever you like games or you
can also control the mouse so well
subject yeah it's really interesting but
it will give me some headache i'm pretty
sure about that because stuff that i
would like would like to show it's not
that easy and that's not related to
javafx so the leap motion is because i
need a 3d physics engine that works yeah
there are the way the leap motion works
most of the 3d processing is done on the
host computer not on the device right
yes yeah and the problem is that if you
just move things and with the same
coordinates way that your hand creates
that's no problem in javafx but if you
need a physics engine and that was my
idea then it's different then because
the physics engine needs again its own
3d model and you have to update all the
transformations and unfortunately they
use different coordinate systems so it's
really a heck to to get it right and
that's why I'm on right now to hang on
how to do and then the last ones a GUI
makeover oh yeah that's the worst one
because that would be really fun it's a
two hour tutorial session together with
your um your Apple were chatting okay
yes so it's a two hour tutorial session
that we did I have moved on Anton happen
from unique also Java champion cool and
we made this this idea came up when we
did some night hiking at my place where
he when he visited me and yeah we had a
couple of beers I think it was too much
and late at night we had the idea to
propose maybe something together which
is the extreme GUI may go oh yeah and
then we make a decision that if this
book will be accepted we will come in a
varian clothing so it's ever pants all
right I'm definitely coming for that one
that'll be entertaining here and I lost
another bad that's that I have to color
my hair red like a canoe so I will be
look like a jerk but it will be fun okay
so tell us a little bit about what this
is that we're seeing on your on your
desktop yeah now you should see yeah
that's something I'm working on for this
session that I have to get over the Todd
it's about the data position from the
Raspberry Pi measured data and it's a
job of X application where I created
some controls that you can see on top
it's cages and also the charts that you
can see in the in the middle of the
screen so the idea is because this
should also run on a on a Raspberry Pi
and you know if you create a chart then
each of these dots will be a note on the
scene graph and you have to be careful
with notes on the sea king or a pending
pie so I created all that stuff on
ourselves and that's what I'm doing
right now to get it running and this is
actually i think around 90 notes the
whole thing and this is more than one
graph it's f also the last 12 hours and
also the last 24 hours so i can measure
data and put it on a MongoDB
on the web and then this application
will put that out get the data from the
from the web and display the measured
data from for example the last hour and
on top and the gauges you see the real
measured values that are I think in
steps of 10 seconds so if I would now
take the thing in my hand I will see the
temperature increasing oh my telephones
ringing unfortunately all right so on
the screen we have a bunch of folks
watching the live stream and Mike Talon
had a question for you he was wondering
you know you mentioned that you're
trying to keep the number of nodes in
the scene graph small are there any
other functions and controls which are
not supported or have problems on the
pie or arm devices in general that you
know of yeah and on the pie you you
can't use the vet view at the moment
which is a little bit yeah I am
unfortunate but I'm not sure it will
come there are some rumors but at the
moment it's not in so you can't use the
vamp you went HTML the other thing that
I really miss is that's it about
controls I think everything else is
working on the pie but um what you're
missing is the media and especially the
audio clip is something that I miss on
the pie because this is so useful if you
would like to get some audio feedback
from a pie you can connect easily some
speakers to the pie but it's a little
bit tricky to get the sound yeah i know
i was chatting with Jasper about this so
he's a good workaround for video where
you can create a transparent scene yeah
and then display video under your javafx
application but the audio is a little
bit more knowing you'd actually have to
script a background native process to do
the audience yeah it works it since then
but you know because the audio clip has
this low latency and that's what I
really like about it so if you have some
signal and you would like to play a
noise then it's there instantly yeah and
that's that's something that I really
miss but I could the media stuff is not
that important for me but have you tried
the OTA stuff
not yet so it goes for the 3d stuff I
have not really a use case that I really
could say this is something it must be
done in 3d right so it's nice to have
but I think on an embedded device not
really needed maybe it depends on the
use case so for me I have no use case at
the moment yeah yeah so I think the
answer and that is that it's it's in
there right now if you want to use it
see it really support or you can use it
yeah that's that's for sure but it's
usable I don't think it's on the
official supported list for eight yeah
it's it's not I thought it it's on the
list i have no idea so i just saw that
you know the video of that Jasper shows
that if FX touch effects experience com
there's a link of this video and then he
shows some 3d stuff which is nice and
fast but yeah for this kind of stuff it
makes sense but if you have i'm thinking
more about scientific stuff well i have
handles on the five that shows some data
and 3d yeah maybe I have no idea at the
moment I have no use case cool alright
so um anything else you want to mention
related to job one maybe some move to
java one let's rock the house cool cool
yeah so many great things if you have
the chance to go there you should go
there it's the best conference ever it
really is you kept the chance to meet
all the people it's so great i love it
awesome alright well thanks very much
for your time Garrett and I will look
forward to seeing you in San Francisco
yeah looking forward to see you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
