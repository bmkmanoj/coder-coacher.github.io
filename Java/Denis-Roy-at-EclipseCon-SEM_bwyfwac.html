Foundation essentially manage some
servers the website the software the
tools that are commuters and 3d use on a
daily basis to do their development work
the conference is great there's a great
buzz here at Eclipse con this is the
venue that introduced me to eclipse con
back in 2005 so this is eclipse con
number nine I believe for me as a great
buzz a great people lots of excitement
lots of new projects lots of exciting
things even for myself as a non software
developer lots of stuff to get excited
about the new flux project which was
demoed this morning during the keynote
is is particularly interesting some of
these stuff in the IOT I'm a gadget guy
so anything that you know a machine that
talks to another machine it's fairly
interesting some of the activities we're
doing this year a bit differently from
the years passed the Eclipse Foundation
is hosting a booth which is the first
time we're doing that one of the things
that we've realized is that we meet a
lot of members in the community year
after year and they're not entirely sure
what it is that we do with the Eclipse
Foundation so by having a booth we're
hoping to you know answer the popular
questions the questions that people have
regarding you know Eclipse and you know
the foundation itself and our role in
this you know great community
I'm the IT director obviously I usually
come here to support you know the the
Wi-Fi in the infrastructure I come here
to get now bus on the new projects meet
up with the committers mostly and you
know the people that we work with since
Eclipse is a very global community we
don't get to see people very often it's
mostly through email and and an
electronic exchange so eclipse Khan
gives us a great opportunity to actually
interact with people and and connect one
of the exciting things that we're
working on internally which hopefully is
of great use of the committers is the
hudson project we have a hudson
implementation that we call a hip and it
allows communities to to build some of
their project code more reliably than
we've done in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
