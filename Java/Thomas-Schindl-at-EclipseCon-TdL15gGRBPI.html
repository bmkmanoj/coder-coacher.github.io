javafx aight i introduce to people a
little bit into the travel fact space
watch above access it's a graphics
toolkit you can include multimedia
support everything is in there and I've
topped that you have control library
well you have three controls or a table
a text field every charting library with
it so everything is part of javafx eight
and well jel effects it has very new
api's this job of X is fully open source
and it's part of el pinche DK in the end
so everything is available as open
source so you can get it from the
mercurial repository clone it and build
it locally for yourself and it's part of
every GDK download difficult moral the
important thing is that it's not cheesy
art so it's not part of the IBM vm eight
for example alright so it's only part of
open or oracle jdk moderating most
important projects are the controls
effects project which provides extra
controls like a spreadsheet view that
you have an ex like view or editor then
the controls effects project which got
no de javafx extra project which has a
calendar control and the spinner control
for example which are not part of the
standard Java vex library multiple
favorite features one is the support
from better devices well you can run
java effects on a raspberry pi or child
or itself and a raspberry pi the fancy
animations because runs on the GPU
instead of the cpu so that's one of the
main amazing is features and the second
one is support that they have a tree
table control which is the most
important control when you look at
implementing business you I without that
you hardly see any business you are in
the world that hasn't you makes that
doesn't make use of a tree table control
so those new AP eyes are really the
highlights for me which feature I wish
to have in there well I had a vision of
course about half would like to have
support for iOS and and another feature
that I'm really miss is that you don't
have dialogues in there yeah I don't
have a message dialog how can you create
a library but you have dialogues and
develop dialogues in there so this is
something that I made so that but I hope
that gets fixed along the way with Java
8 or chopper 9 and until then they're
extra libraries like Joseph ex who
provide you a dialogue system and yet so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
