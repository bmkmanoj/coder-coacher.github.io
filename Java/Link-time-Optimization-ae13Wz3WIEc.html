I'm here to talk a little bit about J
link in the link time optimization phase
that we are adding in Java 9 as part of
the larger umbrella of jigsaw and first
of all the mandatory safe harbor
statement don't trust anything I'm
saying jigsaw we've got much better
presentations of that from Alex back etc
but on the in the scope of our talk it's
organized 18 organizing code into
modules and these are built into
self-contained bundles called a mods and
these are then linked together into a
runtime image with the J link to from
the one of the stated goals of the
gelling tool in the jab to a to was to
provide an opportunity to do whole world
optimizations that are otherwise
difficult or at compile time or cost a
at run time at the time the gaming tool
was kind of a mission as an optional
tool to allow for link time
optimizations but has since grown into
the de-facto tool for how we are
generating images during build time
itself the alternative would have been
to use build scripts as as prior but
although we are all the images that we
are providing early access builds
etcetera have gone through J link to
provide the images in in the base set of
flags you can select and choose the
modules to to include in your image and
there are these meta packages like the
orbital SC that contains most of what
you need while still we need to or we
maintain the ability to perform
optimizations during this linking phase
both such optimizations that we provide
by default but maybe also customized
optimizations that developers and
customers can add on their own whim and
this is provided by a mechanism called
jailing plugins we're allowing
customization enabled enabled by a
command line flags to the ailing tool
you can list the number did the default
set of plugins available and their and
their options in the yelling to the rare
that a spurt yep the plug-in API is
strictly experimental so while anyone
can simply write a plug-in add it into
so that the jailing two picks them up
doing whatever ahead of time
optimization or alteration of your image
be aware that anything can and will
change and I don't think we are going to
support the API offers per se in Java 9
anyhow we do provide lots of plugins
predefined such as strict bug
compression plugins to define how how
how much compression we are putting to
the runtime image we have the includes
locale plug-in to be able to well the
name is a little bit of addy number
because it's really about stripping
locales
so rather than the default will be to
include all the scales as JDK or JRE
today but here we have the ability to
strip out or think so that's one of the
you know cool things about jailing queue
and the ability to strip away things
that you don't need in your runtime
environment in in your specific
deployment in a supportive way what I'm
going to talk more about here today is
well the specifics or examples of
plugins that we have been developing
during JDK 9 + jigsaw development so
typical like link time classical example
would be to you know something you are
referring to a class for example at
compile time
that you want to load but it's not
available at compile time for for
various for some reason this then
requires the use of class portal for
name which everyone here is likely
familiar with to do the dynamic lookup
our dynamic linkage of classes and this
provides an opportunity when you're
linking together if if the class that
you're referring is statically known as
link time you can replace a static route
with static references when that
transformation is valid passing access
checks etc so plugins should of course
deferred stick to the same rules as the
runtime linker plug-in code themselves
currently is simple transformation tool
that operates on a pool of resources and
builds builds a resource pool to output
and then goes through a chain of these
transformations and this particular
plug-in is of course using Assam to take
the resource load load byte byte array
of the resource into Assam to transform
or look for a specific pattern of byte
code and thus replaces the class four
name or string load class but for name
invocation with a static reference to
the class instead so sorry
that kind of that plugin was written by
I think in Lasky or cinder as an example
and it's not enabled by default for some
reason but we haven't really evaluated
if it has a significant improvement but
what we in the the jigsaw team realized
that during jigsaw startup we are doing
a lot of work to set up the jigsaw
module system and going through reading
the module info classes to parse
validate these classes all the exports
are pointing to valid modules and that
your set of packages are coherent and
inconsistent and for system modules at
linked time you kind of know that is the
modules are consistent or you could you
could do that validation check
beforehand and well maybe do something
more so the solution was to introduce
that like jailing plug-in to generate a
preview dated representation of this
system module graph generate that as
more or less robot byte code into the
JDK internal module system modules which
then returns the
list of module descriptors or the graph
for for the system modules since this is
done ahead of time this provides ample
opportunity for us to do various global
or minor processors over the set of
modules that wouldn't be possible when
we are parsing the module in four
classes one by one and wouldn't be you
know very much of an optimization if
done that run time because you can do
the duplication for example if you from
one module export one of your packages
to to this and that module and some
other module lists also exporting their
packages to the same set of modules then
of course Tennison well this is a
duplication opportunity there
this is something we do we exploit
prolifically in this plugin that reduces
the number of objects we have to
constitute at runtime and provides quite
a large improvement in both runtime
total number of objects created things
well for start-up we're quite sensitive
to things going into being compiled by
digit very early so thread interaction
here shows that if we can shuffle or
rather remove
entirely the need to do various set
creations and object allocation during
during startup we can see a rather
remarkable improvement in both wall
clock time and real time this is aa yeah
this is some system with 32 cores so
it's kind of slow at startup compared to
my desktop right and of course by since
we're doing the deduplication and other
micro micro optimizations for footprint
etcetera we reduced the memory usage by
quite a lot people have people have been
asking questions about why startup is so
slow on Java 9 and my go-to answer has
become to ask them if they are running
on the exploded image or the image build
which is the well the build that you
producing after j-link because not if
you do it randomly exploded image not
only do you miss out on this
optimization there's also other code
paths being taken pulling in lambdas
earlier etc causing quite a lot of
object allocation of several GCS etc to
happen just to just to do the trivial
amount of work to get to Java version
right the second thing that I previous
to working on jigsaw I started taking a
look at trying to get the down reduced
the initialization costs of java.lang
invoke the observation of course is that
the first usage of java.lang of any
lambda or method handle etc initializes
the lambda meter factory a lot of
infrastructure to to support the
supporting invokedynamic
and this was reported a year some years
ago to be on the order of like eighteen
eighty milliseconds on some machine and
one hundred hundreds hundreds of classes
being loaded and generated dynamically
so solutions to this well originally
people were a little bit distraught how
can we how can we go about making making
in the faster it's it's such a huge
problem and mess to deal with
well initially we looked at making
making the implementation lazier typical
tricks to make sure that method handles
that you are not really using will never
be initialized in the first place that
got us part of part of the way to
reducing the overhead maybe twenty-five
percent but then of course after working
with jailing for a while I thought why
not apply j-link
to give you D or give the this new
golden hammer of mine try at generating
part of the infrastructure for for
java.lang invoke ahead of time at linked
time so java.lang invoke is a beautiful
creation
of most most of the implementation
details are in the in that are relevant
for for start-up is actually in Java
side of things we have method handles
creating created by the method method
factory method types call sites being
set up and underneath these in the
internal API we have lambda forums we
have their method handles we have bound
s and handles bound method handles
represent species of various well
methods of certain artists of certain
class arguments etc so if you are using
about a lambda that takes or you using a
method handle that takes takes a long
and returns a long you will have a some
species representation of that in your
in the metal handles so most of these
classes are generated in runtime due to
the fact that you can enumerate all of
them you don't really know for any
particular application which bound
method handles will be needed at runtime
so generating them ahead of time would
be detrimental to footprint effects or
you would blow up your your static
footprint of the of the runtime image
itself so we need a tool of course to
determine what things to generate and
then we need a framework to generate
things ahead of time first and quickest
or first step on this journey was to
realize that bound math and handles are
quite well large complex but also rather
straightforward in their in their
implementation and how they are
generated to bytecode
so the inception of the first version of
the generate j'ni classes plug-in
there's a type of there should be only
one column in between bmh and BA
pieces and he'll so this this plugin
allows you to specify the types of palm
method handle species to generate ahead
of time at link time the default in the
plugin was picked arbitrarily based on
the number of handles used by in the Phi
string concat the rather remarkable
feature to replace the string string
builder concur chains with invoke
dynamic calls giving peak performance
opportunities that are rather
interesting you should really take a
look at Alex a ship lives work on this
and it talks is being given of this if
you don't know what I'm talking about
and now the BMH regeneration was well on
the start of test of invoke in the five
string competitors
get a total initialization overhead
reduction of about fifteen percent so
that's that's the part of the invoke of
the I ceased initialization but was
bombers and handles so what I do under
the cover is really generate these
classes put them in the in the image but
so that they are statically created
these were kind of easy because they are
the these classes were more or less had
a name already so we could just map it
one to one after that things got a
little bit tougher because things like
direct method handles etc or quite small
classes they don't really have
everything is everything is currently
built up with anonymous well defined by
an anonymous VM classes so whatever we
do to put a naming scheme on things that
maps to a class name or maps to a method
name that we can resolve or something
complicate the implementation details of
your belonging book but at least there's
now a prototype to take this this
implementation to the next step and try
to generate more invoke static more in
expression especially the direct method
handles as per our shooting again using
in the Phi string Comcast the vector of
whereas the profile guiding our hand
here of what to include by default and
well one of the benefits of this
approach or as opposed to the current
implementation is that the direct method
handles our methods can be generated
into a single class that we then can use
as a look at source for method handles
so we generate told that the I told the
image instead this individual class and
then put they if if you're resolving and
the direct method handle do resolve on
that class to see if this Methodists are
already generated if so but put that
into a into a direct method handle and
bypass the by code generation at runtime
this of course gets complicated because
you need to know what what methods will
be used and if you if you just overload
the classes that you're generating ahead
of time you might run into another
problem so the default strategy probably
needs to be conservatively tuned where a
specific method deployments like a
language runtime could have well will
have the freedom to to tune the usage or
the number of which classes to generate
ahead of time which kind of solves the
problem of being having a rather plastic
optimization target for
what parts of the in the implementation
to generate ahead of time of course this
might be those cases where you want to
generate everything ahead of time to
have no biker generation or on time and
that so that would be a very good thing
to support so there's been a yeah so the
when working on features like this you
always come into the the face of
self-doubt and criticizing what you're
what you're doing because to deal with
something ahead of time you're really
creating API hooks into something
internal that isn't really designed to
be hooked in used by something coming in
from the side as a as a plug-in jailing
plugins really I mean since they are
really operating on the raw byte byte
code of the of the image can pretty much
do anything which is which is great in
theory but in practice leads to an
accumulation of technical depth and we
to deal with that create a little to-do
list for myself apart from the fact that
we want to generalize and pre generate
all lambda forums been possible
ultimately supporting replacing lambdas
and wholesale with generated code that
link time maybe we also want to refactor
java.lang invoke internals to
encapsulated packages to you know not
accumulate more and more technical depth
and hidden or undocumented hooks into
the grow into the code code base of
growing complexity some of these things
might also be dealt with for start-up
and performance other ways for example
Michael helped has some well elaborated
ideas on isolated methods to generate
and generate methods
classes that would be probably remove
most of the or similarly much of the
overhead so maybe there's a little bit
of competing competing implementation
it's there but maybe also opportunities
to to weave this together because with
isolated method if one of the goals is
not only startup or performance per se
but also to be able to generate
everything so that we don't we can
support more of those cases where
bytecode generation is not feasible or
possible and we want to take a look at
how to do isolated methods from d-link
as well also for the user of of j-link
comes the problem that knowing what
classes of bound method handle species
etc it requires you know really intimate
knowledge of the implementation so to
make this a feasible case study for or
something feasible for a deployer to use
maybe we would need some tool to take
take a program run it pro through with
some profiling agent or or or other to
to generate the configuration that we
can you know put us a recipe to our
j-link so maybe we need to consider
looking at how to have let lets dealing
deal with more complex complex
configuration scenarios in a more
user-friendly use way anyhow beyond
slides left maybe i'm talking too fast
beyond the java.lang invoke there are
interesting things that we have
experimented with both internally and
such and but you quite quickly when
you're doing looking at what you can do
a head of time you can go into the
deep end of the pool where there are
things that we can do but probably would
break things or for some user but it
does open opportunity to do speculative
intrusive or other application specific
alterations to the image that might be
quite substantial in some cases for
example if I want to for various reason
if they if it's for performance
footprint or security or whatever I want
to remove code from system and
application modules that I don't want to
be there for example assertions unused
methods
deprecated methods hey I want I want to
deploy a version of a jdk where all the
deprecated methods are simply gone why
shouldn't I be able to because no one
should be using the applicator de Paris
right so maybe that's a having having
intrusive plugins to to simply rip out
all deprecated code or assertions or
object input streams or whatever would
be one way to to support internally or
for any one ways to deploy deploy images
that have these things disabled or more
thoroughly ripped out other things that
we are doing or of course constantly
looking at is if your if your deployment
is running these specific agents and
always running these specific agents
maybe these part of what these agents
are doing for example is instrumenting
byte code to add hooks do whatever oh
the deeply changing the implementation
details of everything from core core
networking classes in in java why not do
that
head of time if your deployment is
always going to run with with an agent
so maybe agents would be interested in
our agent implementers would be
interested in creating a plugin to do
part of what the agent is doing at
runtime and instead that that j-link
time and something that we've seen a
need for in some internal applications
is of course that we are running a very
specific big application that is parsing
we're spending much of its startup time
parsing complex configuration files etc
frameworks who are who are directing
configuration might might want to well
produce more internal more efficient
internal representations maybe this
isn't very common case but it's
something we've done for experimental
purposes with with some success
oops was quick so right I have an
appendix as well there there's quite a
few pre-existing plugins available in
j-link today
some of which we are already what we're
using as part of the build the first one
on this list is in the order resource
plug-in which is really about well
ordering ordering resources in the in
the runtime archive to improve code
startup and this is based on the class
list that we are generating in now in
build time as well to be a little bit of
have some some notion of automatic
profile guided optimization of the
runtime layout right we have mentioned
the enqueue locales to strip out stupid
local data that you don't want to in
your
or don't need in your image stripping
the bug symbols etc the these plugins
are really about or worse a record have
been requested by people who want to
provide the images for example for
embedded other news cases too to mean
minimal minify the size of the runtime
image so that is interesting set of
plugins available in engineering today
and hopefully the family will grow over
time so I guess I'm open for questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
