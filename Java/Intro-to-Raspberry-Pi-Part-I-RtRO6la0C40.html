after development the last 20 years and
15 years the almost 15 years dedicated
to Java my profile used to be similar to
many developers I i am a java ee
developer that started getting crazy
with embedded side after going to make
her fur five years ago I went to make
her fair and I look I don't want to
write ejbs anymore and I start to
research but you know in Brazil the
money comes from Java EE the name money
comes from Java ito so I was always
looking for some way to integrate java
ee with embedded side two years ago we
wonder dogs choice award with jay home
automation it was a home automation
system based on ejbs and everybody said
are you are crazy that's too much java
is not for that and no now we have java
embedded switch which is a lightweight
java ee container so my dream come true
today this last year and we are using a
lot of embedded sweet and javon bedded
the virtual machine and have having
fantastic results we don't have a lot of
thing in production but we already have
a building I smarting building that we
did in Brazil very cool very stable
system running with more than 20
different devices communicating wireless
with rs232 infrared and many different
device so i work with prototyping
services in uber Toobin if you want to
prototype on your product you need to
kurt things and you can go there and
have fun and we work with conference and
training also
so Raspberry Pi is this very small
computer famous running arm v6 which is
kind of old arm now seen your arm let's
say that not old is a senior arm and
it's using a system on chip from
broadcom this one it has the video car
as a GPU video card for as a GPU which
is very good you can play up high
quality videos we have a turn at USBS
gpio that is the weather the phone the
different the funny part of Raspberry Pi
and you can plug out you displays and
cameras in other connectors that is
available that's another view from
Raspberry Pi so in the in the soc we
have the memory so the memory is
soldered a in with the SOC and we have
the basic components the SD card will be
your hard disk where we install a linux
or risc os or any kind of operational
system you want and the connections so
you can use Raspberry Pi for
do-it-yourself project you can even
create products I think that it was not
the demand a bijective with raspberry pi
but now they are looking for commercial
projects so raspberry pi is a business
now and some toys that we did this robot
this robot we built in the beginning of
the java embedded sweet and we did to
test the Javan battered sweet with the
robot this is a it was an Arduino robot
and I say oh that's a big great these
are doing a robot Putin a Raspberry Pi
running java embedded sweet so this
robot is an application server now since
server you can deploy rest applications
in the robot and jarred sub invited us
in January this year to give a talk to
the guys that are
that they are doing the job embedded
sweet so we have a big pleasure to go to
santa clara and present this robot so
with the third time in california and we
did a popcorn machine in our last
conference big conference in brazil and
here is a small data center with 100
raspberries running this data center so
it's very when when you want to do i
smart device you can you want to do your
own refrigerate or you want to do to
automatize your car to grab information
from your car so if you use some small
micro controller you may not be able to
process all the information so the small
micro controllers like arduino zp ICS
they are very good to do real-time
operation so they work they work very
well as accessory for raspberry sincere
as barry is not real time that's the
common user many people are buying
raspberry pi to do multimedia centers so
they plug a DTMF cable Wi-Fi module or
ethernet cable and they use the audio
system and install any kind of
multimedia server you have many options
now to download and that's the most
common use users of raspberry pi but for
you that's not the part that is
interesting we want to look at the
connectors and especially to the GPIO
starting with raspberry you choose the
operational system the most popular is
raspbian but you have pedorra our
clinics risc OS and XBMC many different
types of XBMC servers for multimedia
center so you download the image from
the raspberry pi dot org website and you
dump the image using in linux disk um
you need a power supply you need to take
care if the power supply is 5 volts we
comment1 end but sometimes you have some
kinds of power supply that say that is 5
volt and is not sometimes it said when a
band is not so by a good one to avoid
problem with your Raspberry Pi is very
common to see your Raspberry rebooting
because of some the power supply is not
stable or doesn't supply the current
that the the raspberry needs if you are
not going to plug in the the AC
connector you want to make a robot like
this I would recommend you to use the
ubec is very popular in our seas so it's
a 5 volt regulator you can put batteries
like for a 12 volt batteries and kind of
battery and you have 5 volts with three
amps five amps and is very cheap and
it's very stable I love this component
to make your own regulator and it's good
to make a a cell phone recharge also so
if you have a robot you have a about
many different batteries and you are
flying far away you can use the
batteries that's battery for your cell
phone so it's very good to have this
kind of batteries so you can set up to
have the deck server by default but it's
not this standard so start X we started
the black server but some setups all
these lights we will make it available
for you we have paint drives and with
sample applications these slides and
more information that you can cop so I
put some configuration useful
configuration that you may need during
this hackathon so to set up the network
connection you have this file and
basically you just need to change here
if you want to make a static connection
just change dhcp
like this and you have the static IP
sometimes is useful if you are going to
make a server like all the toys that I
bring here they have a static ip's and
to setup the Wi-Fi we have this file and
you just put the name of your network
here and the pesky we have a raspa
config which is a very useful tdg you
can do overclock raspberry pi is 700 but
you can overclock to 1 Giga we thought
losing the warrant so it can get hot
sometimes it can crash your card
depending on what you are doing but you
can do it without losing the warrant and
if you want to give more memory to the
GPU because the five the memory is
sherrod and if you want to give more
memory to the GPU you need to use this
raspy config to do that if you are going
to run Java facts on Raspberry Pi you
will need to give more memory to that
affects to perform better we have a VNC
we did a special image for for this
challenge we burn especially image with
all the tools that you need because if I
if you download the image from Raspberry
Pi website and apt get a PDA choppy
grade we will take all the data to make
this setup so we prepare special images
with Java inside some tools and
everything should not listen time with
that so VNC is 12 that you have inside
the image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
