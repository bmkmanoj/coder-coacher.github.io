community cast at the or ative stage
welcome welcome here I have Reza ramen
and Ivar grimstead with me here today
who are both on the origin content
committee welcome ok so I thought we'd
talk a little bit today about aura dev
and what are some of the goals for the
content committee and putting together
this year's edition of aura dev really
the goal is you know pretty much you
know the same as always try to put
together the best program for java
developers local developers that we can
I don't think there's only a specific
theme per se it's always that's always
been the program from his go like me
mm-hmm so regardless of what the theme
is like power of computing orit of
passion put the best go ahead I think
the team was kind of decided after waves
are they're inviting speakers the
quality of of the speakers also always
important so we focus on on experience
Baker's we want them to have it to
submit some video and
Ribbit's talks so we can check that but
the quality of speakers meet the
standards we want because people pay a
lot of money to come here and we want as
far as I speaking as possible so so I
think the quality of speakers is what's
makes this conference you need
best-of-breed in the area really that's
what you're saying yeah definitely I
mean you know as you said you know live
it earlier you know Ivor and I go to a
lot of conferences but really the big
distinction of or a dev is you know the
quality really is top-notch and I think
it's very hard to beat you know given
the amount of amount that we have the
quality of speakers in the quality of
the content and in fact to be honest
completely honest equality of the
attendees as well right I've been really
impressed with the conference this is my
first year so anything that you know you
would see in the future you're going to
be on the content committee next year as
well so anything that you would look for
is targets for next year things that you
might want to adjust or adapt to based
on the needs of the community yeah
hopefully we'll have a lot of Java e8
talks next year and maybe some starting
to think of Java EE nine so we'll have a
really strong Java you drive in the
future and that Java EE eight will be
maybe we can have any a known track for
Java ie8 because that's that's gonna be
a cool thing anything mmhmm yeah I mean
I've definitely noticed it's nice to
have a mix right java as well as other
technologies i think that's something
that's unique about origins there are
other conferences that do that but was
still you know having that really nice
mix and then the local people and then
also building in kind of the humanity
and social issues that have been covered
here is particularly in the keynotes
that's been really unique I think
something that some conferences try to
do but maybe not quite as well as or
ative does not at all I mean definitely
it I think it speaks with a Swedish
culture in general you know there's
definitely a a always a theme of
of social justice and you know social
issues they're very well represented
here so it's definitely well beyond just
technology in fact they do have
non-technology speakers they really have
nothing much to do with with anything
technology-specific it really is has to
do with consciousness in fact one of the
most impressive sessions that I saw is
about how technologists should be
involved in politics why we have a
unique voice and a unique value add you
to the political landscape wherever we
are I have to check that one out I
didn't see that one so thanks for
highlighting it what some of your
highlights of this edition of or ative I
think actually the highlights have been
lazy the keynotes oh I'm also talking
with a the other participants of
speakers as we talked about earlier they
saw my experience and one day was pretty
cool the speaker's dinner it's this
conference caters well for the speakers
so anyone wants to speak here next year
I just look out for the CFP and because
he's great conference and also they
wrestle said the quality of the
participants is really high so you can
have really good talks I have noticed
that I've talked to a couple of speakers
who this is their first conference in
Europe right so I guess it's a good
conference for that I've been surprised
how many people have bumped into and
I've asked them you know what kind of
other conferences do they speak at and
they say this is their first conference
in Sweden or first conference in Europe
and even if they say you know first
conference mean actually it's all of
Europe and even my first time being in
Europe so it seems to be a very
welcoming place welcoming place would
yes it does afraid that dynamic as well
but the undercurrent why that happens
usually is because getting in the
program committee we actually do
something pretty unique that most other
conferences don't do we actually make a
concerted effort to invite speakers in
fact I believe I invited yeah baby here
I've invited one other half as well
Chris yeah he's never been he hasn't
been to Europe in a very long time I
knew has a really solid speaker so I
just invited him so there's a bit of
that dynamic as well and that's I think
a lot of the times why you see sort of
these speakers are you know not not
regulars in Europe but you know they do
come here and they have been doing good
speakers right yeah well I do I
definitely think that's a positive thing
to be doing I like to see more content
committees do that especially you know
reaching out to people who haven't
spoken before in that area or maybe even
I've never spoken at all at a conference
and actually not just saying hey
everybody the call for papers is open
but we want you to speak you know and
having them except so that's cool yeah
anything else that's really cool about
hora de that you want to share form from
local we touched into it earlier but but
the the one really cool coolest thing
here is that it's not only a Java
conference we usually go to Java or Java
related conferences there's everything
that's that's really amazing yeah I've
enjoyed that I've learned a lot here
haven't been able to attend too many
sessions because I've been spending a
lot of time just hanging out here but
I've still learned quite a bit talking
to speakers that are new and and ones
that I've met in other conferences so so
next time you should come to the sauna
for sure yes and I I packed into many
conferences in this trip I think I've 25
countries in two weeks so I put a little
bit too much into my itinerary so next
time I come back to or whatever I want
to do the sauna yeah I've asked everyone
what's the highlight and that's most
popular or the speaker is attendees as
well attendees do it every day right
there local so the speakers most of them
don't have that opportunity day to day
so something like skinny-dipping in the
freezing cold water right up I gotta go
in the Baltic Sea I've been on the
Baltic Sea but not in I've been on the
ship on top or never inside next time
all right anything else you want to
share with us before we close out our
interview today there is one thing I'd
like to say a little bit a little bit of
the serious note Heather if you don't
mind so I'll just speak directly to the
camera for this okay
so folks hopefully you can notice the
shirt that I'm wearing it's actually a
picture of you know one of the US
presidents I respect the most and I
think the most one of the most important
people that have helped shape the United
States to be what it is today and what
it should be maybe going forward so I'll
read it to you what the message is on my
t-shirt it says a house divided itself
cannot stand so I hope we take a moment
and an ingested message I think it's a
message that's going to be very
important in the past few days and
perhaps going forward in the next few
years it's a it is ultimately what's
what makes America what it is so let's
be very sure we internalize that message
of a nation divided itself cannot stand
alright thanks Rosa thanks I've are any
closing comments come back to or ative
alright everyone thanks we'll have a few
more community cast before we close out
the day today last day of the community
cast here but or ative continues
tomorrow thank you thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
