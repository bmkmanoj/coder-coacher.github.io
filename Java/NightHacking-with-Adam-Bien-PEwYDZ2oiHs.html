our night hacking session in eunuch
thanks for thanks for driving across
town so to do the session and we're in
Tony's Tony's studio / training so she
can use he's hiding in the background
say hi Tony hi all right you're out of
focus but close enough so what post why
don't you why don't you say a little bit
about kind of actually I maybe I should
introduce you so Adam VN is most known
for we even though slide introducing all
right i'll put that up there we go most
known for doing a lot of java ee work
java SE work I didn't see me posting on
javafx and you know hacking your rounds
and talking about the technology on your
blog and then you do err hacks will tell
us older that what Eric says so in Aksum
just to minimize my travel I i organized
three times a year and java virtual at
munich effort and the interesting story
so people came all over the world the
last time and he has three times a year
three to four days just chubby hiking
java virtual very cool and you get a lot
of people coming out to the sessions
yeah last time about 50 pieces will fall
on the walls so we have already the
biggest room from munich airport so so
you go to the airport and instead of
going to the airport to travel somewhere
yeah you go to the airport get to meet
people and go home yeah that's one of
the meters from the terminal was the
idea okay very nice so what sort of what
sort of stuff have you been working on
recently what sort of projects and
technologies actually I'm working almost
exclusively in Java EE space java and
java SE space and it's unfortunate we
actually using javafx because you always
need a kind of your eye for your back
and stuff and i will actually did a lots
of Swing stuff back then and Java VIX is
just a natural replacement and in some
projects is just on I think is this lots
of advantages
/ HTML HTML 5 for instance and it's um
yeah so this isn't some projects in Java
pigs and on the on the back end almost
job eh money okay very cool so besides
just Java where they're sort of hobbies
do you have yeah the problem because
Java is if you really like Java you have
no time for anything else you're a true
hacker you hack on Java and you study
Java i started i try to learn java and
the problem is regardless how much I'm
running it it is just impossible to know
everything so my hobby was fake tan
netbeans but now i'm using it with all
the times as like a professional
official stuff again so i've actually no
real hobbies one time i would probably
would like to learn guitar or something
and but i have no time yet and i exactly
know that would start to do it right now
it would be crazy no sleeping just
guitar playing and java hacking so I
just only thinking of others yep in Java
nothing else you do good java and
sweeping and sleeping okay very good oh
all right business school is this phone
is this is a solution form a Tony apple
and in this dream team member yes this
could work Wow alright that's pretty
good for your first try this was perfect
yeah thanks Tony so what we are thinking
with we do today was a show some of the
projects you work for kia yes I'm ideas
actually I gave a talk and job one above
stress testing yeah and I got lots of
feedback about going more deeply to that
so what we can do today is I can we can
walk through a open source project on my
called light fish it monitors java
applications and running on light on
glassfish and i could probably hack a
very little java application and try to
stress test with light fish ever think
wife and
because I had really no idea what what
will happen here yeah that's how I use
that's how we like it is to keep things
crazy live unprepared all right just to
go down in a perfect fiora yep yep is
perfect for exactly how we operate okay
so I've tricked out your desktop with
video so you could see how long video
okay perfect so you see us while we're
while we're doing hacking that's the
right video and then lets the wrong one
I chose source a as to the source p okay
your computer your computer's octane my
computer's octane eous yeah so can I
sound with hugging or adjust are there
again searching for your sources alright
yes we can start hacking thank you very
much so on to books so you can just this
is the most important slide a few lines
of Java code say more than thousand
slides so this is my famous last light
and thank you as an excellent talk I
think it's an idea yeah I don't know it
actually starts and i would like to find
out netbeans i just used the development
build because I tested this is the only
reason I could also go with the
production release but see you're on the
bleeding edge yeah for stuff like that
i'm using the bleeding edge and for time
to time we will probably see an arrow
netbeans error then we will submit the
arrow on the fly so we have a great
internet connection from tony studios so
you could do that so this is actually a
light fish and there are two parts
there's a wide view written with java
eggs and the light fish is written this
is actually did back and very simple
application which monitors periodically
glassfish and glassfish exposes all the
monitoring that data by our risk and
funny story i started actually vote the
application about five times for my
customers from scratch because i don't
know why but unit testing and
integration testing seems to be
important and stress testing not at all
for some reasons people are thinking
that
singles by the unit s I was sufficient
to prove the right functionality of java
applications so what i wanted it i wrote
small scripts which which persisted the
d monitoring data and after the fifth
time become a little bit tedious so i
just recently actually we factored it
into a real framework she can read yes
the following refactoring I have to sign
lots of MBAs and not always sure what it
is a very from start from scratch and
actually I was some 0 you know one of my
first experiences as a programmer when I
was in on when I was learning in
elementary school so I was reading I was
I was hacking this was before Java this
was like a Pascal I was hacking my
really old computer writing a great
evening software for my my teachers and
I had a hardware failure I lost all my
data for like three months worth of what
yeah but it taught me that when I when I
went and rewrote it it was so much
better and I got it done I got to what I
originally done did in three weeks done
in three months done in two weeks or so
what I found is you know code is chief
you can always rewrite code yeah but the
ideas and the skills you learn coding or
what really counts so how was your
experience rewriting this program five
times I've never learned the same
program five times yet it wasn't it the
same program a program dual 5x and the
life is the best one I think because it
is on my program and it just is more
generic the other one will just waitin
for for Soto civic vs eight of our
customers but in your case I would just
just write a very little conscript which
devito your machine every two weeks or
something
every three weeks no it's not that hard
we move asterisk / and something that
should work so it would be actually a
business idea yeah and then on steroids
or something yeah it forces you the end
of each generation edge yeah because
this is funny this would be a great
story for trainees scrum master
certification feeling happy yeah exactly
so I'm and story is getting into thania
so I actually do lots of my open source
projects and trains so I travel a lot of
with bicycles because I think hanging on
bicycle is really hard without voice
recognition writers on therapy and on
trains is really really nice so I had 33
our time between frankfurt and munich
three other thing or three to three hour
time to hack something and i got the
idea okay i have no time after the train
but right now i have to do things done
and my first idea was to start with java
SE and then i found okay with java SE i
would have to write Java util timer to
periodical is how to the timer then I
will have to use jpe persistence so
there's only three three lines of code
just to put up the entity manager so if
i do it with java ee itself it is like a
breeze just have one annotation that
schedule one annotation inject
entitymanager and i'm actually done with
the proof-of-concept so i just after a
few lines of java is echoed I dropped a
project we created it from scratch shoe
for java and what light switch did it it
captured the GlassFish data and
persisted in a broad table and the idea
is so you can perform stress tests and
after night you can just connect you
with the table with jasperreports or
whatever bird reports or whatever you
have just to see how your application
performs or whether it is table of note
isn't it's more about robustness not
performance yeah so you're collecting
all the data during runs during the day
and then you can inspect it in fairport
on and I using this tool yeah but then
the idea came I would like to see in
real time because it's more exciting so
our collecting is the d major use case
but real-time data is more exciting and
I thought which technology to use and
then the decision was made java packs
and it was extremely simple with some
charts and a table and data binding I
did it a thing in a half an hour I had
21 chart was on table data and with
service and and then I ended as an
interesting story the first feedback of
life is one guy asked me why I didn't
vote a live fish with worth java
javascript HTML 5 and Raphael GS assumed
javafx a JavaScript framework and I told
him I had only one hour time for the
pool hundred of it and it's a okay then
it is understandable so it was about the
right and this is why he's so he was
actually proving the point that actually
javafx is easier to get started with
this yeah applications absolutely i
showed him that the code is ok if you
can revert it with Chavez cooked and it
will be simple then then it's right now
I will just do it i don't care i thought
it was ok not no way right know it and
this is one on it yeah one of my points
of why java x is great because it's java
and most of my projects if we have in
back-end java it would be nice to have
java underfunded as well so to be able
to debug and profile everything from
from from from the UI to the backhand
because you know mixing languages is
cool but not very pragmatic in bigger
projects and particularly not in project
nine to five projects so i think we can
take something right otherwise it would
be a night talking then that's not like
my vagin we can do some night and I
talking during the day ok i think i
think it's i think it's night in latin
america yeah
so we're we're not hiking in some part
of the world yeah hmm so come my texts
oh it's not Jim Oh be nice right so we
can just keep your eye packs so there
will be no problem with him yep okay
yeah he is he was our first night hacker
I there grew by the calm night hex and
just some stress so I will start with a
maven project why not we are made meat
and tony has internet so it could work
and I would just run it and I expect to
have an application deployed on
glassfish java application with actual
you are single jet p and the idea would
be to stress the staff will occur Jamie
town and life ish Oh failed not able to
start then I have a very important
command kill Java some process is
running from today morning I heck
something and I think my pots was that
sir that's a nice tool so you know we
have those random java processes and you
go hunt them down slowly no you don't i
am i clearly pain- 9-9 java this is
actually yeah i need to get that for
before i start my presentations because
i always find i have old processes
running shoe alley it is kill kill all i
think- knowing java this is how it
operates so it's two most important but
it was the UC useful if you create an
alias for now it doesn't like to start
like this which is actually master shoes
is very very sad can it be that you use
some of my 8080 parts
if not we could just because my grass
which doesn't like to start and I think
it 10 because it doesn't say so to say
the port is in use on how 00 invalid
says invalid property yeah but it didn't
did anything doesn't care I will just
show you the source code from from my
fish so um the the organization of life
is just consist of components and the
components are organized are always the
same way so boundaries exposes to the
outside world these services control is
some logic and entities to persistence
and the most import import in staff is
the monitoring component and the
monitoring controller is their heart of
light fish and what it does it it it
just covers these two snapshots and here
you have the schedule expression so it
can set up the you can set up to gather
the data every few seconds and it takes
the data and persist the data in our you
know entity and the entity is X ready
and very simple one is just a snapshot
with some data like used heaps heaps
eyes thread count pic thread count
weather threats AB is an odd number of
committed transactions and so forth and
then I just would like to see the
connection pools and applications and
there is actually very easy to extend in
fact some of the of the retina jeebus
guys ask me a java one whether they
could extend light switch for Chavez and
if you replace this class you should be
able to gather the specific Abel's or
Tommy or whatever buddies any
application server yeah they were just
you know every application server has
the same data but the department is
different so in this actually that is
the source code for this open sources
yes entirely and it is actually light
fish is the page with an intro
introductory video
and on you have on github go to my
github page get help you should find
life ish and everything is so what do
you saw already this is everything
exposed on github as well I'm the apache
license cool and the idea there's a link
to that on the flight fish page yeah
perfect okay so I'm going to send people
the light fish so they can try it out
and hack along with us yeah actually it
for me are very paid off because life is
didn't support it authentication because
it is needed for from my projects
because it was an integration stage yeah
and someone contributed the ssl an
authentication code so it was actually
very good friends all right right now it
is 17 assault about ssl that's all open
source rocks actually if you are lazy
you should expose everything you know so
um so this is the bag and a little bit
boring for you more exciting to see live
you ok so the live view is a java fix
part and the java ex parte this actually
starts with UCD apache license takes
eighty percent of the source code so it
starts like an application yeah and the
idea is it is web stop it is and send
along a network so I package it three
times and the main idea was as well to
show how to build more more enterprise
javabeans applications because of the
beginning there was actually no good
making integration so I did that and
brought actually optical java magazine
as well no to do how to do that and
there's nothing better than open source
application because I mean you can you
can you have to share the search area
code and that you're working on yeah
without any any problems and the
interesting stories in Java X if you
start with Java fix your arm you could
use a main method
the whole point is to use the large
methods because well whenever it is an
applet and web start domain class adjust
just delegates to the launch is the
first first idea and the second idea was
just do it right or drive i mean i just
tried instead of hanket or the reasons
behind as i started with satellites wish
it was very early and what i expected as
2022 to have some challenges and
problems and the idea was just to to
build encapsulated modules so if a
problem occurs i will be able to
identify it more easily so i try to
separate the view from the back end
logic from day one and actually i got
lots of problems with comet style
communication with with back-end to turn
out there were some problems was with
long polling and stuff like that so it
was actually a good choice to separate
that mm-hm so everything starts with a
presenter so the light fish is built in
Model View presenter fashion so what
means the arm you look at the presenter
represents a presenter implements an
interface which is a usual
a lot except
purpose and the purpose of this
interface is to specify what the back
end is able to deliver so actually if
you would like to monitor a given
property you just have to extend this
interface and then write a view
component for that this was the idea to
separate that and what you see is a most
of the properties are we the only
properties yeah with as you probably see
as a properties or i can use binding for
that and there's actually simplified
things allowed because if you think
about this and one single property makes
the interface very narrow usually I
would have to have interface with with
with a method like give me a property
you get a float back but you have
constantly to pull the interface that
there's a lots more infrastructure so
this this gives you properties gives you
your vent callbacks exactly without
having to actually write all the event
listener isn't adding event handlers and
all the things you normally need to do
for the exactly so I would say do you
think this would also be useful in some
of your java ee programs having property
support yes and actually fold already
just to reuse the java big stuff for 440
bacon logic and actually as i hope i
hope help mark reinhold is watching us
yes but you're I'm sure she got very
smart we want properties and in Java so
mark lost property so whatever it right
whenever yeah yeah yeah we just want to
ask if you would like to introduce
properties since 1995 yeah yeah what
suppose let's go to man up john i john
i'm or in java 8 actually now that they
don't have chicks over there enough time
to build properties you know yeah yeah
possibly maybe maybe we can hack and
I'll find somebody wants to properties
and we'll do a project coin style
orientation and a compiler yeah in a
doobie in apple valley then we have
apple root foit and apple valley is the
staff of our properties are built but
exactly what I said I'm actuary this
interface is everything but usually you
get 10 or 15 interfaces to cover
everything and this is what i like and
java weeks of oz it minimizes the amount
of code necessary and actually they have
to say and one of the few crazy guys you
are another one i guess i really like
gothic script and actually it would be
even better to condense the code even
more they actually wrote a whole book
about java java java script and then I
got a call from from from Java on oracle
I think your talk is great but we will
kill them java big script you will still
would like to talk about this it's like
we are talking on the problem the book
is another problem so i called the
publishers ok we have to cancel the book
but that's but four hours are over and
no problem I mean yes or no problem so
you don't make money with books anyway
so whether they are probably for not is
just enough but it's it's a lot of time
it's it's it's like my investment of
time to write a book but it was good for
me just to play with javax a little bit
more and right now I just applied the
same ideas to Java peaks in Java but
yeah so we're trying to get the new
JavaScript visage working with javafx
too and that will be an option i mean
java api czar good because everybody can
use them learning language and for the
same reason you have you know people
writing MVC frameworks and server-side
code and groovy like rails or scala you
know lift or no it was the most the more
recent one to do for getting the scala
because and these kind of glad i play a
framework Griffin's Griffin's it more of
a client frame working for groovy but
the same reason people are doing those
languages on the server side nobody has
a good client side language which has
dedicated features like you know
animation syntaxes built-in properties
kerchief closures what those those
belong in the baseline we can't
regardless but there's still place for a
JVM language specific to use interfaces
this was episode in my opinion as well
and actually a live java script a lot
because it was concise look a little bit
like adjacent so it wasn't totally good
syntax the only problem was netbeans
support this one was not as great as
JavaScript or Ruby either so it which is
crazy so I you know the Sun Microsystems
programming language wasn't well
supported was negative but this would be
my only complaint but it works right and
it's actually some point it with that so
it works really well yes so back to
reality right now yeah we have a Java
with light fish when the that is not
that interesting so I think instead of
launching lights which we will stay in
Java mix right now okay so we have the
bindings and bindings church as an
interface to to make more clear which
beckons comfort which vacant properties
actually supported and I have the
desperate presenter which actually
implements that and you can see this is
are all simple properties and observable
sets collections which are also great if
you would like to use tables for
instance a lot easier than swing for
instance so on and what's also very very
useful what I use one here our services
and what what a service here a snapshot
service and what service does my
snapshot service extends javafx service
and jelavic service is something like
swing burqa I would say it is able to
fetch to create tasks in and what the
toss toss it just connects with the back
end who's this which is as natural fecha
and this is actually a very simple call
and get call which gets the snapshot
from the back end and the snapshot is
actually identical to the entities or
before but this is from different
namespaces there a little bit bit
coupling so there are the same
properties the same names but it comes
from other projects so there's no it's
not the same entity but this is the
single ina from Josie I will replace it
later which I'll with Jax Rs 20 but it
just
deserialize XML screen to this next shot
and the snapshot is exposed with the
snapshot provider and this is part of
the service so whenever a new snapshot
is ready to be displayed it's just it
arrives in the presenter and a presenter
has a restart service so I've just say
ok if it's it is running and we're
starting over cancer we set and then
start fetching and they start fetching
it just creates the snapshot provided a
service with theory the auras bounce to
B to D to D UI against on every change
of the ureter services automatically
restarted which is actually very simple
to do so we start and then I just used
you see another technique in diabetics a
very property at listeners I will never
change do something about this and in
this case it just involves on snapshot
arrival for instance in Java X script
there would be just one method and we
just such as our closures it would never
happen just hope that you know silly so
this can we get sure that once we have
closures yes hello Charlie java a go
make this a lot nicer and what would
also make nice as approaching mass horn
I think if it comes jdk 18 and you know
java fix with NASA on the closure it is
actually a dream I think so what you can
do is will change a lot of things and
here and on snapchat I will so we work
through with you what do i do right now
is hsm fetching the usual properties so
this is the converter between the
integer and the integer property javab x
so it is a little bit I just thinking
about to make it more concise because a
little bit get us and said invocation
but yeah it is very very old code but it
should be probably somehow easier to
justify right so we got a question for
you from glasses so if you tried
whitefish on 312 to build yeah yes it's
Rhyno so um should I answer with futa no
I mean he's he's listening to you talk
ok thank you also did I thought this is
a Twitter string is a Twitter stream it
says is a twitter social stream ok but I
mean everybody hears
obviously yes I'd fire them it seems to
work talk to them yeah I tried it seems
to work but if you are if I if you
manage to sound glassfish then it will
work yeah so getting a last wish to
start was a little hiccup yes so um I
get the I get the entities and then what
will you see here I've here is well I'd
switch tasks it adds the snapshots to
the lists which is going to be displayed
in in a table and the apt yeah I have 18
presentes 44 remain logic and escalation
presenter is responsible for managing as
scripts so I now is little bit hidden
functionality like fish what you can do
on the fly you can register JavaScript
filters to a light fish on the fly they
are they are managed on the server and
what they do is you can you can set up
in real time channels you can say when
heat is higher than one gift notify me
and you can it can play this filters on
the five hi guys an escalation channels
you can you can subscribe to the filter
by rest and this is some covered by life
fish as well the old the whole yeah
that's a nice way of kind of having
server-side filtering and querying it to
fetch custom data back from the
escalation the idea exactly so let's so
we have the whole life which is
organized in model it's just the RG
plain pojos entities the script which is
actually JavaScript has just named and
content and the annotations are checks
be annotations just necessary to be able
to see a nice initialize data and yeah
so the snapshots to present us actually
the core presentation logic and what's
also nice with presenters with presenter
is what it can do with presenter you can
eat easier unit has that because if you
have the presenter you can just write
unit tests and unjust mock out the
properties without firing it
which was also nice in my case because I
wanted to test the backend logic without
the new rendering mm-hm he's a big line
so here's some stream crash always if he
did this before your screen is okay who
cares about no Marcus in a row no
problem it's my fear is like yeah so so
Marcus I'm weren't you weren't you
supposed to be here in person so if you
if you want to get one of these stickers
and I don't think so you have to show in
person oh thank you and this is a this
is limited edition so only only if you
actually are brave enough to come on the
stream and and chat with folks online do
you get one of those perfect thank you
you have one okay vodkas spot hoppiness
car drumming that yeah because my vision
yeah you can tell me for this afternoon
with Tony we're gonna do tanya is a 3
3pm oh yeah yeah yeah so come by at
sonia's recording Marcus Amal wanting
out that and take take the glasses with
you in the life you chose exactly may
the light please be with you right yeah
so few very important in Java pigs case
yes so um without you there is no you I
I think so we have to talk a little bit
about the view and the most crazy thing
in Java big is the browser so tourism
embedded worth it and the idea of that
is so the administration interface of
light which was in Jessa was written
jetta and that was just too lazy to to
rewrite it in context so I just embedded
that in here love you good and in top I
have to work you and and the interesting
story with the webview is it looks
almost like javafx because I just
adjusted dcss so it is looks almost
exactly the bottoms everything of the
viet worth you they are
the native up in some applications
because you can skin javafx with CSS and
if you use the same statute this is
almost identical oh nice so you're using
styling on CSS for javafx styling CSS
for get Jessa yeah and then you can make
them get out somewhere oh yeah nice no
sooner identical identical crazy and and
yeah the webview is very very simple
this is actually the exciting stuff you
just need to create the webview and the
engine and the engine is the departing
part on the web views the rendering path
you know I think I we're all that right
web you yeah and that's actually the the
only thing what happens this is the deep
aggress the progress bar and what I do
here is I have the possibility to
install light fish from the web page and
I don't like to install already instant
light fish so what I do with the webview
is either I remove some links from jsf
which is very very easy it's just simple
Dom operation so you can actually
manipulate so they be a web page you're
going to see additional stuff to get
live fish yes and if you view it inside
light fish those are all hidden by doing
dominic reaction and this is very simple
does the entire code like fish I mean
pay a page and get element by ID what I
do I get the light blue element and then
and say starve display none and then it
just disappears it's just disappears
from the dump so this is what it
actually takes by the way we don't need
system out print lies anymore so and now
we have knife on my packing right one
more one more one one thank you very
much so yeah so now we change the code
that I change the culture smaller ones
are good to sticker
serve you this was the boughs of you as
is actually 120 lines of code with about
one other lines of system out print line
but it's very very simple works work
very well but a more interesting is
actually the the snapshot itself so
snapshot is actually visualization of
one property so the idea is regardless
how many properties do you have one
property is visualized by one chart and
one child is a snapshot so my approach
is a little bit unusual I guess so all
my views do not extend from anything is
just simple poacher and I am just
encapsulating the child's here and I
have one method called view and in this
view it returns the note and the one
component dashboard has organized the
notes without knowing what actually
comes and the the triggers each snapshot
gets on with only long property and the
end the end the property is just the the
value is going to be this flight result
although in this case is very narrow
interface between the present and abused
because each views gets its own property
to be displayed but there is no coupling
between them and this would be lot
harder without having properties in
javafx sexually yeah so even though
you're returning a node back you can
always update later by just injecting a
new chart oh gee the view on the fly and
then it'll change downstream forever is
currently looking at this so on exactly
so there is a there's a snapshot there
are laws of the dashboard for instance
is just key the dashboard view and it
just knows these snapshots yeah yeah I
could use a list or whatever but there's
travel list of snapshots and the whole
UI is very very simple just use these
using H box and B box so I fancy layouts
November and John
one CSS style like 10 pixel spacing so
there's actually very very easy so this
is the whole layout melting so I was not
interesting layout rather than
organization of the different parts yeah
so and even more interesting is probably
what I did there is one specific one
specific view code scripts it looks
exactly like the other so there is one
create you wouldn't quit and pop up and
the interesting stories are you seen
builder in this case so instead of
crafted by hand I just use symbol de and
was curious what how it will work
actually and I would start with symbol
of the pic but but I started with light
fish before single that was available so
right now i will just use symbol
therefore for lots of stuff and those
you're expending builder to you k GM
like the development experience for a
building site obscene builder yes and I
just opens the sin duda and this is the
JavaScript the escalation view very very
simple but the idea is why I like seen
builder is not because it's very capable
to of visualizing view rather than it
works with inversion of control if you
think about this and in a pinch rollers
inertial control because of the
controllers yes instead of of creating
source code for you you creating a
controller and cebu the uses that and
this is what makes us very very
interesting for real-world projects they
did actually one of the things i learned
so i did an initial integration of
spring and java FF what spring framework
okay you know her no no
just kidding so what other things i
learned which applies to javi iose
containers as well is the f xml actually
has support for injecting inversion of
control and so you can actually populate
all of the controller methods with
things that come from the container yes
yes this is what it is I you can inject
into the contour did use yeah this is
what wipers you have to do that yeah
yeah this exactly you have on you have a
you originally controller and then you
can inject the views and there the tag
is epic cement on a patient yeah so
let's show your controller I have to
find that first worse so wait a minute
should be where's the code called pain
script presenta this is the control arm
okay yeah so and then would you where do
you inject your own gear do stuff so
this is injected from the from the class
yeah I fix them out thanks people you
saw really okay what are you so what I
was talking about is you can actually
instantiate the controller object from
your ioc container and then inject that
into the power of XML okay I did
something similar I had to do this in
scripts I used to ethics Elora here and
then I you I got a presenter year with
the controller you can you can fetch
from there already controller to be able
to you need you need an instance of the
difficulty controller right yeah and you
can do the you can do the opposite so
rather than using the instance of
controllers gets created you can
actually push your own controller class
that you instantiate that's container
manage and then I think some alota will
work is JC your controller and injected
properties in full color you give up so
that makes it a lot more compatible with
let's say you're using juice or you're
using the job UCP dependency injection
and you can just use that out of the box
with the objects which are container
manage yeah this this will be great and
or this will be great if I have the I
here on my job excite so I've been used
dependency injection yeah because one
wasn't necessary in my case but I see
the point farewell found for like very
big applications yes dia is actually
nice because it it lets you separate out
all of your your different views of
screens let's go yeah personís modules
is coming less code so um so we have
these quits and what I actually you are
exactly as I would just would like to
show you the script view again this is
the scripts and if you look at this what
happens actually I get back to the root
element from the lowdown so and the
scripts here
it is somehow readable XML and what I
like here is for me understands the F
XML like like scripting of the factory
so I have two approaches either I can
build the UI by hand what I did with
just combining the notes page boxes and
beer glasses yeah i am using i'm using a
fix ml laura which creates the mood for
me so i can just mitigate the risks so
in bigger projects i can just from the
outside there is no difference whether
it was created by simple de or by myself
and even the controllers could be the
same and this is the huge point because
before then i use a LED on bed themes
Matisse and swing builder yeah it's
broke right but it generate lots of
coated sometimes it just became
inconsistent so what we did we checked
everything in we committed everything it
becoming canadian we have all right
modifying wall back key modification was
somehow treaties or what he did back
then was so Sam you generated by
NetBeans we just ever think which was
essential was reflected out to an
interface as and the controller just no
nudity interface and just interacted
with the interface but right now it is a
lot simpler because the view itself is
screen from the outside yeah this is
what makes the season versus you to have
a clean separation between your view and
the controller and the to be a code
you're writing and it was nice and light
fish so I introduced one view generated
by symbol de afterwards and it's
actually no difference at all in both
views on the dashboard doesn't even know
whether it is generated by simple de or
the other yeah so seen a nature you're
such a chav effects curve have you
considered giving any javafx talks at
conferences I didn't jump on actually ok
was very well attended and I will do it
here actually the my next yeah heck
would be java UI and I think summer
hours would be javafx I will talk about
how to structure java fix applications
because in my project is not about
effects is more about organization
because enterprise know
good 3dx and enterprise applications are
somehow critical but even as a Java a
developer mixing in some small user
interfaces with your application it's
quite easy to do since it's all java
yeah and so this is some Java Vic's I
like it a lot should be available on
iPads on all devices as well this will
be one of the kief killer features in my
perspective by the way because I came up
with the Munich job last night yeah yeah
and I'll tell you why because if you are
java developer i think you don't
interests it a lot in objective-c except
you you have a lot of Apple stickers on
at home so i would say under an hour we
can we can replace one ok and we could
do that the problem is machine is broken
i live in order to apple store so I if
we did it would we need another sticker
for my new machine but we can restart
yeah thank you so I consider to give
some Jelavic starts and then always did
actually I did one of the first job I've
see just returned the machine the apple
store and they fixed glass fish for you
and you get a new machine back for class
networks glass case i need you mind this
glass is broken as well so there is a 1
pixel damage so that's unfortunate you
can actually see the pixels on the
retina display you can find a little
yeah it could do that probably nano nano
nano meter la novia middle thanks aware
there's on several problems but um yeah
javax so what had been to sing dalla
Cinderella was a welder symbolizing
hacking so a wise great inversion of
control is the number one the number two
it seems to to be used by the jibjab
travel expires well so internally and I
attended some great travel one talks
about simple actually and they were very
passionate there were some French guys
from grenoble maybe I think and did this
distance were extremely grated the guy
was passionate in the show tweets with
CSS so you can even find out from where
the CSS style counts you know whether it
comes from there from the CSS default
from CSS file or from from from
inheritance this was actually very
useful and CSS is also great for for
some kind of effects in one project we
have to perform some validation and the
labels of text boxes have to turn right
for instance so you could do it just
changing the changing the color or you
could also do with with feathers test to
add and remove and CSS class which is
very simple and then the cool story was
they their developers were not that Java
fix &amp;amp; javas killed but CSS was very
simple was Ned been so they were able to
you know to create account on the
slightly out and we just replace the CSS
class and it worked perfectly does so on
so this is the CSS is I think at the
beginning I was a little bit concerned
that is too much but right now for me
conceptually CSS is nothing else than
dependence injection again so you're
injecting into you I components that
values from CSS and CSS happens to be a
standard yeah very well supported by
name is by the way this is you can you
can use methods for html5 and css3 which
sits perfectly with the strap of X so
grateful so and the last interesting
stuff properly so we have some questions
regarding life in structure or
structured Java X not lighting that is
not that interesting probably
both busy the human faces so we are
seeing the common tation impossible is
it missing missing ah attention java
book exactly javadoc is evil if you if
you ask me so on I could just for just
for my crew right now that's Marcus wait
a minute Adam so now Joe of adam says
java texas evil o-jama da da da yet no
NZ alpha marcos i will just document
this is a default constructor it creates
an object oh and this is very surprising
you see you see the power right of
hacking end and an open source returns a
return a note and it's very very now
have Charlotte's yeah and now we
internal doc says I actually know that
that javadoc actually is good because
because it's true yes the Javadoc which
is evil is the Javadoc where they
actually explain something and it's
wrong it doesn't match the code that's
evil and this is perfect because if
somehow doesn't get that perfect
understand what would know that what's
that so I mean I hope mark is like that
a novice is invited to create even more
javadoc
now in his own Fork it's possible he get
out and he can go to a pusher for single
never ever we request I will just try to
skip the another the filter out the
gelatin but everything as we accepted no
in them what I really do my project I
just am from time to time my job is to
perform code reviews and such javadoc is
defect in my eyes so really so I think
guetta setters constructors everything
is just not documented at all if you
would like to comment something you
should comment about the intentions and
the purpose of the class not you know
what you know I think I think the as an
example the Java 15 does a pretty good
job with their javadocs so they they
explained at the very top of it how to
use the classes and give examples of it
and I've even found for the layouts and
some esoteric methods i found
interesting in some things in the
javadocs which i would have had to read
the implementation to figure out
otherwise yeah and this is the point but
if you look for instance on the note
there is no single you know single line
about this is an old it is a constructor
is how to use that and so I mean this is
a great job but this is actually another
javadoc to the dock yeah yeah this is
like how it's supposed to be there and
most of the project javadoc is like
obvious obvious crap it's like they're
they are documenting something with all
the subway now somebody told them they
have to do to Avila yes exactly yes very
very popular and and unit is the same so
100 person unit test coverage as my my
favorite and recently I saw a project
one hundred percent has coverage without
single assault
next complaint from my verizon where are
da da Jerry test but I could ride them
with one hundred percent code coverage
in few minutes actually yeah without a
source of course so the janitor is
really great from from it is getting
better and better but it started already
good with Java fix but the end the
beginning was on mixed between the old
calm some stuff and the new Java X stuff
right now it is clean and clean and
actually looks good you didn't see with
with nice images embedded so this is
actually Java Java doc which character
which is usable analytics oh yeah baby
it's really documentation at this point
it's a lot of work to put this together
yeah there are lots of good examples
like my favorite is makita as well
mojito framework is the unit test
framework make sure the whole
documentation of the framework is Javed
off from the mojito class this actually
for very well done so you don't yeah but
actually so now Marcos now we documented
live fish and and I would like to show
you something so Java vix comes with
Java Vic's packager and what what you
can do easily so this is just a maven
integration it can create for your
native package which is actually perfect
because what do I always did was swing
back then I think it was not always
legal to some time and what it could do
you can put in a folder dedicate then or
Joe Jerry then your application then one
batch file which points to out points to
teach to to Jerry and the application
package everything in shipping the end
it worked it worked perfectly i got our
egg there's a redistribution clause and
sun and the old sign it I think it was
not that so I am my take on this was we
do it and we have to ask the legal
department under
manager said always of course we will do
it okay now right now everything is is
done right from my perspective but it
was not that clean so I think you
weren't able to reduce to the jury you
have to download it at something like
this and with Oracle is I think a little
bit easier because yeah there is a tool
which package is the application yeah so
this is this is the way I look at the
packager so here's applets not that good
and here is web star it's a little bit
better because you don't have the
plugins and it works on more machines
and this is where you want to go i mean
this is this is the official a wood in
this Oracle logo on this is this is
official because I made it say something
yeah but ya know we're encouraging folks
to do packaging because you know you can
ship the jvm version you tested with the
people don't have to have java installed
on their computers and this is going to
get your application and app stores like
the apple desktop app store or the
windows market what was what's windows
calling their app store yeah Bob stop
you know yeah I'm gonna say windows 8
has a lobster I haven't played with any
markings market is a Windows market so
hopefully make them to work with your
software Navin clean sorry with us or
stop or stores or of course well we
we've got folks from Brazil online so is
it is it it's a night in Brazil yeah let
us know let us know if it's night in
brazil what time is it there
if you if you if you tweet Brazil to
should chunk someone should shut out
Breslow so now it happens now a time
light which is going to be packaged
natively nice forward and the dmg should
be the output actually and this is
actually great f to say because what
start what's going technology but a
little bit shaky and the problem was not
website itself rather than you know the
proxy servers and caching mechanism and
enterprise that we had always trouble
with that yeah but just packaging
everything like in single file and
shipping that is actually the best you
can get and right now we do it without
packaging in one project because before
that so we do the zip distribution in
several countries and we got the answer
what is it it works great well
regardless where we move this it just
works you know because everything is
self-contained and I think the
self-contained deployment is just great
okay so now we have our light fish EMG
somewhere
installer
alright I'm going to war oh I can assess
morning of results I am over there a
damn yeah so order to be nice probably
aja aja it's night time can be you know
Thank it's always mindful sure Australia
I guess this is for somebody who travels
as much as I do we're I'm horrible at
time zones I have no clue and I think I
think the Sun rotates around the earth
but I didn't quite figured out this is
what would I love you son yeah some of
the sun goes in the orbit around the
Earth burn iso arms in New York those
advertisements feet behind every cloud
there is a son hi poli from the cloud a
cloud the cloud company three o'clock
three o'clock oh so it's it's night and
yeah that's right there like four and
five hours off yeah so it's it says Jim
actually up Jim Weaver's online he's in
he's in India Indianapolis or Indiana
bridge on Oregon pull you right yeah it
has to break all over the world oh
whatever clock yeah buddy kiss thank you
something so I think I could show you
something but I think the core pieces we
already live and without launching blast
wish it will be really hard let's let's
look at the GlassFish area just quickly
because you know we what we want to see
all right I can show you just don't
break netbeans is very very sensible
piece of software wait a minute
what I can do it can launch it is the
light fish without live you sharing your
son this is how it looks without without
with all gray sad charts ya paranormal
activity it was the best charts i think
it is not great here you are in trouble
performance commits per seconds robux
per seconds applications and this is
actually the beautiful WebKit yeah this
is an out of the box you can feel
without without any design skills which
is remarkable and the what you can do
you can create new scripts to selection
interview from the symbol that you see
here let's say alright let me check
something which is beautiful right I'll
even resize is property of course nice I
spent several minutes to work cool
alright so let's let's talk about what
we're gonna what we're going to do so
for folks on the stream after we're done
with Adam we're going to swap places yes
and Tony and Adam are going to interview
me about the night hackings horror and
it was our idea yeah you said yes yeah I
somehow I said yes I should have said no
yeah but you would like to have this
tick the right so also i was thinking
what we'll do is we'll actually will
take the camera wireless and go walk
outside and look at the bike and walk
around and do stuff so you'll be fine
and then to finish out the stream let's
let's let people know a little bit more
about how they can get air halves or
attend air hex of course I mean so keep
our toes and it always perfect yea gads
is he a hex calm just a tool yikes yeah
I was about to show you with a night
hiking or so just kidding good is the X
you get to get in mind no
think I think they're here as well well
the judge I have a sticker on now
everything settled yeah so air hacks Go
Go 10 can I come home we can connect
them I think so we have this we have we
should we should do a we should do a
virtual like you know you can do air
hacks so that we could put like a
brother yes and stream it on all night
actress yes yeah what's working on but
it would be in March but we can do that
no problem and it's like this nice yep I
sent out that link on the on the online
stream and if you like just contribute
or I found with that cool thank you I
said upcoming schedule right after this
hang on the screen five minutes and
we'll go back live with a reverse
interview and then at 3pm which that's
it 24 hours from now we're going to do
Tony perfect all right and thanks
everybody for attending night hacking
with Adam thank you very much and thanks
for coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
