technology Network we're here on the
floor of Java one Shanghai talking to
members of the java community I've Alex
with me hey Alex tell me tell me your
last name my last name is Damita ANCA ok
marinko and tell me what you do in the
java community we are great enjoy me but
it for small mobile devices for small
constraint really concentrate mobile
devices ok and there's been a lot of
excitement and interest about this whole
Internet of Things platform so tell me
what you're showing here ok we are
showing three demos now first of all is
the robot demo this is really really
come straight device on this demo this
embed with 32 kilobytes of RAM only and
the Ramage in Java is running here so we
can turn on this demo ok is turned on
and control
so Java is running on that little tiny
chip right there Yeah Yeah right right
it's raining on the great teenage ship
is 32 kilobytes of RAM it's our
investigation is right here yeah and
second emma is a solar panel system demo
first of all this demo is running on two
balls can be around one single binary on
two balls first of all is a kale board
and Raspberry Pi board Joe any berries
for these two balls and one simple bar
can be run on supports the main feature
is find the brightest position to charge
the battery it contains several
optimatus programs first of all you can
find the brightest position okay okay we
can turn on white flashlight
and it will be triggered ok so the solar
panel is looking for the light yep right
we can further life right absolutely and
tell me generally you really have to do
special things in Java to make this
happen like it's very complicated it's
not very complicated to a program of
some programming Java the way you would
regularly but it just ends up on a very
small constraint device right yes
absolutely right there it's really
simple to download our SDK in netbeans
and the flash program to this device we
are wires we have network and run very
cool so it's a great way to get involved
in terms of the Internet of Things using
devices people developers already know
Java and then they can go out in this
new exciting opportunity right yes
absolutely right well as a sub demo so
Demma is a smart home dammit we try to
imagine how we can improve our phones
yep this is my second phone and we can
send short messages to this home and
control peripherals in home for example
Triton turn of light ok you can send
short message to smartphone ok and the
wait a minute raspberry a boat right to
turn off the light ok it's working wow
yeah that would work anyway you can you
could be at work and say turn on the air
conditioner because it's really hot yeah
having chicken Chains Vega car you can
turn on condition just in the system
yeah cool well thank you very much i
really appreciate your welcome euro
story wit with the Oracle technology
Network I know you can get lots more
information about how to get started
with Java and very small devices on OTO
