presenting and also working on machine
learning yes I am so what do you do
exactly so I I work as head of machine
learning for a company does call cimt
and we help our customers to butte
models using machine learning and also
we have product that's down in internal
alpha that's called smart canvas that's
a collaboration and communication to
four companies so are you are you a data
scientist or developer I'm more an
engineer so yeah developer yeah I I work
in the frontier between a data scientist
in an engineer so okay so explain you
say that that machine learning in
production we do real products using
machine learning okay so so give us like
a little example of who does what like
all the typical release of the of your
product okay so so in our product we
have front-end did this this front end
is the web application and also we have
mobile applications between for android
and iOS and then we have all the the
Java bet back-end that serves the all
the functionalities and then we have the
models machine learning so for instance
one thing that we do for this brother is
that we find topics of interest for
people based on what they post what they
write about and what they interact with
so that's exposed to to this front end
so it's it's a machine learning model
behind it okay so and you develop the
model or yes we do yes okay we do all
the data science stuff and all the
engineering because the problem is that
sometimes you you spend a lot of chance
during the more
but you have to make it work and you
have to connect it to to a real
application right so that sometimes you
think that okay that that my mother is
working the accuracy is good but then
you have to put it in production in so
that's when the trouble right yeah and
so how do you how do you deal with or do
you have experience with false negatives
or like things that that you thought
were were going to produce like the
great results and then you realize that
you malo has laws that you do right sure
sure in the one month Earthlings think
that the happen is that sometimes the
data changes because machine learning
model is composed all the the data the
algorithms in all the parameters that
you feed the model so if is if the data
changes sometimes you have to change in
parameters and and sometimes you even
have to change the algorithms so it's a
very dynamic yeah very dynamic problem
so okay so how long does it take you to
just like a write a working model to the
satisfaction that you that you um okay
so so it takes sometimes six mom Wow
yeah some of the models that we are
using today we start two years ago so
that that's a evolving thing so it's
really based on experience that yes it
is so did you are you also doing a
presentation here at it yes I am okay
yeah so what's the topic the topic is
about deploying machine learning models
in production okay yeah excellent so any
what do you cover it on the on this
topic what are some of the main topic
that you cover in your session yes I
gotta talk a little bit about all the
possible solutions that that we can use
so for instance one thing that we can do
is that we can serialize the model and
and then make a make it available to to
the application that's that's one one
thing that we can do another thing that
we can choose what i call the projection
so what do I do is that I I taken it in
that event something that I need to
predict for instance if I would like to
to predict the the most interesting
topics for you and for other users what
I do is I ask the model then then I
store this result in a database and that
I serve that results from the database
so it's kind of a projection of the
demand of itself so there are a lot of
solutions that we can try to solve this
issue of making the models of able in
production and so to the general public
do you think the session is really to
understand so how can can developers use
the information that you're presenting
oh so it's based on our experience so i
think that people that are starting a
fued as well as people that are ready
doing things in the field because i
gonna show the basic techniques and also
the more advanced techniques so i think
that that you be useful for for
beginners and experts as well so any
funny stories about stuff that you found
I don't know any examples that you want
to share with us about the data modeling
that you did did you do somewhere lol
attacked in Brazil yeah so for instance
unless last week I was working in a POC
that the they go was tube to recognize
flowers for a customer so I spent two
days during the model so I extend an
existing model and I got really good
results but at this point I'm still
trying to make it work in production so
you can see that's really tough problem
to zone okay well good luck with that
process all right
thank you thank you so much for spending
the time with us and don't be talking to
us about the deadly thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
