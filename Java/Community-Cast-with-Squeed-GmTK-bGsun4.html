dev Heather van Kyra here with my next
interview team I'm really excited about
this because we have three really cool
guys from Sweden here to talk to so
thanks for joining us three guys from
spleen once you introduce yourself oh
let's start with you yep my name is Lola
Peterson java developer and organizer of
the jog in gothenburg along with these
guys right and i'm going to talk to you
about your java user group i'm really
excited to hear about the things that
you're doing Oh in guttenberg and we
also have rickard yes my name is Cedric
cotillion and I'm also a Java developer
been doing Java since Java 120 also the
Java user group leader in guttenberg and
occasionally it speak at conferences and
such and and then what about your your
profession your professional life what
are you doing your professional life
well I write software alright yeah ok
java correct yeah all right cuz that's
one of the really cool things about this
conference is raised you have a mix so I
have to ask that at this conference most
of the conference's I attended it's
assumed that you're a Java developer so
that's why I asked ok am Peter yep Peter
Lane this my name I'm as these two guys
almost of the java developer I've been
doing yoga for ages as far as I know
yeah participating in the in conferences
like this and speaking as a message that
we want to want to give to to the
community and people around us also you
involved in the community in Gothenburg
quite a lot right yeah well I had a
really great time meeting all of you in
san francisco at javaone this year so
I'm excited to meet up with you again
here in Sweden want to tell me a little
bit about Ordo for you like what you got
out of participating here I know you
have a talk later Peter and Rick are due
today let me share a little bit of your
perspective about what makes or devs so
great and what you're talking about
later today
well I think it's it's a the talk we
give is called what a back-end java
developer doesn't know about the modern
web stack and it's it's quite heavily a
tool talk so we we don't show any code
it's more like it's really important
that you know what you don't know so you
can improve and I think that those kinds
of soft skills are more and more
important in in our business it's not
just writing the code anymore it's like
people communication how teams work how
you talk to a customer how how you
really get things done make the final
solution and it's so much more than just
writing the code nowadays right I agree
definitely that's one of the things that
I talked about like I think I spoke to
you a little bit about it when I saw you
at javaone about what you get out of
participating in the java community
process right is are those soft skills
communication collaboration things that
not every developer has a chance to
practice and their day jobs but that are
going to be crucial skills to have using
you know at least fifty percent of your
time as a developer is going to be
dedicated to those kinds of skills and
it's going to be even more crucial at
you know to secure your spot in the
development world in your professional
career to have those types of skills
exactly cool and so I think as a result
of us talking at javaone I think did you
saying that you joined the JCP did all
of you join the JCP when I should share
a little bit about that I I had already
joined the JCP during yeah earlier the
summer in the summary joined the JCP
yeah one got to you guys so I got the
t-shirt as well so I already had the
Java t-shirt for Java well alright so we
had a membership drive when they
introduced these new memberships earlier
this year we you know as part of the
promotion that you could join now we
offer the shirt and so you actually had
participated in the membership yeah so I
I did it the online with the new super
easy just the digital signature and
enjoying
yeah earlier during the summer all right
but I think you guys joined during yeah
we joined I joined us at JCP associate
and as Allah says it was really a simple
process so i highly recommend everyone
it's not it's not a huge step to get
involved and as a first step we I was
able to vote in the in the JCP election
oh right that's cool so we have another
election going on right now we have the
java community elections we have the JCP
Executive Committee elections going on
right now and so we have five more days
that people can vote if you're a JCB
member you should definitely take
advantage of that voting right that you
have to vote for who's going to be on
the board of the JCP executive committee
and so have you all voted yep you know
voted yes we have okay awesome alright
so yeah you only have until Monday to
vote and we also had as part of that we
have a big push to encourage more Java
user groups to participate in the Java
standardization process and I know
you've mentioned they are all involved
in your local Java user group so that's
great to hear tell us maybe a little bit
about some of the initiatives that you
have going in your user group because it
sounds like it's a little bit different
how you do things in Sweden and maybe
some of your plans for the future about
getting more involved and maybe adopted
jsr and some of those things yeah and
the Java youth group in Sweden it's
called the Java forum and it it has it
actually was started by sun microsystems
at those days and for about 10 years ago
at the kid ago son wanted to have it
more like a community-driven event so at
that time in three different cities
malmal stockholm and Guttenberg we did
like local user groups that was driven
by the community really so we've been
doing that and we have taken approach in
Sweden not to have meetings that often
so we have at least four meetings a year
so once a reporter
and we have very large audience at least
in stockelman Guttenberg so in Stockholm
it was like crazy they couldn't even
send out the invites before the meeting
was full with the 250 participants or
300 yeah that's quite a large gathering
they actually needed to implement a
random mail distribution so people with
long down in the alphabet they couldn't
participate because it was already full
when the emails got to like taken during
like the last 10 years it has been more
of mini conference evenings with like
three sessions and a large audience who
sits back and relaxes and just listens
two sessions so we have started to
discuss about maybe doing something a
bit more handsome gathering maybe 20
people instead of 220 people with things
like it of the jsr or helping out yeah a
bit more hands-on with the java
community right and and like i was
mentioning to you earlier that yeah it's
good to have a sub sub group that
focuses on that because a lot of a lot
of javi's group members still do like to
have that traditional taking in of the
information and kind of informal
chatting and discussing and networking
versus getting back into the code but
there is there's a subset of most user
groups that would be really interested
in doing that so have a subset of like
you said you know 5 10 maybe 20
developers even large user groups like
the london java community their hack
days and their most successful ones have
been five to 10 developers right and
they're making a key contribution to
java to the platform to making it better
and having that real world experience so
we should definitely have some input and
feedback from sweden and you could be
the trail trailblazer there in
guttenberg so that would be awesome and
what about so i noticed all of you work
at the same company how do you get your
sponsorship and how does your company
support your efforts to be active in the
community yeah we are all the squeezers
as you say it with the company squid I
mean
it's we really really really care about
sharing that's basically we're close our
hearts so our our our vision or are our
goal is to kind of raise the the lowest
barrier for people I mean to race the
you raise the bar in knowledge is so and
then we know that we will get much more
funny funny gigs sort of so it's a yeah
we like we like to share basically it's
important right yeah I think that's yeah
would you say that that's characteristic
of Swedish companies or you think that
sweet is unique I'm just curious in that
way it's pretty much Swedish I guess
yeah but uh it comes to community effort
there are a few companies who really
cherish like the community and the
knowledge and to share knowledge and we
really want to be such a company with
having it in the very core culture and
but it may differ between companies in
Sweden as well some some really want to
have it in the core values others like
to maybe they don't have it in the core
values of yeah so it differs a bit well
that's great that you have that partner
in your Java user group and in your
employment so and then also I noticed
you know mentioning as we had our
speaker dinner last night right at the
city hall we heard from the malmo mayor
he gave us an inspiring talk that was
really interesting you want to share a
little bit anybody want to talk about
the speech and kind of the Swedish
optimism or character that you might
recognize being Swedish people yeah I
think you're right okay no I was very
proud as a sweet when I heard them mayor
when he said that we might not everyone
involvement may speak Swedish perfectly
but at least one person in mama who
speaks any language in the world
perfectly so he had a twist on the
multicultural way of mama and of sweden
in a very positive
yeah shape yeah and it's a in these
times it was very very refreshing and
nicely the mayor of mama it was aight i
enjoyed it very much i enjoyed the
opportunity to be in the city hall to be
welcomed and the words that he shared so
that was really cool and then as I was
discussing and as my dinner table was
telling me last night I didn't give the
rabbit in the room which was that oh
actually yeah my heritage is Swedish and
they said I should have shared this much
earlier so I share it with you there you
go now it's out i'm not holding it
secret it's just I didn't think it was
that relevant but I really enjoyed the
dinner and I'm enjoying the conference
so far I'm looking forward to meeting
more people and hearing more about the
things that the community is doing in
Sweden and meeting some more of you
throughout the next couple days and
having some fun so thanks for taking the
time to talk with me and share with the
community and our community cast here at
aura dev and we'll enjoy the rest of the
conference together thank you thank you
