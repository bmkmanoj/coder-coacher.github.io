like four people and we just make sure
that Twitter services are running well
under on the on the JDK des JVM and we
have three chassis engineers and I'm the
compiler engineer and so what I do
pretty much all the time is trying to
run Twitter services on this new Chet
compiler call crawl okay tell us like
what is growl growl is um so the hotspot
the JVM of open JDK there it has
something called chit compilers like
just-in-time compilers and the compilers
they translate Java bytecode into native
code that you then run on your CPU right
and there are the existing there are
actually two compilers two different
ones the existing compilers are called
c1 or client compiler and the other one
c2 or server compiler and growl is is a
chip compiler that's basically designed
to replace C to the top tier compiler
which produces the peak performance code
and the main difference is C 1 and C 2
are written in C++ and growl is written
in Java so and the purpose what is the
purpose of using growl I mean in so
what's the situation that you have at
Twitter right it makes that's really
useful so there are many reasons but in
particular for Twitter what it what it
brings us is our services are almost
exclusively written in Scala and Corral
can do a very good job with Scala code
so we are saving roughly around the 8%
mark of CPU utilization across our
services and data centers which means at
the scale of Twitter that's a lot of
money so okay yes so but it's also
because you have like a large I mean a
lot of applications and you yeah we run
thousands and thousands of JVM x' and
thousands of machines in multiple data
say yes oh yes the scale is big
to the saving s big butt so I gave this
talk a bunch of times and and I've
talked to people afterwards and the way
I see it is even even if you have a
small company and you only have a few
servers it's still the money you have to
spend it's in relation to what you know
what the income is of the whole company
side it's still it still matters right
so it's not just be if you don't have a
size of Twitter or Google or anything it
doesn't mean you can't use crawl it's it
still helps you or can this way so what
did you show in your presentation it's
it's basically that I'm showing the
tweet service as an example it's the
service that reads and writes tweets and
I'm running this in isn't in an
experimental setup and then I compare a
VM that's running with C 2 and 1 with
growl and and then how much savings we
get there which is in an experimental
setup it's even more we are seeing like
an 11 percent improvement which is which
is a lot in compilers it's usually when
you when you gain like one or two
percent that's already great but I mean
11 is like a lottery win okay anything
else like recommendations that you if
people want you like deploy likes a lot
of JVM so what's it's you have to be
aware that's it it just behaves
differently
and that's because it's written in Java
you have to know that it has to do
something called the bootstrap if you
don't alt compile it if you don't ahead
of time compile it you have to be aware
that it's allocating Java heap memory
instead of native memory you have to
notice it's not most of the time it's
not a big issue it can be but most of
that time it's not but you have to know
that because you know service honest
they're there monitoring their services
very closely they look at the metrics
and if something you know if you use my
memory they they freak out because I
think all memory leak but so these are
the issues that you have to deal with at
least at this stage of Gras I'm sure in
in a few years we'll we'll you know make
sure maybe even that Chavez allocations
are actually not be done from the Chava
hip you know - I kind of isolate or hide
it from the user or things like this but
at this point you have to know these
things so any other things that you're
sharing in your presentation basically
the presentation is about my experience
at Twitter so I'm there enough
year-and-a-half and and what I
experienced over this course using growl
and you know what what one main
motivation why I'm giving this talk is
because you know growl is still an
experimental compiler let's call it this
although we are using it in production
like today the Maine Forest Service's
that Twitter is using are running 100%
in on growl in production so every time
you tweet or read a tweet it's going
through code that's being compiled by
growl ah and that that's been going on
for a couple months already and I don't
think did you lose any tweets or
anything no no no that's where
everything works for us it works great
we found about four bugs I think you
know one was not that important we were
pretty important but since then and that
was more than a year ago and since then
we haven't found any bugs so what the
compiler needs at this point is exposure
to other code so I'm giving this talk to
encourage people to try it out you know
show them hey you can't have winds and
even winds you know in money which is a
driver - if you want to go to your
manager and say hey we should maybe try
to send them Anderson why right and then
you can say well you know Twitter is
saving a lot of money so maybe we should
try to that that's one of the main
reasons why I'm doing this okay cool
anything else that you want to let
people know about growl way to get it is
it easy to implement it so the preferred
way of so yes two things number one as a
mentioned earlier Jamie MCI and gdk9
right so it's in there
it's also if you download a JD cape 9
built for Linux x86 you already have a
crowd version in it and that's because
the äôt feature and JDK 9 users grow
but that's only on Linux on Mac you
don't get it but since you have g vm CI
in it you can't just grab a graph copy
on github build it and then you run with
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
