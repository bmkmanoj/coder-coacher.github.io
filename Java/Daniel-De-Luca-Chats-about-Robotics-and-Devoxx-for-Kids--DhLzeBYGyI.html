Network and I'm here today at devoxx in
Belgium and talking to Daniel DeLuca
Daniel hi I Ron have you nice to meet
you too and so what do you do Danielle
for a living after leaving I'm a
freelancer so I'm proposing my services
as a software architect team leader in
software development in java j2ee
platforms no more stuff that's it okay
and so what is the robot in your arm the
replies in my arm is this now so it's
from aldera ban robotics comp french
company is building game we use such
robots for the d'box pockets initiatives
where we try to teach children to
introduce children to computer software
computer programming in order to
introduce them to computer science in
general so we do that either with normal
computers let's aim to show them that
they can be they can be creative with
those computers instead of just watching
Facebook commenting on facebook or
posting pictures or watching videos on
YouTube we want to teach them it's also
possible to be creative to build for
example some games in an easy way and
the other way is also to teach them okay
give the max an aspect of robotics where
the we teach them acquire a robot it's
also computers you can also program it
but it has another interface so we can
have multiple sensors here a sonar
sensors on the on the feet on the hand
and they they use all those sensors in
order to do to make the robots doing
things quite funny sometimes we do that
with this kind of robots we use also
some Lego Mindstorms and another aspect
we try to teach them is also electronics
showing them that behind the computer
screens the most the robot there is a
model boards there are some electronic
components and for this we use the
Arduino platforms so we give them a
voltage ohms all those electronic
particularities and we make them
lighting a lead using sensors and
sometimes we also interact with the
Arduino platform sensors and with the
computers to make use the sensors of the
adrenals in order to make the games for
example okay you taught also green food
green food true that's a higher level of
in the indication parts yep no teaching
really concept of Java object oriented
programming using Java like object
instances having different instances in
a world and then those instances or for
example a total that they have to move
around with the keyboards and behind
them we show them okay sometimes no you
have to code Java and so we introduce
them to Java and to those concept but
it's for high level between it's a 12 to
15 years old she knows so where did you
use those workshop I mean in which
countries ah we started in 2012 in
Belgium with two sessions two events in
one in Flanders and infra in Dutch and
in vilonia in French and then quickly
the other jerks started to create also
events and so we have no events in
different region in France in
in Holland also in the Netherlands also
there are multiple different cities in
Denmark in Switzerland in Geneva for
example recently also we are starting
also session we're going to start
session next year in Canada in the US in
the Bay Area in San Francisco we already
started last month in the Philippines
just before the typhoon so now it's kind
of tricky so I got new good news so it's
everybody is fine but the schoolers are
completely destroyed so and and we're
gonna start also in in Africa North
Africa in Morocco so what happened with
the language I mean how do you how those
groups work with the language today
design it yourself or what can what kind
of resources can they depend on yeah the
prominent that we encountered that's why
we started initially the DevOps for kids
that we were looking for materials on
the internet to teach software
programming to our own children's but
the problem is that okay we found
materials but only in English but I'd
say it's good for the US for example in
Canada but the rest of the world
sometimes children at that age do not
speak English yet so we translate them
we combine them and and we share of
course those materials and we try to
have them in translate to have some
translations for the other countries or
we translate them in English and then
they translate in for example in Danish
or in in France for example so every
groups as in their own country have the
native language version of the workshops
so if somebody wants to do that I mean
do they need to pay for anything for the
training or I mean what everybody else
in open source minded so we share all
our materials on our website so WWE box
for kids calm and everybody is welcome
to to use it not necessarily under the
name of the Vox Rockets as long as
basically the share what they have
modified or what they've created with us
so
can we share the same information to
everybody else that's the main goal we
don't we're not looking for having
benefit or the only benefit we are
looking for is the happiness of a
children's the joy on their faces when
they are programming such a robot is
it's amazing you have to see that it's
really incredible and it's also
incredible from the parents point of it
because they say my chalice has changed
basically it's come back you come back
home and it's just talking about this
Ollie all the week long and they're
really happy and sometimes the parent
ask okay can you do that for for us to
sit sorry but we are just concentrating
on video and so it's really funny
sometimes it's really rewarding and it's
a they give us in inspirations okay you
have a lot you can give a lot of
inspiration to the children's because
they have some ID incredible ideas what
they can do with with those robots for
example and also the games they are
building with the applications but they
give us also inspiration in say okay
this is really early an enormous rewards
because it's very fun to do that you
learn a lot also from the children
because they are not afraid of doing
things with the computers while the
idiot sometimes persons say okay can I
do this can I not do this would it break
not sure that don't care they just go
full speed if it breaks okay the brakes
but at least they'll learn from it so
it's very very were waiting yeah it's
it's amazing yeah it's a man you should
try it it's a really have to advise to
do that do it even with your own child
it's very funny sometimes you can just
even without the computers you can do
things already and you will see that
happiness on your child again it's a
very wonderful so if they want to get
started they they should go to the
website or contact you go to the website
to look already at the videos to have an
impression already what what has been
done already and then they can contact
us we start discussing to help them at
giving them advice as how to get the
actually we're to look at four locations
ought to get even three sponsorships I
know to organize this we have for
example tomorrow at the session we have
a session on room seven where we will
explain give all the tips and tricks we
have learned so far ought to organize
sessions but also the second part will
be on all the workshops you already are
off providing and the buff in the
evening will be talking about question
and answers and we will also discuss
about eventually new things that we can
add new type of workshops you can do
nowadays you have hundreds of thousands
of possibilities to teach in a fun way
computer science to children's wonderful
thank you so much for sharing yes your
story and your wonderful work this is
really wonderful thank you thank you
thank you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
