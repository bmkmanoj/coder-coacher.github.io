have Chris Judd with me here authority
of stage hi Chris hello welcome thank
you why don't you introduce yourself
tell us a little bit about you sure so
I'm Chris Judd and I'm the CTO and a
partner at manifest solutions were just
a mid-sized consulting company out of
columbus ohio and I've been doing Java
for about 22 years and I also do mobile
development so I like to tell people
that by day I'm a mild-mannered to
enterprise Java developer but by night
I'm a crime-fighting mobile developer
you seen it all yes and I've also led
the central Ohio Java users group or
coach ugh for 16 years now wow that's
impressive I was fortunate enough to
visit you at your jug just earlier this
year first time to Ohio yeah we're happy
to have you yeah yeah so that's fun so
you're here tour dev first time this is
my first time and what are you talking
about here at or dev so yesterday I did
a full day tutorial on the Amazon Cloud
and specifically some java application
and we went through a deployment process
both the ec2 and two elastic beanstalk
and then tomorrow i'm speaking about
java web security cool java web security
so you can catch that session tomorrow
at what time 120 ok cool that'll be fun
to watch and some of the more
interesting things also are kind of
happening around the conference we have
some really cool keynotes that I've been
enjoying today and we had a lovely
dinner last night and I heard that
yesterday there was another excursion
that I missed out on so maybe you can
share with the folks here your
experience with the the sauna and
excursion that you enjoyed as part of
the speaker excursions yeah so you know
I've been really amazed at how beautiful
that malmo is and how proud people are
of Malmo and the Swedish traditions and
heritage and one of those things we got
to participate in was the speakers went
out to a sauna and we started off the
event by having some fish sandwich and
then we had some schnapps and then we
got undressed and we went into a sauna
and we stayed in the hot sauna till we
couldn't stand the heat anymore and then
we walked outside and we actually got
into the sea and it was very very cold I
think that's an understatement and I
wasn't there but I'm from California and
I don't even go in the Pacific Ocean
yeah Mike I felt ice on my feet yeah it
really woke you up so if you had any
type of jet lag or anything it was gone
great is it was snowing yesterday right
yep then you're in the ocean and we were
in the ocean that's impressive I I do go
into the Pacific Ocean if I'm in the
southern part of California but in the
northern part of California I don't even
venture into the ocean so that's like a
traditional Swedish a custom it is yeah
is it yeah they're some of the natives
we heard him talking about going with
their families of the weekend before so
yeah they do it all year round and
frequently that's pretty cool about our
dev that they give you a little bit of
the culture right of the traditions I
enjoyed last night we got to see the
dancing as well and we got to
participate in the crawfish and so yeah
it's been a lot of fun yeah cool so what
do you what have you thought of the
conference so far here in the in the in
the space it's obviously a really cool
space rustic let the exposed pipes and
the breaker can oh it's a great book
it's a great space I like that all the
cushions out there that people can sit
on I'm amazed at how many people are
here i was expecting maybe two to five
hundred and having over a thousand is
really fun it is fun i've enjoyed the
conference a little bit different for me
I'm used to going to Java pure Java
conferences so here we have a nice mix
so I've had an opportunity to meet some
people that I don't usually have the
opportunity to talk with and hear from
what they're speaking about and learn
some new things so I've definitely
enjoyed that is this your first order my
first order I've mint to sweeten many
times I've never made it to or ative so
I'm really excited to be here and
experience it and looking at other new
conferences I can go to is gonna ask you
about your conference that I just
learned of last night I wasn't aware you
organize a conference in january is a
code mash yeah so the user groups in
central Ohio and all throughout Ohio as
well
the ones in Michigan realized that we
didn't have any great Midwest
conferences and so we got together 11
years ago and we started the small
conference call code mash and it's grown
over the 11 years to last year late 2500
attendees and which unique about this
conference is not only does it bring
together a lot of technologies like here
or dev but it also is held at a
waterpark the Kalahari water park and
that gives it a really family-friendly
feel a lot of people bring their
families and we have a associated kids
conference with it called kids mash and
it's just a great event we have two days
of what we call pre compilers which are
the workshops and then two regular days
as well okay and so what kind of topics
are you discussing there is it pure Java
or other technologies as well it's a
combination of Java JavaScript net Ruby
architecture tots soft skills talks just
a wide variety of development-oriented
topics okay so call for papers is open
call for papers ended already is ended
so their conferences in January from the
7th to the 10th so we're actually
finishing up wrapping up all the final
details for this one cool and so is this
something that you do is part of your
user group or is this something in
addition to your user group this is in
addition to the user group yeah what's
going on with your user group I really
did enjoy visiting you in Columbus your
kind of unique and that you had two
meetings at lunchtime meeting and an
evening meeting so an opportunity to
interact with quite a few developers in
your area and learn about some of the
things they're working on what's what's
new with you in your user group
community what are some of the things
that your members are interested in so
yesterday we had a meeting and the
meetings were both about serverless
architecture and deploying to
specifically lambda and the Gateway
services of Amazon but you know that the
ideas and concepts could be applied to
any of the other server lists
architectures as well okay then when we
talked about JCP related things and
whether or not maybe you thought you
might do some of the hands-on activities
have you discussed that at all since we
were there like getting into
scene for JT canine looking at some of
the early access builds or doing any of
those kind of things so at this point we
haven't we've usually on the JCP front
allowed the individuals that were
interested to kind of lead up those
efforts and nobody stepped up at this
point okay we gave them the information
and it's always good to touch base and
see what's what's coming next so at this
point you're just happy with doing kind
of talks and then networking which I
found really valuable with your folks
there's they were very warm and
welcoming and discussing with each other
but both before and after the the
speaker part of the meeting so I really
enjoyed that you're kind of I guess
being born in California I'd never been
in the Midwest before I'd been on both
of the coast but never really true in
the the Midwest there and I guess
there's kind of the perception of the
Midwestern hospitality right so i felt
like i was i was very welcome someone
even gave me a ride back to the city
downtown so i could visit the art museum
there someone that you know was just
attending the meeting offered to give me
a ride so yeah that's great to hear a
little odd that you got to share that
Midwest yes yeah that was fun so well
it's fun to see you again here in Sweden
of all places so nice to see you again
here and thanks for sharing some of the
things that you've been up to and the
experience particularly with the sauna
enjoyed hearing about that I'll have to
come back another year to be able to
experience it myself you should it's a
great experience yeah all right well
thanks enjoy the rest of those around me
