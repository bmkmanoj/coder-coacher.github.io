technology Network we are here reporting
live from floor of Java one we're having
a great time if you are a part of Java
one get down to the hub as soon as you
can because things are very exciting and
lots of great things to see and there's
lots of vendors that have really
interesting solutions so for example I
have Mike talent with me here hey Mike
and I'm doing great so tell me about
your company so I'm the CEO of a company
called object wheel okay start up and
it's house Brad framework basically
framework for dragging and dropping and
making mobile apps and different types
of things like that that's rated javafx
so it's very good very similar to seen
bill burr okay cept it's not seen
builder it's our own our own platform
okay so you'll put a button on there the
grid or you'll put a field or a label or
whatever right on the screen and then
when you hit a button it'll generate the
Java code behind it Oh excellent cool so
how do you see the space going right now
well we really like javafx it's very
exciting product we are actually able
right now to create an application with
javafx and run it on iphone android
linux mac and windows
all with dragon draw so oh sweet it's
doing it natively right we anticipate
javafx to really make an impact when
people want to write in 11 language and
be able to deploy in all those platforms
wait a minute is this like the concept
of write once run anywhere oh that's
very that's the Holy Grail okay wine for
a long time right it really hasn't seen
the light yeah object wheel is really
trying to make that happen okay so we're
getting there getting there excellent
and it runs natively so sounds fast
right Fester's the idea robo vm and also
a port of android that you're on boss
okay yeah and those are the two products
that we're using and we anticipate
having a reader that's going to run all
these different platforms as well as the
way of actually generating an APK or an
IPA or
your DMV or whatever your extension is
just clicking wow that's very cool also
going to be talking to other other
databases like MySQL using glass fish
and Jersey to where we can talk to other
databases but the actual platform itself
is designed for both programmers and
non-programmers to to make to make apps
you don't have to be a programmer oh
okay so maybe if you're more in the
design space is that what you're talking
about somebody yeah we create a button
you can create a background you can
create a maybe a grid or a graph or
whatever right just dragging and
dropping these components all right
anticipate other developers making some
of these components that are more
powerful maybe a clock component yeah
right great yeah so we anticipate
getting a lot of help in the developers
community to to make the platform
even more powerful that means to you
guys right all right so I'm here I'm
watching the video I'm really excited
where do I get more information when I
jump in if you google object wheel okay
wikipedia for object wheel we have
videos on YouTube the object wheel I am
on Twitter a big dreamer there's a lot
of pictures and stuff on Twitter okay
for a forum on theirs oh yeah and then
and basically before the end of the year
we're going to be watching and you'll be
able to actually play with the software
before the end of the year and so that's
very exciting excellent so here's your
chance to get in on the ground floor the
pool thing about a start-up is this is
the guy and he's available on Twitter
and a lot of other places so give it a
try and give them some feedback right
yeah all right great so what we're going
to do one of the things that we're
working on is what's called a launcher
so from a URL from a URL like object
filled up yes you'll click on that and
it's going to load the entire jdk
framework as well as all the stuff for
your platform automatically so from from
a link oh wow okay and then it's going
to load the actual content the digital
content adapter
okay one of the things that we also have
the browser built into them to the
framework so you can actually launch a
dashboard that has a browser built into
it that could have potentially 100
websites honor oh okay cool so you can
monitor your app in real time and very
close an actual client and so we're
going to make sure that we occupy the
user when it's doing the download the
second time around the dashboard would
launch its contain ially because all of
the jdk all the stuff right in the
background okay very cool well thank you
Mike for dropping by this is one of the
exciting parts about javelin as you
learn the new things that are coming up
so yeah I know so javafx is a really
cool technology and a good way to jump
into it is learn a little bit about
object will thanks a lot this is Tori
