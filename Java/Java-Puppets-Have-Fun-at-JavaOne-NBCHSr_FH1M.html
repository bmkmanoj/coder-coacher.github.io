have a talk tomorrow at one and we
explained everything about becoming your
champion so but i'll give you because
all of you you're so special i'll give
you like a short thing right the short
summary so there are five steps five
steps only as we only we're puppets we
only have four fingers I don't know how
to count to five well you can count to
five right so then you don't have an
excuse I can count you more than 40

short answer oh that is five questions I
really want to do it I want to be more
helpful in the community so it's not
easy yes it is that easy girl yeah I've
got a good idea you know to make it very
very easy you should join a job easy
group and then you can do with your
friends because once you do if your
friends is even easier yeah that is true
that is the easiest way to get into is
just talk to do the getting too involved
in the community and just join a Java
user group that is closer to you there
many many Java user groups around the
world so you're bound to find something
that is very close to you are you a good
courting you can do or going to use one
told you it's not an either/or yeah just
get now you can you can do lots of
different things that's cool you know we
love java so we don't mind we'd all day
long yeah that's cool ok so I think that
it's almost time to wrap up guys right
