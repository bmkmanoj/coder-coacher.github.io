Network and I'm here today at devoxx UK
talking to Patrick curiam Patrick hi hi
Ellen thank you for inviting me thank
you for coming very glad to be here so
you with we had an interview at devoxx
in Belgium and you talked about the GCP
that makes programme yeah can you remind
us a little bit what was what was it
about sure
JCB though next is shorthand for a
series of GSRs that we are working on
whose purpose is not to create a
technology specification but to change
the way that the JCB itself does its
business so the first of those was jsr
348 which we finished in October 2011 we
did a second one last year which was
much simpler that just merged the two
executive committees for Emmy and SCE
into one and we're working on the third
one right now which is a more
complicated one to modify the legal
agreements and intellectual property
flow and so on but the first of these is
probably the one that's more of interest
to regular developers than the
legalistic stuff and that jsr 3:48
basically mandated that in future all
jr's must be conducted in public so the
expert groups have to do their business
in public on a public mailing list they
have to have public issue trackers they
have to take comments from people and
they have to basically permit the
developer community to participate in
the work that they're doing to observe
and to participate so building on this
couple of the Java user groups who are
represented on the Executive Committee
at the JC P learn a Java community who
are obviously the hosts of this event
here in London and also so Java the
Brazilian Java user group together
created this program they called adopted
ESR which is basically a program
intended to help individual developers
to participate in the work of the GP but
do it collectively as a group
it for several years now I've been
coming to events like this and
encouraging individuals to join the JC P
we have a lot of individual members
about 3/4 our members are individuals
but what we found out was that once they
join that was kind of it they didn't
really know where to go next because
they were individuals some of them would
feel a bit intimidated even by the name
expert group I'm not an expert how could
I serve on an expert group or it's just
me I don't want to I'm just me how can I
represent someone like IBM or whatever
and what we figured out or what the ALJ
see and so Java figured out was if
people can join collectively and behave
collectively through their Java user
group then they can help each other they
can teach each other and so on so that's
that's what the adopted us our program
is about and that's what I've been
talking about while I'm while I'm here
ok so you have you had a session about
about just about how to get started with
DJ so we had a couple of sessions
yesterday the first one was a brief
session where we talked in general about
participation and you know having JCP
works why it's a good idea for
individuals and developers to
participate and then yesterday evening
we did a longer session called it a
workshop where we talked more
specifically about the adopted GSR
program how to get involved how it works
how how much progress we'll be making
and so on so how many people are
actually in the program right now I
think we have more than 20 Java user
groups who are actually participating in
the program between them they are
working on almost 30 different ASRs so
there really is quite a lot of activity
and the kind of things they do it varies
very much from very simple stuff like
helping out with with the mailing list
making sure the questions get answered
or triaging issues making sure that
issues are appropriately prioritized
some of the guys from run and Java
community are actually helping out by
building
TCK tests for jsr
the date and time jsr several others
building applications what they do is
they take the latest build of a new jsr
and they create an application to test
it out so by doing that we get kind of
real-world feedback from real developers
and somebody made a good point during
the session yesterday evening it's when
you're holding one of these events you
shouldn't assume that you're going to
get a lot of that everybody's going to
be a skilled developer some of them will
not be and in fact that's a good thing
if all you have is really smart
developers then you're not necessarily
going to find problems in your
documentation in the way that the API is
are structured because let's be honest
you know we have nine million Java
developers in the world and many of them
are relatively junior and not so
experienced so when we put something
into the Java platform we've got to make
sure that it's usable by everyone so
having regular developers play with the
stuff try it out they can find problems
they can report bugs and in fact
yesterday evening at the session I
demoed one application that was done by
the belgium java user group b job and
what they did was they took the jsr 3:56
WebSocket jsr and they built a simple
multiplayer tic-tac-toe application so
with multiple clients you have a client
runs on Android runs on apple iOS runs
on html5 runs on JavaFX speaking to a
server nor communicating over WebSockets
so this is a really good example of the
kind of stuff that regular developers
can do to provide useful helpful
feedback to the expert groups and to the
spec leads great so where can they find
know more information the simplest place
is probably go to a doctor Jenna saw
walk that redirects to a Java tan their
project where everything you need to
know about adopted GSR is listed you can
find a list of what Jo SARS are
available whose work
on them and a kind of step-by-step how
to get started
instructions some examples of the kind
of things that people can do all the way
from the simple stuff like working with
bug lists to mailing lists up to the
more complicated matter of actually
fixing bugs and submitting fixes so
adopted Giada org
jump in get started thank you so much
for talking to us today Rick thank thank
you for the opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
