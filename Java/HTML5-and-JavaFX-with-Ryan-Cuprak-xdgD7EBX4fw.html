so I want to welcome everybody to the
Silicon Valley JavaFX user group so we
usually have about monthly meetings
second or third week of the of the month
and we also livestream all of our
meetings if you go to my blog steve on
java comm /sv jug effects and we're also
this is the first time we're dual
streaming so this is showing up with a
night hacking website as well so if you
go to night hacking calm you can also
check it out and we'll be monitoring the
chat during the session so if you're
online feel free to type into the chat
window the Silicon Valley JavaFX user
group and then we'll be happy to take
questions or comments from the audience
online and then note about our sponsors
so thanks to Oracle for providing the
venue and the and the food and the
wonderful brownies I think we got
compliments on the brownies and also for
Jay frog because they pay for some of
our meetup fees and they also missing
IntelliJ gives us free licenses to give
out at the user group and line node does
some of the hosting for us
oh and parler is where we used to post
videos but I got lazy oops
all right Stefan I'll post this one in
five ways apologies all right so with
that I'll let Ryan take over and talk a
little about Java effects in html5 so
welcome okay thank you thanks Steve
I'm Ryan Cooper akka actually I work for
the so systems just out of curiosity how
many of you have heard of this oh okay
that's good we make software CATIA
SolidWorks so if you flew out here on a
plane or drove a car it was probably
designed using our software I actually
worked for a group that does chemical
formulation software so you've probably
used something today that was designed
with it whether it was a soap shampoo
over-the-counter drug etc so we actually
use it's actually written using Java
it's a desktop java application so it's
my interests in Java effects and desktop
Java so this presentation actually gave
at JavaOne and the genesis for the
presentation was many times I've heard
the question you know why Java effects
you know there's html5 wise Oracle
investing in Java effects what's what's
the purpose of Java effects going
forward in and desktop Java
so with that I'll dive into the
presentation the presentation tonight
I'm going to put I'm going to the first
part of the presentation I'm going to
put Java FX in html5 and perspective
going over the major features the
history of each and then finally doing a
technical comparison of both of them
then going into how to integrate both of
them together to actually make them work
together after basically ripping both of
them apart and then finally summarize so
Java effects in perspective so looking
back at the history of Java effects in
html5 html5 actually started initial
development on started around 2004
actually at the time XHTML was actually
thought to be the successor it was
already in development at that time so
html5 was actually something that
organically grew out it was not you know
a decision by a main body back in 2004
to actually decide to begin building or
designing html5 it the origins of html5
for instance the canvas in html5 came
out as a result of Apple and their
widget desktop thing that they wanted
they wanted to be able to put up that
I've heard the the widget thing where
you press the keyboard and have the
different JavaScript widgets so that's
actually what resulted in the initial
development of the canvas WebGL which is
not technically a part of html5 came
about as a result of somebody saying
well you know the canvas is cool but
what if we did what if we made it do 3d
so that's how WebGL came into into
existence so I would actually the
origins of html5 are for many different
places there's not one main designing
body that was driving the design of it
so 2004 specification development began
around 2006 w3c switch to HTML 5 from
XHTML and so there were a couple of
years there were some confusions for
XHTML versus HTML 5 and which way things
were going to go 2008 the first HTML 5
draft was published and then really it's
been within the past two years that
you've gotten
Hauser's that are actually capable and
support a large enough features of html5
that you can begin to use it JavaFX
actually has as we know as a slightly
different history it was first announced
at JavaOne in 2007 initially was at the
time pitched as being like a mobile
phone mobile phone technology it was a
separate download from Sun at the time
and also a separate language so in order
to work with JavaFX you had to download
it separately in a required learning a
separate language so it was finally with
the purchase of Sun by Oracle that Java
got folded into the main platform and I
like to think of Java FX - I was kind of
being 1.0 release with it being
rethought out and integrated into the
platform so they've been both kind of
developing in parallel with Java effects
having a newer history some common Java
effects misconceptions now this audience
ibly most of you are Java FX developers
how many of you are HTML 5 ok this is
usually usually when I'm giving this
presentation you know there's one Java
FX person and the rest are 80 ml 5 so so
some of the common Java FEX
misconceptions is that Java FX is it
relevant with the advent of html5 Java
on the desktop is dead that's definitely
not the case in fact to see a good
listing of desktop Java applications if
you go up to the NetBeans website there
is the NetBeans platform example
applications where they list probably 50
or more vertical applications written on
top of the NetBeans platform which are
all rich desktop applications doing many
interesting things such as you know
simulation programs for Boeing farming
applications all kinds of very
interesting things that are done on the
desktop the other misconception is that
Java effects in html5 are mutually
exclusive and I'll kind of touch upon
that later in the presentation
in fact JavaFX is support for html5 is a
reason to actually use java effects in
an existing swing application for
instance because Java FX does embrace
html5 Java does not have good graphics
performance there's definitely not true
with Java FX Java FX is for reach media
applications now
your traditional desktop application
which is using you know form-based type
application we are entering data and
everything so in the early pitching of
JavaFX there's a lot of the demos with
the globes with you know think you know
you know ten thousand movies on it
playing and everything like that which
to a standard business you know somebody
that's developing more of a spreadsheet
application goes well that's nice but
that's completely irrelevant what I'm
working on that's definitely not the
case Java effects and kind of tying into
that Java effects is meant for only
building games and mobile apps you can
actually build real business apps using
it and you know the final misconception
is that you never use Java effects in
the business application where it's
actually a pretty good fit for it JavaFX
versus swing
JavaFX hominis has actually been saved
at a conferences is a replacement for a
WT swing
unlike swing JavaFX is not built upon a
WT this is actually a favorite trick
question like to ask people as you know
a WT is not dead swing is actually built
on top of it so many of the limitations
that a WT has swing also has so a WT so
swing you know swing goes all the way
back to you know it's early history with
a WT so you know not much has actually
changed there so why replace swing
what's what's the purpose for replacing
swing with Java effects and if you've
worked with swing long enough you know
that there's a lot of it kind of looks
nice initially but then the further you
dig into it there's a lot of different
issues and problems with it there's
architectural limitations that prevent
graphics acceleration by graphics
acceleration I don't mean the the flags
that you can pass into the JVM for
turning on hardware acceleration there's
other things with like seeing graphs and
being able to do real graphics
incomplete look and fuel support if
you've ever tried to extend the look and
feel or change the look and feel of an
application to say you know provide a
custom look and feel for your
application it's an extreme amount of
work and there's many dead ends that
you'll discover where things you know or
just you know you can't actually get to
them or change them poor component
extensibility it lacks multi-touch
support presently and given the current
state of the swing AP I don't see how
you could ever get multi multi touch
support in there
you know and have it fully fully support
it wasn't designed for it and there's a
lot of historical baggage that prevents
evolution of it that's kind of been
incurred over the time and in terms of
and also just touching on the
architecture of it if you've tried to
extend as you know you're developing
custom components you'll discover in
many cases that classes that you need to
extend our package protected you know
there'll be one method that you actually
need to do to implement something and
there is no way you can get it unless
you copy the son code into another
package and then pull you know fifty
other classes with it to try to work
with it so there's a lot of you know
it's it looked night it's much better
than what was there before much better
than AWT but it never quite reached its
full potential so legacy technologies
JavaFX given the job of exports 3d and
media and everything there is quite a
bit of confusion because there was
previous attempts at you know java 3d
java advanced imaging and java media
framework all of these are dead and
they're not related to java effects so
java 3d is not the same thing as JavaFX
3d java media framework is not the same
thing as the media support that you have
in java effects so JavaFX unlike these
technologies is crop cross-platform the
features are available everywhere which
was not the case with some of the JM F
stuff where you know it was supported on
one platform but not the other platform
it was always one behind or you know
you'd have you know for for some
platforms you'd have native libraries
that we do acceleration but then other
ones would run in actual Java code
JavaFX unlike with you know taking JM F
into account Java effects include
support for common video and audio
formats finally so some of the key Java
FX features first of all it has retained
mode retain mode graphics it's a scene
uses a scene graph underneath the hood
the scene builder tool so finally we
have a standard tool for constructing
Java desktop applications you don't have
to work with you know use code yet you
know use an ID ID specific thing like a
tool specifically from IntelliJ or from
eclipse
they've also most recently open sourced
the scene builder so you can actually
check that code out and begin making
changes to it I've actually done that
some fun playing around with it I'm
looking at extending it because you can
use it to to build up you know like a
custom editor for your application using
that so you can finally do things like
that the other thing that it adds unlike
the GUI designers inside of NetBeans or
IntelliJ it doesn't generate code to
display your UI it actually has an XML
format finally it's an XML format that
describes the UI there's one of the
other major advantages or benefits of
drive effects
it's got 60 plus components out of the
box if you look at swing the core swing
library of components is maybe a dozen
or two and it hasn't changed since it
was first introduced there's really been
no additions to to the library of
components and then you in terms of
skinning components with look-and-feel
you don't have to you know subclass and
create a look and feel and deal with all
of that overhead you can use CSS for
skinning I'll touch upon this a little
bit in the presentation it also has
built-in support for animations so if
you're coming over from like iOS where
you have animation API Java effects does
have support for animation
it's got audio/video support which i've
touched on already it's got also has
multi-touch support so you can use the
pinching zooming and all the rest of it
and then it does have 3d tooling 3d
support and tooling support with 3d with
the most recent version of the same
builder tool so Java effects in
perspective one of the differentiating
features is the scene graph is at the
core of the API so if you were writing a
swing application and you wanted to
create you know we wanted to be able to
zoom in on part of the UI or you wanted
to have an animation where you animated
the widgets that was really hard to do
right you couldn't you know you couldn't
you know you were limited to if you
wanted to put in dim the screen real
imited to one glass paint on the screen
doing anything with fancy graphics
transitions you know making a component
you know expand in size or something
like that you really couldn't do that so
the UI widgets you know text fields
labels buttons are nodes just like any
other node so you know there's there's
really no difference you a widgets are
the
and as I mentioned they can be animated
transform filtered leverage etc so you
can create some of the nice you know
fancy snazzy you eyes like you see on
the iPhone with special effects so you
can easily write a banking application
that as you move through the wizard the
screen slides over you know it fades in
and out you know you throw up an error
messages the screen dims you don't have
to write all kinds of complex code so
many of the things that if you read the
old there's a good book on graphics
programming for swing the I forget the
name of it top of my head yeah filthy
rich clients so many of the things that
were covered in that book are much
easier to do with JavaFX now so it's
switching gears to html5 so some of the
major features of html5 and after I go
through these I'll compare this to Java
FX major features are the 2d canvas
WebGL which is the 3d graphics library
and believe it or not that's not
actually part of html5 that's not part
of the core standards so although
everybody throws it up out there as
being a part of it is not technically
part of it it also isn't supported on
all devices
so although html5 has great support on
iOS WebGL is not supported there Apple
wants you to use native code for doing
3d development css3 web fonts
transformations animations with CSS one
of the big features is WebSockets and
for doing finally socket programming so
I can have bi-directional communication
from the web browser back to the server
and the server can asynchronously send
events back to the back to the client
without having to do long polling or you
know polling of the server it finally
does html5 adds support for data storage
so you have access to the file system
local storage basically built in the
sequel database that you can use all
part of it and with html5 it's not page
centric like JSF or JSP or servlet so
html5 is not just a set of new tags it's
also a different way of developing web
applications there's this concept of a
single page application where you're
write your application resides in a
single page it's not something that
you're not
beginning from page to page so you can
actually if you go to the chrome store
you can actually download applications
that you install in a web browser that
or a mixture of JavaScript and HTML code
and that's the actual application and
actually stores data out it may after
you install it it may not actually have
any connection back to another server
can actually be a free-standing
application or a free-standing game so
that's one of the differentiating
features with html5 is this whole
concept of single page applications we
are not navigating between pages like
you would if you're writing a JSP or a
struts application so the application as
I mentioned is coded in JavaScript you
have with WebSockets you've got true
asynchronous communication with a server
and you may sell the application via an
app store like the Google Chrome store
many mobile apps are actually hybrid
applications so if you download like the
local news like many TV local news
station TV stations have an app that you
can install on your phone in many cases
those are apps are just a native shell
with an html5 you know content pane in
them and so that gets you the nice
little icon that you can click on the
launch screen and then it launches into
an application that's just an html5
application and so those are using
things like PhoneGap or Apache Cordova
to wrap up a html5 application and make
it look like it's a native application
however usually you can spot those
native application development still
dominates the mobile mobile phones are
well powerful or still not as powerful
as a two gigahertz I three devices are
also RAM limited and it kind of gets
into JavaScript where it does do garbage
where does provide garbage collection so
Android does support if you're
developing for iOS you're writing a
native objective-c code for Android
you're going to be working in C or C++
if you're not using their Java based
stuff so you can actually write C or C++
code using the NDK now in terms of html5
there are performance considerations in
fact Facebook every time somebody tells
me that you know html5 is the way of the
future face book pulled their html5
application and rewrote it as a native
application
oh you know html5 does have overhead
associated with it so you know it's not
you know if the application is
generating tons of garbage and the
garbage collector is running a lot
that's going to kill it's going to kill
battery of the phone actually and so I'm
going to hop into a technical comparison
now between the two so I'm going to look
at the features support the rendering
API is compare the multimedia support
look at the controls animation and also
comparison
looking at the 3d support in both WebGL
and JavaFX 3d and JavaFX 3d comes out
with the java 8 release in March so the
first thing I like to say every time I'm
making a comparison between Java FX and
html5 is that html5 is amorphous it has
a basic set of technologies SVG canvas
WebGL WebSockets web worker etc except
it has additional functionality is
provided by open source libraries and
generally there is an open source
library out there that can do just about
anything and the JavaScript libraries
are coming out practically every week
there's some new JavaScript library that
comes out that does something so if I
say Java html5 does not do X somebody
able to say well there was just the
JavaScript library that was released
last week or released yesterday that
does that so it's like you can't
actually say you know it can't do this
because there's there's a JavaScript
library that will you know talk to a
native code or something like that there
is something out there so you know you
have the major ones like jQuery 3j s and
tween J s between being an animation
library so if you say that you know
html5 doesn't have you know built-in
support for animation somebody will
point out you know 10 different
libraries that you know support that
have different ways of supporting
animation so it's almost impossible to
argue that html5 can't do X Java effects
however on the other hand is fixed it's
got a robust set of core features that
you're guaranteed to get with the
platform that are well tested and work
across multiple devices it is easier to
use developmentally because you've got
you know an integrated set you've got
the animation is integrated into the
core platform you've got the scene graph
we've got multimedia support so
everything it's an integrated package
and working with it it does have a
smaller ecosystem although it has 60
glass components that come with it by
default which is a lot when compared to
swing html5 there's you know everybody's
banging out different components you can
download all kinds of different things
going through the some of the jQuery
libraries so an overview of the html5
limitations so the biggest limitation
with html5 is the JavaScript language
we're left with many of the limitations
to the language that were as a result of
its original development timeline where
they were trying to get it in for
Netscape back in like 1994 1995 so you
know we're still you know language
really hasn't changed that much since
then so although it's the latest
language we're still stuck with
decisions that were made to meet a
Netscape release back in 95 so you have
challenges between different browsers so
each browser has different support or
behaves differently so you know the
thing that the old joke about travel was
right once to debug everywhere with
html5 it's write once and or write
listen sometimes write different code
for different browsers and debug on you
know 50 different you know versions of
different browsers you do have does lack
support for true concurrency so although
it does have concept of web workers that
is nowhere near as powerful as
concurrency support that you have in
Java so if you're trying if you're used
to working with code that a writing code
that's multi-threaded web worker is not
really going to more of like kind of a
toy when you look at it's still on my
pet peeves is it still doesn't have
timezone detection so you still don't
know when somebody visits your website
really what time zone they're in so that
you can appropriately localize you know
the display that the user is in so you
know you can tell them where that you
know if they uploaded the file you know
today that's why when you log into a lot
of web sites Alaska what time zone its
time zone you're in so they can put up a
display that renders correctly it does
have long release schedules so my
question is when's HTML 6 coming out and
what are the features in that and so
forth I mean we went from I think HTML 4
I'm not quite sure some of the different
versions got a little side trip into
XHTML and then XHTML 2 which never quite
got born and was killed and then xh then
HTML 5
and html5 the spec wasn't wasn't
actually solidified until a couple years
ago and they were kind of adding and
removing features so it was kind of a
spec that was in development so you know
the web browsers were out before the
spec wasn't even approved so I was like
you know when is when you know when is
HTML six coming out you still have
limited capabilities for interfacing
hardware if we're talking to like
accelerometers or stuff like that you
don't have that built into it tooling
challenges you were still are stuck
within within the web browser right
chrome has around so the developer tools
Safari has their own set of developer
tools etc and then you also have to I
guess the bigger things you have to
worry about patent and fridge
infringement and IP theft because if
you're writing an html5 application your
code your application is distributed as
plain text essentially so anybody can
download it reverse-engineer it try to
figure out how to hack it for instance
and they can also look at it to see if
you implement it and algorithm similar
to the way that they did right so if
it's a compiled application that's
really hard for somebody to try to
figure out whether you are infringing
upon their intellectual property whereas
with an html5 application you can look
at the source code and say hey that's
the same algorithm that I own a patent
and patent on right so it makes it much
easier to you know surf for you know
look for patent infringement so you know
especially with large vertical
applications it becomes more of a
concern now looking at Java effects
limitations there still is no smart
phone strategy although there has been
work at getting JavaFX on the iPhone and
Android it still is not an official
official port yet so you know if you're
writing a Java FX if you're targeting
mobile you're either going to end up
doing native Android native iOS or in
html5 we're using one of those libraries
that tries to bridge it and then dealing
with the limitations of both so it's
still you know it's one of the benefits
of Java so hopefully someday we'll get
that isn't is incomplete it's still
work-in-progress like I like to say Java
FX - oh I kind of considered to be the
first real release of Java FX its core
features are still dependent upon Oracle
resourcing so hopeful
oracles keeps their interest and pushing
JavaFX forward and investing it it's
missing feature is still it's missing
features that you get on some of the
native libraries and also to some degree
in html5 such as geolocation so there's
not an api to find out to request your
you know longitude and latitude device
orientation accelerometers camera
captured you don't have any of that
built in currently and then finally
another limitation is the perception
stemming from JavaFX 1.0 so it still has
this perception as being a language so a
lot of people that looked at JavaFX when
it first came out immediately wrote it
off like a lot of people that looked at
EJB too and even though we have EJB 3
out still think of EJB 2 and all of its
limitations so it's kind of limited by
this initial initial baggage so looking
at deployment strategies JavaFX you can
actually get JavaFX into the Mac App
Store and also the Microsoft App Store
html5 although I have it listed as
neither I was recently pointed out that
I think there is a Firefox plugin that
allows you to wrap up an html5
application and actually deploy it into
those stores I've not actually tried it
myself that so that's a little bit
misleading up there there is now as I
said before html5 is an amorphous target
if I say it can't do something there's
something that came out within the last
two weeks that did it so yes you can get
it into both of those app stores
JavaFX you still can't get into the
Android or iTunes store because it does
iTunes is native only and html5 you
can't get into those stores using things
like PhoneGap breakdown of the operating
systems that support on kind of more of
the same from the previous slide
obviously we've got Windows Mac OS 10
and Linux whereas html5 goes across all
of them and then looking at the features
html5 seats feature support break down
via browsers these are actually the
version numbers up here
I think Firefox is probably up to
version 50 now kind of joke so as you
can see WebGL right now is still not at
least was not supported in IE 9
so you know this is the support I like
to say with with html5 the browser
support has finally gotten good within
the last year or so that all the major
browsers have added support for it I've
got some more notes down at the bottom
the slide will be up on the web so you
can look at it take a look at it later
in terms of rendering html5 canvas is
equivalent to the 2d drawing service 2d
drawing surface it is similar to Java 2d
Mac OS 10 quartz and I like to pull this
one out to poke fun at at quick-draw
from 1984 on the Mac platform the first
time reading through the API for it I
thought you know Jesus is like you know
this is like this like reading the
documentation for the inside max I'm
like 92 html5 canvas is immediate mode
whereas JavaFX is retained mode and I'll
kind of get into that a little bit more
later why that's important html5 canvas
is similar to the eight JavaFX canvas so
there is circular you know for
functionality there is an immediate mode
canvas and JavaFX html5 canvas does not
support hit detection so if you're
trying to use that for drawing things
you're going to have to handle the hit
detection yourself in terms of lining up
rendering JavaFX
scene is the scene graph is roughly
equivalent to the html5 SVG support and
the JavaFX canvas which is the immediate
mode one's equivalent to the html5
canvas element so it's kind of how they
line up technically in terms of the
features and then looking at the 2d
support in JavaFX versus html5 is really
no difference between the two of them
the features the major features and
drawing capabilities basically line up
in terms of being able to create
rectangles drawing text compositing etc
so in terms of the 2d canvas of JavaFX
versus html5 the similarities are
immediate mode rendering and the API as
you saw in the previous slide is almost
an exact match
now with JavaFX the its immediate mode
canvas can participate in the scene
graph and also in JavaFX 3d so you can
kind of combine the two of them to to do
some interesting things and JavaFX also
supports SVG paths so if I'm when I was
trying to draw some things to animate a
little sailboat using Java effects you
know I'll create it using SVG I won't
try to actually draw using paths etc in
Java effects I'll actually generate SVG
output that'll then parse in my Java FX
application html5 lacks fill support for
arcs and polygons which Java FX does
have and then looking at feature
integration so this is kind of where the
scene graph comes in so with Java FX
it's all integrated with the scene graph
so your canvas your video your audio
your 3d they're all part of the scene
graph and they all that these features
work together so you can put a video on
a you know on a 3ds you know in a you
know sphere and rotated etc and it's all
done for you now over in html5 the
features are not integrated so the
canvas element is separate from the
video element there's no concept of like
a scene graph that you can apply
transformations together and have it
perform operations right so they're all
separate features so say you want to
have you know it you want to draw text
over a video that's playing on the
screen so you want to have some
JavaScript code that display some text
over a video that's playing so you're
going to actually have to do and there's
maybe another way of doing this since
there's always you know through you know
550 different ways to do something with
html5 and job and JavaScript you'll use
you know absolute positioning position
to canvas position the video element and
then draw the text right setting the
alpha channel if you put the canvas on
top of it you'd set it to be transparent
and then draw your text so you know
that's that's as opposed to using a
scene graph where you have different
nodes that handle the rendering for you
so the video in canvas are integrated
via you know the layout not be like a
scene graph
so this makes it much harder if you're
trying to you know develop an
application to integrate these different
technologies you're doing the
integration yourself now html5 if many
of you probably remember SVG which came
out in the early 2000s I was all excited
you know back in 2002 and then it kind
of drifted off and I kind of thought it
was dead well it's actually back html5
has kind of resurrected it so the first
version of SVG was released in 2001 SVG
2 came out and is targeted to come out
in 2014 August of this year so that's
when SVG 2 will finally be out it can be
compressed using gzip the browser
support is not robust ie ie 8 didn't
support SVG it doesn't or still doesn't
support SVG and some of the modules are
not fully supported by all of the web
browsers so SVG is the equivalent of the
scene graph in Java FX where you can
have nodes and draw stuff so multiple
and SVG you can actually leverage in
Java FX I'll kind of touch on that in a
couple of slides so multiple tools can
export to SVG so you have Adobe
Illustrator OmniGraffle professional
CorelDraw and also instant ink escape
which is an open source package that you
can use to generate graphics and it can
be nimble manipulated via JavaScript so
it's kind of like another it's so it's
kind of like another presentation from
it so if you're trying to do
vector-based graphics which is what you
get with JavaFX you use SVG and then
you'd manipulate it with javascript in
terms of control html5 and JavaScript
wheat of controls Java effects as I
mentioned before as 60-plus controls
html5 as as quite as a lot more controls
out there especially you factor in the
the third-party libraries now in terms
of binding with Java FX you have
built-in binding support with the
binding API where you combined you know
the properties and everything together
with html5 you don't have that and when
I pointed this out a couple of months
ago I immediately was pointed at this
library called knockout Jas which
supposedly is trying to do that so once
again you know I say
html5 doesn't do this and somebody
immediately points out a new JavaScript
library that does that html5 lacks a
windowing API so if you're trying to
develop an application that you know
throws up you know has like docking
panels that slides out and windows that
pop up in front of the things that's up
to you to actually do most of the
applications that implement it right now
if you've worked with it are using divs
and you know manipulating Z ordering a
couple years ago I tried to write a
complicated GUI application using just
HTML with divs and ended up it felt like
I was trying to re-implement the the JRE
you know handling Z ordering and trying
to do drag-and-drop myself and stuff
like that also HTML 5 lacs
there's no layout managers windows menu
toolbars you know things that kind of
take for granted you don't have those
things built in by default there's no
framework for extending browser controls
controls vary the appearance of controls
vary between web browsers and back to
the layout manager a bit so if you're
developing an application with rich
desktop applications you know the text
changes so if you're displaying Chinese
versus German there's going to be a big
difference you know the German word will
be you know 25 characters along with
Chinese word might be 2 characters long
with layout managers things dynamically
size so if you're doing with html5
you're going to have to handle that
yourself because you don't have anything
like the layout managers you have with
swing or with JavaFX to handle that
there's also no built-in support for
internationalization like you have in
the Java platform and the Java FX
controls as I mentioned before are in
the scene graph so you can perform
animations and other things with them
tables html5 still has no native grid
components like you know J table Excel
equivalent now that the table element
that you do have in html5 you can
actually implement using you can't use
drag and drop with that for instance so
you can't drag a row and drop it on
another row even with the support that
HTML does have for drag and drop so most
of the table packages that are out there
the open-source ones use a really
complicated set of div elements to try
to replicate a table
to render a table and so there's no you
know as of html5 there's still no native
grid component that you know can do
things like table cell joining with
drag-and-drop for instance so there's
quite a few of them out there with the
multitude of them yes yeah I'm talking
about I'm talking about html5 with with
it's there's no native grid support with
it so the the table the table element
really is not a data grid it doesn't
allow you can't implement things like
dragging and dropping of rows with it
really so some of the challenges you
know are merging cells you know copy and
pasting selections so if you try to you
know there's several different table
packages out there but you'll actually
have to you know compare the features of
them because one might support dragging
and dropping of just contiguous rolls
but not non contiguous roads or not
continuous rows that have merged cells
so it's very complicated and of actually
with JavaFX the version of JavaFX coming
out that actually in march of x-- JavaFX
8 they've actually you know they can
join table cells and do all kinds of you
know split cells etc so if all kinds of
support for dragging and dropping all
the rest of it which you don't have in
html5 now in terms of multimedia support
video audio codec support is actually
determined by patents with html5 with
JavaFX oracle has licensed many of the
formats for java effects so you have a
consistent set of formats available
html5 believe it or not supports no
audio video codecs by default that's up
to the web browsers to support the
different video audio codecs so that's
pretty much the reason why if you go to
cnn.com you know you you know they they
still use flash because otherwise you'd
have to have you know a version of the
great you know a version of the media
for this you know set of web browsers
and another version of it for this other
set of web browsers so dramatically
increase your costs of delivering video
JavaFX provides a known set of codecs it
is built upon an open source package
GStreamer so looking at the video codecs
applause
support matrix I'm not going to go over
this in detail but as you can see you
know chrome has probably the best
support for the html5 codex and some of
the other web browsers like Safari not
so well and then JavaFX supports those
set of codex on all of the platforms on
which it runs now looking at backing up
the video although you know the looking
at the video codec support html5
comparing the h2 the video controller
support between JavaFX and html5 html5
includes a controller for stopping and
playing you know for the buttons to play
video to stop video etc whereas JavaFX
does not include any controls by default
on it so you actually have to provide
your own play button wire that up to
play the video
neither technology currently can access
individual video frames so if you're
trying to write a multimedia application
you know that's like Final Cut you're
not going to be able to do that with
either Java FX or html5 because neither
of them can access individual video
frames ok then taking a look at audio
codec support once again we've got a
variety of different each one of the web
browsers has kind of a different take on
it so it's not uniform throughout JavaFX
finally does add a standard set of
codecs so you can reliably play audio so
if you remember back to the swing days
if you tried to play audio back then it
was always you know googling for this
little code snippet to try to do it in
dealing with the limited set of formats
that supported okay moving onto
animation html5 animation is primitive
now I know that there's libraries out
there and I'll touch on those but
basically animations support with html5
is this request next application frame
call back so you get called back in on a
interval to repaint the screen and it's
your responsibility to do all the rest
of it so unless you're using an external
javascript library you're going to have
to figure out you know what your frame
rate is going to be you're going to have
to handle that all of yourself and
you're also going to have to handle the
situation where you're running on the
device that doesn't support that and it
throttles you to say battery juice so
you must either use you know either
build a toolkit and/or use an
library like twing je s so JavaFX has an
animation framework built into the
platform all notes can be animated
including basic UI elements like I keep
mentioning and I think on the next slide
I have nope I don't I don't have the two
subclasses but there's two different
subclasses for animation for doing two
different types of animations but anyway
Java effects does have built-in
animation support now still not quite
there if you look at the iOS platform in
terms of on the on the flight out here I
was watching some videos on animation on
iOS where they now include a physics
framework so all the fancy iOS 7
features that you get were the screen
bounces that's actually now built into a
core animation library that they provide
for when you build your applications so
looking at JavaFX animation support it's
got a robust built in animation library
it leverages Java FX as binding
capabilities and you've got several
different subclasses for parallel
sequential you know sitting up key
frames time frames you know doing
transitions and if you're not you know
if you're trying to get if you're not
using a third-party library with
JavaScript you going to have to
implement all of this yourself so it's
going to be a substantial amount of work
and this is the html5 animation support
without a JavaScript library as you can
see depending upon you know what
browsers you're targeting you may have
to have basically kind of like a
polyfill to try to handle the different
web browsers now shooting gears to 3d
support Java FX 8 and html5 WebGL which
is not technical part of the standard
both support 3d Java FX 8 3d support is
built upon OpenGL direct3d it provides a
built-in scene graph for you so you
don't actually have to implement one
yourself it uses the Decorah DSL shader
language for working for for doing
shading although not actually written
any of that myself yet or tried using it
html5 Java FX webview does not
ok so I'll get to the html5 webview in
the second and JavaFX is 3d as we'll see
in a second is 3d without the heavy duty
overhead so how many of you have worked
with done
doing OpenGL programming or done OpenGL
programming okay so the history of WebGL
WebGL was initially developed by the
Khronos group or is maintained by the
Khronos group it's based upon OpenGL es2
oh the embedded form of OpenGL which is
used on iOS and Android the API is
fairly low-level so if you're going to
use WebGL to develop like a 3d game
you're either you're most likely you're
going to have to use one of the existing
libraries that are out there and I don't
have the code sample with me tonight but
with with WebGL you're given one
graphics primitive which is a triangle
which means if you want to draw a
cylinder you're going to have to
tessellate that yourself so in order to
get you know that first I had that the
code snippet initial I spent tons of
time trying to like you know go back to
like college graphics to try to try to
you know draw my my little cylinder that
I was trying to draw out the sat down
when I thinking okay I'm going to do
this as part of the demo demo the code
for drawing a simple cylinder and JavaFX
and I'll do it for for WebGL and like
after like eight hours it was like okay
this is like okay if I'm not trying to
use a graphics light you know you almost
have to use a graphics library and
literally the code went from here to
like you know where you're sitting right
there it was like you know four or five
pages worth of code just to get the
initial scene set up so it's extremely
basic so you're programming at an
extremely low level and depending upon
license what licenses your company you
know allows and everything you might
actually have to develop your own scene
graph right so if you're building a
large graphics application on top of
WebGL you know probably not going to
want to depend upon somebody else's
scene graph library that could come or
go away because the hasn't which library
is going to win hasn't quite shaken out
yet so as I mentioned before WebGL is
not supported in all web browsers ie
support has been lacking first version
that had it was ie 11 Safari still
requires that the user enabled WebGL so
you have to go up and turn go to the
developer menu to enable it and also
shaders are written in a C like language
which is a real joy to try to figure out
and you actually have to write your own
shader before you can get something
show up in WebGL so there's a pretty
height no that's pretty not not that I
saw there's a pretty high bar for doing
it so in comparing like three three Jas
is probably one of the leading libraries
right now for WebGL 3d support so
because I can compare it just directly
to WebGL so for light JavaFX has seven
WebGL three as two now this is from
several months ago so it could have
changed since then
built in shapes JavaFX as 25 WebGL 3 Jas
library has 4 as I mentioned WebGL with
no JavaScript libraries you only get
triangle meshes and there's also no
picking API currently JavaFX
is still a high level api so if you're
developing a CAD program or something
that's not not kind of a presentation
type thing you're probably going to you
know want to dive down into OpenGL
directly so there's things like jagneaux
already on the Java platform that allow
you to do that so if you're really
trying if you really do need to develop
your own scene graph and you know do all
the calculations yourself you can still
do that on the Java side JavaFX 3d does
not preclude you from doing that now
import formats Java FX supports there's
several different libraries out there
that you can use to import maiya colada
object
html5 has a custom JSON format and at
the time that was about all that I could
find on it so that that may or may not
be correct that in googling and trying
to research it because obviously you're
not going to create a 3d world
programmatically because it will take
you you know forever to do a rendering
of this room you're going to use a 3d
tool so though Java FX has a nice API
for doing a for for for building up
stuff programmatically you're probably
going to use another tool like mayor or
something like that to create your 3d
environment so one of the JavaFX
third-party importers
is interactive mesh which has a very
nice library for importing several
different formats including obj and STL
so for my demo this is actually a part
rendered in SolidWorks and actually I
can export stuff from SolidWorks to an
STL and then using that graphics
interactive mesh library on the previous
thing you can import it into JavaFX and
that's the NetBeans code right here look
at my mouse so it's a little hard to
read up on the screen right now okay
there's not most of this code is just
basically setting up the scene so you
know I set up my you know I use the
interactive mesh the interactive classes
to actually do the import so basically
in two lines of code I read in this
complicated thing which I think if I
remember it when I exported it it had
over 40,000 triangles on it when it
rendered and then it's just basically
setting up the scene and the light and
everything like that
and one of the nice things with JavaFX
tool actually it has a default light
source and everything for you so it's
very forgiving whereas WebGL if you
don't know what you're doing with WebGL
the first time you fire it up if you
didn't set up your light or your source
correctly your scene will just appear
blank or black
you'll be seeing they're going okay what
did I do wrong and there's no there's
nothing out there that says okay and on
those four pages of code you set up this
wrong so let me run this here in that
open source package actually has a
fairly nice demo application so my demo
here doesn't quite look as nice as
theirs oops on the other screen so
that's that's what it looks like by
default and I could easily wire this up
so it could rotate it I need to add some
shading to it and you know kind of
pretty it up right now but that's you
know you know that's basically all four
lines of code they're really doing that
importing this thing so you can render
something design something and say
SolidWorks import export it to an STL
file and then import it over here
okay so going back to slides so one of
the other things that's never really
discussed with html5 applications is how
do you tune them with HTML with Java you
have you know a lot of support for for
tuning finding out what's going on
inside of the Java garbage collector
right you've got companies like J
clarity that have tools that you know
will tell you if you're prematurely if
objects are being prematurely promoted
you know how do you have to you know
adjusting your perm gen space and all
kinds of all these other my rative
things that you can control set and look
at to try to find out what's going on
with your java application right you can
generate heap dumps and they'll look and
find out what objects are in memory and
who's referencing them with with
JavaScript you really don't have support
for that right so you know there are
tools out there in the web browser that
allow you to profile and everything else
but you don't have the same tooling
support that is consistent you know with
web browsers each web browser has its
own separate implementation of things so
it's much more challenging to try to you
know to figure out what's going on out
there with with the stuff and if you
follow some of the j-card has a pretty
interesting discussion list where they
onto like performance type things into
different people and performance
problems that they're trying to
troubleshoot I mean we look at that and
then look at what's available on the the
JavaScript side of things this is pretty
it's not be hard to write a real
application and try to figure out its
performance problems in fact there's
some other tutorials online that go over
how you are write JavaScript for mobile
web browsers for instance right there's
certain things that you want to you
don't want to do because it's hard for
the garbage JavaScript garbage collector
to predict what's going to happen so
that can collect stuff correctly so I
think one of the things I heard is that
jQuery is not or one of the things I had
read was that jQuery is not typically
the best thing for a mobile application
that there's certain problems with it so
this is just some best practices for
html5 for you know trying to
troubleshoot html5 problems where you
know you have to be careful because your
application is running in a web browser
with you know say flash running at the
same time you can be impacted
by other things that are going on on the
machine so I've kind of knocked both
technologies so let's look at how to
integrate both of them so I'll look at
CSS skinning for components the webview
for rendering html5 content and also SVG
rendering and the webview I have some
interesting code samples in there so
JavaFX uses CSS for skinning however you
know when I first pitch this at work I
said we can you know easily use the CSS
file from our website to skin or JavaFX
application and then you know I dug down
further into it and realize that that
was not the case and that I gotten a lot
of people excited about something that
wasn't exactly true so job FX does use
its own CSS attribute so if you have a
graphics designer have to relearn the
JavaFX ones drop FX CSS reader is not
fully compliant at least the last I read
and the properties don't support
animation so I have a button up here
Java FX a button that I rendered in Java
FX and one that I rendered in html5 and
I spent a tremendous amount of time
trying to get them to look the same I
can't tell you how much time because it
you know behaves differently from
different web browsers so I actually
went to a site and generated the button
so this is the code that was output and
as you can see you know it was there's
different things that use for different
web browsers right so if you then
subsequently try to go in and change the
button you're going to have to like
figure out how to do it for all the
different you know you have to either
keep that tool handy or you know how all
the different web browsers work so
that's the code for the html5 the JavaFX
skinning is a little bit easier to read
but it's not using the same elements as
the previous slide and it still doesn't
quite look the same there were some
things that were kind of hard to figure
out how to replicate so looking at the
properties we have our html5 property
our html5 value and then the JavaFX
property in the JavaFX value that was
used so you can kind of see that they
don't exactly line up between the
various between the the html5 and
JavaFX so although yes you use CSS for
skinning it's not the same CSS that
you're used to working on web
applications but it's still much easier
to use than the swing look-and-feel
architecture so the web view is one of
the big reasons to switch if you're
writing working with an existing swing
application is actually major reason to
try out JavaFX because it allows you to
integrate html5 content into your
application right so if you're just
trying to render like you know like a
layout like report or something like
that words we extremely time-consuming
to do it in java code to create this
custom report and you just want to work
with markup tags WebKit is definitely
the way to go it uses the it uses sorry
the webview uses WebKit which is the
same rendering engine as Safari and
chrome although Google has forked web
WebKit recently it is a fully functional
web browser in that you can render
cnn.com a Bay etc and it will look like
you have a little look like it appears
over in Chrome or in Safari so you can
you know develop your own basically web
browser if you wanted to build on top of
Java effects you can actually integrate
that into your application so people
would not even know that the screen that
they're looking at is is an html5 view
within your java application so you can
actually integrate like online help
easily into it the existing swing
control for rendering HTML I think oma
can render HTML from like 1997 was
pretty bad so like the media controls
for JavaFX it doesn't have any built-in
navigation control so you're going to
have to write your own you know controls
for control in history for going back
and forth so you get to control all that
it's either a benefit or a drawback
depending on how you look at it proxy
detection and configuration is
challenging so I work you know behind a
proxy firewall which uses authentication
in different ports it was kind of tricky
to get everything working initially and
then I have no idea how you actually get
a hold of like say the system settings
that the existing system is using like
what on a Windows platform Internet
Explorer is using for defaults I know
some applications can automatically
detect it and use it
and there's limited limited control of
page loading loading and monitoring so
in many cases if you're working behind a
proxy firewall the page will sit there
like it's not finished loading for a
long time right not quite sure exactly
what's going on with it so it's really
hard to figure out what's going on
sometimes in terms of you do have
support for bi-directional
communications with the webview so you
can actually have an html5 view that you
put into your java desktop application
that has JavaScript code that calls Java
code and you can have Java code that
calls JavaScript code so it allows you
to integrate the two of them of course
you wouldn't want to just allow any old
site to begin talking to your java
application because that could open up
some pretty serious security holes so in
this case here I've actually created a
I'm actually talking from Java code to
JavaScript code so I'm getting the
JavaScript objects from the web engine
and then you know basically calling
calling this object over there and then
this code right here I know this is kind
of a hidden API but this is actually or
from what I understand is a hidden API I
was quite excited when I figured this
out I had to dig through the NetBeans
codebase to find this so I was wondering
how are they debugging allowing you to
find out what's going on inside the the
the webview control and debug it there's
actually a JSON protocol to WebKit that
you can talk and send to bug messages
too and so that's what I'm actually
using right here so I'm setting up I'm
getting a hold of the debugger from the
webview and I'm sending over basically
JSON messages to it and there's actually
an API if you go up to the Google site
you can find the things or find a via
Gulu you can find this JSON API that
allows you to debug it so that is how
the debuggers are actually implemented
inside of Safari and Chrome as my
understanding is using this API to it so
you can actually build although the
method is deprecated up there so I'm not
quite exactly sure what's going to
happen with future releases of it you
can actually build up your own debugger
to debug it and this right here I'm
actually enabling console output because
when something doesn't go right with
your html5 page or just
Gmail page with webview you just get a
blank screen and you've got no console
output you got no you can't go up there
and click on console and find out what
happens so this block of code here if
you're trying to use the webview is
worth a lot to you right now for this
because this will allow you to get the
console output and find out what's going
on so every time your JavaScript calls
console dot log it will get printed out
this this call right here this isn't
that out will print what the JavaScript
code wrote out so this is this is worth
quite a bit in them one of my things is
to figure out that API a little bit more
and try to build up something on top of
it so the webview does enable hybrid
applications and allows you to integrate
web applications into the desktop
applications so you could actually have
an existing desktop application you
could integrate in an existing web
application into it and make it seamless
and if it's like say an internal
application with inside your company you
can have your java application calling
stuff in that application or you could
have that web application make calls
into your java application so for
instance you could have like say an
online help system that when the user
clicks on something you know show this
window it actually has JavaScript code
that tells you java application to do
something so there's quite a bit of
power power there in terms of being able
to do yes you know additional benefit to
what you just said is that you're just
writing to you know the webview rather
than trying to accommodate all your
browsers with all you know so it's a
stable platform for which to run your
html5 very predictable yep so yeah you
could do online help and not have to try
to launch you know get the default
browser on a Windows platform and launch
around the Mac platform err on the Linux
platform it allows you to use the same
online help throughout all of them and
allows you to integrate it where that
online help can actually affect your app
it can affect changes in your
application so it's not just a static
page that tells you what to do some of
the limitations actually try this out
because I wondered whether you know the
Geo html5 geolocation feature worked
with it and sadly no it does not I could
not use geolocation tags and get the
location using JavaScript
man because we since we lack that API in
Java I thought maybe I could use the
WebKit thing to get at it and then
unless you're using the API that that
hack with the debugger that I showed you
previously you can't set the user agent
so for things like robohelp that will
has explicit code in there looking at
the different web browsers and then when
it sees you know Java FX WebKit stuff it
says I have no idea what this is it will
render it so that's one thing that
hopefully will be addressed at some
point in the future is to be able to set
the user agent so you can fool other
tools now moving on to SVG support as I
mentioned you can actually leverage SVG
which is come back with the advent of
html5 to do rendering in Java effects so
you can export complicated graphics from
you know a tool like Adobe Illustrator
or OmniGraffle professional and then
render them in your Java FX application
because nobody's going to sit there and
write tons of code to create paths and
arcs and everything like that to draw
sailboat you want to go into a tool and
fiddle around with it and design it
right so this is actually taking you
know dicing up an existing SVG because
it doesn't read the SVG format although
it can render it in the web in the
WebKit I'm sorry in the webview
component can render SVG if you're
trying to get it into the scene graph
this allows you to import by by dicing
it up you can actually get this code
through sorry render the SVG as paths in
the scene graph right so by dicing it up
you can see how it converted the SVG
into you know a string that would render
within the JavaFX scene graph and
there's a couple of there's at least one
importer out there that tries to do this
somewhat so in conclusion html5 external
libraries are necessary to make html5
viable so as base set of features is
kind of you know the the WebGL stuff
requires you to you know write do you
know tessellate triangles in order to
draw a simple thing like a cylinder
you know binding of controls is not
there by default but there's all these
open source JavaScript libraries that
allow you to get there so as long as
your application
as long as you don't mind either
integrating tons of open-source
libraries in there and then supporting
them throughout the year so depending
upon if your application is one that you
know it will be around for four or five
years but if it has like a longer life
cycle like ten years you know that's a
little bit you know you're integrating a
lot of extra packages in there its
weaknesses still the core language and
feature integration between the
different features JavaFX
my opinion is well designed and
architected with you know excellent
feature integration it's not complete
there's still gaps in core features but
we're not you know we're only a couple
years into it and JavaFX to it was
really the first version I mean it's the
next logical step for desktop embedded
devices it is definitely the next
logical step to replace swing swing is
really old you can't develop the type of
applications that you see on an iPad
using swing I mean the amount of code
that you'd have to write to do that is
practically impossible and users
nowadays I mean there's still a lot of
reasons for writing desktop applications
and users expect those desktop
applications to behave like what they
see on you know their iPad or their
iPhone you know they want to see
transitions they want to be able to do
things like that Windows 8 has added
support for touch screens you know
you've got the multi-touch support on
the track pads on the Macs
that's what users expect nowadays so
swing definitely doesn't get you there
so that's you know a major reason for
JavaFX so major concerns with html5 one
is protecting IP I can't stress this one
enough that if you if you're dealing
with something that has potentially a
lot of you know that's doing some
complicated math or something like that
you do have to worry about protecting
your IP because anybody can go out there
and download your JavaScript library and
you know hack it I mean it seems a lot
of websites and you can go out there if
you're saying something from a website
go to somebody else's website and look
at the source so that's how they did it
right there's a lot I know there's a lot
of web development people that do that
we have you have to be concerned about
the longevity and stability the external
libraries you know that market still
hasn't quite shaken those out and where
they decide to go you may not may not
decide to go so if you built up a large
you know 3d video game using WebGL and
using one the open source libraries and
then they decide to change it which
breaks your game you know what do you do
browser support and tracking browser
releases
it's you know test on three different
browsers and you know 50 different
versions that are people are currently
using
JavaFX concern it's still missing mobile
support which is the main hole not see
there's always concerned about Oracle's
commitment to Java effects and the
technology is not fully developed yet
it's still evolving the tools are still
getting there really on the second
release of Java effects coming out with
Java FX 8 some slides some favorite
slides for you know for information one
is if you're looking for more
information on html5 and html5 code
there's this html5 rocks calm which is
probably one of the best sources for
information on html5 and realize that
most of stuff that you do up there you
can actually do inside of the webview in
Java effects so it's kind of fun if you
you know try playing around with you
know using that so we've got some
different you know Java FX tutorials FX
experience website then many different
articles and so that's it thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
