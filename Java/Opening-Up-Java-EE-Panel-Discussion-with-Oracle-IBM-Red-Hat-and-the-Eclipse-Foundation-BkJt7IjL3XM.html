coming
my name is will Lyons with Oracle and
I'm joined on our panel discussion with
by Mike Milankovitch from the Eclipse
Foundation
David Blevins from Tommy tribe at the
end marks little to my left from Ian
Robinson from IBM and we're the session
was originally entitled opening up Java
EE we've renamed it Eclipse Enterprise
for Java which is what we will be
talking about I'm the moderator I'm
gonna give a brief summary of this
project and then I'll pass it over to my
colleagues and then we'll take questions
in August
Oracle blogged about its intention to
evaluate moving Java EE technologies to
an open source foundation we approached
IBM in Red Hat on this and they
indicated their support of this
initiative we evaluated a number of
foundations and selected the Eclipse
Foundation to host this project and we
have recently taken the first step to
actually create an eclipse project which
will be which will receive all of
Oracle's Java EE 8 sources to form the
nucleus of a new project that the
Eclipse Foundation called Eclipse
Enterprise for Java Eclipse Enterprise
for Java is a project that will be
created at the Eclipse Foundation oracle
intends to contribute all of its Java EE
eight GlassFish sources to this project
together with other vendors like Red Hat
and IBM and Tommy tribe we hope to
recruit community sponsorship for
technologies that are that exist within
this project and we will also sponsor
the technologies ourselves so this is an
open project which is intended to
liver and a reference implementation
which is compatible with Java EE 8 and
can serve as the basis for evolving Java
EE technologies in the future we have
created an open discussion forum which
you can join that's indicated on this
slide to discuss the project and offer
any feedback you have our intent in
creating the process or this project is
to create a project which is more nimble
than what you've seen from Java EE in
past years we've received a lot of
feedback over the years that the
technology is not a evolving at a fast
enough pace to keep up with industry
changes we hope the EE forge a process
will be more nimble we intend to make
the project more flexible the software
will be available via an eclipse license
so readily distributable we will
open-source TC case so that they are
available for testing your own
implementations so it's much more
flexible from a licensing perspective
and it's more open in that it's a
community driven process we intend the
current Java EE or JCP process Oracle is
the primary vendor it's the spec lead
for the overall specification at EE 4j
we intend to create a more level playing
field where Oracle is only one of
multiple vendors and community sponsors
of the project just some details on the
project we intend to transition to the
EE 4j project early we hope next
calendar year by early next year we're
starting immediately GlassFish 5r Java
e8 reference implementations technology
compatibility kits and product
documentation we intend to create a
process for evolving existing specs and
creating new specifications and a
process for establishing compatible
implementations
we intend for the technology to evolve
we hope that technologies like micro
profile may be evaluated for inclusion
in this project and just a message to
Oracle's current licensees we intend to
support licensees or vendors producing
compatible Java EE eight independent
implementations so Java EE 8 will be
supported for its full lifecycle Oracle
itself intends to deliver a Java EE 8
implementation so we hope this will
provide a more nimble or more flexible
more open process and we'll begin by
implementing a compatible reference
implementation early next year and we've
got multiple vendors supporting the
initiative and we hope to create or
recruit community sponsors to create a
truly community driven platform so with
that we've had a the Eclipse Foundation
we've created a top-level Charter
document which is open for feedback at
this point I'd like to turn it over to
Mike Milankovitch Mike maybe you want to
introduce yourself and tell us more
about the project from your point of
view
thanks well yeah so for those who don't
know me I'm Mike Milankovitch I'm the
executive director of the Eclipse
Foundation the coop sound ation has been
around now for 13 and a half years and
we've been I think a mainstay in the
Java ecosystem and obviously we're
thrilled to welcome GlassFish in the
Java EE code base into the Eclipse
community and looking forward to
welcoming many of you to as active
participants in in the Eclipse community
as well so welcome and looking forward
to working with all of you so the draft
document that's up there is a top-level
project charter and I don't think it's
appropriate for us to go into sort of a
lesson on how projects work at the
Eclipse Foundation but suffice it to say
this is sort of the top-level governing
document for how the open source project
is going to be run
and so things there's if you drill down
into it there's things like you know how
do committers get elected and those
kinds of governance topics that some
people love to dive into and many people
just gloss over and use it as a good way
to make sure they fall asleep at night
when they're lying in bed I think the
important thing about this document is
that it represents a stepping stone to
making this a truly community lead
vendor-neutral exercise for innovating
in the enterprise Java space I think
that's really what we're all trying to
get to here
nimble is a great way to describe it but
it is also important to recognize that
this document is really only talking
about the process by which we're going
to be managing the code the source code
and so it's going to be about the the
source code and the tcks
that are coming over as open source to
eclipse anybody who's been following me
on Twitter or on my blog note that I've
said that the process of doing how we're
going to be doing specs going forward is
something that we're probably not even
going to start talking about for two or
three months perhaps even longer and
just so people understand why that's
true is we at Eclipse firmly believe
that well to coin a phrase code talks
and walks
right I mean this is an open source
project and the faster we can get this
thing boot strapped so that it is
functioning as an open source project
the fast the more the quicker we can get
back to actually talking about
innovation in Java and we want to help
this community get to that stage as
absolutely as quickly as we want as we
possibly can just one point of
clarification when Mike said he
wasn't actually specifically referring
to the specifications so no
yeah sorry that's that's not at all what
I meant what I meant is the faster we
can get - the faster we can get this
team back to coding the faster we can
actually start to demonstrate results to
the community and I think that's
ultimately what everybody wants to see
is they want us we are all here are
going to be judged ultimately by the
progress we show on making Java better
right ultimately that's what everybody
is a developer wants to see is they want
to see this platform moving forward in a
way that helps them do their job better
and I think so that's what we're trying
to get get to as quickly as we can and
then the second thing is I don't think
it's really been enough attention has
been given to the fact that Oracle is
going to be open sourcing the T CK's
right so for many for the in the entire
history of Java EE the T CK's have been
a very a control point a way that Oracle
has exercised control over this
ecosystem and by making those open
source I think that that's actually
that's actually a very fundamental
change to the dynamics of this ecosystem
and the fact that people are going to be
for the first time able to download and
run the tcks and see if their
implementations are compliant is going
to hopefully bring other players to this
to this table is be able to build
implementations without the sort of
pay-to-play kind of model that we had
before so those those two things getting
the open source projects in the source
code going as fast as we can I want to
be able to see people downloading
running code from eclipse.org websites
as soon as possible getting the tcks
over as quickly as possible those two
things are are what's going to be our
focus for the next little while
at some point in parallel we'll start
talking about what is the specification
process going to look like but we're a
little ways away from that so I guess my
message to you is we are going to be
going as hard as we can to make this an
open-source a successful open source
project
and this is a very large undertaking and
I thank you in advance for your trust
and patience as we move this forward and
with that I'll turn it over to David am
I supposed to say what not to Ramona the
question I forgot you might might want
to comment on the project sure effective
on it I guess that I would say that this
is a long time coming obviously right
and I think that I could have a couple
net perspectives on our ecosystem and
the sense that I think that our IP model
has slowed us down over the last several
years and this is going to be one of the
things that make us go quite a lot
faster because it encourages
contribution
quite honestly taking effectively
licensing away from the picture it does
remove a barrier
I know we're all technical people's so
we like to think of the technical
reasons why we're slow but that is an
actual reason that we don't really think
about on a regular basis so this is
gonna be one of the things that kind of
make us go a lot faster than we've gone
before we've seen in micro profile for
example with all of us together payara
and everybody here that we've picked up
pace very very quickly
I think that's shown kind of an example
of what our future can look like there's
been controversy over the name I guess I
have strong feelings that I like the
name Java but I also don't care too much
about the name of the band at this
moment I really just care about the
music and so I want to see what kind of
music we're gonna play and I think we
probably could play some pretty awesome
music when we get to that part and I'm
really looking forward to it to be
honest the access to the T CK's is one
of the biggest wins of this entire thing
you know even even us you know a little
Tommy tribe has had a hard time getting
access to the T CK's
and not because everyone's ill-will it's
just the way this the game set up but it
can be difficult you know Apache was
responsible for getting us a TCK they
eventually decided to stop signing the
agreement so there's no change in Oracle
side of the fence but Apache changed
their heart and then suddenly no TCK for
tummy and that was one of the reasons
why it took a really long time for each
seven to happen in Tommy not technical
reasons again again just just the
logistics of the way we've been playing
the game those barriers aren't going
away
so not only we're going to see things of
the existing players adopt stuff faster
but we're gonna see new players and I
think that that's one of the best things
about this whole thing seeing another
generation of EE implementations
regardless of what the e's stand for I
don't think it matters I'm gonna call it
EE forever I never really elongated it
in the first place I never really said
Enterprise Edition I don't have the time
or patience I guess so I'm really really
excited to see the new people that come
into the market you know that is one of
the things that we really need we have
you know kind of the young vendors
amongst us ourselves and payara but I
think we're gonna see a bunch more and
that's how you know when this thing is
gonna go much better for the next 10
years is when there's two three more
that show up and they may be run by just
one person at the time but you know
Tommy was one person at a time and now
we're a company so you know I I'm very
positive optimistic about the next
several years
there are definitely going to be
challenges but there's no gain if there
aren't challenges and so you know I have
things that I would like to see taken
care of things that I would hope to see
in the way we define specifications or
enforce them but at this moment I'm very
very optimistic about what we can do I
see far more advantages and
disadvantages awesome Ark Orion would
you like to make some comments yeah I
mean I echo pretty much what David has
been saying companies individuals and
various groups have been asking for this
for a long long time asking for Java to
be moved to an open standard process or
to an open source foundation so to
actually have that happen now I think I
was talking to these guys earlier this
time last year didn't think this was
gonna happen this was not something that
we actually thought was a realistic
possibility because we've been asking
for it in the JCP for instance for a
long long time and Oracle hadn't budged
an inch so then have it happen is a
great thing it's it's a it's a victory
for a lot of a lot of people groups and
vendors like I said but it's also a good
thing for Oracle I you know said it on
record before but I I'll say it again
you know I'd like to congratulate them
for having made that step because it
probably is the biggest thing to happen
to the extended java ecosystem since
open JDK and it's you know it's a big
announcement at JavaOne it's probably
not necessarily getting the level of
publicity I think it deserves but you
know we'll we'll wait and see in terms
of going forward I think that's you know
Java EE or e4j or EE or whatever it is
that you want to call it
for the next generation coming down
whatever it is that you want to call it
has got a great future as long as
everybody who is interested in it in the
past and in the present is willing to
commit to it for the future we often
forget or some segments of the industry
often forget that you know there are
there are a number of Java EE compliant
application servers out there they've
been around for a number of years
they're deployed very very widely it's
extremely successful as a technology and
then there are other Java technologies
that leverage those components within
Java EE or the application servers
themselves without necessarily always
paying the right level of due
acknowledgment I think to the underlying
technologies so everybody in some way I
think is dependent upon Java itself or
in its individual components so that's
why I like I said at the keynote I think
everybody should get together behind
this and really push it forward because
it's gonna succeed or fail not because
Oracle has open sourced it but because
Oracle IBM Red Hat Tommie tribe payara
and everybody in this room and beyond
get involved because if you don't that
is a little it's just gonna fail
so Mike asked me over a beer yesterday
well woody what's your criteria for
success for this project so what I think
is is that this time next year at
JavaOne we're still talking about the
enterprise Java platform we're talking
about what is done in eclipse and we're
talking about how bits of it are owned
by a much broader set of people when
when we were going through this sort of
the the early discovery process of what
it might mean for IBM who I work for
you know I what I got the things I
wanted I wanted greater ownership of the
technology
is amongst a wider distribution of
people paths which will be us so it's
like you know we can do more here we can
own more of the specifications in order
to have more influence over you know the
details of how these things evolve and
you know but we've got to do our bit
we've got a we we've got to put our
hands up
for some of these specifications some of
these technologies - at which point my
executive team went oh crap that's going
to cost something which of course it
will but you know what we want to be
able to do here is to take
responsibility for some of those things
but to get other people people that are
interested in the individual
technologies putting their hands up -
and spreading the love around a bit so
thank you all and at this point I think
we'll open it up for questions we had a
debate earlier about whether we needed
to seat ourselves with the questions so
we like to encourage you to ask some
questions that you may have yes
rethread once again
but the one thing that actually jumped
out to me is the term application server
learning
I really wonder if that's gonna get
broken
as we know
sir always myself
because every ology
I don't agree with that I'm open to the
skin yeah actually I think that's a
perfect example of oh I'm sorry yeah the
question is oh sure the solution the
question is the top level charter
includes reference to application server
I'll take responsibility for that just
tests are used in the document
application server as a tested meeting
the question is could we eliminate that
term from the top-level charter and in
effect to make it more use one time in
its place to represent a more flexible
definition and I I think that's a very
reasonable suggestion on everybody
so I mean suggested on the list and I
think that that's a perfectly reasonable
edit to make and sure no problem
let's make John Rock there we go there
we go I like this question from the
front next time so in Java EE 8 MVC was
removed from the list with the new
governance model could it be put back on
the list I mean I would say that once
the wants the project's up and running
it's down to the community where it goes
it really is not gonna be under the same
kind of governance as it was in the past
if the community decides they want to
put MVC back in why the hell would we
say no to that well the only thing I
would add to that is I don't think we
would put dead code back in if there was
a like a demonstrable functioning
project with people doing stuff then
yeah but that's you know that's the only
caveat I would get on that so I would
just say that MVC is currently the the
IP of Ivar Grimstad because it was
transferred from Oracle to him prior to
all the opening movements and he's
currently he has a panel this week a
session this week and in the session he
intends to ask the audience what should
we do with it should we go and also put
MVC into the Eclipse Foundation and so
if that's a topic that's near to your
heart I would say definitely go to Ivar
Grimm's dad's session on this because he
does intend to do whatever the world
wants despite the fact that he is
currently the sole despot owner he
doesn't really like that designation so
you know he wants to do right by the
technology so if you have an opinion
definitely express it one more question
what happens to the concept of profiles
profile and full profile yet so to beat
it to be determined because that's part
of the spec process so we haven't got
there yet I can just tell you that from
from my perspective one of the things
that
so my sort of going in assumption or
whatever is that we've made it far too
hard to create profiles in the past like
it was sort of a very big deal to be
able to create a profile and if you know
if a if there's a group of community
people that want to pull together
something that makes sense to them and
it's then I think we should be a lot
more open to those kinds of ideas and
try to inspire more innovation there's a
phrase I heard years ago that's really
stucked with with me that one of the
things that open-source does is enable
innovation through integration like a
lot of what happens in open sources
people putting together stuff that
hadn't been put together before in a
particular way and I think that that's
one path of innovation that we should
definitely be trying to support I would
just add as well I mean I was involved
mmm along with some of these guys when
we were defining the full profile and
the web profile you know the reason we
ended up with those with just those two
is cuz you know when you think about it
Java EE is done really well because of
portability and the ability to if you
really want to move move your
application from one implementation to
another if it says it's compliant so
profiles give you that surety that you
know at least you know if you've
developed an app that works on the web
profile for WebSphere it'll run on the
web profile for EAP so you know we want
we might want to do something a little
bit more flexible than profiles but we
absolutely need to maintain the
compatibility and the portability and
the interoperability aspects yeah and I
guess I would say as like someone who
has only a web profile implementation
and not a compliant full profile when I
would be absolutely on board with
maintaining that initial implementation
yeah yeah supports both profile and then
we'll take it from there
firstly I'm gonna go out on a limb and
say that maybe the people who invented
the name micro profile I don't know why
we call them things like maybe they
really so on the topic of profiles we've
seen some vendor
generate pretty much the runtime when
you build your applications things like
wild fly and open Liberty and I think
Pierre has something in the words like
you only bundle the Java aaps are you
going to use not so I think it would be
a good idea suggestion to standardize
this so that it can be done on any
application server or runtime or
whatever you want to call it instead of
you know being features so that some app
servers have like we have at the moment
it's kind of what we're doing a micro
profile okay oh yes and no so I think I
think having a Java EE always has had a
modular way of defining different
technologies but the way in which
wildfly or Liberty or PI R or anybody
else
Tommy tribe this determines that that's
how their runtime is going to provide a
means for an application to say I need
this this and this and this is how they
all get packaged together okay I don't
know I wouldn't be keen to standardize
down to it that's that's an
implementation detail in my mind well
let's see what the community wants yeah
yes going yeah I have an opinion about
that kind of level of modular I'm super
a big fan of basically uber jars with
all the stuff in one binary that you
ship I actually don't like modularity
and Tommy was based on the opposite
concept of modularity like all app
servers have typically been desktop and
thinking I gotta be able to swap out the
video card and a sound card and I need
to be able to upgrade my RAM and all
this kind of stuff and that leads to a
certain amount of weight in my opinion
that the weight justifies the modularity
and people asked for the modularity
because there's weight there and so with
Tommy we definitely went the opposite
direction deliberately and said let's
build a laptop and everything's wired
directly together so if there was a
modular spec we probably wouldn't
lamented but we were already like super
small and tiny and the things that would
make us faster have nothing to do with
the other things in the api's to have to
do with the fact that there's a
artificial barrier between the JVM and
the apps that run them in JVM such that
when we start up all of us we have to
scan the entire class path which means
iterating over all the jars listing all
the class files which is not a portable
thing to do by the way and then we got
to read them all in with like a SM look
for an annotation find all of the
needles in the haystack throw away the
hay and then boot the app server up and
that takes a long time and if we got rid
of that stuff this whole we would be
starting up in like you know 0.2 seconds
and no one would care about any
modularity at that moment like I can get
you down to a point one five seconds
they'd be like I don't care that means
they got more stuff to click on you're
not saving me anytime find another
problem to solve and I have a more
pragmatic reason why I wouldn't want to
start to start this thing off by talking
about modularity because the last thing
I want to do on the day one of
establishing a new community is reinvent
that jigsaw versus OSGi wars for two
years like I mean like is that really
what we want to start do first as much
fun as that is so you can like you know
write stuff on blogs forever and ever
and ever it's just not probably the most
constructive dessert it's a good job
that eclipse has got nothing to do those
[Laughter]
come on Mike out nothing nothing I'm
good so Mike I have a pragmatic question
for you you know for somebody that
that's in the JCB from the inside
the reality is running an organization
that can support a set of technologies a
large set of technologies like Java EE
requires a lot of funding you know
there's a little bit of infrastructure
that goes into it the Sun process you
know and there's a TCK running the TCK
itself there's evangelism and the like
so what's your answer to that is this is
probably the largest undertaking that
with all due respect it's probably one
of the largest undertaking that eclipse
has has started
what do you where do you expect the
funding to come from in order to
effectively run this I just I thought
will was writing a big jacket yeah it's
a personal bank account no that was
totally a joke make sure everybody
totally a joke so that's a really good
question and you're absolutely right
this is a massive undertaking to do
right there's ultimately the Eclipse
Foundation is a member supported
organization and I think one of the
things that we're gonna have to really
focus on over the next little while is
to make sure that this is sustainable so
we're gonna have to go out there and
recruit a whole bunch of new members and
and you know look at other sources of
revenue as well but that's um you know
you're right there's no way that the
co-found a ssin has the resources at the
moment to do this without with zero
incremental revenue let's like the
eclipse on Dacian is a not-for-profit
we've been managing this organization
for 13 and a half years where the goal
is every year the number at the bottom
is zero right so we're a lean
organization it's not like we got like
18 million dollars sitting in a bank
account somewhere so we're gonna need
the support of the community and and one
of the things that's so for the people
that are in the room I mean people have
been talking about
Java needs to be more free for a lot of
years and your your companies are the
places where you work are companies that
are relying upon this platform and upon
this ecosystem and so we're gonna be
like knocking on doors looking for your
support to make this a long-term
sustainable solution for making job
keeping Java free I would just add that
I one of the statements that I made in
the keynote which i think is valid is
that by and large the majority the the
largest investment in EE has been on the
consumer side if you total up the number
of hours that are all teams spend
rolling out upgrading learning
developing writing EE it's so much
larger than what the vendors put in by
comparison and opening up the tcks and
things like that for everyone who has a
stake in EE to contribute even a little
bit it does this whole movement does
open the doors to a very significant
source of investment which is the world
that uses EE so if we understand our
responsibility and we approach it
accordingly we're all gonna have
something that lasts for a very very
long time
and it's gonna have an even greater
amount of portability than we've ever
seen it's been the kind of standard case
where if you had an app that was
supposed to work on three vendors a
bunch of the functionality will work on
all three but some of them will only
work on two and when the third one won't
work and your current status is that you
just have to well either decide not to
use that third vendor or support it or
not use that feature so you can stay on
all three and with the path going
forward what you would do is you'd go
straight to the TCK and the open source
project that eclipse you would find the
test or where the test should be and you
would add it and then you would go knock
on the third vendor and say hey you know
maybe you want to work that one out
and you could do that openly in the
public you wouldn't need a support
contract you would just say hey that's
probably in your best interest to pass
that test and this is an example of you
being in the driver's seat and making a
very small investment in portability
everybody's very small investments and
portability can add up to mean a very
massive investment overall so I think we
need to understand that we are part of
this whole ecosystem and opening up of
these things is only magic if we
actually leverage it other questions
I'll just make a comment on what's been
discussed here I I work with Fujitsu is
a major corporate entity and may we have
major applications that are based on the
EE and we have a lot of revenue that
comes to us because of that but we're a
vendor who is not a member of eclipse at
the present time and because of this
move we are seriously considering
becoming a member of Eclipse and I
suspect that there are a lot of other
vendors who are major who have major
products and and revenue that comes
because of the e product they're gonna
be thinking the same way yeah we became
a member of the club's this last year
after the creation of micro profile as
did payara and basically everybody who
had anything to do with that and yeah
well so it's you know that that's been
part of the we've been a little small
part your growth Mike yeah I think it's
it's very very much appreciated maybe
it's more a comment than a question but
the I mean in companies people who are
deciding that such and such project and
such team are going to use Java EE
against other alternative around not
necessarily technical people not
necessarily very we're aware of what the
Eclipse Foundation is what open source
is maybe well probably that I know at
least have a little idea on this topic
and those people will rely more on
communication and impressions they have
then on real facts on what's going on
inside the Eclipse Foundation in the
transition the feeling I have so far is
that they are they are seeing a
situation that is in stable or I called
used to be in charge not in charge
anymore or I call worth supporting with
people and money and probably less
supportive with people on money now so
this is the this is the situation as a
situation of instability and if they do
not have a clear communication in the
upcoming month probably three six months
it's probably too much then they might
bail out from Java EE and deciding to
use other technologies to achieve the
same result in their application and
those people may may be in charge of
teams of developer in the order of the
thousands so it might be a period really
critical to get some clear communication
to with them to see that to show them
that they are indeed people in charge
even if the governance of the EE foj
stuff is not completely stable at least
that it is going to be stable in the
next month or so and people and that
things are still going to to move
forward to innovation and thing like
that so well do you have a communication
plan first of all we will can for those
customers who like to rely on the
existing Java EE standard we at Oracle
we're supporting a Java EE 7
implementation we just released Java EE
8 through the Java community process
Oracle plans to deliver a Java EE eight
compliant commercial implementation
WebLogic server and that will be
supported for many years so there is a
long path forward for those customers
but all that said I think your point is
well-taken
we have been very open about this
process we're trying to communicate
openly and we do want to move quickly
you know as Mike said earlier to get
sources into the project to show that
it's real to recruit recruit community
support for it so our hope is we can
just move this project forward very
quickly just a comment on that we have a
milestone coming up
on October 23rd we hope to ratify this
top-level charter that we've published
here so if you have comments on that
please get those comments in right away
we need to keep moving on this project
once the Charter is ratified we can
begin to actually open real projects at
Eclipse into which we can contribute
source code to start making this project
real so I just wanted to alert everybody
that there's a milestone coming up on
October 23rd to finalize this document
and take the next step in implementing
this project yet the only thing I'd add
to that is just in case anybody's
wondering just because the by ratified
it means the cliff's Foundation Board of
Directors is going to vote to approve it
to establish that new top-level project
that doesn't mean that we can't go back
a month later or six months later or a
year later to revise it we do consider
these to be living documents and as the
circumstances change that we're you know
we're perfectly happy to have them to
have them modified so it's not like it's
whatever gets you know ratified on
October 23rd is the last and final say
forever and ever this is these are not
on stone tablets coming down from the
mountain and the only other thing you
have sort of on the question what I'm
what I'm personally what I hope
especially the like all the vendors that
are up here with me do is go to their
Java EE customers today and say look
this is a good thing for Java EE and
here's why we think it's a good thing
and I think even but even more
importantly you customers are now in a
position where you can engage directly
with the upstream project that you're
going to be relying upon and we want you
to do that we want you to engage in the
open source project we want you to
engage in the to be defined
specification process and we want you to
support the Eclipse Foundation as the
long-term sustainable home for this for
this code in this project and can I'm
talking to our customers you know
speaking as an IBM websphere going
obviously exactly what we're going to be
doing but I think the proof of the
pudding you know the thing that is going
to make that the thing that's going to
convince people is when new technologies
are completed in foj and platforms that
have either historically supported java
re' in the past or new ones that may
find that they have a better opportunity
to do so in the future actually start
implementing that and providing support
for those things in production which
comes back to the question that Mike
asked me yesterday which was what was my
criteria for success it is going to be
that so for me personally it is going to
be new things being defined in open EE
delivered and supported by IBM in
websphere and by the way in 15 minutes
time we're going to be talking about
Open Liberty in room 2006
please go okay last question
probably jumping the gun in a bit but
for like Eclipse workbench and the
release train model there's the core
train all sub projects that wish to be a
part of the Train released together it's
a set clock work function you can pretty
much bank on the release date every year
do you anticipate EE will follow that
model in terms of core definitions core
projects train of sub projects and use
that as a way to both continues a
stair-step model of evolution and
bringing related technologies in I'll
first start off by saying that we were
very flattered that the Java platform
started to emulate the release train
process twelve years after we showed
them that it could be done so you know
flattery is the your imitation is the
highest form of flattery you know so but
ultimately that that question is for the
community to decide this is not
something the Eclipse Foundation has not
and will never mandate to projects that
they must join a release train that's
not that's that's never been how we roll
and it never will be how we roll that
again but that said the if I could the
maturity of process that we have at the
Eclipse Foundation that we've
demonstrated by a book being able to hit
a date with a major software release for
12 years in a row is I believe one of
the reasons why the Eclipse Foundation
was chosen as as the home so it's so
we're not going to tell anybody what to
do what we are going to do is promise
that once the community decides that
they need the Eclipse Foundation to
support them in a particular goal we are
going to do our very very best to help
them make that a reality I would say one
thing that applies to that and maybe the
comment is as I made earlier which is
there's a tendency in times of great
change for people to buckle down and
wait and see this is the wrong time to
buckle down and wait and see
if in a time of great change we all do
nothing and wait for the outcome the
outcome is going to be nothing so now is
the time for us to get involved in these
conversations and if we want something
about EE to happen now is the time for
us to speak up and shape it because
everything's malleable the piece of
paper is white we can write on whatever
we want on it and so if you have things
that you've been wanting out of EE stand
in line get on the list and start
writing them down and that's going to be
what we do for the next couple years we
can always change it mutate it but
absolutely resist the urge to wait and
see do get involved now I've just add so
RedHat very very supportive of this but
we didn't get involved to help Oracle do
this to get to a process that only
releases Evo j9 let's say after three
years okay
it's got to be released a lot quicker
than that okay I think we're at the end
of our time please search for Eclipse
Enterprise for Java join the mailing
list give us your feedback be patient
with us as we get this project moving we
appreciate and request your support and
thank you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
