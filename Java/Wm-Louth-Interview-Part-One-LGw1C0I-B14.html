technology Network we're here at javaone
India speaking to members of the java
community I've got William louse with me
here hey why am i how are you doing good
lower good so tell me your role in the
java community well I'm I'm CEO of a
company called J inspired and we do
application performance monitoring and
management and I mainly myself my job is
to to research into new technologies
that will help make systems more
self-managed self self regulated so I'm
more focused on that and I'm quite a
large scale so we have questions from
with tells us of JPM's and they want a
solution that can manage it we feel our
view is that this kind of management has
to be put directly into the applications
rather than something external so that's
a we're looking at adaptiveness that
goes beyond above what the hot spot does
the day so the JVM is a very adaptive
engine for our view is that the
adaptiveness has to move up into the
application tier and that's what we're
focused on its research well hopefully
the usage will be soon ok so tell me I I
know you were accused of blowing a few
people's minds today right as a part of
your session so tell me about the title
year session ok generally what it's
about yeah so the first I had two
sessions today and the first one was
signals and boundaries and this this
session was focus on how can we create a
mechanism that would allow the machine
to learn about itself today what happens
is when we measure a solution is an
application is monitoring itself has a
metric and it publishes the metric and
some other management tool is collecting
that metric in storing it in a database
the problem is that the application
could probably use that data to help
change its own behavior so what we're
trying to do is create a feedback loop
that doesn't just notify observers but
notifies itself so take the example like
a typical web where a web application
goes to a database to make a request
servicing a you know
proquest and the database is not there
and it shows an sqlexception the
exception goes back up to the requests
and the next one comes back in and the
application will do the same behavior
consistently until the database comes
back oh now humans wouldn't do that
because we would probably say well the
database is probably not there I'm
probably going to wait a little bit
longer before doing that but software
has no memory and it has no means to
control its behavior so we're looking so
the signal ISM and and boundaries today
was how can we make the head can we
bring intelligence into the application
that's not that goes beyond the
algorithm itself but the goals of beyond
what do i do how do I do it how do I
evaluate so intelligence about looking
at your past behavior assessing it and
changing your future behavior this is
how we feel intelligence like you're
smart because you had passed bad
experiences and he looks matter so what
we're trying to do is make the
application so signals and boundaries
was was about that and how we can
augment the Java platform libraries to
bring signals in the signals is kind of
like is is basically a kind of a name
and a number one like a way we call it
like a wave and what we want to do is if
you take light first for example is we
color it's not something that's there
which is a wave you know electromagnetic
wave comes over and our eyes interpreter
enter and turn it into a color so what
we want to do what we view is that same
kind of approach can be used for
applications where the applications and
the libraries have a signal since item
internal the names and they said and
they emit them so today when we write
Java code and we call a method there's
one return value it's the result of the
function if we talk about function of
course you can have a procedure that
doesn't do anything you know it does
something but doesn't return but what we
miss is that like if we were having
signals in humans when you talk to
someone you're reading you're looking at
their whether they're interested and you
probably stop talking when they're not
interested even though the interaction
is still there so we are adapting to
those signals which are beyond just the
words themselves but javed or most
programming languages don't have this
means to communicate
this okay I did this but really duck
took longer because it is or that was a
slow way I had to go a slow away because
of this some data structure or some
context like if we talk about hashmap
hashmap has a function called gets will
you give it a key and it returns the
value now to do that has to turn that
into our hash code takes your key turns
into a hash code looks a bit a table
kind of index and then on that there's a
kind of a linked list and it scans along
it now occasionally of course what you
want is that it always hits the force
entry and matches it but what happens if
all the keys are hitting the same book
it and we scan all the way down and it
takes 1 1,000,000 times to compare well
the reason the hashmap get was slow was
because it's scanned but when it returns
to body it doesn't tell us that we can
unless of course what we could do is we
could measure it but if we measure it
then we perturb the response for all the
other calls which are normal so because
hashmap get is a quite a quick fun air
call so you wouldn't want to measure it
at the time in measuring it would be
greater than the time of doing it but
there were these occasional times when
it does happen so what if we want the
software is the hashmap in Java to have
a signal that emits that says I did a
link scan and I did this amount us of
comparison no it won't change what's
returned but it's assume if the caller
is observe air signal aware he can check
the signals and say what did what what
would the signals emitted during that
interaction and and you can compare
those signals with normal operation and
one of those signals will go off on it
and that's a wavelength so the kind of
so think about the spectrum of colors I
will see a different color and I
stronger your you know a stronger hue or
yeah and so I be able to say okay every
time I it goes a bit slower it's because
at this particular signal so that's what
my mind will do so an observer is work
associating the signals to colors so I
want this all code to be able to observe
other codes that is executed when it
delegates it and then sent in to take
those signals and turn them into
something that says I'm going to learn
from that now of course the first part
is ok it would learn at least what
happened that's one but that's not
really changing you know that's not
changing a system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
