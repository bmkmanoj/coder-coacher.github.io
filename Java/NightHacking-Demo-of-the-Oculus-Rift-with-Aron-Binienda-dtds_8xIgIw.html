with aaron vienen pin yonder pinion oh
yeah and we are doing a between night
hacking session interview on the oculus
rifts this is like a surprise extra when
we added to the schedule but I think
it's going to be a lot of fun so tell me
Aaron tell me a little bit about kind of
how you got involved playing around with
the oculus rift and what you've been
doing with it ok so I'm a computer
science engineer by trade and I studied
until December last year and I was
always very excited about the
possibilities of virtuality technology
and that was also the reason why I
studied computer science but why i
started i wasn't really like the
university couldn't provide what i
really wanted out of the technology and
and the tech just wasn't there and then
in the year 2012 oculus rift that sounds
like the name of a movie there ok all
right keep going so in 2012 oculus we
are at the company they they started
with the Kickstarter and they got like
2.5 million dollars and then they
started to produce this virtual reality
headset that we see here and this is a
development that they introduced last
year and so when I when I saw that this
was emerging I I really thought okay
this is the time where which raiatea
really comes to pass and it's going to
change the world and I want to be one of
the persons who change the world the air
your your innovator your entrepreneur
you could say that that's that's that's
the goal yeah and so I decided to get
one for myself and start developing for
it and I also by these little honeys the
razer hydra motion controller yeah
you're telling me about is you know
these will pick up a motion and also
give you like joystick like yeah
controls serve virtual environment so
you have the possibility to like check
your hands one to one
and you can map that into the word and
to avatar hands and then manipulate the
world around you cool and this is also
what I wanted to show you today so I
have with me a demo it's not by me it's
from oculus and six cents the producers
of this hardware pieces and yeah I will
show it to you so okay so I'm gonna put
your screen up here so this is a view of
what you're seeing through the rift
exactly so this is say yes one screen
it's a smartphone screen basically and
we have like this to view points for
both eyes and there's a slight
difference between the two eyes so you
have like a disparity and you can see in
3d and now when I look around sensors
pick up where I look and the computer
just changes the image according to
where I'm looking at and now I have the
feeling that I'm standing in this little
villa in Tuscany and now I can take my
controllers and I will calibrate them
and now i have my virtual avatar hands
yeah that's awkward we okay here your
virtual hands but you had no very arms
to match the so the hands are moving
like disembodied hands yeah yeah they're
disembodied hands so I could basically
clip and make a fist and stuff and so
now I can like move around and I see
okay this would I can take it and throw
it into the fire okay yeah real life
well anything like it's only get a
meatball yardage and fire and burning
things ok so my actual environment ok so
I see my um yeah my right hands vanished
this is awkward and now I can't move so
i will probably have to restart the
whole thing ah ok ok just losing your
hand ok let's always if you want to show
something then it's not out there you go
again you go ahead so so I can go around
and everything has the right size and
feel so I mean I mean I can look up and
I see okay there's the ceiling it's like
three meters high and I really get a
feeling for the distance so like I would
be like like a mere well like I'm really
there and so now I can take like a book
and go to the fire more burning set you
little bit higher and now i'm going for
walk uh-uh your book is gonna marry that
it's gone but yeah ok let's look real
life again so ah ok so the fire is out
egg bread of applause for firefighter
with oculus rift and now i can show you
my superhuman strength clay i take this
thing here in the barrel and i can throw
it away like a few meters and there's
reality again so I I mean I can't see
what's in reality and full of me so
Chuck Chuck all right ok right yeah
nobody duct and so I mean this is this
is a basic demo it's it has low
resolution the screen isn't that great
and I mean it the latency is like a
little bit too high but but we make this
sort of technology is going to really
change the way we do definitely paying
or what's your what's your company run
is it or our gaming or work or what sort
of applications do you see people using
this for so so initially we wanted to
start in the
a non-gaming sector but then we
reevaluate the the technology that's
really there Anna we decided probably we
will start with the game because I mean
the plot the potential is great and
there will be better hardware and stuff
but for what we wanted to do it's it's
really not there yeah and so I mean the
resolution has to get better and the the
controls Africa I mean these these
things that track my hands they don't
even produce them anymore and there's
there are new system on the way but
their cause like a few hundred dollars
and you couldn't expect that everyone
who buys these glasses for free on a
dollar that they will spend four hundred
dollar for controllers yeah but I mean
freaks like me would do that but I think
the average consumer wouldn't do that so
we have to wait like a few years to
really expect that the average person
has these things okay the ball is gone
yes and we do something really wrong
yeah it's it's gone I don't know all
right wider than the wall I mean I mean
you could really imagine in the future
you have you have a thing like this on
your head and you can have like your
virtual workspace with you and open like
a few less microgreens like use the
browser and here's my program will write
your media teams are usually I don't
know you two bases something for
interactions yeah yeah and that's that's
a nice scenery there yeah and when you
were really contract your your fingers
with high fidelity and you can really
like beautifully interact like in the
Iron Man movies you could see that this
is going to change some things yeah all
right hey so thank you very much for
the short interview on the night hacking
stage here at Java lands how can folks
find out more about the the work you're
doing with the oculus rift and you know
how to maybe like get hacking on their
own okay so i'm from germany and i can
tell you go on the german page it's
called blocker loose d and there you get
always the the news grr grr alt and if
you want to know more about me then at
my twitter handle at alba yonder and
yeah and we'll put those in the in the
show notes for the video recording here
and then for folks who are here at java
land i think you're set up in a table
right over there with your cadets what
everyone can get to the table and get
the little give it out i see see if they
can if they can save the book from
burning down as well exactly and i also
have a butch roller coaster oh that's
appropriate for java lens yeah alright
so thanks very much Aaron you're welcome
appreciate it give a round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
