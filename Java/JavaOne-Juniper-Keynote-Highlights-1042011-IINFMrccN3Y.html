and I'm up here representing the
Internet itself you're optimizing for
experience I'm optimizing to connect
everybody to everything there's critical
information that a lot of systems groups
are trying to do about the application
but what's interesting is that there's
an extreme amount of information all the
way down to the capabilities of lambdas
or wavelengths inside fibers that you
can use to build a better experience for
application so how to ensure the best
experience for our users so first of all
it's really realizing that there's four
actors involved in this particular
equation there's the end user who knows
what they're trying to do and the rest
of the system as far as they're
concerned maybe just to get out of the
way second and third as related are the
application they're trying to do and
again this can be any of the enterprise
applications that you're building
working on the Oracle database tools or
any other application that might be
underway and then the last one of course
is the network and the network is going
to tie all of these things together and
so it's the relationship of these four
elements that is going to move us to the
next level of building experience out of
our applications in interaction the
application world has a number of new
touch points and interfaces that it can
use to directly program the network next
the network now has a number of new
api's that are available to actually
extract directo pelagic information
location of content carrying application
information in routing protocols that
flood to each node without breaking the
internet so now an application can bias
which cache which server which database
which bit of storage it's going to use
based up on proximity to it on the
internet that proximity can be not only
shortest path via router nodes which is
moderately entertaining but what's most
entertaining is if you add in the extent
that we've made to include delay
utilization of that path jitter of that
path and so now again you can stay away
from going halfway around the planet if
that was currently the way the internet
wanted to route you your application
would program the internet to take a
different loop loop free path through
the internet to get to the exact service
that you wanted to the more you know
about what's going on below those
development platforms on how they're
interacting with a network you're going
to be able to do more than just get an
IP address or get a domain name which is
what you might be able to do with the
current language that we're working with
and instead program in program that
notes themselves get topology get delay
get utilization and program qos profiles
for your application the key thing to
remember is that the development
platform you choose for the type of
application you want to build one
hundred percent defines the customer
base and direct market that your
application has access to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
