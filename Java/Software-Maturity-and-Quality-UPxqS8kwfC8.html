directly from the TDC vent in some Paulo
Brazil for tonight hacking interviews so
like to thank Steve in your land and
especially the otn guys for allowing us
to be here interviewing cool stuff koku
people here at the TDC vent right and we
have a speaker at the devops track so
the TDC has lots of different tracks one
cool track that we have today i'm one of
the coordinators with Luciano and adds
menahga and one of these speakers we had
at the track today is a bruno tinoco so
hi Bruno high high Burrell oh my you
have you have a very nice name Bruno
yeah you also have yeah I know ok so
Bruno you know you gave a talk today
about a continuous integration and
ranking yeah but really domains the main
thing that you like it most is about
software quality Yeah right so you know
a lot of developers out there think that
you can just write the code anywhere and
it's running as soon as solving problem
it's okay but why quality is important
equality important because our clients
are wishing to deliver and software
earlier Yeah right it's not easy to
deliver software you know that without
any kind of automation any kind of to
stewie it's pretty hard very hard to do
that you know guys I remember that all
times that we are used to code on our
machines we generate our softer when we
deploy that in somewhere else it's you
know that the result is bugs and users
complaining you know and then you always
forget something yeah library forgot
your age yeah normal you know sometimes
you get you're in a good mood sometimes
not yeah yeah yeah that little
configuration the application server
that you have your element you forgotten
production on just one line one one
little piece broke it off right yes yes
that that's the thing important about
the software
let's say continuous integration yeah
the political integration most of you
guys know that's a really important step
in the process of software development
cycle right right yeah it seemed pretty
important to know to know that the
entire process in order to build good
quality software so so without the the
the help of good tools to allow it to
automate all this process it's really
hard to deliver good software so in my I
wasn't on one of the panelists about the
the Jenkins continuous integration so I
I did some Paul they're asking some some
guys about how have you guys how many
you use continuous integration software
to do that some of them raise the rent i
am using that but it's it's interesting
to note notice that aspire to be using
some important automation tuesday is to
have leg and a delay in delivering
actually the real softy today and users
right there is a a time frame a window
that could be more it could be released
earlier if people know how to use that
correctly so yeah because because the
longer they takes for you to deliver the
software the longer the user has a
problem yeah are the functionality and
never get delivered you so cold in the
repository is more like you know it's
like um you know you have items in
storage in your store right oh yeah it's
it doesn't make you any money right so
you want to get code out you want to get
it out to the hands of people yeah right
and so you want to shorten their time
yeah is it possible to do like faster
fast turnaround only fast deliver
software and it should do it quality yes
yeah and how do we do that you have you
must have the right tools in place to
automate each step of your delivery
process right you must you have choose
to and check the quality of your code to
check a home
and the stability of your building
process you must you be able to get
there sooner and mentioning much marchi
Fowler's you know and continuous
integration often so of your books right
yes the thing is that you get there
those earlier right that's the reason
you you you must you run it as fast as
you can to bring your culture to a
traditional production like environments
to get to know if that would we work or
not right right so so are those tools
for doing soft quality like really
expensive to the no developer can use no
no it's in fact you can start it right
now if you want if you you might it
might be me thinking right now yeah I
don't use that that's guys talking about
right now how I could do concur I could
start that that is doing that right now
that's a wonderful question so how do I
do this right now yeah it's it's pretty
simple man yeah you can't just answer I
I want to say one of the tools right
yeah there that do you know the Yankees
no yes I don't you just entering google
type Jenkins see i right you're gonna
find a really good and extensible
powerful to to start automate your
process right now right and the very
cool thing about Jenkins that is open
source so it's completely free yeah any
works for a small project don't need to
re-think to to start to use it right now
and I Justin it is pretty simple right
now yeah maybe some of you guys that
must be must be asking that this is
something light for for java developers
and it is not you can lose Jenkees for
any language you want Jenkins supports
several kind of language is very Ruby
and PSP so i just installed jenkins and
all my quality problems disappear not
not all right oh yeah how do the next
step then the next step yeah I something
that I mention that there on talking
about tank is that you must you know
about the process as i mentioned yeah
you must you know how your environment
you we work how would be the process
how many views you gotta generate for a
day you must you have a good
communication plan river team right it's
not just about tues but also about
culture the process how you gotta
interact you with also the testers the
the operations team it's like about the
devops righty that without a you know
that it must be nice to have the tools
by that you but also you know you must
know that about the process how you
interact with the other parts for those
people that do deliver yourself to
choose to be installed in somewhere
somewhere else so you must do to
understand their pains you it's it's
about the devil devops scripture know
that right yeah okay so so how does
quality fits in the divorce process and
i like qualities like a big thing under
Bob's it takes a long time or it's
something that you can do quickly it's
like I have to do several steps one step
how do you it what is the thing you know
not easy no no it's a quality is always
hard it's really hard it's a it's hard
it's not it's not starting you oh yeah I
believe it's a road it's a journey you
must starting automating small pieces or
steps you're the villain in delivery
process to be able to chew in the future
start creator a DevOps culture so the
thing is that you must start and is more
yeah maybe the first thing you can do is
stall jinx let's do that first starring
keys think about how how your beauty
process it is how oh you could get there
your source code and start to compile it
tested at the first moment and even
deploying us some integration server
right so it this is the first time after
you gonna interact you with the other
people's responsible to to get the
softer chew delivered for today inducers
so right this is it small steps right ok
yes echoed about culture relationships
