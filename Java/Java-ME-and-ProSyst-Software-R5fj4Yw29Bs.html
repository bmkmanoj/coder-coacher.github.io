hear me yes hi this is Tori wet with the
Oracle technology Network we're here
live at flora javaone we're having a
great time things are amazing at the hub
if you are here in San Francisco you owe
it to yourself to take a look at the
exhibition area we have a 3d printer we
have a wave glider we have
demonstrations and we have the experts
here they're all here and there waiting
for you and your questions so get
yourself here pick up some swag do what
you're supposed to do in a conference
for those of you that aren't here I am
sorry but we want to share information
with you and I have the honor of talking
to dr. Demeter vault chels did I am i
close very close okay thank you okay he
is a CTO of proces software and he's
going to tell us about a little bit
about the Java ME space and what his
software does so thank you for joining
us yeah yeah my company is actively in
the area called nowadays Internet of
Things for almost 15 years we have two
different products one is a stake for a
very devices which is always a based and
the second product is a management
server which can manage get through
dinner devices a lot of different
protocols like pier 69 osgi gateways
almaty em devices and what we did
recently is that we extended the support
with Java ME devices which was a major
step and so
it was really a very very beneficial for
our customers because Java means
nowadays such a platform which is very
powerful much more powerful than during
the past but you are very efficient in
term of resources that it needs right so
we really observe a lot of growing
interest in using Java in here ok and
we're talking about little tiny devices
is that what you work with yes yes
actually an hour our company we work in
that this IOT space and we have
sometimes gateway based devices which
are bigger right and we also again
manage edge devices which normally are
not they are powered one of Turin osgi
and java SE and for those devices we use
Java me and our back-end system is now
capable to directly manage those devices
this means that we can remove the
updates or the software on these devices
we can update the lipless the midlet but
also the full firmware and as I said
there is real a growing interest of
using such devices in iop space right
lots of interest so you've got a really
cool demo going here and you tell me
generally what your software does it
allows you to manage delivery of an
application actually a management
software can do three different things
one is device configuration the second
area this is software management and the
third one if you can read some sense or
an actual date and control deck
in this case for java me we focus on
software lifecycle management we can
manage midlet sandeep niblets so we can
just update and we can push new software
components to the Java ME label devices
very cool and and your software's in
early access is that correct it's fully
available is very mature products okay
installation we can be hosted by the car
our customers but we get also a
cloud-based installation thought it
makes quite easy to start using the
software so you've got a cloud hosting
and then people notice than just a login
start using it without the need to
install it what's also very important
our software allows too many to Virginia
devices this means that if you kept Java
ME devices but also osj based devices
almaty m-base devices we can manage all
of them within one single management
tree and by defining management
operations and all of them including
math operations and it is very powerful
okay so here's the vendor that's been in
the iot space for a while before it was
even called IOT so they can help you
with management of your devices using
your applications of Java you can take
your existing Java skill and port them
down and control very very small devices
and that's an exploding space right now
so it's a great opportunity for
developers and companies to get into it
so if I want to get more information
about your company where do I go we can
go to our website it's the double double
your process com I can't also here at
the boot of course we can visit us we
are showing a joint demo with Oracle and
so great happy to answer additional
questions so thank you very much for
dropping by it's very exciting you're
very welcome I look forward to dougie d
again thank you this is Tori wheel with
the Oracle technology Network thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
