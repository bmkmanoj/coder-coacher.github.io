is Tori wheel we report alive from the
floor of Java 1 and it's pretty exciting
I'm a developer advocate at New Relic
and I have the distinct pleasure of
talking to Joe LoCascio hey Joe hey
how's it going Tory pretty good what do
you do at New Relic I'm a dude
I generally float around and do stuff
okay I love interviewing random white
dude tell me random white dude what the
heck is this new relic thing and what
does it do and why should anybody care
well in a DevOps culture the DevOps
engineering managers need to have kpi's
right for the team okay so what are you
driving our team towards are you driving
them towards lower error rates are you
driving them towards a revenue
generation with the new features that
they're developing or I want everything
always immediately always yeah no
definitely this dashboard that I'm
showing here is actually representative
of some kpi's that you might have for a
dev ops team okay and this is a one-week
rolling dashboard that would show how
many users are on our site interacting
with our software that we're developing
and releasing code to day to day did it
change today versus yesterday okay we
can check the dashboard and tell and
this is real-time okay we could see if
we have like a high rate of login errors
week over week and different releases
and like I said if this is one of your
kpi's you could even track revenue in
the product Oh interesting so this takes
years and years to setup it's very
complicated it's really hard right no
not at all so how long does it take
honestly to put something like this
together honestly this could take about
an hour if you're really fast and
familiar with the eight guys to a day if
you're very handsome
with the API okay so New Relic is let's
see it's a SAS based product it is yes
and so you drop your agent on your
application and the data goes up to the
cloud and then this is the
representation of some of that data is
that yeah we have some default data that
we collect that's you know transaction
response times and err codes and things
like that
we bubble those events up and we allow
you to add things like the revenue
attribute to the data points okay so you
can you get stuff out of the box but if
you want to do custom instrumentation
you can do that as yeah we call it
adding custom attributes the data set
okay interesting
so as a java developers that's where at
JavaOne tell me how how does this relate
to what I'm doing and is it important
and what is this crazy DevOps stuff so
that was 18 questions yeah yeah yeah I
like straw man so when you're releasing
job applications into a new
containerized environment it could be
very difficult to track all the
statistics and re instrument things but
New Relic makes that easy with the agent
based code level approach you don't have
to care about what is going on at the
container level or what servers the
containers are running on the API is
inside of the code and then the agent is
on top of your application and it can
run anywhere okay so this is keying in
on what the application is doing and you
don't really care if it's on a VM or
yeah our docker container or even if
you're running a distributed hybrid
cloud you're running in your data center
on your legacy environment and you're
maybe migrating in v2 into Amazon or a
juror or the Oracle cloud right okay
very interesting so tell me in terms of
some of the interesting stories you've
seen in terms of people doing their
digital migration what does that look
like
from monolith to microservices totally
depends but a lot of these larger
companies that we see in our market are
trying to modernize the front end first
so they'll slap a micros
service API gateway on top of their
legacy Java stack and that will be v1 of
the upgrade okay and they may do some
modernization of their web front-end at
that point and that that will probably
involve like a single page application
framework like angular reacts or ember
and that's to get the new client
experience to the market as fast as
possible right so it's all about speed
right getting new functionality out to
users as quickly as possible
how do you see people dealing with the
issue of technical debt and you know all
this legacy code they have can they just
chuck it away or tell me tell me what
you were really seeing out in the field
two approaches that I've seen one of
which I saw today this is very
interesting migrating a customer that
was migrating their WebLogic instances
directly to the quad just porting them
directly over without actually changing
anything okay so that's the and then the
the other is actually migrating that
code into a new environment onto a new
kind of application server or technology
typically you know Tomcat servers of
some kind actually doing some level of
rewrite of the actual application itself
okay so where would you recommend if
somebody I'm a Java developer I've heard
about a lot about DevOps I've heard
about micro services I know I've got to
get on this train somehow where do you
suggest they start oh man well you can
you can start with I don't really know
honestly you're on your own people here
first no I can tell people that there
are a lot of various resources one I'd
suggest going to a meet-up finding
meetup you can always meet up obviously
my services are docker or whatever and
just start to do your research and meet
other people that are doing this because
a lot of people are on the journey the
classic thing is how many people are
running docker every hand in the room
goes up and then you go in production
and then all the hands go down right so
a lot of people are on this learning
journey together and I feel like you do
have to realize that you're not a pizza
delivery company you're a software and
that's that's the reality and I think
it's pretty exciting times for Java the
Java community and software development
in general right I guess actually we do
have some fog leadership it within New
Relic some folks that have written books
about architecting at scale our chief
cloud adviser Lee Atkinson yes and some
folks that have written about how to get
containers in your production
environment right some of our site
reliability engineers Karl was his last
name escapes me and Sean Sean Sean K
Sean Kane there yeah right docker up and
running docker up and running yes it's
an O'Reilly press book right because new
relics been running docker in production
for what two years now for about two
years now yeah yeah we've been on the
bleeding edge and we've really scaled up
in user a lot and have some expertise
around it and are glad this year that we
like to think so you know in this
application that I was showing you the
dashboards for yeah is actually
completely containerized okay so it in
fact has the Java agent inside of the
containers and you can actually see the
container instances here and we will
detect that its container will represent
that in the UI and will also help you
monitor the the server's infrastructure
our legacy server product product
actually monitors and detects docker
host right and it will show you the
container CPU and memory utilization on
the host all of the containers and a
fleet but our new infrastructure product
is actually going to supply that
functionality and is designed for
dynamic infrastructure interesting yeah
yeah cuz that's
the people we acquired opps matic right
and now we're surfacing that
functionality and it's pretty amazing
and it focuses on configuration changes
and all sorts of things that when you
have a large fleet of servers whether
they're real or virtual minor
configuration changes can make big cause
big problems for people yeah someone
might log in and tweak something here
but it takes out 10% of the docker host
or docker containers in that host and
you've just sunk the ship Jim she's dead
so we're gonna prevent that from
happening
Jose thank you so much for coming by
it's great that you're part of this
happy to be part of the Java community
yeah great this is Tory wheel with New
Relic signing off stay tuned for more
exciting interviews live from Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
