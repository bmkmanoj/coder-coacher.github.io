night hacking episode with Holly Cummins
on stage here so how's your Jay focus
experience been so far oh wait
I'm setting myself up for a disaster
story aren't I
tell me anyway so I'm really enjoying
Jay focus but technology has not been my
friends so far today which is always
good when you're speaking so so far I've
had coffee spilt on my laptop which
isn't unusual but it wasn't me that
spilt the coffee on my laptop which was
unusual I've um demagnetized my hotel
card which meant that I got locked in
the lift on my hotel I thought I was
gonna have to ring the alarm button
because I was pushing all of the buttons
and nothing was happening and the reason
I was in the lift in the first place was
because I got to Jay focus and then I
realized I'd actually forgotten my demo
in the hotel room so I had to scamper
back to my hotel really yeah that sounds
like that's important yeah and and my
laptop wouldn't talk to the projector
and the talk I just did as well but
apart from that but but somehow you made
it through and you gave a good talk I
gave a good talk no we're gonna well yes
a good talk and then we're thinking
optimistically because everything here
is gonna work
so now we're gonna show some of your
Raspberry Pi hardware yeah so actually
before we start that just for folks who
haven't been on the screen before you
can check out the live stream on Knight
hacking comm we have a live chat window
open here so folks who are on the live
stream can interact with us and there's
there's a bunch of users ant on our UPOV
from Jay rebel is on the live stream
Jove or Decker's from the DevOps
conference he's part of the DevOps crew
and the parlays crew is also on line
here and then we have 16 other unnamed
guests you didn't bother to log in but
though please still count yeah they
still count so we have those folks
online a couple folks in the hall here
and um Jay focus I think we've been
doing a couple of these and nobody's
actually seeing the the audience but I
I think for the benefit of the online
stream we'll get a pan shot all right so
one or two people here
and a white screen up on the projector
is still a video we do okay but we have
a projector anomaly which I'm sure some
some techie person will come and fix for
us while we're recording all right so
tell me a little bit more about what you
do at IBM I'm part of the team working
on the u.s. application server so I'm
working on the Liberty profile which is
a new profile and it's we we started out
thinking what can we do to make this a
really good experience for developers so
you know it needs to be easy to install
it needs to be fast to star it needs to
be dynamic and then we thought about
that a little bit more we thought
actually those are really good things
for lots of environments as well not
just script developers
yeah cool so are you applying those
principles to what you're doing with the
embedded devices we are yeah so what
I've got running on the Raspberry Pi is
a web application server in Liberty
profile there's sort of it you know
we've been talking about PI's loads and
I think now you can't go to a tech
conference without seeing a bunch of
PI's yeah no I heard I heard a rumor
that um some of the folks who came to
this conference in the Jay focus the new
Jay focus embedded track actually got
raspberry PI's today it's one of the
cool things about the PI's is that
they're so cheap that all of a sudden
all these possibilities open up about
what you can do with them and how you
can give them away and and you can
almost treat them as disposable
computers and then there's sort of a
nice convergence as well so there's this
huffed this hardware which is sort of
semi embedded semi embeddable hardware
and it but it's becoming more and more
powerful so we used to talk about you
know embedded computers and you can only
do really limited things and you know
you could maybe run java on them but you
know you couldn't do much and you had to
be super careful about you know your
resources and
yet to choose just you know the sort of
the sliver of the programming model that
you wanted and start there but now the
devices are becoming you know so much
more powerful that this twenty five
pound piece of hardware actually has
more power than a computer would have a
few years ago where you know that yeah
definitely more power than the computer
I started programming on and more memory
yeah and then the sort of the other
thing that's happening is that the
application servers are getting smaller
as well so you know it used to be you'd
rather an application server really need
you at your four cores you medium
mountains of memory you know because
it's gonna load the whole Ju programming
model into memory any time you know so
yeah so speaking of speaking of running
in constrained platforms so so how much
memory is on the device which you're
gonna be using today 256 baked okay so
first generation model yeah we've got
some I've got a first generation one in
a second generation one and it's kind of
sad because I think the first generation
one is actually cooler because it's
worse you know so at some point you know
the Raspberry Pi is gonna become so
powerful that it's not actually
interesting to show things on it because
you know it's equivalent to my laptop
but you know this is still it's a pretty
constrained device which is what I think
makes it kind of interesting that you
can actually run a full-featured
application server on it cool and you
have like a hat yeah yeah sort of what
there's two things that are a bit novel
you know because we've all got raspberry
PI's we're all showing raspberry PI's
but the first novel thing is that this
one has WebSphere running on it and the
second novel thing is that it has a hat
as well so this is sort of adventures
with wearable computing so what we have
here is we have here we just have the
basic pi
and obviously for wearable computing one
of the requirements is that it's gotta
be portable you can't be you know tied
down with power cables and stuff and so
I have just a phone charging battery
that I'm using to power the PI so that
means that it's it can get carried
around and the other attempt at
portability is a bit less successful so
what I've got here I don't know if you
can see because it's pretty small is a
tiny little Wi-Fi dongle
yeah so gayness you know it's quite cool
because you can take your pie
you can attach the Wi-Fi dongle and then
all of a sudden you know you've got this
package which is pretty small you can
carry around anywhere but if you look at
it again you can see something else
which is that next to the Wi-Fi dongle I
don't know if it's clear so we have
there we have the Wi-Fi dongle and there
we have the Ethernet cable because this
is where we start to run into the
limitations of the PI as a wearable
device which is that although the PI has
you know a reasonable amount of memory
and a reasonable amount of disk space
and a reasonable amount of CPU power or
CPU um I guess you could say what it
actually physically doesn't have is a
lot of electronic power and so it's
limited I mean the Raspberry Pi
foundation did a pretty good job with
the hardware but it's limited what you
can physically fit on that little board
and still keep the small form-factor
you
we're robust demo
I've now got an Ethernet cable as well
yeah now that makes sense and it
definitely makes it more rugged for
conference situations like this yeah
there I mean there's still some
interesting limitations on the recognize
of the PI actually I've discovered just
because everything has to connect plug
into the board and they're quite an
important things that plug in so you can
see I've got some sort of quite a few
things plugged in so I've got a USB
cable I've got a few sort of little
dangly bits yeah those are so important
but this is the power and this is
obviously critically important and it
has a tendency to come undone so came if
you're sat there and the PI isn't moving
the power works great once you start
waving the PI around in front of a
camera and going look at this I'm
talking it up side down on the power and
then no more demo exactly yeah
so I've sort of I've been learning some
lessons about the PI but some I'll show
you what I've got though because it's
kind of cool what you can do there's
sort of the PI works well with some
other things that are going on in this
space so as you can see I've got the pot
and the PI's not very big and then I
have a sock which is I think you know
every embedded computing needs scientist
are yes I'm surprised you haven't drawn
a little sock puppet face on there yeah
yeah I originally had this idea you know
that I was gonna have something really
neat and streamlined and then I was
trying to get the demo working and the
sock is actually a cable tidy so there's
nothing in this sock except for cables
and you could see if I was organized I
could actually go and I could find a
little USB cable that was not that long
get the sock but as it is we've got the
sock as part of the demo and what the
cables that the sock is tidying are
connecting this little board here mm-hmm
which is a tinker forge master bridge
nice to this tiny little thing here and
that's I think the Forge temperature
sensor
so again I'm not sure whether you'd want
to do tinker forging a you know a really
hardcore embedded proper wearable
computing because you know you do have
quite a lot of cables that go with it
you know it's not all soldered together
and you need a sock to hold your cables
it's really quite cool for playing
around with Sanford you know as well I
think this is the prototype and when it
gets mass-produced mi yeah I think this
is probably as good a time as any to
show oh yeah which there's a web
component on here and if we go and we
bring up the web should be able to show
a web page
okay so we have welcome to Cafe woz and
I'm connected to the static IP address
of the pie yeah slash cafe woz welcome
servlet I'll refresh it just to show
there's no tricks up the sleeve it's
some refreshing automatically actually
anyway I think it refreshes about every
30 seconds okay which I've discovered
this again is sort of starting to hit
the limitations of the pie in terms of
how much heat up I can contain while you
know while thrashing the web server I'm
just gonna put a video overlay of while
we're showing this okay good yeah so you
can see it's yeah refresh to refresh and
it's showing that the pie is 23.2
degrees but no we get into the
wearability part so we try and assemble
everything into the hats this is the
part where you try not to knock the
cables out yeah yeah bitter experience
there is nothing like putting on the Hat
going to the web server and getting this
404 and there's just nothing you can do
try and carefully assemble everything
together I think I have a particularly
rubbish power cable as well which
doesn't help the robustness of the
assembly also sort of carefully put
everything into the heart
there's something sort of refreshing
about this demo actually because
normally we need to give a demo if you
have a real fear of looking stupid you
know you think oh is it gonna work is it
gonna work am I gonna look stupid and
this one you know the answer to both of
those beforehand which is that probably
it's not gonna work because there are
these physical limitations of the device
like the power cable coming out and you
know this is not a lot you can do and no
matter what you're gonna look stupid
yeah so this is a deterministic outcome
yeah and it you know it's just it makes
it very relaxing so take that somewhere
there's something sort of professionally
physical about it all as well because
normally you know when things go wrong
it you know we're just trying to
manipulate the bits whereas here I'm
actually trying to manipulate yeah take
the entire assembly on and it will say
you can see the dignity has just
evaporated looking stupid part of the
demo so when it says that my server is
currently calm 25 or 20 degrees and if I
leave this on my head for a while while
it continues to refresh you can see that
temperature is gonna go up and up and up
so I have a hot detection embedded in a
Raspberry Pi so you can tell exactly
what's your body temperature yeah and so
that the original intention behind this
demo can see I'm really struggling with
cables across my nose yeah so you're not
thinking hard enough you can think
harder to warm it up yeah discovered
that's another limitation of the PI
actually is that a hat is not a very
good environment for an application
server in terms of the amount of cooling
right it seems to be okay so far but
I've had it you know where the certain
temperatures been 30 degrees 35 degrees
40 degrees and then after that I haven't
had a server anymore yeah you probably
want to take off the Hat once you yeah
once you get beyond the safe operating
threshold very cool that's heating up
again
so 224 uh-huh there we go
27 the temperature sensor
was outside the heart I've felt the
physical problem what else I've solved
good demo recovery yeah one of the
physical problems si si can see it's
gonna heat up and the original idea here
because you can see this doesn't
actually make any sense in terms of what
it's showing they're showing a picture
of a hat and that makes sense and then
it's asking you what chocolate bar you
want and what I was originally thinking
was when we talked about mobile
computing you know we're always talking
about the client being mobile and
there's this idea that the server is not
mobile because and that's sort of you
know we don't even think about that
constraint it's like well obviously
clients are Mobile servers are not
mobile that's you know the definition of
the thing but actually now that we have
these devices that can run a server and
that can be mobile you can do some sort
of possibility so anything well why why
is there value in having the server be
mobile because the client has a network
connection and then the first thing is
well maybe the client doesn't have a
network connection we take it for
granted but of course as soon as you
start to come to somewhere like you know
conference Wi-Fi anyway let's actually
maybe I can't take never a connection
for granted and if you've got sort of a
you know perhaps say you know you're in
the middle of a desert or you're doing
disaster recovery or something like that
you may not have a network but it's
still quite useful to be able to do
these things that are connected to each
other and one of the things that you
absolutely need a server for you can't
just do with clients it's collaboration
so if you're doing disaster recovery
you've got the team you know you need
some sort of ticketing system but they
don't have the network to go talk to the
server back you know the central server
to say oh yes you ever going off to
bring blankets there but it's really
useful to have a portable server perhaps
not embedded in a chef hat in that kind
of context but it well a rescue her yeah
rescue hat maybe it'll be version two of
yours a little firmer so it'll yeah
mostly mostly yeah there we are yeah
perfect and so there's sort of the other
thing you know where it's may be useful
is sort of instead of talking about
location-based services which is what we
talked about at the moment you know
where you tell the server where you are
and this is oh right near you is
yes sir you know you might be interested
in that you can have these locatable
servers instead and so the idea here is
that you might not know that there's a
web server around but if you see someone
wearing an idiotic hat then all then you
know you can say oh actually this hat
represents the cafe wires and then you
can connect to the cafe wire server
which is right near you you know so
you've got this really geographically
close network rather than having to get
to you know a Wi-Fi and you know connect
to the internet proper and then the
intention was that you could connect to
the Hat and you could say I would like a
galaxy bar or I would like a Snickers
bar and then you know the server would
run over to you getting warmer and
warmer as they did so and give you and
so then you and then there's some sort
of so that's that's how that's how you
save people in disaster situations is
give them candy yeah and then you know
you've got the sort of potential for
more information as well so it can tell
you you can connect to the Hat and
that's kind of useful but then it can
tell you things about the person wearing
the Hat as well which again if it was
coming off a central server so if you're
warm if you're gonna heat stroke and you
need to like take a break from serving
people snicker bars yeah or you know if
my temperature is 85 degrees you know
I'm probably overworked so I'm probably
a bit stressed is probably gonna take me
a while to get to you with the chocolate
bar so you know whereas if I'm pretty
calm then you know you can expect the
chocolate bars gonna come quickly
actually another example of a
application where you need a mobile
server was I know some of the Java user
group members we're looking at using
raspberry pi servers to do kind of
auctions or giveaways or registration at
events yeah because you might not have a
internet connection or you might want a
mobile device people can just hook up to
at the event yeah and it's very portable
programmable you could have a full well
WebSphere running on that yeah yeah
we're sort of we're starting to I mean
we're starting to think about this idea
of zero infrastructure you know we're at
the moment now you know we've got so
much and you know if you look at the
Wi-Fi setup for one of these conferences
they're just you know got these massive
great cables and they've got you know
all the stuff running everywhere and
maybe we don't need that
maybe actually we can have something
where you just do come in with your
small little device and people say okay
that's good enough I'm going to connect
to that and then do my comm for my
competition
yeah and most of the devices which
people are using for embedded large
embedded now are not that much different
from the processors used in cell phones
or tablets or you know for example that
that device there I I would wager runs
an ARM processor inside of there it's
one of the things I've sort of realized
after starting to see the Raspberry Pi
work you know was because I did discover
these physical limitations which is why
I have cables running out of my heart
you know I took this Raspberry Pi and I
thought okay well I need to be able to
have an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network and that
was the first thing and that just and
then I realized that wasn't going to
work at all because the PI didn't have
enough G's so then I thought okay well
the Python connection an existing
raspberry Wi-Fi network and then I
realized that that didn't work either
so I thought okay well I can use a cable
that I can connect to the PI and you
know I've got this external battery that
comes loose and it's not it's a really
cheap model it's a you know it's
convenient in some ways because I've got
you noticed 25-pound device but as a
really robust portable computing model
it's not great and you know these sorts
of devices
yeah but the main difference is um so
devices like this are in their own way
kind of special-purpose so if you're
dealing with a with a tablet it's
designed for browsing sites or input or
running certain sorts of applications in
this form factor the the advantage of
mobile development platforms like the PI
I mean one thing is it's actually a
small low-cost computing platform but
another sense it lets you write
applications for the ARM chip test them
on a chip which you could mass-produce
very cheaply in large quantities and
then you could actually you know have an
industrial design for a hat or whatever
it was you're designing with it's
exactly the same processor architecture
but a form factor which is much much
smaller because the actual processor
size is tiny on the Raspberry Pi board
the Raspberry Pi board is huge for all
the connectivity options
not for the yeah processor yeah yes sort
of there definitely are other
limitations to things like this as well
you know because I did sort of start to
think okay well maybe actually I
shouldn't be using the PI because it's
just too fragile and you know the
ability to connect the external things
is great except that all I actually want
is Wi-Fi and power and you know perhaps
I should just use the device and
wouldn't it be nice if it was just all
built-in but that doesn't have a
temperature sensor and the the problem
with this particular device is that this
does also run WebSphere and it does also
fit into a hat which I can show because
you know I still have a think about ten
percent of my dignity left which I'd
like to get rid of yeah that's a good
way a focus hat so did you put on the
Jay focus hat during your during your
presentation I didn't know I see this
presentation is tomorrow actually today
I was talking about HDMI so you can see
you're starting to see one problem with
the tablet really but the other problem
with it is that in principle this you
know the other weekend this was running
WebSphere and then we did an update and
now it needs to be rebooted so you know
you haven't got the access to the
physical device you know in the same way
that you have for the PI so what I have
is something that could run WebSphere
and doesn't then and there are cost
problems as well as you say you know
this is 25 pounds this is 200 pounds and
my colleague has another device which is
a phone which also runs WebSphere and
again you know it's so cool because you
think it's and it's really an
application server but the you know
there's problems there too and that's
the cost which is that you'll notice I
don't have the phone with me and that's
because we have one phone and we're
trying to share it between two of us and
he's had another conference and so his
phone yeah yeah no and really all you
need is a subset of the hardware in a
general-purpose computing device yeah
cool so I actually I have a couple
things for you
so first for suffering the embarrassment
of wearing a hat on the night hacking
show here is a night hacking sticker and
I also I have something else which is
just just for you it'll it'll take me a
sec to get out but I think this will
give you some more options for your
industrial design of the Hat which
you're building so one of the things
I've been doing is Raspberry Pi labs I'm
actually going to be doing a session on
raspberry PI's a little buff later today
but to make sure that I could safely
make it from Iceland all the way across
Sweden and Norway in all these countries
I I got really really tiny cables that's
cool and I think this USB cable looks
like the one you need yeah and I'll also
give you a cute little Ethernet cable as
well might come in handy and you can you
can use that in future demos if it's
helpful or not brave taking this off
yeah yeah we could give that a try let
me I've never actually done the demo
without the socks no it could be a lucky
sock perhaps perhaps actually this would
give Jim Weaver Jim Weaver
how're you doing he's in Indianapolis
and he signed on and he saw you wearing
the Hat and you immediately wondered
what it was for so I think he'd
appreciate a encore demo
you can see the other really high-tech
piece of 65 yeah those are any any good
industrial design needs safety pins
several of them
I think I think we might have failed at
these oh yeah yeah yeah yeah Micro yeah
that's a fail I actually I do have the
other USB at home as well and in a
really like like it's that long but I
didn't bring that with me unfortunately
all right well it was a good it was a
good effort yeah you're the first person
who has happened to have even the wrong
USB cable in the soft lives another day
all right cool
well thank you very much my pleasure for
joining the neck hacking program for
folks on the livestream we will be
live-streaming the Gosling talk on
robots and liquid liquid robotics
shortly from it's actually going to be
streamed right from his office in
Sunnyvale and then broadcast here for
the Jay focus conference session but you
also can watch it online as well if you
stay on the night hacking stream and
we'll have after that we'll have the
Java posse live on the stream and then
some more interviews with heinki boots
and gnome 10:00 tomorrow all right thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
