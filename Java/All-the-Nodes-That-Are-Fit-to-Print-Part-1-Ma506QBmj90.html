the lights down so you can get a better
shot of the screen oh yeah but then I
get a hard shell yeah hey I'm okay with
that alright so welcome to the Silicon
Valley javafx user group keith is is
very sorry he couldn't be here but he's
incapacitated he's losing his first
amounts of blood okay so tonight we have
Phil race who's going to talk about the
JavaFX printing api's before that a big
thanks to all of our sponsors oracle
supplies the venue and all the food line
owed it does a lot of hosting for us Jay
fog pay some of our meetup costs and
then we also host the videos on some
different video sites and get books from
a Pressman and a couple other companies
although since Keith's not here you guys
get no handouts apologies in advance so
normally we have lots of good handouts
right yes so well we'll have to live
with that it's this Keith couldn't make
it ok so without further ado I'll turn
it over to fill to talk about the javafx
print API hey good evening folks ok so
this is um a you're getting to
experience the early access version of
my java one talk so please them go easy
on me if there are few rough edges it's
not feature complete yet so Jennifer
isn't here tonight but so good about
myself maybe I'm in that sort of i've
been working on java platform graphics
and related stuff for quite a while and
printing a long time ago and then in the
jdk and so forth and although i've been
i haven't really been doing that much
printing for the last few years you know
we now needed a new printing api in the
FX platform and so
I've tried to learn from some of the
things that we've done in the past so
I'm not sure why my mouse focus that's
sorry that's Oracle standard disclaimer
stuff they make us put in there for java
one so this is the sort of rough agenda
what I will be going through there's a
little bit of the history which kind of
touches on what I just was talking about
and you know sort of what I was trying
to achieve with this API a few examples
I actually um have this for fun I
actually brought a printer so if anyone
wants to actually try to print something
for real we can try it some details
about the implementation and just very
briefly you know touch on some of the
things that we know that really need to
be done so jdk arm printing has a quite
long history just while the jdk does
itself of course but it's one of those
things that went through a number of
iterations and and you know back in jdk
10 which everyone remembers came well
many of us remember came out in like an
alpha in 1995 and then you know GA dumb
in 96 it had no printing so what
whatsoever I mean that wasn't hungry the
focusrite it was ran on a device yeah we
keep coming back to java and devices and
so forth and then it was you know turned
into something for the web so you know
printing hadn't been something they put
into the platform but of course you know
you need to be able to print for many
valid applications so there was some
basic printing API added you know just
for the release that came on a year
later and then jdk 12 which was the big
java to release all you want to call it
added a completely different API that
had been in added in jdk one dat one you
know just like no overlap whatsoever and
that was designed to print java 2d not
just print arm awt components which is
basically the AWT basic graphics
graphics which is the focus of jdk 11
but you know you had to kind of you know
be there with your mouse and you
couldn't do anything if you were a
server or anything like that there was
no way you know Java that we're trying
to get java into server-side
applications and there was no way you
could do that you know you you could not
literally literally couldn't print
except by pressing ok on a print dialog
so you know it just didn't work for a
server application so there was some
support added to the original API in 13
and but then JDK but then javis is d
which was what could print a lot of
things that people wanted a print still
didn't have that that finally got added
in 14 where were things like headless
ADA Wheaties so you could run on a linux
or unix server without actually bringing
up a good even if there was no ex
display for those people remember x11
i'm sure many people still use it on
linux and there was a whole set of api
is called Java X print which went
through the JCP and so forth which was
designed also to be used with
interoperate with potentially Genie
enabled devices and so forth so there
was lots of lots of iterations on the
JDK side of printing and 14 is basically
where it stopped but it you know the
real issue i'm trying to get through
here is we just tried it you know
different there were different API is
incompatible I mean job req sprint is
really a third API so there are three
api's and each of them you know added
something or did something a little bit
different and it took a long time you
know to try in 14 to unify these things
and make everything arm and be able to
print everything in the platform and be
able to support all the different use
cases so I keep losing focus so that's
basically my my last point just took a
lot of tries and you know so there were
some things that went wrong in trying to
you know as a result of that but you
know the main thing that I think that
you know we got right is that you know
and then most modern platforms
essentially do this as well is that you
know the drawing model for printing is
you know you're drawing to the printer
just like you draw to the screen it's
not like you had to or go off and say
well you know now I'm going to print oh
I actually need to start generating
postscript
something and send it to the printer you
know you know and completely essentially
redo your your your the way the
application renders it's exactly the
same rendering model you just draw to a
printer graphics device instead of a
screen graphics device so that's one
thing that think we got right so FX
printing I you know again it was one of
these things that the mistake in a sense
made here was perhaps that you know we
didn't do it earlier but javafx 10 was
sort of like JDK 10 very web focused it
was the scripting language javafx script
for the people who got into FX at that
time and in printing wasn't actually in
the plan I don't mean to say that any
know people were saying oh this is
unimportant we never need to do it but
there was no you know it wasn't in a
project plan and FX 2 dropped script and
arm was done in a major hurry really it
was quite impressive on a lot of things
were sort of converted to Java and we
had to get a release out quite quickly
so although people were now you know
much more talking talking about printing
much more there was no no time to do it
just not a chance javafx eight arms I
think you all know is basically the
first one that sort of tied into you
know at major jdk release and what we
started doing in seven but um it's it's
you know a release in which you know a
lot of new api's have been added in the
Java language based FX and you know
finally we're trying to add what we are
adding some printing support so that's
kind of the history and I've you know
haven't been there through all of that
history but you know I've been there
through quite a lot of it so it's too
late just to get it in the first release
but I trying and I feedback is obviously
very important and welcome here as to
you know only have to provide one API
now this doesn't mean to say the API is
complete although it wouldn't evolve or
that there's not some things that are
missing but you know the worst thing
that you know that can happen
we say well we just need a literally
completely different API I mean in Java
JDK ones one we had a Java odd print job
and a job at 12 at a Java or print
printer job and then there was a Java X
print print job in jdk 14 and just
completely different and you know it's
just too much so let's hope that we can
do that and then it you know as we
evolve to new users and platforms that
that's you know flexible enough to be
able to to to survive it's strange okay
so what are the big goals here well I
think you know the end user right one of
the things that you it's sort of a um
you know not everyone out will it
necessarily agree but this is the you
know if you're building a platform like
Java or Java effects right do you are
you aiming for a completely a platform
feel or you want something that's you
know behaves pretty much the same across
platforms JDK you know pretty much try
to give you both options and let you
pick and not let's didn't always get
everything perfect but very few things
up but the idea is in FX that the
greatest extent possible we want it to
feel normal for the platform so the user
will pretty much as an end user what you
would see is the usual printed page
setup dialog zon the menus and so forth
however you want to do it as an
application developer but you know if
you want to go and say hey I want to
develop a custom print dialog because I
just want these three options and I
don't want the use of futzing with
anything else because i need a very
control setup you know you could write a
little UI control yourself to do that
because we provide you you know most of
the information you need I'll talk I'll
come on to what that means that in a bit
I think this is weird i keep every time
I leave my mouse for about a minute just
loses focus on the window
ok so then there's the developer
experience while you want to make it
fairly easy to add printing to your
application you know doesn't necessarily
mean it's a slam dunk there are some
things that are that are you know
complex um make the API fairly
straightforward so nothing superfluous
by which I mean some things like Java
Rex print kind of went and added a lot
of stuff that uh he never really got
implemented and it was like the whole of
the IPP API and you know that most of
the platforms we were running on just
didn't even support it so there was all
this API that really was you know pretty
much wasted so it's not to say we can't
add new API but I haven't you know and
also JDK 12 I remember lessons that we
had for where we had implemented API
because we thought oh and then we can
patch it in in you know a later release
but you know it in that later release
you could I API anyway and instead you
just had functionality which just did
nothing which was broken so I'm hoping
I'm not adding any functionality which
does nothing and again the same
rendering mode is on the screen so in FX
this basically means the scene graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
