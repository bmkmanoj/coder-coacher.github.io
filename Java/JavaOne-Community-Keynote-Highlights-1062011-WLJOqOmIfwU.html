be here I think that the reason why
javascript are popular it's because I
love you the overwhelming message came
through that we need to continue driving
open standards and open implementations
for the API is that we use day-to-day
what are some of the values that you saw
you learned from from eclipse that you
would bring to openjdk and your
participation there well thanks the I
think the simplest way to put it is
transparency I think the openjdk project
is primarily Oracle it's opening up
we've joined there's red hats join as a
piece join there's others and I think to
get the maximum effectiveness of all the
contributors we need the most
transparent open project possible I have
high hopes for the future because with
the combined lines of jdk 7 and open jdk
7 vc fixes trickling in to openjdk seven
right away and as OpenJDK 6 ramps down
we're hoping that not just red hat but
all of the community can put their
efforts into fixing bugs and adding
enhancements to OpenJDK seven and eight
the only things i think missing are an
open bug database and ability to come
into hot spot those are the biggest
things and I know that you guys are
working on it and it's going to be great
I'm looking forward to it you know your
developers have excellent opportunity
the OpenJDK is the refs implementation
or java right now in a great way of
helping those guys is go on use it right
installed on your machine starting the
development environments test out in
your server environment make it girl you
know test so if you're heavy application
to see how it's doing we need that right
so we have to improve those this use
numbers here just in the past year
Oracle took on the stewardship of Java
came out with the release of Java 7 and
made something amazing happen in the
community there's been a huge huge
groundswell of support around Java 7 and
moving towards the new releases and I
think that execution actually making a
commitment holding it up and delivering
on it is going to be important to drive
the platform for word what lays allows
you to do is actually real live
presentations but even in a non
sequential way so if you only want to
see the demo parts which are often like
the cool parts you can just skip all the
slides that go immediately to the demo
parts right so that's that's really nice
and we'll going to be doing that for the
talks of Java one the best thing we can
do is communicate together because the
only way we can drive Java innovation
forward is by talking and sharing
experiences
