technology Network we're here speaking
to members of the java community i'm
mateus carlson with me hey Matias hello
how are you doing I'm doing great so
tell me where you're from so I'm from
Stockholm Sweden where I'm running a
user group and working in the industry
okay so tell me about the work that you
do generally yeah I work as a consultant
or a contractor for a company called a
vague a group in Stockholm you know the
usual customers are in the enterprise so
we're doing work with the cat telecom
industry the insurance companies and
banks and more more a big company that I
usually work with so tell me I you said
you did architect your work so what's a
typical stack you work on yeah so
typically nowadays I do kind of a
team-leading and technical project
leading stuff and we're building as or
should texture mainly and you know large
complex systems with integration between
back-end system in mainframes and sa fie
and then we build you know core systems
with Java and you know the usual
stachyose is an enterprise Java or for
some cases we use the spring okay so
tell me is Java big in Sweden nobody
uses it tell me what the deal is yeah
it's a normal you know we have
everything of course in Sweden so we
have a lively dotnet community and some
people are doing Ruby on Rails but I
would say that the java community and
all of the major players are definitely
using Java for part of the core business
in Sweden we also have you know a very
large gaming industry you mean like
online gaming and they are definitely
on job all of them we have companies
like Spotify we have companies like King
Kong we are also on to the JVM as far as
I know at the moment right and you told
me a little bit about you have some
friends in the computer science area
they're doing some cool stuff yeah so
friend my friends that we're working
together for for the user group they are
actually researches now at the six and
that is Swedish Institute of computer
science and they have been ain't you too
embedded in Internet of Things and
sensor networks and stuff like that for
10 or 15 years and you know it's it's
fun to see it's actually happening now
and you know we have come quite a while
from frozen quite a bit away from from
the Sun poop thing and we're moving into
direct right direction anyway it seems
like it's happening now right right it's
a big explosion I know we have the we
had the Raspberry Pi store and they sold
out of raspberry fights here at devoxx
there are definitely a lot of developers
that want to get their hands on it yes
yes one thing is the Raspberry Pi but if
you look at the you know the small
Gemalto ship you know the possibilities
with this is just amazing it's
mind-blowing and I'm like I said it's
happening now almost endless yep yep
great so in addition to being a
developer I know you're a jug leader
right yes we have been running the
Sweden user group and the Stockholm you
see roof for I don't know a almost 10
years so seven or eight years now and we
have branched off so you know from start
we had a jack meetings or local
Jackson's calm maluma guttenberg but
nowadays we also have Jackson in
linkoping and email and some other
smaller cities so we are definitely
having lots of traction and how often do
you meet in Stockholm we typically try
to meet between six to eight times per
year I would like to be off more often
but it is always a big deal to make the
meeting happens with because we are
always more than 200 people at every
meeting wow that's a good number yeah
they are huge and the thing is we sell
them out or whatever you call that we're
fully booked within half day so we
usually have you know the last people
that get the emails when they get the
email the meeting is already fully
booked so we had to randomize our our
amazing because people are starting to
register phone email is with AAA is to
totally to get get email first Wow
gaming the system yes pretty interesting
so I and your jug sponsors a conference
up in Sweden or how did I where we have
been you know spinning off the
conference so it's a community style
conference but it's run like a kind of a
more of a organization nowadays because
you had to do that and it's grown so
large nowadays so so Jay focus is like
1500 people and it's just a huge
organization excellent i could happen so
when's it coming up soon yes it's in the
first eco februari we do a three day
conference from third to fifth of
februari and we're expecting about 1500
people and we do six parallel tracks
with quite a diverse content excellent
that sounds I heard it's a great
conference so if you're in Sweden or in
the area it sounds like a great thing to
check out and waltzing would that we do
that we thought about last year is we're
doing very specialized sub conference so
we do in a jay focus embedded of jay
focus internet of things wow totally
focused on the new excellent so your
timing is excellent on that yeah yeah we
get lots of interest last year we had
more than 200 people for showing up for
that conference alone and the keynote
but wow great so I know you're also a
philanthropist so I wanted to ask you
about one more thing you're involved
with kevo why don't you tell us a little
bit about that yes I'm been trying to do
different things to help the community
or people there are less fortunate than
we are and one of the things I did the
couple years ago I did a habitat for
Habitat for Humanity build so that's an
organization in US based organizations i
went to come over for a couple of weeks
to build houses and it sort for people
to do that I guess mostly so we started
out and a team within Kiva the keyway is
also an American organization so what
they do is personal micro loans so you
find an entrepreneur in the third word
and you lend them $25 you get them back
and you can relearn them to somebody
else and to get that going you can start
up teams so we have a Java you sir java
users around the world team okay it's
it's it's me I'm team leader and I'm
invited some obligation do you have a
FAFSA is very very active we also have
you know van riper is a team captain and
the total who used to run the Norwegian
user group is also a team captain
nowadays so where we are building i'm
quite quite large team so i think you
should join as well I I think I already
have so I encourage you guys do the same
so you can take twenty-five dollars and
really change somebody's life right and
i think it's teva kiva.org / team /
jogging we'll be sure and put the URL at
the tail end of this so you are a Java
developer a jug leader a philanthropist
a conference organizer you are quite a
guy I really appreciate you coming by
and talking to us thanks a lot all right
