and I'm with the OT and advocacy team
and I manage the Java champion program
and I'm here at devoxx and i'm joined
with one of our java champions Peter
pilgrim welcome thank you thank you
thank you for interviewing me yes shall
I introduce myself sure go ahead yeah so
um Peter pilgrim I'm a job a champion I
live in Milton Keynes England I'm an
independent contractor and I suppose in
my day job i help companies move java
ford in their organizations ok yeah and
then you know a big part of being a java
champion is not only being an expert or
luminary in the field but also giving
back to the java community how do you
find yourself getting back and nowadays
i contribute blogs I i do talks when i
feel i want to i am starting a new
series of video cars again and that's
how i give back once upon a time I used
to run a user group in London which was
called the Java rug I helped found it or
founded it in 2004 in that in a pub waxy
o'connors it was great and people didn't
know who I was a dick she hadn't seen my
face so pre-board bandai's it ran for
seven years and food at work and going
to conferences at the same time
eventually I was someone suggested me to
become a java champion so in I guess
februari 2007 or January 2007 I'm never
quite sure so nearly 10 years again yes
yes sir can have a little beer
celebration to myself in a couple of
months time well thank you so much for
all that you do for the java champion
program and enjoy the rest of your time
