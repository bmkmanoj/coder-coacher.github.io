there I'm your employee from Oracle
technology Network and I'm here today at
devoxx interviewing Jim Weaver
tell us a little bit what you do what do
I do
like professionally yes okay well I'm a
java evangelist kind of borrowing a
religious term I guess I like to call
myself a java technology
activist actually that's my favorite
title because I'm very passionate about
rich client Java and so I joined Oracle
after doing that in the community being
an advocate for rich client Java and
Java FX joined Oracle in April and I'm
doing that as my day job okay do you
like it I love it I love working for
work all right and I love being able to
do some of my favorite things which is
to work with the Java community work
with the greatest people in the world
and and I get to travel for example here
I am in ant work and interfacing with
some great people all over the world
and I get to play with great toys and
and and technology so yeah I really do
like my job so you've been working on
Java effects so tell us a little bit
what's new since last year what's new
since last year on Java FX a lot of
things are new actually the version 2.2
came out and it's got a lot of nice
features to it that have been added one
really nice thing is that it's been it's
it's been ported to Mac o ax so now it's
on Linux Mac OS X of course windows also
there is an embedded job FX available
it's a it's Java arm but Java FX
libraries available for those things so
like for example on the Beagle board so
you can begin experimenting with Java FX
on unembarrassed
where a lot of times developers have
wondered especially with all the buzz
about html5 do I use html5 or do I use
Java FX and the answer really is you
don't have to make a decision because
those two play very well together and so
one of the nice things about the new
things in Java FX is this web view
control which is a WebKit port which
then allows you to to do to leverage the
best of both worlds html5 and JavaScript
client Java and then talk between them
between Java and JavaScript and back so
that's another really nice thing about a
really nice new thing another really
nice thing is that that Java has had
this issue over the years with
deployment both deploying the platform
itself that the the JRE the Java Runtime
environment but also in deploying job
applications so one of the nice features
about in the new versions of Java FX is
this idea of self-contained applications
so where a developer can create very
easily a native package that has a
native installer that then installs
including the runtime the the runtime
version of the runtime that they want on
the user's machine and at Java one for
example we demonstrated that one of the
showcase Java FX applications is
actually in the in the Mac App Store so
this idea of being able to to create
native installers so that the users can
have the experience of just clicking and
going through a normal install process
of the application makes it very
deterministic and easy for the user so
that's another new thing that's an
exciting feature so what kind of tool
can developers use trainers really any
any kind of tools they want the ones
that are kind of by default when you go
to the Oracle website to download Java
FX and Java is NetBeans but other tools
if your favorite tool is eclipse for
example the gentleman by the name of Tom
Schendel has an open-source project
called EF X eclipse in which he has
plugins that that have very good support
for Java FX also you can use many
developers use IntelliJ you could use J
developer from Oracle lots of different
tools you can use for you just use your
favorite IDE and you have also like what
kind of tools do you have for designers
just any kind of design tools that you'd
like for vector graphics or or you know
bitmap graphics those kinds of things
for the graphical world also we have a
tool called scene builder which provides
a drag-and-drop interface where if you
don't want to code the the UI by hand
express it in code we have something
called scene builder where you can
drag-and-drop user interface components
into a scene and then you can hook those
things up into the code to where when
you click a button on the scene for
example it's going to invoke the code
that's in your NetBeans project so
that's a very powerful paradigm
something that's easy for for developers
to use and underlying that I'll just you
know mention another buzz word I guess
it's called F XML underlying that the
scene builder is actually kind of a
visual editor but the underlying data is
a as an XML dialect called F XML so at
runtime your application brings in that
F XML which expresses the your scene
graph if you will and then you know
displays it and then you can interact
with it so that's another tool it's a
designer tool that you can use so who is
using JavaFX today you know we see the
adoption in in several areas one of the
the biggest areas we see adoption in is
those that already have existing swing
applications
and JavaFX is really the the next step
after swing so it's it's the swing
successor so there's a lot of companies
and people that have built swing
applications and those are those are the
rich client Java people right so JavaFX
is the next-generation library for for
UI so one of the one of the patterns
that we're seeing is that a lot of them
are migrating piece by piece
or sometimes wholesale the applications
there swing applications into Java
affects one of the features of Java FX
has come something called jfx panel that
you can use in a swing application and
then put Java FX nodes in there so you
don't have to eat the proverbial
elephant all at once so you had a demo
today about this 3d animation oh yeah
yeah after companies - well that was a
company called a couple of companies
involved with that there's a company
called canoe which is a software
development company that specializes in
all sorts of kinds of really nice
development very great company and one
of the technologies that that they have
really been focusing on is Java FX so
they have a customer called Navis which
is a container tracking shipping company
and so the demo one of the demos that we
saw today was an application where they
manage their this Java FX application
helps them manage their shipments but in
addition it shows 2d and 3d views of
their shipyards including the containers
on there and it's very interactive to
where you can drill down into a
container and see what's on board and
and all sorts of business logic
surrounding that so that you can really
get a good handle on what what's in the
yard in a 3d manner
wonderful and it's a it's also real-life
data stream as well so tell us you have
a Maui community right these are all -
of our FX community it's called JavaFX
community JavaFX community calm and what
it is it's a site that's on Java net and
we've just we gave it a URL that
redirects to the - that you know to a
more complicated URL so just remember it
by JavaFX community comm and what we've
tried to do is kind of aggregate and
provide a common place where JavaFX
developers can find resources so one of
the areas is on the left of that site is
a set of links where they can download
java you know maybe new versions of Java
like Java 8 and the JDK they can find
real world examples like like I was
talking about like with this Navis and
others like mint and cellar technologies
there there are some links to - those
adoption stories links to the API thumbs
and things like that but then on the
right we have an aggregated blog feed to
where people that are blogging about
JavaFX
you can see over on the right though the
latest posts and so you can get kind of
an up in a minute
glimpse of what real JavaFX developers
are doing and blogging about and then
learn from the projects that they're
working on also there's a Twitter feed
that that has the hashtag JavaFX so you
can kind of at one glance see what's
going on in the Java community and then
you know it's a good place to kind of
starting point to kind of dive into
resources you might want to have so how
can the developers get involved today I
mean is there something from that
community page that they could also -
yeah absolutely
one of the best ways for developers to
get involved would be to go to that page
download the the SDK the you know the
the Java developer kit which comes with
you know the JDK 7 comes with Java FX so
it's not this other thing that you have
to install if you've got Java 7 you've
got Java FX already but then there they
could download then you know NetBeans
they could download some of the samples
so they can learn from samples for
example there's a application called an
ensemble which is one of the samples in
in the download package where the in
samba l-- application that has an
example of all the different types of
things that are in Java FX like the
controls or maybe some or a lot of the
animation objects and graphical objects
charts techniques it's all very
accessible to the developer in this one
application so they can they can click
on on one of the techniques see it in
action and then see The Associated code
and then copy it into their project so a
good way to get involved with DITA you
know download it download some tools
download some examples and just play
with it wonderful yeah plays good yes
it's good so and it was announced at
JavaOne that java effects would be open
source can you talk a little bit about
it right yeah Java FX is in the process
of being open source and so early next
year early in 2013 the plan is to as we
progressively put things out in open
source and that's been happening over
the course of the last several months so
that so then that we can encourage more
participation from the community in
building out you know porting Java FX
and and supplying improvements to Java
FX also there there are projects there's
one open source project called jf extras
which is one that has a lab
where folks like Garrett Grunwald and
others are adding to adding really nice
controls to that that that will then
someday could them potentially someday
be destined for the mainline OpenJDK or
open jfx project wonderful thank you so
much for all this information and use
its thank you for coming thank you thank
you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
