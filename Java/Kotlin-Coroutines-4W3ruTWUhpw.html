adjey brains and today I'll be speaking
about coroutines and for a change it's a
language design talk I hear those have
gone out of fashion a while ago but we
can probably enjoy why anyway so this
talk could have been named async
awaiting yield for example or look at
say it's about fibers or well if you
squint enough we could say it's about
continuations and the thing is that all
these things are more or less
expressible through one another and the
essence of all this is that we're
talking about suspend herbal
computations so something we can stop
where we want again contain I'll try to
give some motivation then show how other
people do it how we do it and then we
may dive deeper into byte codes and
exception handling and stuff if we have
enough time so my mocking of illegal
slide is that I'm trying not to lie but
this hasn't been released yet so all I'm
saying is a note lesson not more final
than Valhalla stuff okay so let's have a
look at this piece of code is there
anything wrong with it anything bad
about this code what
all right that's an option - yeah so I
don't know actually if it's better or
not but if I add this at low game image
from URL it's a time consuming operation
and everything happens on the UI thread
and it's probably not so great because
those guys kick in and I'm a grumpy user
frustrated looking at this so basically
this is why people want asynchronous
computations and of course it's not only
about UI although those guys appear only
only in the UI and so basically we all
want latency and walking is bad and one
way of mitigating this is saying okay
this piece of code is somehow special
it's a suspender wall computation I have
my load image my time consuming the
operation working somewhere else and
Here I am waiting on it which means that
when I get to the await point this is a
suspending call I suspend which means I
don't block the thread anymore so I hand
off the work to the other thread I'm not
working here anymore the UI thread may
crunch on the event and when the time
consuming operation is done
somebody will schedule me back on the
event queue and I'll process the rest of
the code there is a continuation so
basically every suspending call slices
the code block into at least two parts
and the continuation is scheduled back
when the time consuming part is done any
questions at this point
ok I'll be trying to encourage questions
because this keeps people alive there
are different ways of doing this and
this is a screenshot from a JavaScript
program that they know how to read it's
all you care about is this
so one way of doing a synchronous
computations is for having callbacks and
when you want to have one in sync
operation after another after another
after another those callbacks nest into
one another and you get those letters of
curly curly curly curly
so that's dog callback hell and that's
what you have if you use explicit
callbacks an alternative to this will be
futures and doing all those nice
functional Combinator's on futures which
is great especially if your perplexity
is not over the top and if you don't
want much control flow inside but in
practice many people find very very
functional very advanced uses a lot of
type inference and many people would
prefer straightforward control flow
that's just suspending where you wanted
to wait in something else so this is the
motivation we want straightforward code
that works as synchronously without
disturbing the user very much
one constrain that we have is minimizing
runtime support because there are ways
of doing Oh even more that we can do or
with significant work on the runtime
side and we wanted to avoid that I
managed to minimize our implementation
so that in the library will have only
one thing one interface of two methods
is continuation and that's it so all the
rest is compiler magic maybe we'll add
one or two methods here and maybe one
more class to speed things down to speed
things up but that's it so as far as
goals go we want asynchronous
programming supporting a nice white
without explicit call backs without
involved future combinators and we want
maximum flexibility which means we give
the library writer as much power as much
freedom as possible with many
runtime support and no we don't have
macros so we have to somehow divide
something in the language that's
flexible enough so a note on what sort
of core genes we're talking about yeah
yep
oh that's an option we can discuss them
yeah
okay so so far in our mm-hmm okay thank
you so far our current prototype uses
this but maybe with Erics feedback we
change things a lot okay so important
note what we're doing here is stackless
goroutines an alternative would be stack
full which are a lot nicer from the
users point of view because it can
suspend anywhere oh three calls down the
stack you can still suspend and in the
stack with stack this case or you only
can do it inside the async block so we
have inlining so you can also do it in
an inline lambda but still and this is
motivated for us and probably for many
other people's Calvin c-sharp and many
other people do it this way by the
locality of the thing to do stack rule
you have to transform code all over the
program and you need some substantial
overtime support okay any questions at
this point
all right so here's a piece of c-sharp
so this is our pioneer this a few years
ago and this is how you do
I think wait zero but I have two icing
functions one is simply doing some work
actually wasting time for turning
milliseconds and dancing done and the
other does some more work print
something then awaits on the first one
get the result and write to the console
so what I want to emphasize here are
these things which are in flexibilities
of this code so this is sharp solution
says okay we have two key words in the
language async and wait and whenever you
are is async I have to return some sort
of task either a task of something more
just a task or you can return void so
this means that as a library writer
I'm bound to using tasks which is
probably changing in the upcoming
version of versions of c-sharp and I'm
definitely bound to using async and
await even if what I'm trying to express
is not actually in a synchronous
computation but something that uses the
underlying machinery for something else
so in comment we try to go away from
this and make it more flexible so what
we get is something like this so my word
function returns a complete future which
is just a decision for this particular
library
so my async on the right is actually a
function that returns completable future
I have different kinds of a sinc
functions for different sorts of futures
and other synchronous API so Michael
evil future goes away by type inference
and so syntactically all ideas moved
acing from the left to the right but the
important part about this is that all
those are points of flexibility async as
a library function I could have called
it full and a weight is also a library
function night and I could have had
different overloads at that like with
different themes and different semantics
like I could have and a weight that
awaits on many things for example stuff
like that so that's what it looks like
from the user point of view and let's
look at how the libraries written let's
start with a weight I have my
continuation and that's the biggest
interesting part of all this so when I
declare a white I have to annotate with
suspend so that the father knows that
this is a suspension point and when it
looks at the curly braces the lambda
passed it to the asynch it knows where
to slice it into different pieces so my
weight is a special kind of function and
has two parameters completely future
which is work a right I'm just passing
it inside here and the second parameter
is not mentioned in the code it's passed
and explicitly it's a continuation so
that when my future is done I can
reschedule
the rest of the computation we're like
so and how we implemented setting the
exception handling aside basically I say
completely future went complete I get a
value the result that dumb thing from
the word function and I say continuation
got regime of that failure so this means
that I continue from where I start where
I suspended and that code expects the
result of the weight function so this
value that I'm fascinated here just
works as the is the value away the
village two and is written to the string
variable and then printed hwachun's here
okay yeah and a weight function itself
returns unit so it doesn't return
anything interesting the actual return
for the computation is done through the
continuation more questions yeah yes yes
so there are I'll show the the rest of
the bits but the thing is that the
compiler knows that the lambda after a
sync is the special co-routine lambda so
it sports the suspend functions your
function calls inside that lambda and
transforms the code so that I can
suspend and wraps it into continuation
so on so forth I all show the details
later more questions yep
exactly no no it doesn't explicitly I'll
show you how the two are connected but
it might not even mention that
explicitly yeah it's single-shot and
there are some subtleties about that
that I'm not presenting today but yeah
it's single choy okay let's now look at
how a sink works a sink is again a
function a special function because the
compiler needs to know that the lambda
we pass in as has been transferred so I
say that it's a big golden parameter and
then this may be the most involved part
of this talk because there is a scary
type for the C and actually it's a
normal calling type but not everybody is
familiar with Kyle and it's a function
type and actually an extension function
type so the first bit future controller
is an implicit receiver for the lambda
it's like if you're declaring an
extension function you have the implicit
receiver that works is this inside the
function saying here the future
controller works is this inside the
lambda a weight is actually the method
of this controller so you can call
weight without qualification because
this is implicit then the lambda may
have parameters in this case it doesn't
and we don't actually know there when
you use cases for that but for
generality was still supported and then
this function returns a continuation
which is kind of a funny kind of
condition because it doesn't continue
anything it's actually starts the
computation so it's the first chunk of
code before the first suspension it's a
way to start the computation so in the
body of a sink we simply create an
instance of a controller we initialize
the let's go routine with the controller
instance
and then resume so basically we execute
this code and the whole point of this
async is to return a completely future
so of the controller has the future
instance inside it I'll show your
controller in the next slide and we
return that questions here so the job of
a sync is to take this lambda that's
transformed to be suspended all
initialize it start the computation and
return whatever useable instance there
is completely future in this case
questions yeah yep yeah it's a design
choice here or we do it synchronously we
could have done it on a different thread
or any how else so here it's a lot of
flexibility I have my library code by
fingertips more questions okay now the
controller can you see the code
hopefully Bach can actually zoom in so
it shouldn't have asked their controller
is a class first it allocates a new
completable future instance that needs
to go that needs to communicate to the
end user then it has a weight that we've
talked about already and it has to
handler functions one is hen result
which is called everytime if you lambda
tries to return something like for the
word function there is a string that we
evaluate to so upon a completion of that
computation hen result is called with
this done constant and what it does
inside is future dot complete so that's
the result for the computation questions
here okay oh yeah yeah thank you so
there is a second parameter which has a
funny type continuation of nothing
nothing is an empty type which means
that you can a call continue should not
resume here because there is no possible
argument it can pass to it we can still
continue with exception so you can fail
at this point at least and maybe well
the continuation interface a little
further and see see about more questions
okay yeah I was about to tell you about
that anyway so the last method here is
handling exceptions so if there is any
exception that tries to cross the
quarantine boundary it will be handled
by this method here I'll and get into
details a little further the last thing
is that we have an annotation here not
sure if it will stay an annotation will
be a modifier it says that this
controller allows suspend extensions
which means that so normally by default
all the suspending functions are weight
weight many so on so forth have to be
members of the controller so that a
library author has full control and what
the actual curtain will suspend on but
if I don't have anything to hide I can
declare this controller is open is allow
suspend extensions and then I can add so
I as a as an end user or the second
library can add more suspend functions
to that controller so that's answering
your previous question so I can have
outside the controller I can have a
suspend suspend function it is an
extension to controller call it await
again but have it work on not on a
completely future but a reasonable
future from guava for example and
whatever code code there is the logic is
the same so I assume normally all with
exception and in the same async block I
can now use both completable futures and
listenable features so it allows me to
compose different kinds of futures in
the same machine questions here all
right
yeah I was about to walk you through but
for good provided by that so summary on
the library part all we need to create a
library that implements async has
declared the coding builder async
function with the quarantine parameter
basically that's it so all the other
parameters may be arbitrary do anything
you like
you have to have one course in parameter
to be according to other then we declare
to spin functions normally inside inside
a controller but maybe not and the
continuation is implicitly passed inside
this function and the controller class
can handle all the intermediate state
there is and it's a scope declaring the
suspension functions and handlers for
return values and exceptions questions
yeah
okay the question is there are those
handle result and oh sorry handle result
and handle exception how are they cold
so basically when the compiler sees
equity it looks for return points and at
every return point there is a call to
handle result injected and handle
exception I'll show you later okay more
questions here all right we've seen a
sink let's look at yield and this time
well we'll be looking at it so the
library implementation about it how its
compiled so this is a piece of c-sharp
and again there are in flexibilities
here and c-sharp a yielding function a
generator function has to return
enumerable and it uses keyword you
return to actually yield value so add a
new bit so the whole thing here computes
a lazy infinite sequence of Fibonacci
numbers okay find a bug please keep it
to yourself okay so so this is like an
infinite list and here's the same thing
in : so in carbon we have sequences for
lazy things and iterables for eager
things or here it will be a sequence
generate as my function the scoping
function for necro routine and my yield
is just a function I can also have you
all for example next to yield and it
will take another sequence and killed
every element of it so it should be more
or less straightforward how we write
this library here is a piece of code so
my generate has the same structure
creates a sequence object with an
iterator with some sort of controller
I'm not
- details of how the controller works
and the yield is a method of the
controller that's it
questions here alright so a question to
the audience why this continuation takes
a unit here it's just just to wake up
alone yeah you know that is interesting
so that's because yield doesn't return
anything so this this thing is the
return type oh that the quoting guests
from yield and since it doesn't do
anything interesting its unit that's it
so we're not we're not using yield as an
expression it's a statement doesn't do
anything it doesn't return anything
interesting yeah yeah we could do a more
involved thing but we don't
how would what yeah every sink returns a
different failure so we just I will not
scroll the slides back but the idea is
that here yield uses the type parameter
of the class but it could have declared
its own type rounder yeah that would
type okay so all this is compiled
through a standard technique to state
machines so the idea is that we have
suspension points here my yield one and
yield next our suspension points and I
have to be able to stop somewhere wrap
the rest into a continuation and then
continue so the way it's done we
basically say that there is an initial
State l0 and then every suspension point
generates a new state in the state
machine and we just remember the current
state and when we continue with jump to
that state and continue from from from
there that's it so here here we have the
initialization than the trivial edge
between
l1 and l2 just checks for true actually
it's emptying the byte code and then
this loop edge does the work actually
every time and every state yields
something apart from the English one
so all this so I'll go outside in all
this machinery is compiled into a an
anonymous class obviously for for this
Curtin lambda we're trying to economise
in the number of objects allocated here
so this same class works as a lambda
itself and as a continuation so we only
have one instance for everything and
that's why we have to implement function
one here and continuation as well it has
a controller instance the label is the
current state of the state machine we
have our fields for local variables so
corn next here have to be stored in the
in between the operational lifetimes of
the coroutine then we have invoke this
is for the lambda I'll skip it and
receive a resume with extension with the
exception or the continuation methods
and they are both implemented through
this do resume method that actually
contains the state machine so well now
zoom into that one any questions here
anybody cares about those volatile
things here okay I'll get back to them
maybe later ok so now they do is you
method okay what's that no no both is
always there we actually don't need so
many of them only one would be alright
but we need some to account for the
multi-threaded cases because it wouldn't
sink Rinnai the state otherwise okay so
when I so what line do is you looks like
I have my label field that contains the
current state and resume is basically it
starts with a switch on the state that
basically jumps into some position in
the code so it's basically the original
code of the untransformed lambda where
we insert a bunch of labels and a bunch
of research that's about it
so my L 0 corresponds to the first
branch then L 1 for the second so on so
forth and each each label ends with
assigning the new state and doing yield
so this is a suspension this how
suspension works we call the suspending
function and return that's it so we
return the control to the whoever called
us the for loop most likely for this
case questions here yep
we have some restrictions we haven't
implemented both but will implement
awaiting in finally blocks and some
other cases are prohibited yep yes and
that's the point because if there is an
exception from yield I either terminate
the whole thing and it's invalidated
altogether or I handle it because there
might have been a try-catch a user
try-catch around this and then it's okay
well if we if we handle this well
continue in the code and reach another
label assignment before we suspend again
okay now now let's have a look at how we
start so to start I initialize my local
variables this is a chunk from from the
original code and I have nothing else to
do so I just copy those values to the
fields assign the state and make a
suspension call that's the trivial part
and so this is user code the rest is
bookkeeping so here I just remember
whatever I have on my stack frame and do
the suspension magic next from l1 to l2
I have to first restore the state on to
the stack then maybe I have been resumed
with the exception so if there is an
exception I throw it and whatever
trycatch I am surrounded with well we'll
handle that or it will just be thrown
upwards then again I have nothing much
to do because it's while true in between
me and the next thing so I just save the
state back into the fields and make a
suspension call that's how it works
the Priya straight board any questions
here
no it's actually we optimized that only
shared the variables that are shared
between states are copied into the field
other others are just very local so we
don't care about it huh yeah we do not
find those don't like never release that
much thank you okay so that's it
basically to summarize first note that
we can't express generating yield as
well as async/await so it's not a single
use case feature it's like double use
case feature and then so takeaway is a
cartoon body is a compiled to a state
machine and there's only one instance
allocated for the whole thing yeah okay
now the second ex thing is exception
handling so let's think we're exceptions
can come from in this picture so first
thing of course an exception can happen
in my workload so I owe exception may
happen when I am reading from somewhere
then a wait can throw like and yield
can't throw so a library code can throw
something so this one is asynchronous it
happens when I'm not on the stack
actually this one is synchronous but it
comes from library code this one is
still synchronous run set image
something I'm just genuinely calling has
thrown I have to handle that as well so
there are different sources of
exceptions library code can throw
synchronously quoting code can throw
synchronously and the workload can throw
asynchronously and then there are at
least two parties that can catch a
routine can have its own try catch
written by the user inside so there some
exception can be caught and library code
can handle whatever it likes
if account so Alfred with how library
code does that I mentioned that before
so I learned a little bit in the
previous slide
because my do resume function is a
little bit more complicated the whole
body of the method all the labels are
wrapped in one big try-catch that says
if anything happens inside those labels
and is not handled there it's caught and
passed on to the controller so
controller handles all the exceptions
including out of memory error
unfortunately then how will it try to
cross the the boundary of the core team
so anything is passed to the controller
and then we can read throw we can do
anything we can try to reset resume
whatever so that's that's how library
handles things a little more details and
that thing I showed a few slides ago how
we reroute asynchronous exceptions so if
something happened in my a synchronous
computation in the case of completable
future I'll get notified about it so my
when complete has the exception
parameter here and if that is not null I
say resume with exception which passes
the value here and every time I assume
from anything first thing I do after
restoring my stack it is if there is an
exception I throw it maybe there is no
handler inside the quarantine it will
cross the boundary and go to the
controller maybe there is a try-catch
around and it will handle it questions
here okay
it's if a
oh yes sure thank you very much yeah so
let's have a look at this example had my
async UI it's the first example I was
showing in the motivation slides and
there are those marks where something
can go wrong so the actual operation
order here is I first call load image
synchronously for it to give me a future
back simultaneously it starts some
actual work on the separate thread so my
first operation is load image that may
fail synchronously and that will be
handled by this trycatch then some
actual work is going on and I do a
weight synchronously so I'm trying to
suspend if a weight is not happy it
throws it throw synchronously again and
will be handled right away with this try
catch and as we discussed with Remy if
there wasn't a throw here it could fall
through here and it's alright that's how
I wrote my program then so after I wait
I suspend I get shelves somewhere my
actual work completes and schedules me
back so that may have completed with an
exception so we will say resume with
exception pass it in first thing I do
after I resume I throw that exception I
catch it again with this sink bracket
log and throw and it's alright so in the
last thing that happens is this
synchronous call here if it froze it
just goes to the controller questions
exactly yeah yeah it does compile
because there is throw a here no it
shouldn't
yeah more questions yeah it's about it
we're thinking about the possibilities
of like resetting your core routine so
that it maybe not like dead but it's
current state is dead
more questions
alright so somewhere here so we wanted a
uniform treatment of all exceptions
synchronous and asynchronous by both
user code and library kind of achieved I
think the default handler by the library
is controller handle exception if it's
there if it's not there nothing happens
and it's just thrown up the stack so
what I've not covered in this talk I
should have because I'm talking very
fast and the questions don't take very
much time is finally so finally is it
pain in the neck everywhere so one thing
is when so when you suspend in a finally
block what happens then you may have a
stack of finally blocks actually out of
your head and if it's a spin there it
means that there might have been an
exception and again I have to read
through you have to maintain this
information about what finally blocks
you how to complete after you handle the
exception that's pretty messy I can't be
done I will do it and not prototype yet
so that's one thing another thing is how
the library can interact with whatever
finally blocks you you have in your code
team because so the problem there is
that I could have used my yield to read
a lazy sequence from a file for example
and that file has to be closed
when I completed the iteration or why my
for loop that iterates has drawn an
exception to support this I need an
extra method on the continuation or
something else it says ok something bad
happened execute only finally blocks and
that's another massive part of the
transformation on one hand on the other
hand Java and coughlin don't have the
notion of disposable iterator so the
semantics of a for loop in common as
well as in Java is that you just iterate
well until you hit the end the semantics
of for loop and c-sharp for example is
that you iterate until we hit the end
but around you there is a try finally
that in the finally block checks if the
iterator is disposable and disposes it
whatever happens which is great and
we're thinking of whether we can
actually retrofit this feature and call
them 101.1 somehow it will work it will
be loud brittle with the old code with
the Java code but it may be worth it
we'll see yeah so this has been the bulk
of my talk talk but I have an appendix
about like dreaming about very distant
weird applications let's try to read
through this so I have a fictional
function serializable async which is
running on a server and what I do in
this block is I show the user
registration form
so yeah show registration form you type
in your username and password
I send you a confirmation email you go
have a tea and when you return you click
on the link in the email I received that
I resumed a confirm your registration
and show a welcome screen or you can
never come back the teas too tasty I
cancel so the thing is this is what we
do on the server side all the time all
sorts of asynchronous communication with
the user
but of course I'm not anywhere in memory
even not only on the stack I'm not in
memory when you're drinking tea right so
to to do this to be able to suspend on
all those calls and basically put that
into the database until your return I
have to see relies a lot of data well
here it's not a huge lot I I need to
serialize the label and then you use
your information but in general it may
be in general it may be a lot of status
you realize and it's an open question
for us whether we should or shouldn't do
it because everybody knows how tough
civilization is and how messy but it's
very appealing because we've seen lots
of examples of such code that can be
simplified greatly because if you expand
this as a state machine it won't be so
bad but if you make it a little more
real it's really bad so this is a dream
we're thinking about it to implement
something like this well needs some kind
of reflection API on the court in the
state and we have to somehow make it
stable to if you serialize the new
