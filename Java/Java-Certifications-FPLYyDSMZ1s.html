in Sao Paulo my guest
is Maria Maria hi hi so you are a
programmer and professionally and you do
so what do you what do you use as a
language oh okay I use a Java and Java
Enterprise Edition so I have been
working with Java for 14 years and I
always use Java and Java frameworks like
certain GPA new API is from Java today I
work at IBM I am a software engineer
senior software engineer in Watson IOT
lab here in San Paolo and we develop
some new services to bluemix from why ot
like to connect devices for example we
have and you serve some bluemix now name
it IOT for electronics and you can
connect any device electronic device
easily in the platform a bluemix
platform and of course the clients can
see how people are using the devices for
example wash machine how my clients are
using this wash machine and it's very
available asset we are creating and we
develop using mostly Java so and you
have a presentation actually on Saturday
1:00 in the Java track yes about so Java
certification yes I want to talk about
Java certification because I take my
certifications recently and of course
I'd i was postpone it but it's really a
very important thing to do after you do
a certification you are going to be most
recognized in your job and you can get
pass over to units before looking to you
with on other eyes and of course
we are going to improve your knowledge
if we stitch the certification so it's
really very important to do this and I
strongly recommend that people go to to
certificate and I'm going to talk a
little bit about the first two
certifications first two exams and so
which one so is it Java is your
associate the one z0 803 and 804 the
associate and programmer tests and I'm
going to talk a little bit about how is
the past what we need to do how you can
prepare to do the test some tips about
things that you need to pay attention
about so so what are those tips because
we want to know a nice talk about the
Java certification and I hope people
feel motivated to to do the
certification so I know a lot of people
have so you can that you can pay for
training or you can just take the test
at the end right so which one do you
recommend do you recommend that people
do the preparation as part of the of the
certification or just study themselves
or I mean what is a work of the tines I
mean for example I did the certification
and I program for a long time so of
course hmmm oh I have more feelings
about what to do and I understand more
about Java and I think if you don't have
any contact with Java you should do the
training because it's very important you
have this first contact and have some
training and so like for example if a
student just comes out of programming
school for example yes I do probably
learn during university like a lot of
languages right so they can it would be
probably a good idea for them to just
start with the full training and at the
analyst yes because job is very quickly
and there is a lot of things that we
need
- no to do the test work for example in
the first one the associate you need to
know a little bit about the Murphy's and
except on handling and something like
these and I mean there's a lot of things
in the test do you need to know and it's
a good idea to do the training if you
don't have practice in Java or if you
just take a look in the university but
you not go deeper and in Java you need
to have some training first and of
course if you like to start by yourself
you can do this but you need to program
a lot and you need to read the books and
theory because the theory it's very
important part on the test it's two
parts that you need to know Terry very
well you need to program a lot because
you need to have a quick your time
transfer the classrooms it's charged you
so you need to read the code you know
and go fast you answer things and of
course you don't have like computer it's
look only I mean of course you do the
test in the computer but you should not
able to code you need to know if
compiled or not compile yourself just
reading the code so it's not easy
I see so you can't really test your code
right okay as you are doing the
certification shells these you need to
know very well the theory and program a
lot all the examples and don't have
doubts so they are also sometimes like a
test preparations right I mean so there
is a training but there is also like you
probably can take like a cool test yes
yes there are some yes you should do
some some so tests like mock tests like
all mock tests and so you can measure if
are going well or not and you can know
if are preparators should take the
certification or not if you pass in for
example shoot to full test to mock test
of course who are preparing to do the
real test
other advice I think you're motivated to
do this work hard and in study hard and
don't don't think you could not be able
to do this you need to think you are
able to do this sometimes it seems hard
but if you need to think oh I am able to
do this and I'm going to do this and so
of course you are going to take her
certification so any in general any
career advice that you that I mean
things that you found that were really
helpful and helped you in your career
okay it's important of course
certification it's a very important
point because the big companies look to
these and as I said better better
opportunities come from from these and
you need to have soft skills it's a very
good advice I mean you can be up great
programmer but you don't know how to
communicate if you don't know how to
speak English just a little or just to
read at least you need to know these and
you need to know how to cooperate
working with a plane with a team and
have these soft skills this is a very
important point thank you so much thank
you for coming and talking to us and
good luck thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
