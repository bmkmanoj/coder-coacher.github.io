off shore of the the Kona Coast of a big
island of hawaii and it's actually being
captured and streamed live off of one of
our of our robots that's wandering
around in the ocean out there the liquid
robotics got got started back in 2005
when a guy named Joe rizzi who has a
house in Hawaii and he could see the
whale sort of jumping you know outside
his kitchen window he was kind of
wondering you know why can't I listen to
them too and being an engineer he did
the usual things of you know going out
in a rowboat with a microphone in a long
piece of wire and learning why that
didn't work and all kinds of other
little experiments and somewhere along
the line you decided that what he needed
was a sort of a radio-controlled car for
the ocean and you know he brought in his
friend Derek Hine and then Derek writing
this on Roger mine and they came up with
this rather strange robot to one of the
ocean and carry initially the this
acoustic sensor out there and they did
this as a part of this this this
foundation that Joe is involved with
something called the Jupiter foundation
they're actually the ones that own the
wave glider thats collecting the the
audio stream you're listening to right
now and if you go to Jupiter foundation
org during whale season in hawaii which
is january-february march miss of april
they almost always have a wave glider or
two out off the coast you know some
somewhere around the Big Island er Maui
listening to the whale singing and right
about now there are a lot of Wales and
it's a little quiet now because it's
sort of the the middle of the night
there
round about Don it can get pretty
exciting but you go to Jupiter
foundation any time you'll hear a live
stream from from our from our robot so
this isn't actually such a big change
for me this is a picture of me and Mike
my first job is a geek I was my mom says
I was 14 in that picture and I'm not
sure I was a might have been 15 but I
got this job working at the University
of Calgary being a code monkey for a
bunch of physicists who had some
experiments on the ice is to satellite
and for me that was like more fun than
anything I could imagine so now I'm back
doing that here's some more more
pictures of the the the satellite herbs
I was working with at the time the
picture in the top left corner is the
the satellite where you can see the the
photometer array that sort of tube thing
that was the thing that I was taking the
data streams off of and I was helping
make the pictures at the bottom and
that's a great way to learn how to
program and of course the the computer
in this picture is a PDP 8 which has
less less compute power than the smart
card and inside the phone in your pocket
you know so these days it's a very very
different world and there were robots
that we build are not your typical robot
you know people tend to think of robots
as things that have arms and legs and
you know laser cannons and the whole not
the whole nine yards our robots are kind
of a surfboard with this weird thing
that's the sort of dangles below them
that has all these little wings on them
and and the the surfboard it's it's kind
of floating on the surface it's being
tossed around by the waves and that's
important because the waves make it move
up and down and there's a there's a
cable this is in this photograph this
one it was fitted with a shorter than
normal cable normally there about seven
meters or 21 feet so the the float is
is in the waves and the little way the
wings are down in the calm part of the
ocean and so here's a little picture of
how it works when the wave pulls the
float up the little rack of wings gets
pulled up and they they sort of rotate
and if you just sort of imagine you know
dragging a wing through the water
generates forward thrust then when the
wave goes down the little wing of things
I've descends and it and it goes forward
again one of the really important things
about this is there's no computer
control in this as in this this this
this thing that the little wings they
they literally flop back and forth on
hinges and they have Springs and they
just respond naturally to the motion of
the waves and they they'll they'll
harvest energy from the waves 24 hours a
day there it's a really really simple
mechanism which is really important
because it makes them very very reliable
there are some some issues with it so
it's the motor that you can't turn off
you have absolutely no control over how
fast the thing goes or whether or not
the thing goes it is always moving so if
you want to stop you have to do
doughnuts if you want to slow down you
have to zigzag and if you want to speed
up well you've got a limit these things
go about a knot and a half on a gun a
good day we've got a new one in the
works that should go somewhat faster but
being able to be out there 24 hours a
day for a long periods of time is a
really really valuable thing so the the
these devices are really platforms for
sensors we can put all kinds of things
on them there are we can put cameras on
them we can put weather stations on them
these days we almost always put a
weather station on them
we can put these things called Doppler
velocity loggers or a bcp adaptive
Doppler current profilers that measure
the speed of the water their sensors
that measure wave height their sensors
that measure all kinds of things about
water chemistry we can detect algae we
can detect crude oil we can detect just
crud we can measure salinity there are
actually people that have sensors that
you can put on these things that will
actually do do certain amounts of DNA
sequencing you can we can measure just
about anything you want want to measure
and the course that the only thing that
we can mechanically move is this little
thing down at the bottom this this this
little square piece here this little
paddle is actually the rudder and that's
the only thing that the computer can
mechanically control is the rudder and
so we have to do everything around the
guidance of the system just by big
wiggling the rudder and you know so that
that makes navigation and such much
simpler because there's only one thing I
could play with don't have to worry
about 3d modeling and collision analysis
of arms and all that because they got no
arms so I mean a life is easy but life
is hard it's interesting so inside the
float there's a bunch of boxes that
contain wires there's a there's a box in
the middle that is the command and
control unit in the the current
generation of machines it's a it's this
very strange processor with only 64 K of
ram and the fact that it works at all I
find just just amazing the next
generation machine the one that I'm
working on it's got an an ARM processor
and it's you know it's pretty much the
guts of a cell phone which means it's
pretty deluxe there's there's lots and
lots of room and lots and lots of
compute power and since you know don't
have to do any graphics rendering
we're not you know showing movies to the
fish or anything like that we've got
lots of leftover compute power and then
we've got these these these payload
boxes that customers can put electronics
for whatever sensors they want into and
then there are no way still were to wire
things up so that you can put the sensor
on the upper hall or down down below on
the on the glider and they're also
cables that go through the umbilical to
talk to the to the rudder module and we
do almost all of our communication with
the shore using the Iridium satellite
network if we're really lucky and we
happen to be close to shore we can use
gsm the cell phone next network turns
out we're almost never close enough to
short to use a cell phone network but if
we can we do and certainly in our
engineering site in Hawaii that's what
that's what we do but one of the
interesting / painful issues with
iridium is that it's not cheap so it
runs about a dollar a kilobyte to move
data which is not that what you guys are
paying and you know so you know I really
really really don't have a big data
problem so here's our our manufacturing
shop this is this is where we build them
which is just about 30 feet from where
I'm sitting right now and there's a
bunch of wave gliders that are in the
process of being being built you can see
their their weather stations on top the
are the solar cells here's a here's a
glider rack being assembled here's a few
more of them that are they're getting
ready to be to be shipped the the black
paint on these is is this paint that's
got a bunch of copper in them if they're
going to be out in the ocean for a
really long way of blunt long time we
have to
make sure that that all kinds of you
know malas mollusks do not grow on them
so it did make sure that that the things
like like limpets and such don't done
don't start growing on them which really
slows them down and luxe them up but
these things are really tough you know
like I was saying earlier on the design
is really simple so there are fewer
things to fail they've been through like
just incredible storms this this year
alone we went through 14 hurricanes or
hurricane equivalents now the word heart
hurricane is a funny one because it only
applies to storms in the Atlantic
they're called you know you know
tropical cyclones or monsoons or
typhoons and they're all really the same
thing just in different oceans so the
chart at the top here is a is an event
that happened just did just a few weeks
ago this this last New Year's one of our
robots off the coast of Australia just
to the to the east of Australia kind of
near New Caledonia went through category
three so on on the Left there's this
charter the the wind spike did about nye
think it was 91.7 knots and then on
there on the right you can see that this
chart here is the is the wave height and
it in it Pete just shy of 10 meters so a
10 10 meter waves or 30 feet which is
this is certainly not the biggest storm
we've been through but but it's a pretty
recent one and you know in storms like
that you know ships just get out of
there it's really interesting to look at
plots of of you know the location of
ships in the Gulf of Mexico in hurricane
season because the all the ships head
for head for port and all of our little
robots that are out there they just stay
there because
they actually like waves they do really
well in waves and and and there people
always ask about things like sharks do
we get shark attacks well we almost
never get shark attacks we've had to one
of them we hardly knew happened except
we found a dent in a wing and then we
had one that got fairly seriously mauled
here's its its glider rack after has
been pulled out of the water and you can
see scratches all over the place and he
was really big these these wings are
fairly large and for him to have been
able to get his mouth on those wings and
scratched deep down Wade where he did
this was a large shark interestingly
enough when you look at it really all he
ever did was just like scratch the paint
here we've pulled one of the cables out
of the out of the cable protector but
this little little dis little white
triangle here that's a piece of tooth
that was embedded in it and we've taken
that bad tooth and picking it around to
a bunch of shark experts and nobody has
a clue what it was other than you know
big and nasty but the glider came
through the this this major shark
mulling pretty much unscathed except
that the there was one place where the
cable was unprotected and you can see
this little nick in the in this one
rubber cable and that unfortunately was
the communication line to the rudder so
it was left of drifting a couple hundred
miles off the coast of Maui and we had
to go out and get it and so we
redesigned in that one little piece of
cable is now protected it's now inside
something that's that's reasonably safe
from you know giant shark chomps so what
do you do with these things do we use
them for things like being a weather
buoy here's one that's that's
actually doing doughnuts around a NOAA
weather buoy the little almost
impossible to see white baseball sized
thing here is a weather station that got
most of the instruments that you see
here and this one is actually just doing
doughnuts around this weather buoy tit
for calibration but unlike unlike a
weather buoy you don't have to you know
rent a ship for a hundred thousand
dollars a day to go out to the middle of
the Atlantic to install it you pretty
literally just throw it off the end of
the pier in deep water and it will swim
itself out to the middle of the Atlantic
and do donuts for a few months until it
needs to be cleaned off then you'd like
have it swim in and you scrub off the
barnacles and it swims back out again
they get used in the oil and gas
business to do things like communicate
with the various instruments that they
have on the gun that on the sea floor to
do various kinds of monitoring around
the drilling rigs to you know major
things like water chemistry and such so
here's here's one in the Gulf of Mexico
monitoring water chemistry around a rig
after the the BP oil disaster people got
really really really sensitive about
pollution so that's been a good business
for us also get used or starting to get
used for doing a marine mammal
monitoring they're all kinds of places
where where people actually care about
marine mammals so like in the oil
business they're not allowed to do
things that make really loud noises
whenever there are marine mammals in the
neighborhood and these days the the
standard is to have a bunch of guys
standing up on it on the corners of the
rig looking out in the ocean and if they
see something that looks maybe like a
whale's tail then they have to shut down
and they are looking for a better way to
do that so we're starting to help folks
with that
these things can be used as a picket
fence around marine sanctuaries who've
been doing number of trials about on
that we've been involved in a whole
bunch of global warming studies a while
ago we did a large survey of ocean
temperatures in the Arctic one of the
nice things about our little guys is
that they're much cheaper to send back
and forth over a big swak of ocean and
you know so so we did this this survey
of Arctic water temperatures and the
numbers that we got back are scary be
scared we also get used you know
depending on the sensor you know people
can do things like like talk to
underwater vehicles all kinds of weird
sea floor sensors that you can get like
like tsunami detectors and occasionally
they're used for public transportation
this is this is one of our wave gliders
this was just like a few days ago off
the off the north west coast of
Australia we don't get much problems
with birds hitching rides but you know
it's always kind of sweet when they do
we sometimes get questions about what
happens when they win the bird craps on
the solar panels and fortunately the the
waves wash the crap off pretty quickly
they tend to be you know pretty clean so
enough context what am i doing what am i
up to so I'm working on a pile of things
right so I'm the chief software
architect here so we're working on a
next-generation robot which has more
power and better hydrodynamics it's
actually got a thruster on it one of the
interesting things if you've spent much
time we round around the ocean there's
sort of an inverse correlation between
sunshine and wave height when it's
really sunny the the waves tend to be
pretty calm and
and vice versa so when when the waves
are calm we don't get as much thrust or
the the the wave racks as we can as we
would like normally it's only a problem
in the tropics like in the Gulf of
Mexico but we are adding adding a
thruster to it the really hard bits is
that we've got customers that are
talking about you know hundreds or
thousands of wave gliders we currently
don't have numbers like that we've got a
pretty decent number out there but the
way that they're operated right now they
have operators who actually pay
attention to each one one at a time and
it's a real pain in the ass and so to
you know make them be much more
autonomous to be able to do things like
dodge ships on their own without
requiring human intervention that's what
I'm what I'm doing so the the onboard
software is going to get much much more
sophisticated so this is the the cart
full of electronics that these days is
occupying most of my life this is the
the guts of a next-generation wave
glider also pulled apart and you see the
the arrow that's pointing to this little
little bored here that's a that's an arm
running java SE embedded on on linux the
java SE embedded it's really really
lovely product i'm so happy with it its
performance has been great and with the
the latest not not yet FCS version of
NetBeans the 7 dot 3 release I've been
running the dailies of NetBeans but the
the latest NetBeans has got sort of
special plug-ins for dealing with the
performance monitoring on the embedded
on the embedded arm vm and so I could
you know do performance monitoring
actually on board the onboard the robot
as it flies it's really really great you
know the the state of the art for most
people doing embedded program in these
days is you know roughly VI and you know
doing debugging in that is really really
tough in the Java world this stuff gets
so much easier and it's been fun working
with a bunch of embedded systems
engineers who are expecting this stuff
to be hard and it just it just falls
apart and becomes really really easy so
these wave gliders really are part of a
much larger network architecture right
so we've got the wave gliders out here
that have a network link through the
Iridium satellite to a satellite ground
station satellite ground station is
redundantly sending packets to a couple
of different data centers and this is a
really simplified diagram but we have
this this this this data cluster
architecture that lets us you know
kippah you know and eventually
consistent fault tolerant got a yachtie
storage of all the samples that come off
the wave gliders and then these this
this these data cluster nodes then feed
a variety of web applications and
desktop applications and when I first
got here you know when I when I was
thinking about how to do these data
cluster nodes I was thinking about using
you know any of the the usual no sequel
candidates but I kept bumping into ways
in which you know this universe is just
just different between the the real
paranoia about about reliability and the
fact that we don't actually have a whole
lot of data and the fact that we wanted
to be able to slice and dice the data
tories and kind of fine-grained ways and
we needed to have authentication so we
need to be able to say who gets day to
get access who gets access to what data
win fairly precisely so we actually have
authentication information on every data
sample so we can do things like you know
sell the data from the weather station
the weather sensor on you know all the
gliders in the Gulf of Mexico get sent
to Noah and then so the NOAA folks can
securely see all the weather data but
they don't get to see the the you know
the water chemistry data from the people
who are doing oil prospecting and it
gets streamed back and forth and then
there are all kinds of issues about
around where the data can physically
reside just because of you know between
there are all these these these weird
data privacy rules that are much more
contorted than that you use privacy
rules and then and then the tax lawyers
get involved it's like you pay taxes on
on on data differently depending on
where the data resides it's like oh lord
please you know anytime your network
architecture is if is affected by your
tax accountants just run so I ended up
doing what was either like the stupidest
thing I've done in years or their the
the most fun thing I've done in years
which is I built my own eventually
consistent note no sequel data
repository and it's this streaming
telemetry server and it's so it's it's
you know coefficient of reality is
noticeably less than one but it's it's
it's you know it's vapor pressure
certainly greater than zero we're using
it you know actively every day and I'd
like to think it's a lot more reality
than vapor but who knows none of it's
really rocket science it's it's you
think
is being kind of kind of a combination
between cassandra and JMS and it's it's
really optimized for small things that
flow it's not really i mean you can do
blobstore kind of things with it but
generally when we need to do a blob
store for like large audio files in that
we actually use the stream as indexes
and every every chunk has as the
opportunity to be individually
authenticated and you know if somebody's
looking for a a a general purpose
streaming data system this isn't it it's
really it's really really optimized
really simple so like I said it's not a
big data problem right it's it's a
dollar a kilobyte and it adult thing I
think about it a dollar a kilobyte means
and you take pic the the sort of
standard disk drive you can buy for a
desktop machine these days is about
about three terabytes at three terabytes
it costs us three billion dollars to
fill one disk drive right so at the time
where we're just like finishing our
first disk drive we can afford to launch
our own satellite constellation so not a
big data problem and actually right now
you know we can contain all of the data
from all the robots from the beginning
of time you know on my laptop in ram
with lots of room to spare so we just
think about it differently but
reliability is really really crucial and
a lot of other reliability issues are
somewhat variable so so for things like
like scientific data you know they kind
of needed eventually they don't want to
lose it but they don't need to need to
have it right now but for other stuff
like like the sensor information are
about ships in the neighborhood and most
interestingly ships that might collide
with the robot we care about that data
you know minute by minute and so uh so a
10 20 minute outage can end up with a
robot going through some big ships
propellers and that's you know generally
a bad thing you know so cell failures in
our in our system lead to fleets of
flailing robots thank God they do not
have laser cannons and an authentication
is a big piece of it and we need to be
able to do authentication on individual
pieces our data model is really really
simple the the chunks of data to go
through our just unique bags of bytes
they tend to be just a few hundred bites
bites apiece and and the fact that
they're unique is really really
important and there they tend to be made
unique by the fact that beach bag of
bytes is that has got a time stamp and a
lat long in them and you know a sensor
type and all that but it means that that
for instance to do duplicates
suppression so if you receive a packet
from you know dude duplicate packets
from two places you know if if they look
the same they are the same right you can
just you can just throw it away and the
total data is small so we can afford to
do a lot of redundant copies just I just
out of just out of paranoia so in this
indecision system there are there nodes
the nodes contain data the the nodes can
publish their data to other nodes and
they can subscribe to to other nodes and
the publish and subscribe mechanism has
as you know when you when you subscribe
you express interests when you publish
you will you authenticate and really
it's the intersection of the interest in
authentication that determine what
actually goes out in in the stream and
all you have to do is is is is connect a
couple of these publish-subscribe links
in either in either direction and you've
got nodes that are chatting and
and it's replicating and then you put a
bunch of them together and you've got it
you've got a mesh of nodes that are you
know effectively staying staying
consistent and I do this sort of viral
video echo echo cancellation so you know
how you know viral videos work yes it's
somebody posted a video of a sneezing
Panda and then folks you know send email
to their five closest friends saying I
look at this crazy video and and then
folks just going to repost it to their
friends and puts every now and then our
friends at jeez I've seen that that's
boring and then they don't repost it so
we're just I just just did just do this
the sort of flood replication and and of
course there's there's all kinds of
subtlety for when a node goes down and
then it comes back up again it has to be
able to say well what did I miss and it
gets it gets gets kind of messy but it
to to a first approximation it's pretty
straightforward but it means we've got
all of these nodes that are from the
outside world's point of view absolutely
identical so use you can subscribe to
any of them and you will see the same
the same data stream and and also you
can put these in lots of different data
centers you know one of the one of the
issues with hosting providers is that
you know they not only have like
individual machine failures but whole
data centers can fail and if the the
hosting provider has a software boggy in
there you know whatever or they a fat
finger some configuration problem you
can lose a whole hosting provider so I'm
actually running running cluster nodes
in
in three ISPs right now I'd go grid
it'll add a nice little boutique one
that I like called antic and then with
the folks at Jay elastic it was a really
nice sort of java web app hosting
hosting outfit and you know I've been
very very careful to not use any of the
ISP special ap is right so if you go to
Amazon there are all kinds of really
cool Amazon api's I just don't use any
of them because that's kind of what what
works if you want to spine expand
different data centers and you know in
truth the the kind of API is that most
of these folks have aren't terribly
useful to me so I would just just keep
it simple I can spread it all over the
place and one of the interesting side
effects is that if we ever get hit by a
denial of service attack being on
multiple data centers being able to move
from data center to the data center
pretty easily actually makes that much
more straightforward also when all the
nodes in the cluster are essentially
mirrors of each other then applications
that are really paranoid can actually
subscribe to the same stream but for
multiple multiple sources and since you
know pat packets that look the same are
the same I can do cancellation really
easily so when they the app just does
duplicate some subscriptions to multiple
hosts in the in the cluster and then if
if if if nodes go down the app doesn't
even notice that there's been a failure
there's no interruption in the data
stream and another interesting little
side effect is that the app gets the
data through whatever the fastest path
is you know so that so that if there are
you know not just local failures but
local sort of timing bumps the the
packets get through the network pretty
pretty quickly so that that helps a lot
so you can also take clusters and treat
them as no
goods and then you can use cluster to
cluster links with different filters and
we use that for delivering to customer
private data centers there are all kinds
of jurisdictional issues that we use for
slicing the slicing up the the data boy
I'm going to skip this slide that's a
long talk I think I've already talked
about authentication mostly we use the
open am an open des for any of you who
don't know what those are those are the
the Sun of the Sun identity manager and
it's a when we win son turned them into
open source projects and they're now
actually being looked after by a an
interesting norwegian company name
forgerock it's a largely a bunch of X
son employees who took the the Sun
authentication products and and ran with
them after after Oracle canceled them
really really nice way to do
authentication so another rat hole is
sort of doing the autonomous navigation
it's much easier problem for us because
it's a 2d problem there's only one
actuator the robot actually knows where
it is and it can communicate with the
shore and it moves moves pretty slowly
it is also somewhat harder because these
things have to collaborate and interact
with each other and be out there for a
long time and their way out at sea so we
tend to be really apparent paranoid if
something goes wrong and you're in the
middle of the the North Pacific Guyer
where you're like thousands of miles
from anything if something goes wrong
then you're just right off the robot
because it costs you know 150 thousand
dollars a day to rent a boat to go out
there you're talking at least 20 days
back and forth to fetch it three million
dollars for for a repair run not going
to happen so we get really paranoid one
of my points of inspiration is this
little gizmo here the the guy on it is
is a
drinking buddy of mine from grad school
named mark Donner this was his thesis
project and at the time people were
doing all these walking machines that
had super computers on them and and and
and and mark you know and this is
influenced by significant amounts of
beer so I've noticed one one evening
that you know cockroaches they have six
legs they can walk they don't have super
computers onboard so he spent a lot of
time reading the the literature on the
neural structure of cockroaches and
found out all kinds of interesting
things and he actually built a
programming language that was around
being able to implement neural net well
neural algorithms not neural Nets but
kind of the way that that that the
neural pathways in things like
cockroaches sort of collaborate to move
stuff and and really the the way it ends
up working is it's really really simple
and what looks like complexity is you
know what people call emergent behavior
so the navigation system that I that
I've built it so the the first pass is
one that it's kind of like ants so this
is that this is a simulation that shows
33 wave gliders that are all heading
towards this this goal here the green
dot and this this red dot is is
something that they're trying to stay
around so they just get there and they
just go around it and here's one that's
you know one of the tasks that we get
asked to do is things they're like
picket fences around things like marine
sanctuaries so here's you know a bunch
of robots being dropped in the water and
they guide themselves out to this this
formation here's the same thing only
we've dropped the robots in different
places when if when a fifth one joins
you see that the picket fence it sort of
reshapes itself here's kind of the same
thing it's for join and then a ship
comes
through and this this one in the middle
if you watch it it it's it's dodging a
ship so this is all running nicely in
simulation and what I'm doing right now
is I'm trying to get it to be actually
in the ocean and so sometime in sometime
in April and actually the big problem
right now is that the gliders that can
run this or mechanically not there yet
and this then the the algorithms behind
this is really really simple it's just
these set of three goals you know the
fence is good avoid each other avoid
obstacles duh and then all the all the
complexity sort of emerges and you can
see how they have these really Wiggly
pass because they can't actually stop if
they need to slow down they just they
just sort of like the zigzag and when
they need to stop they just do doughnuts
so thanks that's some of the ones who
run through of what I've been up to
right
so pop up the volume again to you and
thanks very much James for the
presentation so what we're going to do
now is we'll take a few questions from
the audience here and this room just
hooked up via Skype to the room where
James is presenting from so if you have
a question raise your hand I'll hop up
and you can ask yourself and otherwise
we have other two questions from folks
who are watching online which we can
also toss out that you guys you guys
actually make effort to come here in
person so you guys get the first first
David questions for ghazal anyone
oh come on
it's not that late
my question would be the robots you said
you'd spin and if they are sort of
broken how do you feel about the
littering of the sea I mean you put
something out there well we try really
hard to not do that you know how much
this might contribute to the littering
of the ocean it's it's it's completely
microscopic compared to you know you
know one ship lost is you know hundreds
of thousands of our little little little
gliders and I'd like to think we do a
lot more good than harm and we've only
ever abandoned one we actually haven't
completely abandoned it lost its its its
glider unit but it's reporting in and
it's drifting around in the North
Pacific Gyre so we know where it is it's
just you know three million dollars to
go get it and if it happens to drift
close to something that we can go out
and get it from then we'll go do it
so how many of these do you see being
deployed in the future like is the limit
economic or technical for you well you
know we we can't do you know certainly
at a hundred thousand we would have
swamped the Iridium network completely I
don't know how many of the Iridium
network could support but you know
tragically it's not a very big number
but there are people that are trying to
put out replacement stir to iridium and
a lot depends on on you know for the
numbers of them a lot depends on on who
you're talking to and what the
applications are you know so so folks
like like the the folks of you weather
predictions you know in their rich
fantasy life they would like to have
thousands out there there are folks that
would like to do like mongering of
fishing grounds to to block poachers and
you know that would take thousands more
you know if we just you know had a
couple for every you know oil oil
drilling platform out there to measure
the water chemistry around them you know
that would be probably 10,000 you know
the numbers rack up pretty quickly and a
lot of these uses are actually pretty
important
I I was wondering about the
authentication of the data does the road
would actually know who owns the data
from each individual sensor or is that
configured in the data node somehow it's
it's in the data nodes currently and I
was so it's it's the way that the
interior architecture on board the wave
glider is going it's pretty clear that
the wave glider actually has to have
caches of the authentication database or
parts of the attend occation database
because in the very near future like
this month or next we'll be able to drop
in sort of this sort of the equivalent
of a servlet so that the customer can
drop in a piece of of analysis software
and then we do the full sort of security
encapsulation around it and get it acne
I give it access to the stuff that it's
allowed to have access to on board the
wave glider there's a number of our
sensors where we really want to do data
reduction on board the wave glider so 04
for example people doing marine mammal
monitoring it's crazy to move an audio
stream back to shore at you know a
dollar a kilobyte instead what you want
to do is do the audio analysis on board
the vehicle and then then just send a
message that says hi i found a narwhal
here and we're not quite there yet but
it sits on the very near to do list
alright so thanks very much James for
taking the time to chat with us in the
morning there in California and evening
here stock up and we'll let you get the
last word in to folks here before we
close out the session well thanks for
inviting me in you know the the Java
end-to-end story has been a pretty
interesting one and I'm I'm really
having a great time doing a fairly
extreme version of end-to-end
alright thanks everyone enjoy the rishta
country thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
