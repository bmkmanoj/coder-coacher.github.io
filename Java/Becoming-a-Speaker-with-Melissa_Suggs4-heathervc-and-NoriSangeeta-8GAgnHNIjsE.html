introduce it yourself and then you know
what what your idea was for giving a
talk okay so my name is Melissa Suggs
and I am new into the web development in
front-end development and one of my
ideas of a talk was transitioning from
careers so I've been to a lot of
conferences and it's more technical and
about the software but no one's talking
about when you're changing from one
career to another and how to navigate in
that space as far as what is it that you
need to know the interview process who
do you need to know what software
languages you need to know outside of
you know just going to the bootcamp and
learning that but there's more in that
space that it's not talked about and I
haven't heard of it in any of the
conference's I've been to so far cool
yeah I think it's a great idea and you
also had an idea I think you were the
first volunteer who was willing to put
forward an idea so I really appreciated
that was inspired by you and all the
other women speakers there at the
conference and it's always been my dream
and I attended these conferences that I
should get up there one day and speak so
the idea for me that I had was I've been
a developer for many years and building
for the traditional infrastructure and
of course now we have cloud everywhere
everybody's talking of deploying in the
cloud and it takes a change of mindset
to go from building applications in the
traditional world to building in the
cloud and the idea I had was how do you
get to building applications for the
cloud and what are the changes you need
to make in from a software design and
architecture perspective as well as just
knowing what are the different
technologies cloud technologies out
there so what is what are the best
practices to build cloud native apps so
and this is more actually one of the
tips that was given at the breakfast
this morning was if you want to learn
something you decide to speak about it
and that's the best way you can learn so
that's what I'm hoping to do well and I
gave that tip but I actually learned
that tip from someone else so it's
amazing weather on
and you didn't really introduce yourself
so yeah I'm Sangeeta nori I'm a Java
developer work for General Motors up in
Roswell and been doing java for about
twelve plus years and just recently
getting into the cloud space so twelve
plus years and and all that time it had
it ever occurred to you maybe that you
might want to give a talk at a
conference not for the longest time but
now yes I did take a break in those
twelve years so I guess practicing about
eight plus I would say and still an
expert but no never occurred to me that
I should be up there I mean I guess the
thought was there but I didn't feel
prepared enough for it but I think now I
am ready to take that first step so you
sound very prepared and any feedback
that you got from attendees at the
breakfast this morning that lots of good
feedback lots of good feedback so how
you go about choosing what conferences
you want to present in how do you write
your abstract how at the beginning of
the talk you set expectations for your
talk what what is the level of audience
you know what is what is the audience
level that you're expecting and just
being prepared in terms of the content
as well as how to handle questions that
come up in the course of your talk so
lots of good advice from women who have
been there and done that
so yeah thankful for it oh well thank
you for coming and sharing being willing
to share here in front of everyone else
I appreciate that what about you Melissa
any feedback that you got today that was
valuable to you I mean obviously I think
it's an idea that a lot of people
especially today I've heard from a lot
of new developers right who were kind of
new to the industry as as we said right
any any thoughts that you've had that
helped to expand on your idea well just
even
talking the idea of giving a speeding
closer sorry the idea of giving a speech
and just knowing my own experience of
what I'm experiencing right now that is
a talk and I always was thinking oh like
you had said you know I don't know it or
I don't know all of it so I'm not gonna
do it and I am going through it so why
not give a talk and a lot of the
examples and tips and advice that you
gave and some of the other speakers you
know go up there learn it some give us
speak on something that you want to
learn about and don't really worry about
what you don't know
because when the questions come at least
you'll know someone in the audience will
know and if not you can just tell them
you know I'll get back to you on that
and so that was real empowering
encouraging that you don't have to know
it all but you just have to be something
a passion that you want to share with
someone or just want to let people know
this is an introductory course and this
is something that you know I want to
share with the the community and maybe
some other people can come and join
along in the conversation yeah I think
really valuable feedback actually that
came up in the breakfast and it came up
again earlier today and the panel that I
led about developer careers is you just
have to be willing to acknowledge that
you're not gonna know everything and
that's in life in general but
particularly in technology things just
changed so often and frequently there's
always something that you're in need to
be learning and know more about so it's
okay to acknowledge that you don't know
so ask ask for help from somebody in the
audience tell them you'll get back to
them connect with them on Twitter so
that's gonna help grow your network and
your influence as well as your
visibility being that that source she's
willing to acknowledge that you don't
know everything but you're gonna go back
and find out and be willing to ask for
help so I thoroughly enjoyed the talk
and the breakfast and look forward to
coming back next year next year so next
year when I come back for the breakfast
I'm gonna ask who's the speaker we're
gonna have a lot more hands raising in
the opening breakfast here at doesn't
exist
alright alright well thanks for sharing
I appreciate you being here and sharing
your experience enjoy the rest of the
conference thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
