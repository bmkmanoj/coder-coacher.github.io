right but I just wanted quick introduce
introduction or do we have a hardware
system that is running today well I'll
let you talk about hardware if you if
you say that this is a completely new
area that's not entirely - because
quantum physics exists for since
universe existed then maybe even before
so it's very new the new thing is that
we finally are starting to understand it
and with we I mean the the brightest
scientists in the world are not
including us but it's a it's an
extremely complicated matter the
equations are all relative simple but
it's extremely hard to understand for us
human beings so it therefore it's less
intuitive and and and less easy to get
to get started with so is it is it
because we don't see it and I mean
what's the reason I mean we can't really
experience it firsthand is that yeah
well we don't see it but it influences
our lives so there are so many quantum
effects that influence our life but we
don't see it and if we try to understand
it you have to get rid of your intuition
because it's it's hard to think about
something that's in two states at the
same moment for example a spin can be up
and down at the same moment a wave can
be polarized polarized in horizontal and
vertical at the same moment so it's very
hard to imagine that something and then
we talk for example about qubits which
is the quantum representation of a bit
a typical bit is 0 or 1 but the qubit is
can be 0 and 1 at the same time so and
you can do lots of calculations with it
assuming that is 0 and 1 and that's
that's not always easy to to visualize
so what what about like the hardware so
do we have a hardware system that that
we can work on today different companies
that are working on that there's Google
right now is from what from what they're
saying is working on a
a piece of hardware that will have 49 of
those cubits that that Johanna was
talking about IBM had has a project
called IBM Q in which they put five
cubits a machine with five cubits in the
cloud so that developers like us can
play with them and and now I think that
they've put online one that maybe has 17
cubits I haven't played with that
particular one so it's there's a company
called Righetti in in California that's
building a quantum computer Delft Delft
technical director University of
Technology is working on the quantum
computer as well I think that the
problem is and compared with classical
computer is you can't easily do this
build this yourself in your garage so
unfortunately that would be dangerous if
it was possible so therefore the
production of quantum computers is
limited to
too few big companies or governments or
organizations but unlike how Apple was
built for example that's going to be
extremely hard with doing well building
a quantum computer in your garage with
all the quantum equipment that is needed
so my understand yeah no my
understanding is that it needs to be
very cold right first of all that the
state is a I don't know if you there's
one form of it's called superconducting
qubits that the Righetti and and I
believe that the Google model and an IBM
I know they use dilution refrigerators
that take the temperature down to you
know to very small you know colder than
outer space to you know 100 Mille Kelvin
or whatever whatever the whatever the
temperature is so that at that at that
temperature then you can there's a
couple of things that happens one is
that the
that the the particles the subatomic
particles can can act they can start
acting up in there in there in there
quantum mechanical way you know and and
in a way that is free of the environment
because that whole deal where if you
measure something if you measure a state
then it collapses to 1 or 0 or whatever
then if you let it interact with its
environment then you know its
environment measures it it becomes part
of the environment so it's so the chips
then are are at the bottom of a dilution
refrigerator that cold isolated from the
environment and so that's that's quite a
trick yeah ok it's only one way to
create a quantum computer there are
other ways as well which are not
necessarily easier at the contrary but
you can use photons and laser
technologies to build quantum computing
elements components as well but you're
facing different problems there so it's
a in general it's a it's a very complex
Hardware issue and according to
superconducting temperatures is one of
the options that's that's being used but
that still doesn't mean that you can do
it in your garage with your fridge open
so it needs to be very very very cool a
few Millican of itself ok there's a
project by the University of Sussex and
as a matter of fact the the person
that's leading that project actually
spoke at devoxx I believe last year at
one of the dev oxes and I know that at
one at the one in UK about what they're
building and they're using something
that's not super conducting it's it's
doesn't require that that cold
temperature it's it uses lasers and
trapped ions and then uses lasers to
the gates to change the states of the
qubits through gates as well as to
entangle them okay so what about the
software so what what was your
presentation about and how did you so
what kind of setup did you did you use
then yeah so I think it's it's clear so
the difference between classical
computing and quantum computing is both
the hardware and the software but they
need to be engineered to work together
ooh sounds very familiar I have to write
that down that's nice and the and and
and so the problem with the heart rate
well actually it's not really a problem
it's just that it's completely different
it's much more resembles the the nature
but the software that we are writing in
classical computing only works with
classical bits so we have to rewrite or
we have to write new algorithms new
software the the core principle which is
applying gates to bits still translates
to quantum computing so applying gates
the bits in classical computing for
example means I have two bits a MB and I
have an or gate that will be zero if one
of the two bits that will be one if one
of the two bits is is one that's the
classical fourth gate and in quantum
computing we have gates as well for
example or knob gate which is actually
well which is the most simple example
the knob gate in classical computing
will convert the zero in one and the one
in zero in quantum computing it will
convert the zero in one and one in zero
as well but it will also convert all the
other states in between one and zero so
it's a gate in quantum computing is
still an operation on a few bit but it's
represented by a matrix because the
state is not only 0 or 1 the state can
be anything that is a combination of 0
and 1 it can be 60% probability if you
measure it to be 0 and 40 percent
probability if you measure it to be 1
and by applying a not gate to which you
switch those probabilities
where I have to make the important
remark that this is not really about
probabilities when we talk about
probabilities it only means that once
you measure it there's a probability
there that it will be 0 or 1 but so
those those concepts of gates or the
very fundamental foundation of the
software in quantum computing and when
we were showing this in our presentation
yesterday for it to have a audience I
was thinking about the analogy with
we're now working on the quantum gates
which are analogous to the classical
gates supplied in classical computing
and at the very beginning of classical
computing people were working with those
gates to construct algorithms we were
really working well not we but the
people who were working on software by
then like maybe Jim we're really working
with the bits so adding bits exploring
bits and so on and on top of that people
started to write languages that were
more natural to human being and one of
those languages
well we always built on top of the
previous low level languages and Java
for example is a language that's built
on top of on top of on top of applying
gates to classical bits and I hope that
with more experience on how we can work
and combine quantum gates that we can
create higher-level languages that will
be more intuitive but there's a huge
area of work that still needs to be done
we're completely not there yet but
that's why I did it's such a great
opportunity for developers to to work on
those quantum languages so it's almost
it sounds like we are going back to
doing like machine programming yes we're
back to like the 1940s where where
computers took the whole room uh-huh
yeah you have a limited number of bits
or qubits now and we're we're inventing
languages and the machine instructions
to be able to manipulate that so it's an
exciting time kind of like back in the
in the 40s I don't remember it I mean I
wasn't around in the 40s but but from
what I'm reading about it it sounds like
history's repeating itself yeah so and
so do you use tools to program I mean
how do you go but it don't usually one
of the main things that's used right now
especially to learn is you build a
circuit so you would have X number of
wires in that circuit that are that are
all horizontal and you know parallel to
each other and each wire represents a
qubit and then as johan mentioned then
you can have gates like you would drag
gates on to the wires that would then
evolve those qubits in certain ways to
where you you set them up to where they
solve a problem for you and so that's
that's one way of doing it and then
after someone learns it becomes
proficient at doing that then you can
graduate to a higher-level language then
that would generate these circuits and
so you might use a python-based language
or a domain-specific language then that
manipulates these qubits and these
quantum states to to to come up with the
answers that you want and for the job
developers what we what we started to do
a couple of days ago with a guru is we
started to work on a quantum computer
simulated with a Java user interface
that developers can then drag and drop
gates and see what the results are and
that's actually so you may wonder why do
you want to simulate a quantum computer
with a classical computer why don't you
do it on a classical computer well
because it requires much more CPU if you
do it in the classical way so if we have
this if you use this simulator to create
a quantum algorithm you will soon run
out of memory on your Pascal computer or
not or you won't have enough power
and therefore we were distributing the
workload in a cloud so we're actually
using existing cloud computing to
simulate quantum computing that will
give us insight in the algorithms and
how efficient they are and if you will
then apply the same algorithms on a real
quantum computer they will be
exponentially faster then your
simulation on a on a classical computer
but unfortunately you can't go because
or the quantum computers from Delft yet
so if you want to work on quantum
algorithms you need these kinds of
simulators and the the one that we
created in in Java well you can think of
that sort of an IDE for quantum
computing but at a very very low level
nice so is that do you have a URL where
people can find that information we will
put it at a github at a at the gluon co
at at the clue
account on github and we will it might
appear here now okay so it's not built
yet I thought it was already ready it is
well we have to actually when I said two
days ago it's a four days ago well
you'll have to upload it to github and
but it it will be there the main the
main discussion point is still the name
so are they so did you present also like
a specific like a problem that a quantum
computer would solve the the hello world
problem for quantum computing as we
presented it was an algorithm that was
proposed in 1985 by dr. David Deutsch
it's called deutsches algorithm and it's
a very simple one but it's meant to to
show that that classically a problem
that takes more than one query against
against a black box that has a function
and can be done with one query class
quantumly and so so it can be
exponentially faster
and so then the next algorithm we did
was a variation of that called the
Deutsch Yosha algorithm which which came
along about seven years later but
generalizes it to to as many qubits as
you want to use and so so classically
now you might have to do you know say 65
queries to get if you had qubit six
cubits coming in and hitting a function
where you just need to do one query
quantumly and so it's it's a it's a it's
that kind of exponential speed-up that
that we wanted to demonstrate that is
appealing to these this class of
problems that can't really be done
classically but has demonstrated to be
done quantumly
okay anything else that you presented in
that session that you want to share I
think in general we we try to to explain
people that quantum computing will be
important for example for encryption
okay yeah so that is a very important
topic but we also try to make sure that
we that we don't over hive it there will
be more quantum computing is not a
solution to everything some algorithms
will perform very bad on quantum
computers so I think the future will be
a combination of classical computing and
quantum computing and it's still it's
still not clear what the best algorithms
will be for quantum computing
so therefore in our session we try to do
such expectations right and to give an
overview of which fields might benefit
from quantum computing like encryption
simulating nature searching finding a
new medicines and so on so this area of
the computing center
areas are very suited for quantum
computing and others are very suited for
classical computing so what's the
commonality is that there is a lot of
data or a lot of data to crunch and
that's that would be the use case one of
the one of the commonalities Johan
mentioned he mentioned three different
areas so one one was simulating nature
so chemical reactions drug interactions
things that that because of all of the
things that need to be simulated modeled
classically it just takes a lot of a lot
of memory to be able to to be able to
even model very simple compounds but
quantumly because because a quantum
computer works in a quantum mechanical
way I mean it is you know the memory is
literally nature and the the the
behavior is quantum mechanical as dr.
Richard Feynman who kind of founded
quantum computing or quantum physics I
mean so what did what did Fineman you're
the physicist tell me what Feynman did
as far as he wrote some very nice codes
that you can use when talking to people
and to look very very intelligent there
you go but maybe maybe also adding to
what James said about well indeed those
those things where you need very heavy
computations they're quantum computing
is good and I think especially if you
combine it if you took the ratio between
how much computations do you need versus
the outputs so if you need very very
complex computations and the output is
and one number then quantum computing
will be great and if you need just a
little bit computing and and and and the
UI as output for example then I think
that quantum computing is not gonna
gonna help you a lot so it's really if
there are so many computations needed
but the answer will then be yes or no
that is something that a quantum
computer will be so it would be great
with big data basically a lot of course
totally scary like searching
unstructured data that's Grover's
algorithm and then also Shor's algorithm
factoring large numbers into primes - at
some point break RSA security that's
another that's but that's one reason why
governments and and private firms are
racing to build quantum computers
because that's a real threat right ok so
on this optimistic note we're not there
yet though so that's good no that is
right the key issues you don't know
would you tell if you could break
encryption would you tell that now in an
interview so we don't know how four
companies are but it's definitely moving
forward good excellent well thank you
for this thank you leap forward right
into the future so thank you for talking
to us and spending the time Thanks thank
you thank you for watching us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
