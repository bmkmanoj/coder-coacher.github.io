technology Network we're here at devoxx
talking to members of the java community
I've got venezia sender hi venezia hello
sorry yeah you have a little accent tell
me where you're from I'm from Brazil i
live in some bolos city about to ball
one of the most beautiful the work this
is very true and you are a charter
member of Sioux Java right from the
beginning since the beginning more than
10 years are working with that phrase
people it was crazy people you're one of
them too i can tell so we did the
hackathon for the past couple of days
and to a person the developers said the
things that really made it easy for them
to get started was this board we've got
behind us so can you explain to me what
this is sure so here we have a
collection of different boards running
java java c java me and also java ee so
we have here to raspberry PI's we have
two arduinos we have a big old one black
minnow board from Intel and also this
new and cool board from Gemalto so here
we have also some sensors like an
alcohol sensor distance sensor
temperature sensor humidity sensor and
also the heart monitor and the good
thing about this and added panel is that
the developers can access out list of
all the components sensors and turn on
turn off lights just using rest api ice
so all the sensor you can just type a
URL and you get access to that value of
the sensor so it makes easy to restart
with a playing with embedded and get
into this craze and nice word of
software development for international
things with Java Thank You Vinicius I
really appreciate your time and this is
one cool board thank you this is Tori
wheel in the Oracle technology Network
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
