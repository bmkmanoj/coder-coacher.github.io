Network and I'm here today at the oracle
user group summit and with mohammed
mohammed shaggy shaggy vp marketing and
operations from the Arab oracle user
group ok so we we want to talk today
about gamification so you use
gamification in your community and so
what did you do then came across a big
challenge which is the absence of good
payment channels online for those from
there weren't one thing either do
acquire a get a content from from any
online store or from any online service
provider so even if you have the money
governments will not allow you to send
that money back Atlantis you have a visa
on your passport so we came across an
idea and we said why not if you have a
great idea and you can serve the
community with any excellent idea which
may serve to improve the content enlarge
the net the network and make the
knowledge much more smoother and help
the community existing and we say let's
say you are brilliant in French or in
English and you can translate one
article for us just one paper article
from English to Arabic so that we can
really make the Arabic content more and
more valuable this is one one of the
examples maybe if you can you're
brilliant in Android or in iOS and you
can build an app for us which helps the
members contribute more and being more
close to the community then that's also
a contributing you can give and we can
give you services against services which
you can give it to us we have strong and
strategic partners working closely with
us on problems and challenges which they
believe that really can solve and bring
and improve knowledge in the region and
they really believe in that and how we
do it let's say you are a partner or
your ex company or a white company and
coming to us and would like to post your
training packages on our website or you
would like to have an online conference
to gather people and to let people know
what do you have as product and what you
can give it to us is just couple of free
seats
depends on what is your target let's say
if you're targeting you handle seats for
your training then what we ask from you
is just a couple of percent percentage
based on the need we take those to those
seats and based on the contribution of
our members let's say if you are a
golden number reaching a threshold or a
thousand points then you're golden
member and you can get a free training
out of the packages which we are good at
getting from the partners and here
gamification works we started applying
couple of basic mechanics like points
level badges trophy and we are working
closely with a startup partner in fronts
which is an open source community called
GMM which has started a year back and
they have been cloak we have been
closely working and we have currently an
instance which is running internally and
we're planning to release it very soon
so what do people need to do to get into
the different levels okay we have in our
gamification system we have a business
rule automated system which lets say say
is if you are a number and you've been
working with us since five years and you
are a 16 years old person and you have
solved a problem which is five level
complex then you can get a hundred
points so it's something which made
which mainly built based on our business
rule engine which is tightly coupled
with the gamification engine and
actually that makes that makes a kind of
weight it's an equation which gives way
to tasks if you are a person who is 20
years of experience and you're doing
this job you will not for sure to get
the same points which 16 years 16 years
old the child did that obviously he he
needs more points or he deserves more
points than you and we take that into
consideration our assets are mainly two
assets in the Arab oracle user group
network of people from different level
of expertise experts gurus professionals
with beginners intermediate even dummies
we welcome everybody we welcome
everybody we don't have any any
she with that but the point is if you
are coming and contributing this is this
is the first sorry this is the first
asset we have which is the manpower the
which is the driving power for bringing
a change into anything you want and the
second thing is the content which is one
of the points which thanks to it we are
still existing and we would like to make
it as impressive as possible so that we
really can retain more people to us so
content and if you are willing to
contribute to our content we will be
more than glad to get your contribution
into our community our community as I
mention it it's a kind of an Arabic o TN
which gets all problems solved in the
Arabic language today if you go to the
otn you will find the knowledge mostly
in English language which is the
technology language even with different
other languages like French German
Italian you may find navigation that's
the strip but content is not available
and if we make it available in 3 60
million people whom they are residing in
the region in their own language I
believe that's going to be to make a big
difference because language comes as a
barrier in front of people to learn
something and to move from a level from
a living standard to another one so how
many people do you have today in your
community today we we have a hundred
thousand handed and 1000 plus members
and we have a 5000 to 6000 people
visiting us daily we help them solving
out their daily technical problems we
are also helping them in getting in
touch with our partners and finding jobs
whose people wanting to migrate from a
career to another as well so if you are
a 10 years 20 years experience that guy
and being sequel and you would like to
learn IDF and learn java that can happen
as well
how many countries are participating in
the Yemen Saudi Arabia Egypt North
African countries Jordan we have started
also getting contribution from France
from the UK numbers from North America
from Russia and from India as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
