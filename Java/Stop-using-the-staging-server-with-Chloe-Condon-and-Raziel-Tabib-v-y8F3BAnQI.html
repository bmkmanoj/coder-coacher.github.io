in Napa right after lunch so of course
we're not button we had to have a little
bit of wine with our lunch the rancor
back here in our next interview guests
are from Cote fresh we have Chloe Condon
and Roz Habib welcome here while you
tell us a little bit about yourselves
first introduce yourself sure so my name
is Rafael I'm the CEO and founder of
codfish basically I'm been here in the
Bay Area the past ten years founded
quadfession about three years ago after
being in the industry for almost twelve
years has been relocated here from small
country called Israel and now being
staying in the area and loving it and
love to be here in Napa for the second
time I'm in this event awesome
welcome back my first time here at the
swamp up so of course I've been to Napa
before first time here at the j-rok
swamp up all right Chloe my name is
Chloe this is my very first swamp up I
am a developer evangelist at code fresh
my life previous to being a developer
was being an actress so I recently made
the transition from theater to software
engineering a lot of very similar things
a lot of very different things from both
of those worlds but I'm really loving
learning all the computer science things
that I can especially containers sure
see that was the thing that I read in
your bio that I was to remember that I
asked you about so tell us a little bit
about code brush and then we'll talk a
little bit about your sessions so tell
us a little bit yeah so basically we cut
fresh came up after we've seen these
major disruptions of containers we've
realized that containers actually helped
us rethink many things that we did
before that can be done differently that
can be done much more efficiently when
we have founded codfish we have thought
about how we can build test and deploy
application much fun
we can build test and deploy in
micro-services application much faster
and that's what Christmas is all about
course is all about building providing a
platform that helps team build test and
deploy container in a much more
efficient streamlined and collaborative
way that makes sense so yeah fits in
perfectly with the conference agenda
here I see your session is called stop
using the stage server so that's I guess
it's it's kind of a thing to have a
provocative title these days right like
something you think you couldn't do that
right so what what are what are some of
that what are some of the highlights of
the talk but you want to share with us
maybe Chloe tell us a little bit about
the talk yeah so um a big part of our
talk is talking about being able to get
feedback enough in advance so you can
implement that feedback before bringing
it to the staging server so kind of
pushing all of the unit tests pushing
all of getting the peer feedback pre
staging server that way you can
implement it I'm going to speak a little
more on it yeah yeah I think I think the
one of the it's indeed a bold statement
but we're standing behind the statement
I think that for for quite some time we
have been struggling with having this
staging environment as kind of must have
and be the first time in which our code
changes are being tested for integration
so you know reviewed by everyone by
everyone else and it's pretty painful
when things breaks in staging
environments it holds the whole team
back even when I was a product manager
or when I was developer when things get
into staging and they not have been
implemented exactly the way you've
envisioned it's always too late to make
changes it's already in staging you have
to push it to production so what we were
actually telling with that bold
statement it's not that you will
eliminate the concept of staging
environment but it just forced you to
rethink the way you use their gene
environment and many of the things can
actually take place earlier in the
lifecycle we can create a staging like
environment much earlier
screenful bugs or issues much other than
the lifecycle so when things are heating
the staging environment it's not the
first time they're being tested it's
actually kind of being the last steps of
getting confidence about your code but
not the first time you're testing them
and you know kind of removing that
frustration it goes back to the
streamline of the whole process that
makes sense yeah so yeah you can add to
that and then maybe tell me I know your
talk already happened so tell me how
when you know if we go any better than
you thought any interesting feedback
from the crowd want to share that so
going back to what Rafael was saying I'm
bringing my theater background into it I
kind of like to think of a pre staging
environment like a rehearsal for your
code like I wouldn't want to do my talk
without getting feedback or practicing
and ahead of time so that way you're
able to implement that feedback and then
have a much tinier product to reveal at
the end and the talk was very well I
enjoyed doing it and I actually think
that I'm doing technical talks is a lot
different than doing musical theater I
found it's a little scarier when you're
working with actual technology that
you're not in control of but everything
went smoothly and had a great talk to
your point I I did expect you know some
attendants to come in few engines and
what the hell are you talking about you
know like how do you have the little you
know the balls to even say something
like that sighs okay okay sorry sorry
like how can you have such confidence to
say but but I think you know it resonate
it's actually resonates very well with
the with the attendance that you know
what we can rethink the way we did
things in the past there are new
technologies coming in containers is by
far very well adopted technologies I
think as we talking to people around
here in the event most of them are
either already running containers in
production or in the phase of evaluating
containers Jay Fogg is a great support
for containers also as part of the
platform zone while the beginning was
people were looking at us kind of what
are you trying to say eventually when it
ended we actually got very good feedback
that may think many people rethink the
way they do things now well I think
that's really interesting and you know
one of the reasons why you should come
to a conference right rather than just
sit and watch things online online watch
videos online right so get that feedback
immediate feedback from each other right
and for the speakers from the attendees
and for the attendees to give feedback
to the speakers and the different
vendors who are here so it's really
valuable right yeah and of course you
know we can talk and laugh and drink
wine so thanks for having a little bit
of wine with me and sharing with me
about your talk I enjoy meeting you I
hope you enjoy the rest of the
conference all right Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
