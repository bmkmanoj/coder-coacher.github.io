today we are here to delete casting from
Brazil in uber to buy one of the most
beautiful city in Brazil if you come to
Brazil just send us an email and we will
be happy to receive you here in our nice
city so today is the last webinar from
the serials from ihe developer challenge
from Oracle technology Network and we
are going to talk about Java need for
IOT so the Java me after the phone
generation and soon we will have Terence
bar with birth parents he is the product
manager for all embedded at Oracle so
very very nice to have him today and we
can we I'm going to interview kind of
interview him and you can make any kind
of questions regarding the Java me the
the feature and anything that you want
to to ask to this very expert engineer
so before starting with parents I would
like to share some information based
links about Java me development with
different types of boards so today we
are not going to have a technical
approach but we are going to provide you
the right places to go if you are
looking to use any of the Java me up
boards available in the market so let me
share my slides ok
people though we are going to talk about
Java me the real embedded Java meet
generation we are going to share some
links and make the interview with
Terence bar and in the end feel free to
ask question oh very happy to leave this
moment that Java me up just back again
to the embedded devices and not just
bones yes Japanese to very alive phones
for feature phones like the Nokia one
and for some markets they are very
important especially for the BRIC
countries but now we have a direction
from Java me that's much more for
embedded devices because of Internet
your things so Java me is the best shape
ever since sun just start this project
so I phones actually if we look at the
best foams was a kind of embedded device
and phone what a small device but it's
not anymore and we have some years that
we have many phones running Linux we
were filmed with PC capability or even
more than hope to c and java he was 10
years ago very close to the phone market
and everybody like when we went to Java
one 2005-2006 it was all about Java me
for phones and everything but the the
true is that the forms
since they are they have the same side
as a pc today we can use a operational
system we can have better interfaces and
Remy was a very designer to a small
device well very good because now we
have the small device they just come
back with the IOT wave the io te t
tsunami and Jotham he was refactor to
achieve this market so we we already
have the experience in the past with
Java me being used in real and that the
devices and also in phones and now we
had all the technology of the history of
the knowledge refactor to the new Java
to the Java 8 and to the new device
generation so Java meme is Intendant
intended for Rio embedded solutions it's
not something that you are going to make
up a very simple do-it-yourself
prototype to feed your catch or
something to feed your dog to control
your house and you are going to use Java
me for a real embedded solutions that
you need to have performance you need to
have some some companies supporting your
your product Yuma you need to do update
a meet thousands device at the same time
so Japanese also for Rio a small devices
and that's the idea if you have like
raspberry pi you can do java neither but
you also have the Java Sea so Raspberry
Pi is much more for Java Sea but you can
use it for Java ME prototype he knows
which is very cool
the thing is which type of board i have
to make my prototypes or start playing
or creating a product based on jatta me
the first one I think that we are
talking a lot about this one because
they are studying it's easy to use if
you go from a do-it-yourself project to
indo Street project you will be fine is
the gemalto concept board the concept
board is painted on a shaped colored e
hs6 and this guy runs java me is not the
the latest version but you can you can
make a very nice iop implementations
because these grey this board supports
the 3g connection so you can just plug
your sim card to your gemalto concept
board and start playing with java and 3g
like we did a demonstration available on
YouTube a colored call forth an you just
call us a cell phone number and you can
turn on or turn off FM or anything that
you could plug in a in a AC power
connector and we also have the keyboard
and a poke on the up very big players
very use it around the world and you can
have access to these boards and start
doing a is even more professional the
usage the industry we have different
types of industry that that is not just
a prototype this is very real and we
have a big legacy around around the
dough's bored and looking at the past we
also have the same spot if you
are a lucky guy to have a sin sporting
in your in your house so you can play
with sunspots and internet your things
you don't need to buy any other device
is not the latest version of Java me but
you can do your job implementation use
same spot which is a very nice device if
you look at the time that they launched
distance pot they were actually very
ahead of the time so I love my son
watches a very very cool device is more
plaintiff capability battery as little
mirror and so on and we have also
Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi as I told you
he's not a this very is that big
computer but you can you can do Java me
and better development using raspberry
pi and why would you do it sometimes you
are just prototyping you don't know
which type of which size of application
you are going to develop and you can try
to prototype using Java me and and once
you finish your prototype you can
migrate your software to another board
with even a smaller than Raspberry Pi
and go to the market go to the industry
so that's the idea and I think that is
nice to have raspberry running java me
because you can use the same board for
java c and java meet prototyping and
development so I have here some linked
you are looking to his keyboard with
java me Angela cocido she she has a very
nice blog about it how to get get
started with Java me and new board
if you are looking for java ee concept
board we have this YouTube video and I
is very complete you have access to the
project to the source code we have some
demos and it's very very easy to start
playing with your concept more than Java
me and we have were looking to start
paying with Jackie me age and and you
can look at the Terrans bar blog he did
a kind of resume from useful links to
start playing actually if you just want
to to try to code something you can use
the Java me eight emulator so you can
try to Ave me even without having any
type of work using Java me eight and
netbeans it so very nice emulator
because you can even emulate a GPI euro
and this is very nice when you are
thinking about testing and the life
cycle of your software the application
lifecycle management and everything so
it's getting more and more professional
and embedded is really part of tests and
i think that the progress that oracle
gene with javon yet and that means age
is a very nice direction for testing and
bedded solutions and also we have the
oracle masive all open online course the
MOOC the move they are running the
second class you can enroll for this
class the way we start may the made 30 i
think the the second one and here you
can use your Raspberry Pi you are going
to use GPS and you are going to use
other sensor
hello and you hear me again
okay so MOOC the very nice training yeah
you are going is a weekly class and you
have a exercises and you you can have a
two-part at the forum and so is a very
nice way to start playing with your
Raspberry Pi and some sensors in a kind
of real scenario for applying this
knowledge so let me check if we have
Terrence bar all right here
you
you
of this knowledge though if you learn
again nice just wait some seconds and
Terrence will be will be here with us so
this is the concept board Jim jockle con
support here is the module we do
something hello Terrence I can hear you
okay this is very confusing on my phone
hang out so okay anyway do you see my
video though no no there is a little
icon on top where you can put your mic
and your camera unmute end up activate
are not the camera on the top of hang
out
and and that's not a big problem if you
don't dream very much yeah I I see the
the icons for the video but I don't for
some reason my camera doesn't seem to
turn on so I guess we'll just have to do
it with voice okay there is no problem
we'll just see finishes a nice backdrop
here all to you Attila yeah yeah we are
here from ubatuba very very hot buttered
for winter for autumn here okay Terrance
thank you very much for participating
and I think that we are leaving a very
great moment for java ee i was talking
here that objective me was never in a so
good shape like nowadays and I'm very
happy to be working with embedded in
Java in this time and we are happy to
have you here because I know that you
were a very expert around the future of
Java me development and everything so it
will be very nice your experience for
our audience thank you so much now
you're welcome it's always glad I'm
always glad to catch up with you you
you're doing so many interesting things
together with with your folks in in
embedded java and I always follow your
your tweets and it's it's great to have
you so um yeah let's talk about Amy and
me8 and what's happening I think you had
a couple of questions for me oh yeah
yeah we start up can you tell us about
your position or the job at Oracle we
can edit and everything yeah so I'm the
principal product manager for Java ME
and Oracle so I oversee
the whole Java ME product line including
the Java ME specifications and the
products that Oracle builds which are of
course implementations of those
specifications I have an engineering
background so I've done software
engineering on Oracle's Java
technologies you know a couple years
back and I actually come from the
embedded space so I initially my first
job was working in a company that built
a 19-inch vmebus racks if anybody
remembers vmebus was for a you know
industrial control and processing plants
and things like that so I'm always
excited to to play with with hardware
and and get interesting stuff to run
that interacts with the world very nice
very nice yeah i think that the physical
part of the embedded it's something that
I I can I java de ESO is all about
components that you never touch and the
crazy the magic it start happening when
you touch something and something happen
and do you deal with sensor school I
share the same mindset with you very
nice too and uh how do you see though
that market beyond now we have a with
IOT we are have a real generation of
embedded solutions is much more or
sometimes is rather than a phone or a
tablet but we have trees that they are
being monitored by by Java in me and how
do you see this embedded market we fire
Jian and the future yes so we were at
the confluence of a couple of
interesting industry dynamics today um
first devices obviously are becoming
more capable that becoming smarter
cheaper they have more memory more
processing power but more importantly
they are adding connectivity pretty much
every device every new device today has
some sort of connectivity it might be
you know local radio it might be
cellular connectivity it might be Wi-Fi
it might be some proprietary radio
technology but they're all connected um
and and that opens up a number of really
fascinating opportunities right because
now you can bring a lot of intelligence
into places that previously weren't
intelligent or you know didn't only had
a very fixed amount of software running
and controlling them but at the same
time there are a number of new
challenges how do you write software for
these devices right there are many
different types of devices um different
operating systems different languages
different connectivity different api's
and it's really really a challenge to to
write software in such an environment
and it has to be safe it has to be
secure it has to be reliable it has to
be remotely manageable so many many
challenges and this is where I see Java
ME and Java embedded in general really
coming in and driving a lot of value for
developers and for the industry because
it's Java is really that unifying
software platform that allows you to
develop software intelligence and bring
that to all of these hitter
heterogeneous devices to create you know
new features new services new
functionality in a scalable and
predictable manner which is just not
possible with sort of the traditional
native development model and we're
seeing a lot of good feedback from the
industry on that when we go to talk to
the industry into developers about
embedded Java they get it very quickly
and they understand that this is a huge
challenge and if they want to really
build new products and services for the
Internet of Things then they have to
find a better model for software
development of then the embedded
industry in the past has provided to
them
oh yeah very very nice and uh um what do
you think a company should choose Java
me instead of writing a low-level coding
like stick holding or even assembly code
because sometimes we have companies that
I still have this old mindset of using C
and assembly and kind of not trusting
new technology why why a company should
adopt a Jaffa me instead of low-level
development oh yeah that's actually a
good question i have an interesting
little story about that so two years ago
when when we really ramped up the
embedded java message to the world i
gave a talk at javaone i think that was
2012 about embedded Java and Java ME and
after the talk a guy came up to the
podium and introduced himself and he was
from some Swiss engineering company um
they built you know very robust sort of
large systems for process control you
know million-dollar systems and they've
been doing that for 20 years and he
looked at me and he said you know I've
heard I've heard your Java pitch and I
don't think it works for us you know we
we know how to do embedded we've been
doing native development for many years
we understand it it works well for us I
don't see why we should use embedded
Java I said okay well if you know if
your customers are willing to pay for it
and you can you can invest the time of
the money and you can spend three four
five years software engineering when
moving from one system to another and
you can test it thoroughly and and your
customer is willing to pay for it then
maybe Java ME or Java embed it is not
the right solution right and so we left
it at that and he walked away and a year
later Java 1 2013 I did another talk on
embedded Java and the guys in the
audience again and I recognize him and
he walks up to me after the talk
and he says you know I was here last
year and we did our research and we
investigated and we're all over embedded
Jolla Nell he said he understands that
Java gives them flexibility allows them
to reuse existing Java software skills
and code allows them to go to market
quicker gives them a full run time with
that's pre-tested and pre-integrated and
that solves a lot of the problems that
they would otherwise have to reinvent
every time with native code and then if
they go to another platform they have to
reinvent it again and Java really takes
care of a lot of those traditional
embedded software development issues and
he said that he's a believer and it'll
take them some time to to build the
first product based on Java but he's all
over it now
is still there there yeah very nice you
know and I think that the the problem
that I used to to think about is that
it's like a simple some types of devices
and microcontrollers or micro processors
they are kind of start devices because
you are looking you are using but it
actually doesn't exist anymore so it
will change in five years or in 10 years
you you will need to change the hardware
because uh is not guarantee that you
have a real continuous production of all
the types of microcontrollers and and
everything so taking care can cut off
money and I think that Java Java is is
very uh uh well well design it for that
since the beginning and the nice thing
is that the the phone lessons that we
have with gavin ii they are being very
useful don't you think that the lessons
with phones in the market and
specifications and the variety of types
of phones and and everything it will
help us for the the iot market don't you
think your terrorist yes absolutely and
I you know that's that's actually
something that developers you know they
come back to us and say well Java me
right I know Java me from the feature
phones face that's many years ago and uh
you know what's changed is it the same
Java me um and yeah Java me hate is
really radically different it you know
you can actually still run some of the
old Java ME applications on there from
you know ten years ago if you really
want to but Java me is a purpose-built
platform for the embedded space so we've
we've added a number of new features we
have a much more granular security model
we have a number of api's of the
standardization is much
more strict than we had in the past we
have a number of embedded features in
there such as the device io API where
you can talk to peripheral devices
directly through java in a platform
independent manner so think of it as
really a reinvention of Java ME for the
Internet of Things space and the goal
really is to create a platform that
allows you to develop embedded you know
fully functional secure embedded
applications very quickly and and deploy
those across a number of platforms so
it's it's really it's really much
improved over what people perceive as as
the old Java ME yeah it was a very nice
job but it was the kind of jump to the
jaw of me8 because so many new features
and we also have many cool stuff inside
NetBeans yeah yeah so the whole
development story is something we paid a
lot of attention to and folks like you
who come maybe from the Java desktop
space or the java enterprise space in
the past it was kind of difficult to
write embedded or Java EE applications
because Java me was different in many
ways up for historical reasons and with
Java ME 8 we've made a big jump and
aligned Java ME 8 with java SE 8 much
closer so with Java me 8 you can
actually take a lot of the code in the
expertise and the tooling you already
use for java SE eight armed and and just
reuse that code in many cases unmodified
and just drop it onto a Java ME eight
implementation so you know things like
generics and annotations are collections
java.util class file formats a lot of
those are identical now between Java ME
eight and java SE eight and in fact in
netbeans you just if you create a
project all you need to do is switch the
platform type from Java
SE to Java ME and you're ready to go to
write embedded java application so it
should be very very straightforward for
a traditional java developer to get
started and that was the idea oh very
nice and uh can you tell us which jsr we
have behind the Java ME embedded today
okay so this is something I need to blog
about because there is still a little
bit of confusion and let me explain it
to the audience to make sure everybody
is on the same page so there are the
Java ne8 specifications which are
specifically jsr 360 which is CLD c 8
and jsr 361 which is mb EP 8 so those
are the two specifications that were
approved last week or ten days ago which
form the basis of the Java ME 8 platform
then there is Oracle Java ME eight
embedded which is Oracle's
implementation of those specifications
so we took Jace are 360 and 361
implemented that with our own technology
and then we added a couple of additional
features and api's on top of that to
make it a complete uh you know ready to
use product so Oracle Java me embedded 8
includes additional jsr s let me see it
75 for file i/o 124 wireless messaging
API 172 for java me web services 177 for
security trust services let's see 280
for XML processing and I think there was
one more and also what we've included in
in the Oracle product is the device io
API and a number of AP is for restful
web services like Oh auth and HTTP
client so the idea is that when you
download Oracle Java ME
at eight for the Raspberry Pi or for the
Qualcomm I we platform or even for the
windows emulation in the SDK then you
get a complete runtime that really has
all the api's and functionality you need
to write you know meaningful useful
embedded applications and that was the
idea too to make that as simple as
possible you don't have to integrate
various pieces together and we test them
and you know license them potentially
it's all in one package ready to go very
nice and uh we also have the files now a
better than here the like the compact
profiles and everything so it will be
kind of easing the feature if someone
but to migrate from Java meet you at sea
isn't it right and so that's another
thing we need to we need to educate
people about much more is what is the
relationship from job you know between
java SE embedded and Java ME embedded
when would you choose one over the other
we're getting question on that and
rightfully so generally your first uh
you know your first parameter is sighs
um basically if you have a CPU that
doesn't have a lot of horsepower you
know it has maybe less than 200
megahertz or 300 megahertz just to give
a ballpark number and you have less than
16 megabytes of RAM pretty much you need
to use Java ME embedded because it was
designed to be a very resource efficient
and it scales all the way down to very
small microcontrollers if you have more
memory and more processing power than
that you can look at java SE um because
they're at java SE works well another
decision point is embedded functionality
so Java ME embedded as I mentioned has a
number of additional api's and features
for example as a software provisioning
and management model it has the device I
owe a PRI
has a number of other features that I'll
really make a lot of sense in you know
deeply embedded solutions java SE
embedded does not have those features
out of the box so you would have to
integrate them on your own if you want
to use them and then a final decision
point is if you have an existing
application that you wrote for java SE
and you're using some of the advanced
java SE AAP is for example like the java
cryptography architecture or java sse
either secure socket extensions those
are AP is that only exists in java SE
because they are very resource-intensive
and we didn't bring those down to Java
ME all right so if you want to use those
api's then you would also want to use
java SE embedded so those are kind of
the three the three decision points
between Java ME and java SE but
generally the the programming model and
the tooling you use is is very similar
or the same so you can actually make a
late choice in your project which
direction you want to go oh very nice
and you share with us some Java ME cases
that you like to to talk about like the
real implementations that that you like
to to talk with us yeah i mean sure one
one one use case i think that's really
nice and has been um has been publicized
a lot on the web is gemalto and v2 com
in Brazil right where v to calm is
building utilities infrastructure that
helps people to to minimize or to
optimize the distribution of electricity
and water and minimize things like theft
and leakage and v2 calm is using Gemalto
modules to implement local functionality
on their smart meters
and they send all that data back to a
back-end infrastructure to process it
and then inject it into the customer
relationship management systems so it's
an int n da the solution um and it gives
v2 calm and the utilities a lot of
flexibility to really optimize their
business and I think that's a really
good use case because it's something
that was impossible or very hard to do
before before Java has an embedded
software platform we I saw the v2 come
harbor gateway with 3G support and
zigbee support very nice one they have
different models and yeah they are
really doing a very very nice job around
ihe and gateways and everything so very
good a remember yeah sorry sorry one
more thing and and you know another
benefit of you know using Java over some
proprietary or native technology is that
people can really influence the way that
tooken technology evolves right through
the java community process and through
Oracle's public road maps and Vito calm
is actually a very good example because
um I discussed with the CTO of v2 calm
Leonardo we've met over the years
multiple times and we spoke about
embedded job and how they're using it
and he had a lot of good technical input
and requirements on that we picked up
and he actually v2 calm joined the JCP
executive committee and a lot of the the
requirements that that you find today in
java me8 actually came out of
discussions with me to calm so we've
really tried to to morph the standards
and adapt the standard in a way that
really reflects the way developers are
going to use it and and i think that the
standard has become much better because
of that
we add stroke i was looking at the j sr
60 even if you are not a company because
the people may think that all i need to
be an industry a big company to
participate this is not true because we
we have yahoo facebook it's a friend of
us he's participating on the Assad 360
though it's very nice to meet our office
a process from java and and discuss even
always when we meet you here in Brazil
we could give you some feedbacks and
that's the the best part of jump
actually from from now the Java platform
of the SC and Nia need the JCP is very
is where the magic happens in Java yeah
and we plant you to push that forward
with with more interaction with the
community stay tuned with their number
of things that were working on very nice
and um if someone uh they are starting
with Java me and they are looking for
his mouth devices which type of board
would you recommend you tack plane
terrorist yeah so right now the easiest
way to get started this is just
downloading the Java ME SDK eight
through Oracle's technology Network
website so it's free you download it it
comes with netbeans plugins and it comes
with device emulator which is a complete
Java v8 runtime that runs on your pc so
you can get started without any external
device um you can write software you can
even emulate devices you can see how the
system behaves so that's that's very
easy and we have some very good
documentation and getting started guide
so people should start with that and
then if they want to start playing with
real systems and attach real your
devices and we all say
sirs definitely raspberry pi is the way
to go we have a runtime binary for
Raspberry Pi it's basically just a Linux
application that implements the Java ME
at runtime are you just installed on the
Raspberry Pi you started it connects to
the Emmy SDK and then you can deploy
your application to the Raspberry Pi
directly over the network so that's the
next step you can start hooking up
devices um if you want to become real
serious and you need cellular
connectivity then the Qualcomm internet
of everything board is the way to go but
that's a little more expensive because
it's a complete developer platform with
cellular modem we're also working on
bringing Java me ate too much smaller
microcontroller type devices that are
really inexpensive stay tuned for that
that'll be coming up very soon oh good
to know good to know now you you are
making everybody careers but let's wait
I would have liked to have support for
those micro controller boards from day
one but it just takes us a little bit
more time to get it ready and stable and
tweak it but we're we're working on oh
very nice i can't wait to see that and
i'm pretty sure that everybody will be
anxious for designer woman once the java
me um eight has really been designed to
scale very well across different very
different types of devices from
something is big and powerful as a
Raspberry Pi you know with hundreds of
megabytes of memory all the way down to
little microcontrollers with maybe as
little as 128 kilobytes of RAM so one of
the goals is definitely that you can run
Java ME eight including an application
completely on the on-chip memory of a
microcontroller so you can have a single
chip system that provides a complete
environment including the application
and you know you can buy those chips for
you know five dollars so that's the
target market we're going for
very nice and we have some some question
here from from the audience someone
asked a guy Dylan he asked about he
receive us during auto concept bore but
he would like to have more boards
running Johnny I talking about about
keyboard which other board do you think
that is available and easy to buy and
run Johnny terraced so Gemalto is sort
of a the primary board if you're looking
for a complete system that has a
cellular networking stack on it the
Qualcomm internet of everything platform
is the other one um but as I mentioned
that's a little more expensive because
it's a complete industrial grade
development board um the we're
definitely looking as i mentioned to
bring java me ate too many more
platforms in different sizes and
different price points and we'll do that
over the next you know coming months and
quarters so stay tuned for that and as i
mentioned um you know start with the
Raspberry Pi today and then will come
with smaller cheaper ports on micro
controller boards very soon very nice
and the other question is uh what are my
options to locally stored data with Java
me eight we used to have an API for that
link or phones and what we have now yeah
so they're actually let me think there
are three api's for that um the first
one is the standard rms so the record
management system that carries over from
the from the old Java me young phones
but we've we've improved that API so you
can store locally in this little
database records of your own structures
and you can now encrypt the
you can share them so we've added some
functionality that's one possibility the
other possibility is use jsr 75 the file
IO API that gives you access to the file
system on the device directly so you
know if you have a file system on the
rest we pie for example on a flash card
you can access directories and create
files and write files there you can also
access the file system through the niño
file API so that's one of the new AP is
that we have that carries over from java
SE e so there is an niño file API which
you can use to also access the file
system in you know java SE style so
those are the three methods that i would
recommend using one of those oh if pre
nice and other question is regarding
arduino but he's asking if how could we
access arduino shield using java me so
it would be through the device X's API
right turns exactly yeah so there are a
number of if you want to use the
Raspberry Pi obviously the shield's
don't fit directly onto the pie but I
think you can buy like adapter boards
that allow you to plug in arduino
shields on to the Raspberry Pi and then
you could use the device io API you are
to talk to gpio or I square C or what
have you on the on the shield and I'm
sure some people are trying that already
going forward we actually are thinking I
was mentioning that we want to support
smaller boards like microcontroller
systems there are with the Arduino do it
right there are a couple of new Arduino
boards that feature cortex-m
microcontrollers on them and we're
actually looking at supporting one of
those directly the so you could plug in
the shields directly if I remember
correctly the Gemalto concept board also
features in
arduino shield right i think you can
plug in arduino shields directly onto
the concept bored if I'm not mistaken
yeah yeah you can do it you can do it
you need to write all the software to
access everything but you can do it you
know it's not something that we don't
have a micro controller for the Arduino
shoot so it will be all controlled by
the EHS eh is six module right and so so
here's one I mentioned before that we
want to we want to interact with the
community more and this is one a primary
area where I would like to make progress
is you know if you look at the device I
owe a p.i it's it's essentially a java
api that allows people to write quote
java level device drivers for peripheral
IA oh right and it would be very nice if
we could create an open source project
that allows people to leverage existing
code and then build a more Java code on
top to speak to specific peripheral
devices on specific platforms like
arduino shields so that we would create
an open source based community based
library that helps people you know
create code and maintain code for all
these different permutations of
peripheral devices and that you can
easily pull into a java me 8 platform to
support a particular piece of hardware
so i think that would be a great step
forward to leverage what the community
does and you know on on top of a
standard API like device io api so stay
tuned we're planning to move forward on
that as well oh very nice then the last
question from guy is if he can install
Java EE age after NetBeans date is in
solid but never did but i think that the
easiest way is to download
netbeans 8 which includes the Jaffa me
but I think that it could be possible to
do that okay guy but the easy way is to
download the java me the NetBeans
complete the AL option of NetBeans
tumbled and you are going to have Java
me inside little terrorist thank you so
much for your on we really appreciate
and if someone from the audience I would
like to make one more question this is
the right time but if you want to have
the support after after the session I
would like to share it with you the URL
for the all our official forum here we
go so it is the you are also if you put
you to post your question around Java me
job embedded your IOT project so you'll
notice we are in the end of the Gucci
developer challenge and really looking
forward to the projects I already heard
about some projects that the people are
doing and I think that we are going to
have some some good implementation
squirming hope to have men up then
running java me so we can give you more
feedback yeah i think it's it's an
exciting time um java me aid is new the
the Internet of Things and embedded is
really exploding things are evolving
very quickly um 2014 should be an
exciting year i'm looking forward to to
seeing some of the things people did in
the iot challenge arm and yeah thnkx
yara thanks venetia's you guys are
always great supporters it's always fun
to hang out with you guys so yeah thanks
for inviting me to this chat today ok
thank you so much and hope to to have
these good news around the new devices I
imagine that it will be very very other
nights in fact for all the embedded
community and I achieve and hope to meet
you soon so we can have some beer and
talk more about them better thank you so
much turns thank you bye bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
