stage javaone San Francisco here we are
in the Java hub Heather bankura doing an
interview today with Dmitri Cornell of
hi Dimitri hi thanks for joining us so
Dimitri you are the spec lead for jsr
367 JSON bindings yes all right why
don't you tell us a little bit about the
jsr how it's been progressing I know
you've been making great progress with
your expert group and posting okay so
basically which is our I'm working on is
about Jason binding it's basically
binding Jason documents to java classes
and vice versa it has some importance
because according to the survey which
was done back to 2014 it was voted as
their most important feature to add into
java ee eight and we are working hard to
basically complete it we have a lot of
experts nice experts now expected from
different companies and we released a
public review we had a public review in
May this year and it's past their ballot
in July reference implementation is also
ok so all functionality seems to be
implemented we just need to do some
testing performance improvements and
this kind of things and we'll be ready
to release it next year with of all java
ee 8 release all right that's exciting
yeah it is I know it's been a long time
developers have been asking for that
like you said back in the beginning of
the survey so a lot of the user groups
have been anxiously waiting for this
technology for the JSON bindings and a
lot of them are excited about getting
involved through adopt a JSR
and contributing something to you to
help with the work to start playing with
the code and the sample exactly exactly
actually it was another story it's a
joint work of dzone and java ee
ordinance and according to that survey
Jason be still important whereas summer
you know big numbers of people who still
think it's important so it's just
another proof that nothing's changed
since 2014 not for JSON my thinking no
not the demand for JSON binding so so we
talked a little bit about it you
actually presented to the JCP executive
committee last week when we had our
face-to-face meeting here in San
Francisco at the Twitter offices you
presented and updates the executive
committee on your jsr and we were
talking about maybe some potential
concrete things that the community could
do to help with your jsr now that it's
nearing the final stages there are
certain kinds of feedback you were
looking for could you share a little bit
about what might be helpful for you here
definitely so because it's on the final
stage we want people to test our
reference implementation on the real use
cases so if someone has a project and
using there some other biking framework
like objection or JSON or wherever else
it would be nice if you know this person
just tries our implementation there and
provides us with some response it's
really important for us now another
thing i would like community to do is
performance we need to set up your
formance test we need to set up
comparison tests with other frameworks
on the same use cases and after that we
need to work on actually improving
performance of our code to make it
compatible committed even faster than
other implementations
and the last thing evangelism we need
people to write blog articles about
Jason be for our new oh by the way we
have a new website right oh nice I did
not know that so that the URL is
json.net so everybody welcome there the
idea is to have a sort of a portal for
all Jason be related information we have
a links to the latest version of the
spec we have a download section there
you can download our RI and these kind
of things we have a small getting
started guides and another contribution
from M community can be participating in
putting some or content on the web sites
like manuals like better getting started
guide faq and this gotta be nice alright
so Jason dash b.net correct website
alright so we need a link to that from
your jsr page on JCB dot org so people
can find that and that's great that's
what I tell Java user groups to not
every contribution that helps with a JSR
effort through adopt a JSR otherwise is
contributing code there are lots of
other things that can be done for
instance like you mentioned evangelizing
the jsr talking about the jsr blogs or
even like you said helping with
documentation some people like to write
documentation or they're not coders
that's something that they can do to get
involved and that's something that's
needed especially on this new site it
sounds like that you're trying to add a
lot of that document or is visible even
if you'll write some documentation if
you write a guide and it's published it
on our website everybody see it right so
it's not like cold you contribute
something you're caught some you know
stream or wherever some couple of rolls
of court no one sees is right right but
this is a real contribution so people
see high visibility and then so the
other thing is so if you want to
participate and contribute to JSON
bindings we now have the ability on the
j srs through the associate memberships
people can join as individuals and then
they can nominate themselves to be a
contributor for the jsr so we'll
actually get public recognition on the
jcpoa rjs
page as a contributor to the jsr so
that's a new thing that we're making
available to JCP members so would
encourage people especially since so
many people are interested they can go
ahead and do that nominate themselves
because I look today and you don't have
any contributors yet listed there so we
want to encourage people who've been
interested in JSON bindings now is a
great time to get involved you're
nearing the final stages we really need
the community's help so go ahead there
nominate yourself to be a contributor
and start helping out with some of the
things that Dimitri shared with us those
sound really exciting and of course also
we should mention that last night you
actually won an award JCP award yeah
yeah I'm very excited about that and KP
and very proud of it it was a bit
unexpected for me but thanks a lot yeah
outstanding speckly so that was the
category Dmitriy won congratulations I
think you know the community nominated
you the executive committee cast the
votes and you were selected as the
outstanding spec lead for 2016 so
congratulations and it's great to see
you at javaone yep okay thank you all
right thanks guys we'll see you for the
next interview at the night hacking
