homers in benign when the deadlines are
met shake it we cold hard and his
cubicles styles nerd chic I'm a
programming freak we're cold hard and
his cubicles only two hours till your
deadline don't swipe my technique
sipping morning coffee with that Java
swirl born to code my first words were
hello world since 95 been Java code
insane crime started on floppy disk now
we'll take it to the cut
I'm run desktop Java's what's bobbin and
Weavin I got another winning that before
I get to I'll even play some cold like a
forest fire climbing a tree set the
standards like i triple e put it on up I
use the Force black blue got so much
love from my homeboy Duke GNU Public
License it's open source stuff on my
desk when you need a crash written once
and my script runs anywhere you're free
fucking mean muggin in my air on check
all the best lines of code you know I
wrote him a run you out of town on your
dial-up modem cuz the cold Hardy's
cubicles me and my crew could hide three
hardcore
we're cold hardness cubicles it's been
more than ten years since a scenic Bora
for inheriting a project can make me go
berserk ain't got four hours to transfer
their framework the cleaners killed the
lights man that ain't nice gonna knock
this program out like in most license I
program all night just like a champ
look alive under this side kill em I
called harder in the midnight hour east
seven on the vending machine fuels my
power cs3 the smartphones or Cody's
never ends Chavez there when I need you
in Words With Friends developing skills
are so fresh please discuss you better
step your game up on the C++ we know
better than to use that and he teach me
the damn Brown can't code as hard as me
I was getting bigger that's a promise
not a threat
let me code it on your brains never
forget week old hardness cubicles it's
the core component of what we implement
week old hardness cubicle straight to
your Java Runtime environment week old
hardness cubicles keep the syntax like
in the algorithm tight
- cubicles gotta use Java if it's gonna
run right we're cold hard and his
cubicles Java keeps adapting you know
what's built to last week old hardest
cubicles robust and secure source wax on
blast
haha
