technology Network we're here at arm
techcon in Santa Clara California and
I've got James Allen with me here today
hi James hi nice to see you again nice
to see you Brazil last time yeah and
we're off there again right yeah okay um
so you're with a global business
development Java correct yes so um tell
me we've got this fabulous booth here
tell me what we're looking at tell me
what's going on in the the Java embedded
space sure I mean you would wonder why a
lot of people in a while Oracle would be
at a conference like arm techcon where
we make enterprise software and the
servers well because of Java technology
javac technology is now being developed
in a way that will fit into small
embedded devices and we've got this huge
revolution in IT called
machine-to-machine communications which
also leads the Internet of Things well
this is an opportunity for Oracle and
our partners to really build solutions
that connect things from small devices
on an edge of their network could put
intelligence in them but the connect
those all the way back to the edge back
the other end at the data center so we
have a number of solutions here today
showing Java platform being running
these embedded devices okay cool so
we're in the MDM space and I want to see
some cool things what do you have here
to show us here so this the centerpiece
of our pod we call it why Java for
embedded solutions you see a lot of
demos demonstrations we have with lights
blinking and stuff but we really want to
talk about well you can do this with a
lot of technologies but what is the
advantage of doing it with Java so in
this era we speak to the flexibility of
Java cross-platform the ability to write
an application once and easily ported
many times the different devices we also
speak to the house even within a single
architecture family from a processor
I've you rev a processor from one
version to the next how you can actually
take that application is easier to move
an application from run version
processor to another using Java
technology right so if you separate the
hardware from the software it gets
easier is that what you're talking about
abstraction will help ease time the
market and also reduce the development
costs for people building products that
are embedded but need a application
platform Wow very cool so if I'm a Java
developer and I'm looking on at all this
don't tell me what the big message is
message is that Java works with a
embedded and it can run on arm-based
processors so everything we here today
have on the shelf in the booth is based
on arm technology and we even have our
specific commercial products from our
partner freescale with archana happens
to be on the other side of this wall but
we're showing technology running on
freescale platforms on arm we're also
showing them on these developer
platforms that are kind of out there
there there's a lot of excitement around
like raspberry pi and the beagleboard so
we've actually got two of our newest
java and embedded products platforms
running on these two devices java
embedded suite which was released
earlier this month john bed is sweet is
basically middleware for for gateway
type devices for instance okay right so
we show it running on solutions like
smart home and smart energy for instance
where you might have a home gateway we
also have solutions that are built on
our new product called Java ME embedded
which is really targeting smaller car
arm platforms like cortex in particular
maybe cortex m3 even as small as that
and for that we actually have a partner
a solution in the other area over here
we're working with Qualcomm with a new
product for our wireless module m2m
wireless module that employs that
technology and my colleague Kevin Smith
is here today and he can tell you more
about that great we'll talk to him in a
minute but this is pretty exciting I
mean it just seems okay tell me what
somebody we've got things that monitor
people's health yeah right this is an
integrated platform that makes it easier
for us to deploy the demo but it's a
single board it's almost like a
motherboard of devices you think about
it that way we've got devices different
various devices from freescale from
boundary devices from a company called
SI 14 but this is a platform first to
show that you can build various types of
industry solutions from smart smart grid
smart energy
home health care mobile health to
industrial control all using the Java
platform in this case we're showing it
using java SE embedded it's a little bit
bigger than any like with MES the
embedded is possible to deploy m2m
solutions and in this case we're
actually showing it on a bunch of pre
scale devices IMX class devices and for
m2m industrial automation and healthcare
and then over here is something really
interesting with a partner we have
called kinetics they have used java SE
embedded as a technology to build this
device here it's a device that actually
measures liquor pours so if you are a
bar and you sell liquor it's a way to
keep track of how much liquor was poured
what kind and this way you can monitor
if people are actually stealing liquor
drinking it outside which none of us
would ever consider to it or do that
especially you and I however when i
talked about end-to-end device to data
center earlier this is an example of how
you can use java from divisive data
center the devices are these these poor
poor poor measures right they are
connected to java gateway and when you
take that data this like almost big data
right that data can flow the liquor it
flows to a back-end system built on Java
EE for instance right right right a
database you can then manage the
inventory and take historical data of
what what products you have sold how
much like how much liquor of each type
right so it's really a truly an
end-to-end system where that back-end
system could be on premise or in the
cloud so we're showing now for the first
time and the end divisive data solutions
using java enabled not just with java
but with oracle platforms right very
cool and if i'm a Java developer I'm
totally excited by about this right
because this is only limited by my
imagination because we have devices that
are so small and now they're all talking
to each other so they're really doesn't
have to be any human intervention
there's a lot of things that
be done and ways that we can really
improve lives of people all over the
world right with the green movement and
needing to be smarter about our
resources Java is helping to enable that
Wow very cool and i'll leave you with
this if you're a developer you know the
world of embedded is very different with
java developer traditional have been
enterprise java developers right what do
they do jsp-servlet java ee right how do
I hell do I write a midlet do I need to
learn how to do that to do never
embedded application with this new
product or Java embed it's sweet you
know you can use Java EE skills to
create applications to go to embedded
devices like home gateways because it's
basically a java ee server with a java
database xml web services restful web
services into a software stack totally
integrated so you're able to actually
use the existing enterprise java
development skills to create embedded in
to end solutions wow that's very cool so
I can leverage my existing skills and
then go out and be a part of this
exciting edge play or whatever they're
talking about right part of the Internet
of Things excellent em tim and all that
so James I really appreciate it thank
you for taking time to talk to us thanks
Tori all right good all right this is
Tori from the Oracle technology Network
you can always get more information
