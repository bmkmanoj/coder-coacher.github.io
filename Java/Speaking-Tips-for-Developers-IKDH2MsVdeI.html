my my name is you don't qualify Oracle
technology Network and my guest today is
at Sonia Naga
hi it's alright you are actually you are
a java champion as well right
yes I am yes this is you like this here
right no I received the Java chenko
award last October
all right as I think right before Java 1
ok ok so you already an old-timer
ok so it's and you want to talk to us
about speaking yeah I gave a talk
yesterday here to do some follow about
some speaking tips for developers that
want to present some material in
conferences like GDC yeah I'm just gonna
fix my microphone yeah it's a little too
close Wow ok good hello yep get better
yeah better so so uh I realized that
many people wants to join this community
to start participating events but maybe
they're just too shy or they believe
they don't have enough content to be
presenting a conference like GDC but as
I'm a track lead of many different
technology to I always like to emphasize
that we are always welcoming new
developers trying to present their
content because I started like this like
some years ago I don't know how many
years it goes exactly but I was a
freshman just trying to present some
content in a big conference like TDC and
I of course I thank you the track leads
by by the time that accepted my talks
because it gave me the opportunity to
start practicing my skills and now I can
be a frequent speaker at least in some
conferences so I know it's improved a
lot my my skills
I know it's proved a lot my
opportunities as a career but most
important of all I think it gave me a
lot and a lot of friends now that I have
I can meet to know some awesome people
that I can can that you can only meet
this kind of advance so I
and I can have the opportunity to know
some great developers some that think
that people that you only meet on the
Internet
you can meet at this conference you can
be you can even have a chance to be
interviewed by Java which is a very rare
and special occasion right now why not
and you can only have this opportunity
if you get to attend the conference and
maybe be presenting some session about
something that you know and one of this
so it's a one thing I want to say about
the night hiking stage is that we also
welcome people who want to do the
interviews so like replace me right
because I'm only me one person and so I
can't scale right so I always welcome
also people from the community we want
to do their own interviews and find
speakers to interviews so it's great
opportunity to but right use again so if
you want to have the church you need to
depress certain skills as an interviewer
yeah yeah you you have the night hacking
stage available absolutely what can be
better than be broadcast live to
thousands of developers worldwide then
oh yeah you know I know it sounds scary
but it's a lot of fun okay we're just
having fun here yeah and another tip
that I would like to give you to be
speaking I know of course you'll be
nervous when you have your it's your
first time speaking at a conference but
it is always supposed to be fun because
we were always supposed to be doing
something that you want that you liked
that you loved and and you know the
oldest the oldest they realize when
you're passionate about something so if
you really love what you're doing
there's no way you're getting wrong you
know you may not even talk that good you
know you may not speak the right words
you may your demo might not work that
well but when people they they see that
you're passionate about what you're
doing they're going to like what you're
doing independent of the result that you
have in your talk so you have to be
passionate about what you're doing and
of course a bit of rehearsal home always
helps but anybody but if you want to
just the that tips for trying to speak
at summer but you if you want to get
better
speaking of the conference's I always
like to one of the things that helped me
a lot in the first talks that I did in
some settings some conferences I believe
that to be respected I had to be serious
so people who share would listen and
believe me but there's a great quote
that would like to give I don't remember
who said that to me but there are no bad
talks at all there are only boring talks
and amazing talks so you you have to
yeah so your talk should be fun
you should be entertaining about what
you're doing why okay so what else some
concrete tips that you can you can give
someone to some I might imagine so
somebody is like trying to come up with
like a topic so how can they make it fun
what would what what fun means because
it's easy - okay I know that many of you
to see me on the internet or even on
stage I usually try to be fun or at
least try to be passionate about what
I'm doing but personally I'm a very shy
person I'm an introvert I have a whole
behind
start talking to you so one of the tips
that I gave yesterday is that especially
when I can come to conferences I try to
be another person and try to be the
person that I want to be yeah so I'm
pretending I'm not saying pretending in
a bad way because I'm always trying to
improve I think this person that I try
to be here is better than the person
then I'm every day so I'm always trying
to improve and trying to be this person
that's why it should be a bit more
extrovert I know it consumes a lot of
energy but I think it usually works so
okay so I think yeah right
acting like out of your comfort zone
basically right and I'm not particularly
a funny person so even in italics I try
to when I try to make people laugh or
say something interesting some funny
I usually rehearse a lot because no
jokes have not to do about what you say
but how you say and the timing because
timing is
usually important in all the jokes they
only have that is stop when you stop to
breathe and that's when we expect people
to left right you have to rehearse that
a lot because I know how it works when
you get it wrong so you have to rehearse
it a lot so it's one way of getting
people to to enjoy your talk but when
you get people when you learn how to
make people laugh in your talk then you
then you learn it just the first step
because if you want people you have you
you know you see a lot of talks in
different conferences but some of the
talks you always remember and some of
them you just forget and when you try to
think about the talk that you always
remember are the ones that that make you
feel something so you have to play with
the emotions your talk and again I'm not
talking playing with the motions is in a
bad way but you you have yes you may you
have to make the others feel some joy to
some pain seems some more don't feel
some you some something to laughs them
to be passionate about you know when you
talk about your experience is very easy
to generate in empathy when you talk
about some bad experiences that you have
because many people have the same bad
experiences then you create empathy oh
this guy knows how I feel when when that
happens right so you create empathy you
create some kind of connections so
people start listening and after that
remember you I think that's that's there
are a lot of speaking tips that you can
have but that's one of the things that I
think it helps me the most because I
always try to connect with the people in
the audience if I word the people what
would they feel when they they have the
problem when they use this technology
which kind of problem they're trying to
solve which are the pain points and when
you handle the pain points very well
people will remember that and sometimes
they will love it because not because
you're someone to admire but because
yours
you're exactly a a person that feels the
same pain ah okay you you like them
right so it's really like a connection I
think with the with the audience they
only usually like people that
whew and think alike us yep so that's a
way of greater connection yep
so okay so you talked about a lot about
like what to do during the talk during
the presentation but how about like when
you want when people want to submit a
talk because I mean you need to get in
the door first so what are your some of
your advice for that reali yeah we know
that is to be talking you have to be
accepted for it right
so as a amico meet the the program
committee of many different conferences
and one of the things that we see when
people submit their abstracts is that
sometimes people don't get the point so
uh they submit their distract but when
you read it you don't know what the
speaker is going to talk about right
with the kind of problem they're trying
to solve okay so it's just I'm going to
talk about this technology but okay what
is this technology useful for who's
going to use that why do you think
that's important which kind of problem
did you solve with this technology I
think these are the things that you can
never miss in any abstract because these
are the things that people usually SS
when they're senior your abstracts so
you have to see why your session is
important for the people that will be
watching that so if it doesn't give any
benefit people are not going to accept
that not just because you have a
beautiful name or just because you're
going to talk about a new cool
technology people want you to be problem
solvers they come to your talk to see I
have this problem
oh maybe he has some experience on that
and maybe I can find a solution to my
daily problem so that's why they come to
your talk so that that's able to glad to
give to you when you're writing your
abstracts and for beginners don't try to
create like catchy titles for talks I
usually would it would advise you to
just leave these to the very experienced
guys because people they know your
resume so for the for the beginners just
stick to the standard formal title it's
much easier for you to get accepted that
why
so and they had blogs other resources of
the work that that they have done
yeah is that it always helped because I
do that because when you don't know
somebody doesn't talk you just just look
for that name on the Internet and then
sometimes you find a blog post oh he's
actually using the technology or you can
find a video some demo or maybe he
presented a similar session in another
conference oh then you try to Google
what people thought about that then
maybe that's a really good talk we
should accept that so you you have to
create your online presence and you know
these days the easiest way to create an
online presence is always a blog because
Twitter it just passes by and Facebook
it's hard to get access to that so you
should be really don't think about
Facebook Twitter snapchat just write
your blog because that's a universally
indexable thing that you can use right
get up get up account github yeah well
but usually people just commit your
their code into github yep there's no
readme I got the title of the project is
not usable so if you publish our project
on github please for you what is this
project about what which problems going
to solve blog about it anything that you
can promote it use to promote yourself
yeah because code is great but if nobody
wants to knows how to use it then it's
worthless then you should be able to
document what you're doing so people can
watch and see
well at least how great your code is or
the other way how crap it is but then
you can do that we don't want to know
so what else so any other tips for
conferences or some of the mistakes that
you see in submission so aside from
everything we talked any other like
mistakes like comment mistakes that
people do ok many conferences have a
different tracks that you can submit and
maybe
your subject usually encompasses more
than on track yeah but I see people they
did have on track and then some they try
to submit like five talks to the same
track you know we're not gonna approve
more than one talk by you on the same
track so if you want your chances to
increase you should be submitting to
different tracks with drifting track
hoes yeah it helps you a lot and
sometimes is even helpful because
sometimes the track host is thinking
about something for the track and why
don't you email him or her or send an e
send a tweet about that what you're
thinking about at the track what are the
tops that would you like to see covered
so it helps because at least in my case
I love to reply for these kind of
questions because it helps me as a track
host to create a better track so it
shows me that you're interested maybe
you can now you have a direct contact
with me we can exchange some emails
maybe you can send me your abstract I
can give you some tips on how to improve
that so that that's a that's a that's a
mistake that people to you and that's
something that you can that you can
always improve okay yeah now that's a
very good tip and and another tip now
that you mention that before speaking
it's always useful for you to attend the
the conference and be at the session and
after the sessions you can always go
talk to the speakers you can always go
talk to the track host and see give your
feedback because you know we remember
faces so you see when you see your
picture when you google your name and
see your picture with your name oh I
know this guy we talked about that con
from that place he was a nice guy huh
maybe I could give a chance to him or
her so that that's that's important it -
so how about co-presenting co-presenting
you know that there are one of the my
biggest rings in my life was always to
be a in san francisco at JavaOne
yeah resent a session and I say there
will always be welcome to my very dear
friend that Bruno Soares at the Java man
because my first session I just go
present
with him he just had had a session
accepted his co-presented couldn't
attend the session he invited me and it
was very important especially because
I'm unknown native English speaker so
first time in the u.s. first time in San
Francisco first time javelin first time
is speaking in English so it was the
first time everything I was pretty
nervous so it helped a lot to be
co-presenting because you always have
come come support when you just stall
and you don't know how to do and what to
say your friend your co-presenter is
always there to help you so even if
you're speaking your na in native
language it's always it always helps to
have a friend co-presented wave you
which is more experiences because if for
sure he's going to help you to to get
the presentation well done to get the
abstract going and to help you when you
get nervous you'll be a humid air to
calm you and that's a good thing ya know
that's a good I do that with Stephen and
that's that helps okay so even
experienced presenters to dance yeah
yeah anything else you can think of well
I would like to say that in my entire
life I always thought that at any
conference was a waste of time and money
and I have to admit that my entire life
I was wrong because the best investment
I realized that the best investment that
I can give to myself to my career is to
spend time and money and come to attend
conferences and especially if you come
to a conference and you don't make
friends then it's usually worthless come
here and make very new good friends
because you know we have a lot of
different developers here which is just
a shy as you shy as me they don't want
to be talking to people because they are
afraid of what people will be thinking
about them so everybody's shy here so
just start to talk because you know it's
wonderful when someone just reaches you
out and start a conversation okay and
another tip a good starting conversation
a good a good finger that you can ask to
start over
never ask what the people do okay what
do you do I work for a bank I just get
tickets and I code my code gets deployed
every two years so my job sucks never
ask what people do but ask what people
like to do or what they love to do
because everybody is excited talking
about what they love what they want to
do but that's a good starting for a
conversation right Oh what kind of
subject are you interested in uh you
know I've seen you at the containers
track maybe yeah what do you think
containers would help you in your day or
what you want what you plan to do with
containers yes that people get excited
don't ask what do you do right no dollar
dollars perfect thank you so much for
all the tips it was really insightful
and interesting yeah yeah take your time
you know it's always a pleasure to be
talking with Java at the night hack
website and if you come here to the
conference and you see the nine hacking
booth yeah you can always come by and
ask and say you know I have something
interesting to say and I'll say yes okay
that's it
that's that simple yeah you love this
available peace always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
