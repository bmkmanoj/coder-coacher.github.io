technology Network we're here talking to
members of the java community here live
from the floor of j focus and i have
antonio with me hello hello hello so we
were trying to figure out the name of
your company and what it actually meant
so why don't you explain that to me well
my company were providing school links
then name come from Lincoln things link
of so that's why it starts with L and
the name is linked well the meaning of
the name is linked things because one of
the purposes of the cloud platform we
develop is to link things together over
the Internet we provide connectivity for
devices over the Internet so the
Internet of Things IOT is hot hot hot so
everybody wants to connect devices so
tell me what opportunities you provide
for Java developers that want to look
into that space well one of the main
points regarding the Java library we
have to we provide to interact with
wings is that you can focus and coding
what your devices do the actions your
devices do and they bandstand save the
information they can't be over the
internet without needing to write any
single line of networking code you
forget about writing code for opening
and closing sockets opening ports you
get rid of all firewall issues you have
a built-in security you have also
the ability to do a server push from the
from the front they are outside the
firewall for example so it's very very
easy to to connect your devices without
even knowing about networking okay so
you don't have to be an expert in the
hardware right an expert in figuring out
security for specific devices that's
right you can focus on the application
right I just like what you're saying
okay cool so you're you're you put it up
on the cloud right is that how what you
were yeah we have a cloud service that
is in wine in 3w links com okay and
there you can well using our libraries
and also if your device is not supported
you can use our REST API s you can
connect to to our services in the cloud
and connect devices that are at your
home or even maybe at your home we
device in your office or if you have an
industrial application you can connect
devices that are far apart together over
the Internet very easily do you have an
example a cool you severe technology
well for example we are today we make a
small demonstration here I gave 4 q's
where we have a small temperature sensor
that was at home and I Hugh lamp from
Philips that was for example at your
office so connecting the temperature
sensor at the hilum over the internet
with links we have been able to give a
this wall temperature feedback of a
temperature at home so what the
temperature was called the lamp color
was blue and when the temperature rise
up the color was red but it's also being
used for monitoring for example
the air conditioning system of angers at
airports and well it's a something that
can be used both for more projects and
big ones even in terrestrial ones so
it's only limited by your imagination
right I mean it's a waste yes sensors
are everywhere so thank you for dropping
by it's fascinating to learn about what
you're doing or what's blowing up in the
IOT space and if you're a Java developer
this is certainly an opportunity to get
out there and do something new and
interesting thank you thank you very
much thanks for dropping by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
