swamp up my name is your employee from
Oracle technology Network and I have
with me so Janelle and Jessica I was
confused about with the G's
yes Java and I'm so you two have
actually involved with DevOps and so so
what kind of trends do you see in the
indiv up so we're really kind of seeing
the shift in the industry between
developers and operations and you want
oh thank you very much so you want now
we can talk yeah exactly
so it's kind of you where both
operations and developers both kind of
have to start speaking the same language
and they have to be able to communicate
with each other so they both have to
understand both sides we're starting to
see this kind of culture shift and
practices that are starting to be put in
place that IT never really had to worry
about before such a source control and
CI CD and all these acronyms there's
always so many acronyms but
infrastructures code all these things
that operations didn't necessarily have
to do but developers are kind of kept as
a standard and then vice versa as well
is now operational personnel so need not
to worry about things the operations did
as far as infrastructure and back-end
and security you know if you want to tie
in yeah it's really interesting coming
from the operation space because if
you've been doing operations for the
last two decades you have been doing
things you know a certain way and you
want to bring that together and start
utilizing the tools that developers are
using and then also being able to impart
some of that knowledge on developers
because in most cases you're working for
the same company you have the same goal
like how do operations folks start
looking at kind of the new way of doing
things faster more in being able to
repeat things easier and how does that
help them from an Operations standpoint
how do you improve a release cycle how
do you improve what your customer gets
how do you improve things like disaster
recovery and things like that is core
operations come
opponents using some of the tools that
your developers might already be using
and how can you find new tools or to
work with together so since you are
coming from the system and restoration
point of view so what would you say to
somebody who is new who needs to make
the shift what would you tell them about
because about like the lack of changes
or how would you sell the DevOps idea to
to somebody on the system administrators
sighs really say DevOps itself like one
of the questions I hear especially when
DevOps is still a new concept in a lot
of ways it's a new word that we're
really hearing in our industry it's not
a tool that you really go out and buy
it's a practice that you start to adopt
so one thing that really helped me
personally and I know it's so cliche to
say but to read the Phoenix project I
mean that's a really great book by about
DevOps and kind of explains the value
behind it but then just are really kind
of understanding the purposes for and
it's kind of a four-part purpose where
you have your planning you I mean you
have to start the conversation with
people but then you get to where you
start off with a plan then you go
through your develop and test then you
get to release and you get to monitor
and learn so now you start to have this
almost circle or this wheel of I know
now these different steps so from the
operation side I can take my code or my
infrastructure where previously I might
have to stand up a physical server
virtual machine now I can take that and
put that into code and put that more in
my development test even the light as an
Operations person or IT I wouldn't have
called myself a developer I'm really
developing infrastructure that's what I
have been doing I just didn't know
that's what I was doing so I mean I
think the biggest thing that I would
recommend is be open to change even
though that's a little scary and then to
kind of figure out how you can take the
things that you're already doing you
might not be aware of and put those in
those four buckets it's definitely about
not being afraid of this new way of
doing things a lot of times it's like
well if I don't do it this way I'm going
to lose my job and it's not about that
it's improving your job it's really
looking at processes and figuring out
how you can improve them and document
them first and then use that
documentation to build automation so now
you're not spending time spinning your
wheels doing processes over and over
again that
a long period of time you can now shift
doing things that are more critical for
your organization things like more
business business process more business
management learning to make decisions
that really affect the outcome of you
know what the goal is in your industry
whatever you're doing and not so much
spending a lot of time you know in the
server room you know monkeying with
servers or you know dealing with things
that you did potentially repeat a lot
for the sake of that was just the way
things were always done you know how do
you start building processes that you
can iterate quickly you know in a time
of need one thing I would one thing I
would add to that is she mentioned like
documenting and I mean how can you kind
of move on from that I was telling her
actually before this that I remember
previous jobs I would spend so much time
writing documentation on how I created
this VM or how I installed this
application and how I essentially did
all of these steps why not just put that
in code and then the documentation is
call this script here's everything else
where I can go back and look at which
version of Java installed on this
machine and which operating system was
running a which version of which
operating system and everything is
already documented in detail so that
when I need to quickly stand up that
infrastructure again I know my
documentation says just called this and
the document the code becomes the
documentation and if you're using source
control tools which isn't a traditional
operations tool but taking advantage of
tools that developers are already using
now you also have that documentation
history which meets you know compliance
needs and audit needs and all of these
other things that kind of came to ops as
the dreaded sort of tasks you are
starting to easy easier to like to meet
those requirements and they're almost
like welcome requirements now because
now as I see if I have to go back and
see what did I do three months ago from
this deployment I can go back to my
commit history and see old code and then
if I know that something's broken what's
changed I now don't have to second-guess
or pray that I can look through my
history now there's actual written
history so it is something that's
welcome and now from the operations
whereas before I was dreading this now
I'm welcoming it so you also have to
work differently with developers so any
site that you have or tips or it's all
about process it really is looking at
what the end goal is what is this end
product that we're trying to do and
working backwards from those things and
being like you know what do we do who
does what who touches these things whose
time is being whose time could be better
spent I don't want to say anybody's time
is wasted but who can have a better way
of spending their time how can we you
know simplify this for this person how
can we solve problems where only this
person can do this particular task how
do we eliminate those sources of
potential failure and really you know
spend a lot of time looking at that
because as operations we can bring a lot
of insight to a process or parts of the
process that are a little cloudy
potentially for a developer and a
developer can bring insight to the parts
that are a little cloudy for off I would
completely agree with that I mean
there's there's a concept I guess that
kind of goes along with DevOps called
value stream mapping and you actually
start with drawing out on I mean go back
to like pen-and-paper days and not use
any kind of technology and you start off
with the end product and then you draw
essentially this map all the way
backwards to the planning stage and it
allows both developers and operations to
see things from the other person's
perspective and you're able to see we're
both a developer or an IT pro or systems
administrator is maybe having to do
above average efforts or heroic efforts
or manual efforts just for the simple
task and the developer looks at and says
oh well I can easily take care of that
and then the operations person looks at
what the developer is doing so well I
can hope you would say you need a
developer environment so now I can give
you micro services or container or
something to help ease your job and then
you can help me he's mind when it comes
to pushing that maybe to QA and staging
and you eliminate those problems or
those potential failures so you're able
to now deploy your code because you're
working together and speaking the same
language you're able to now deploy code
faster and have those two your failures
because everyone's able to see the big
picture from the other person's
perspective so it's a lot more
collaborative and not like so
antagonistic and saying well this is
your fault no so there's no more blame
really like once you I mean it is a
process and it's
take some getting used to but there's no
more blame of I mean I remember being
the Systems Administrator were web
developers would give me their
applications and I push that and then I
pushed it and it didn't work and so now
it's my fault because I deploy their
code and so you have it left it's like
reboot the server like you have no tools
because your developer didn't understand
that maybe you needed you know some sort
of uh you know ability to reset or
ability to restart a certain service or
you know kind of control or some on some
monitoring or some alerting or some sort
of metrics so that you could use to
predict a failure all of those things
you know are often not not mapleton as a
function and so providing that
Operations perspective allows you know
everything to sort of move forward in a
better fashion well and then once you
are not having those conversations of
blame you're able to have conversations
where you're you are collaborating you
are moving forward looking at the end
goal because at the end of the day both
the developer and an Operations has the
end goal of going home and not getting a
phone call at 2:00 a.m. because the
website is out so why not work together
on that rather than spend 20 minutes
arguing about why it doesn't work now we
can work together to not only make it
work but then be proactive in that to
ensure that it continues working and you
don't run into those reactive scenarios
in the future so if you had to to give
tips for people to who are looking to
move into the devil processes I mean
what what kind of tips or how would you
say like it changes the culture a lot of
people point to like a cultural change
right as the main thing that needs to be
changed is that really the case or is it
part of the process how do you see that
I mean I think that is a really key
aspect is the culture overall is what
does need to change it starts with
people before you go on to anything else
because the key part in either developer
or operations is you have those people
that you have to at least ensure that
they're open so I would think the
biggest thing is is for somebody who's
interested like be open to change and
having a conversation and working with I
mean somebody from a background that you
might not previously speak their
language I mean I
developers typically and historically
have not spoken the same language or
have understood the same pain point so
once you're open to you might not
understand but that's okay that's part
of the process you'll be able to move
that much faster and you do have to
start looking at new tools and realizing
that you know maybe if you haven't done
a lot of scripting or you haven't done a
lot of stuff via code you know start
learning a little bit more about those
tools start learning how to use them so
that you can sit down with developers
and honestly look at a process I think
the easiest way to start that
conversation is easy to say oh it's a
culture shift well how do you encourage
that culture shift and sometimes looking
at a process and having an honest
conversation about how we get from point
A to point B where can you start seeing
where those breakdowns happen between
developers and operations and figure out
how you can start fixing those and then
the culture change sort of comes out of
that you know sometimes you just need to
have a starting point and it's just a
conversation about you know something
that failed last how do we look at that
without blame because the reality is is
just because Bob or Sally was the last
person to press the button that you know
made that thing implode you know a
series of unfortunate things you know
set that up and how do you find the
series of unfortunate events and start
correcting them yeah I would completely
agree in the key word that she said in
there is having that honest conversation
and what you have to realize is when
you're having a conversation and there's
blame back-and-forth and arguing that's
an emotional conversation that's not an
honest conversation so you take that out
of it no one's at fault we know that
that problem exists now let's move on
from it and then have that conversation
of how you can adopt those new tools or
those new practices to both make
everyone's lives easier in the future
excellent any other tips or any other
things maybe from your presentation as
well that you would like to share with
our audience one thing that I would say
from IT is don't be scared of code I
think that's the biggest thing because
people in IT I mean we tend to not we we
see code and we think oh god what is
this but don't be scared of my eyes
don't be scared of code the more you
start to look at things from a developer
perspective and then tie that
into your own code and infrastructures
code or IAC you'll start to see on how
functions and objects actually even
though those words might be scary I
promise you it's okay those things start
to actually really play an important
role in your infrastructure and how you
stand it up so like she said like
adopting new tools but adopting also new
terminology and overcoming those fears
it's really it's really about being it's
totally about being open-minded and
about stretching you know like if you
don't know where to begin you know maybe
talk to a developer and be like you know
what are you trying to do what
challenges are you having you know can I
fix that with building infrastructure a
different way and sort of challenge
yourself sometimes it's about going with
what you know if you work on a cert if
you do is the web servers how can you be
though the web server without you know
only using code or only from the command
line or doing it just a way that's a
little harder than what you're used to
you know what the end results going to
be so you know what success looks like
because one of the hardest things is
learning something new and not even
knowing what success looks like so you
just be like hey I know what a web
server looks like at the end how can I
do that you know using more code using
more you know command line and learn
from that and just kind of pick
something that you do know that's
potentially small and easy it might be
sort of stupid you know but how do you
how do you recreate that in a different
environment a different way well thank
you thank you so much for for all your
explanation I think this is a lot of
insights actually from first ones so
awesome thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
