we're going to talk a little about cross
injection and security stuff but you're
a developer for info support yes this
rice that we're good infra supports as
lead developer could be evils in many
projects especially in banking so hence
my interest in to do a security okay and
for those folks who are watching online
and also here physically we have one
camera here which is streaming stuff
live on ustream so you can go to night
hacking calm and watch the live feed and
we're also doing a local recording here
at Jay fall which will go up on parlays
later on so why don't you tell us a
little bit about what you're going to be
presenting on later it here at Jay fault
okay well first of all typically when we
talk about security we think about
application security rights things like
web application security cross-site
scripting cross-site request forgery all
things that you can protect yourself
against by creating safe applications
and the point that i want to make with
Mike Ross build injection attacks
presentation is that yes you should pay
attention to security of your
applications that's paramount but on the
other hand there's also a bill set in
which your application is compiled and
assembles and not many people think
about security in this step at typically
get you something like maven for example
and of course all kinds of things get
download is and put into your
application okay so you're talking about
ways in which people can actually inject
code or security vulnerabilities or
stuff right by leveraging build
artifacts and things which happen on the
front end of your application right were
you might not even be paying attention
so typically the archetypical repository
is amazing central which everybody uses
I guess in the Java world and maven
central is accessible through HTTP so no
secure access well actually them that's
not quite right they had an announcement
last week but we'll get back to that
typically you to you just use the HTTP
connection to bathe in Central and all
kinds of things can go wrong of course
when you just use plain iced tea men in
the middle
tax DNS poisoning other kinds of failure
modes for HTTP and in this way bad
things can happen and that's what i'm
showing with the presentation is this is
this theory or i don't know if you can
talk about this but if there are many
companies which actually have had their
systems hacked or hijacked by using a
build system attack good question i'd
like to know about that as well i also
talked to jason from zone he says well
known that i can talk about food so but
bless those of you don't know Jason he's
he's one of the main Nathan he's mr.
maven I think rights he found it's
amazing and soon as I the commercial
guardian of maven maven central so yes
so but its its theoretical point of view
that I'm describing it but it can be
applied in practice very easily if you
know what you're doing and I'm going to
tell what you need to be to do that so
it's not a secret anymore and you an
audience you're calling attention to
potentials have you have you'll ever see
zone attacks for your own benefit um not
gonna talk about that unfortunately Zoe
when we see you move to a private island
next to my not missile re yeah no no so
what I can show is a little example of
what could happen which station attack
ok I'd be nice to show so I think you'd
like us people to see your computer
probably yes might be helpful that would
be nice so actually what we have here is
a very very plain making done file my
cool buddy artifact the diversion
packaging and if it's good it's good
you're using presenter fonts here so
it's easy for people and stream to see
yes so and in my bills I just declared
email from Kampala plug in and say ok
just source job 16 started John 16 I'm
going to compile this very very very
simple
hello world class which just prints out
a single line so I mean what could
possibly go wrong right and as it turns
out when I do this Meghan King soon it
will do this thing will wait for a bit
buzzed success so what we expect here is
when we run this file to get the nice
higher output right and in fact what we
get is this as much as high with
internal Jeff a bit oh yes so what
happens here I mean want to take guess I
i would guess man in the middle rice and
in fact what was happening here is that
my man in the middle you request form a
from compiler plugin which another this
will take the source file yep we'll ride
it to the own message that wasn't here
so and i actually do quite good like x
compiling it so it's a shameful
source-level replacement right sir okay
and after that it writes it back to the
original source and you won't see a
thing you won't see what happens so this
works because may have no sir downloads
for example the maven compiler plugin to
delouse work right yeah so it's not just
depends usually you can actually hijack
the entire compilation steps without an
artifact with this trojans abetted
hopefully do a better job of hiding the
fact you've hijacked yes so if you're a
little smart hacker you might for
example also men in the middle a rep
referring work and not replace it with
something that's obviously broken but
replace it with a previous version which
has an own security golden busy for
example like and then in that way give a
false sense of security to the developer
who operate this framework what's
actually reducing one who actually knows
right but they Viscardi ball better you
could take advantage of that we could
explore this so so the interesting thing
is of course that there are ways to
guard against this right and that's what
I'm going into in my presence
later this day as well actually the main
thing that bass is possible is the fact
that we have an HTTP connection yep and
just last week there was an announcement
by sonu type so there are the commercial
guardians of mavin ecosystem that
they're going to make main central HTTPS
accessible as a bad metaphor apply to
all the projects of avis central open
source it applies to everything that's
available mazen central the catch is
though it will not work for your plane
maven builds your in maven clients it's
only going to work for repository
manages that proxy maven central coast
clear commercial like the Nexus right
but we're also working with occupy and
artifactory to make it possible and you
as a company will have to request a
token for a nominal fee of ten dollars i
guess just for administration and we
kept talking you can get your q axis
which will prevent at least two men in
the mobile and all the HTTP related
attacks all right so that's one one of
the potential other rather any other
types of attacks you can do well of
course there's also the remote
possibility of the actual hosting of
maven central to be compromised right so
if I hecka cook it into that
infrastructure which is at the moment
quite elaborate because you're servicing
six billion requesters here and if you
go through as net h networks etc so if
we could somehow gotten by as a hacker
and replace things in your purse sorry
okay so there may be there could be
you're not a satellite to the news blast
around amazon going down or other big
services if maven central right not
hacked itself so so a a perfectly fine
example of this is what happened to Ross
approach a couple of months ago I guess
they have this PHP my admin application
houses on shorts porch and one of their
edge notes in their content delivery
network got hacks and the PHP myadmin
was replaced with one with a back door
in it and nobody noticed because it was
just one of many edge right servers and
they only had two single one ins so what
you would I
really wants is some kind of an x
verification of not only the integrity
of the artifact that you're downloading
so not just it is what it says it is but
also the authenticity of the artifacts
so for example if if if you developed a
job FX extension and you put it into
maven central that he could somehow sign
it with some key and that I could go
fight and all right so so this is mostly
about corporate projects right and how
they can make sure that they're actually
getting you know pristine executables
off of repose like maven but what about
open source projects themselves so if an
open source project has dependencies
against other open source projects that
would they be subject to the same
vulnerabilities yes I believe they are I
mean if you just use a maven or really
any maven central base bill to any
repository base bill to then you will be
vulnerable to these kinds of attacks all
right so let me give you a scenario to
you so you you mentioned HTTPS that gets
rid of men in the Middle's potentially
you mentioned having some sort of secure
some way to figure out it's actually
artifact you want yes on top of that so
what you get you can validate what if
you're depending upon open source
library a open source library a depends
on B and C libraries and then company
depends on open source library a mm-hmm
so as an attacker all I have to do is
hijack B or C the connection to a
man-in-the-middle that party a then
cranks out a bill through their repo yes
which they'll authenticate as the
official version you know your favorite
open source project version next yeah
and then as a company I am trusting the
open source entity who has dependencies
and other things and who can't use HTTPS
because they're not a commercial entity
etc etc and they got hijacked dream it's
true so when I will recommend is that if
you
I company and you have these
dependencies with transitive
dependencies that you really check
whether these chances of dependencies
are also coming from a repository that
you trust I mean you can define in your
prom of library a that its references
other repositories well I think that's
another well I think you should really
add try to limit that and on top of that
you can well you will need to be passed
the manatee manager to do this but you
can also limit the access of your extra
repository manager to only the ones you
trust and there will be a solution to
this problem I think okay so we've been
chatting for a bit about security um I'm
wondering if anyone who's been listening
out here in the audience or folks online
we have a couple folks online who have
been watching the stream have any
questions for sander so if you do type
them into the stream or you know raise
your hands if you're hanging around
listening to us here yes how about us
please yeah so what other sort of stuff
have you been working on for your day
job other than just security hacking
what are your other em buddy what do you
do on weekends Oh weekends well i also
have a bloke brenson bounce but net and
i really like riding so this was some of
my spare time is is going as well have
you donate books books no no where you
say writing or riding riding riding i'll
get a different sort of yeah somebody
what do you bicycle oh sorry no I meant
writing writing yes I guess I'm writing
for your for your blog yes yes so
actually I baseeri soft blog post I'll
make recommending so don't write a book
because you want like writing anymore if
you actually go through that process
yeah you have experienced a place for
the heads oh look a goal in mind yeah I
i I've done it more than once so i can
tell you it doesn't get better yeah and
how about family i have actually two
kids which also take up a lot of fun
time
and yes so they today do they appreciate
your security hacking weld are two and
four so totally not really look like
yeah yes yeah yes I also have two kids I
have an older daughter and a younger one
with your sandwich chain okay your kids
much bigger gap and I'm amazed that with
kids that young that you're able to you
know work on and continue to be active
in technology speak at conferences like
this and do them so that's really you
must be very good at managing your time
I try yes and well if to make choices
right so what time what time is your
session today it's at um actually it's
440 and it's in boom dem bones here at
Sage a phone so you're all invited to
come and see some more in-depth examples
are well also go to me into this signing
use case when you use PTP which is also
used by both essential for some
artifacts to get to show how you can
verify that something is really coming
from the author the claims this from
that's even more secure because it
prevents other sort of attacks right
it's really n 2 n's sense that's there's
a separate key server by sonu blosser
key and there's a separate signature
which is made with his key and it's it's
kind of involves to verify all these
steps but in the end Oh everywhere in
the end that I think it's something you
should really consider if you have a
highly sensitive built in the highly
sensitive environment and some examples
of that is of course in banking but also
in governments and well you can think
about an example so i guess so yeah
alright so we were talking about kids
and i think i think you need to give
your kids a little Duke I think it will
like this yes my my daughter has a
wonderful collection of Dukes over all
the years I've been going to conferences
okay lined up with some other characters
from a company which I'm not supposed to
talk too much about well thank you and I
have another piece is wrong so you're
you're there's a problem with our our
stream here so if you look at the
picture what's wrong with that picture
I guess there's a sticker missing okay
so we can success sonic roll wow you get
a limited edition night hacking sticker
only folks who actually have been brave
enough to step on the live stream thank
you get a night hacking sticker so put
it to good use I'll stick it somewhere
and we're probably thank you you were
good looking over the rest of your tour
yep appreciate it so anything you want
to say in closing or call out for folks
to learn more about maybe your blog yeah
well like assess that up on your
computer and I can share it here it's
actually let me pick my last slide here
which also contains the link to my blog
it's at bench and bounds don't mess if
if you want to click link to the article
describing crossbills injection in
action then there's this shortcut bitly
link she can use very good and this are
our next interview for the night hacking
tour is going to be in another 40
minutes with Tom huge link so he'll be
back here and then we'll kick the stream
live again when he shows up excellent
well thank you for having you and have a
good session okay thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
