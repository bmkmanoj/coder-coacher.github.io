play minecraft I also like to mod it
this is the second video in the second
part of the minecraft tutorial series in
which we will learn how to mod the game
last video I say we were going to start
modding but we didn't Lee do any so now
let's actually start modding let's think
about what our first mod is going to be
we can look at the game for some
inspiration so I'm not in the game and
I'm going to make a new world recall it
tests I'm gonna get creative make it
super flat so it's easier to work with
right now it's building the world here I
have this new world I'm thinking we
could do something with mobs because I
like them I'm going to do it with
creepers creepers blog and I like to
stuff it blows up and so I'm gonna put
myself in survival so that the keeper
will blow up hi paper yeah blow up now
and he just blew up you can see the
explosion he made is kind of small and
we're going to change that because I
like blowing up stuff and if it's a
small explosion it's kind of boring now
go to eclipse to make the actual mod
here is the source code with a bunch of
different packages we don't care about
these CPW packages you want to look at
the net minecraft packages so since
we're looking at creeper we have to go
to net minecraft entity that monster
because creepers are monsters and then
we have to look at ntt creeper Java now
to make the creeper explosion bigger we
have to look at the variable explosion
radius and hear their radius is 3 so the
people make a six-block diameter of
explosion so let's make it around 20 so
you can have a really giant explosion
then we will run the
so now let's run the game to see what
happened when you end the game it will
automatically save all the files you
edited so now i'm going to us here and
make it bigger again and then let's go
back to that same world and this is
probably going to kill me because i
won't have enough time to run away so
i'm going to go over here and respond
the creeper and put myself into survival
and you can see the explosion in made
was a lot bigger so its way giant here
because if you compare them this one's a
lot bigger than that one so that's what
happened when we change the source code
hooray for you you just built your first
minecraft modification so now let's
build our second mod let's look at which
is for this one so I want you get a
witch egg out let's see what noise they
make they don't really make any noise
when you hit them do they so let's
change that I make it let's like the
move on the heart like cows so let's go
to eclipse to make that change went to
close creeper because we're not going to
read that then I'm going to open entity
which then I'm going to look at get hurt
sound you can see it's mobbed at which
dot hurt which is basically nothing
because I don't make any noise so let's
change it to mob thoughts calvert which
will make it play the sound that cows do
when they're hurt then let's run the
game and try it out
so let's go back to this world and you
can see they're moving why are you
moving with your not a cow are you so
that's our second mod then now let's
look at where I got that sound from so
if i go to eclipse it's mobbed up cow
don't hurt so i should look at cow
because well it's a hurt sound of a cow
so I go to entity passive and open up a
cow then I look at its get hurt sound
and you can see it's also mob how that
hurt and that's where I got that from so
if you want the sound from any mob in
the game you can make it there get hurt
sound get living sound or get that sound
and copy that to wherever you want the
sound to be played now let's make a
third mod let's run the game for some
ideas
I'm going to go a bit far away from the
site these explosions so we can get a
clean area and here it's good so now
let's look at a new mob I think pigs are
funny so I use pigs here are some pigs
and it's about what we breed with I take
the carrot and give one to each one of
them they'll breed and then make a baby
pig but carrots are kind of boring and I
want to make the baby with something
more fun so let's go to eclipse and
change that I'm going to look at entity
pig then I'm going to look at is not at
least meeting item maybe it is that yeah
here it says return item carrot which is
the item they use so I'm going to change
that so then what I can do it I can tap
press control space here and it'll tell
me everything I can we make a braid with
so it's showing me all these different
things ooh cake sounds like fun I think
I'll use cake so i'll double-click on
cake and now let's try it out
so let's find two more pigs and get some
cake out then I'll give one KTM and one
pic to him and then we get a baby pig so
you can see if I try to do as carrots
talk two new pics we'll try it with
carrots they'll only follow me with it
they want to breed with them so that's a
third lon now let's make our fourth mod
so if I take a diamond sword or NE saura
Billy and try to enchant it with knock
back this is a new command it's that's a
chant so you just lies and chant and
your player name then get through the
enchantment ID in this case it's 19 for
knock back and then which level I want
it to be if I try to make it knocked
back 10 I can't because the highest
level is too so I can change it to knock
back to then I hit this pig here he'll
go that far away because of knocked back
to so now let's change that so we're
going to have higher knock back let's go
to eclipse now what we're going to want
to go is net top minecraft dot and
chantment here it is then I want to look
at enchantment knock back and then get
max level here you can see the maximum
level is too let's change up to 10 then
we'll run the game and see what happens
so I put this load away get a new sword
out I'm gonna check the knock-back 10 so
this then the enchantment ID and level
10 you can say I'm knocked back 10 hit
the pic he goes all the way back there
by Peggy's go away the way hit you go
away and then if I say go to this horses
over there I can hit those horses away
to knock back works on pretty much any
mob so just make these horses go away by
a bye horsies and you can sheep it
sounded funny to watch these things fly
away it's actually it's really funny now
let's build the fifth and final mod for
this video this one has to do with
villagers respond the villager except i
might trade we're looking at we're
looking at a certain set of traits so
you see here he wants you to give her
gold eight gold ingots for one emerald
we're going to change it so he will take
he will give something else instead of
an emerald for that let's go to eclipse
so the class reward to look at here is
you need to go to entity villager which
is in hits on minecraft the entity dot
passive then we want to look at ad
merchant item and you can see here the
selling item is an emerald hoping to
change that so I'm going I'm going to
control space I think I'll get to a gold
Apple say like apples and now let's see
what happens
the same builder now well so this is an
old villager so you see the new villager
because old girl just have been changed
for some reason they don't want to be
giving me the right tricks darn do
villagers are so annoying see here begin
34 people here give me a golden apple so
if i take the paper out and give me a
golden apple instead of an emerald and
that's where it was all for this mod at
let's make these guys fly away go away
Bob didn't like you yeah that's pretty
much all for this mod so let's summarize
what we learned today we learn how to
make specific mods which we did were
bigger creeper explosions which is move
and hurt pigs breed with cake knockback
can go up to level 10 and build your
currency becomes golden apples instead
of emeralds thanks for listening and
happy minecrafting and modding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
