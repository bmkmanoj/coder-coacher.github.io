I'm a Java evangelist at Oracle this is
at introduction for the series of videos
that I'm going to call building my first
application using java FX so what we're
going to do in this introduction is show
you what we are going to build in the
next videos so this is the end result
that we will get once we go through the
exercises we're going to be using javafx
2.0 and as I de will use the NetBeans
7.1 for those of you who are not very
familiar with the IDE so this is how it
looks like we have AB some area where
you actually will see your project
you're going to see you can actually
navigate through the components of your
projects and this is where you have your
editing area so pretty simple when this
is the MC application only one class
remember from Java FX 2.0 version the
program is going to be all in Java so
it's actually a Java API so if you're
familiar with Java tissue looks pretty
familiar and we will discuss this in
more detail so I'm going to skip the
programming from now and we do have some
resources some images that we're going
to use for the demo so I have two images
one blue and one kind of orange and as
you can notice that the images are
pretty long so what I'm going to doing
since they were good going to do instead
of seeing the whole image we're going to
clip it we're going to have a
rectangular area they'll show part of
the image but you all know that it's a
pretty long image we are going to bind
the mouse event through some properties
with some properties of this image so
we're going to learn how to do binding
in the exercise we're going to do
animations etc so it's actually pretty
nice so we have these two images and a
third one is some sharks that we're
gonna put under on top of everything so
let me run the application again this is
showing you what we about to build in
the next videos as this is the
application so
you have remembered that the image was
pretty long so this is the clipping area
as you get in you have a nice animation
as you go out also nice animation
showing and hiding the second image you
can also mouse press and drag so you can
actually drag the image along all the
way to the beginning so you can see that
the two images are associated with the
mouse movement with the mountains drug
in effect but the Sharks are not and
then a cool effect that we also want to
explain later is he consumed component
translate you can just do a bunch of a
transformation to your component so for
example here you can click the shark and
the shark will swing away so with that
you know exactly what we're going to be
building so let's move to exercise one
of their building my first application
is using Java FX series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
