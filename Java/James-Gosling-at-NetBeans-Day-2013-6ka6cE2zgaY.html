technology Network we're here live at
javaone speaking to members of the java
community i've got james gosling with me
today hey James how's it going well
having a lot of fun got to show off
their my latest toys yeah liquid
robotics I saw that great demo so we're
here at NetBeans day so just tell me you
set a little bit up on stage about what
you liked about NetBeans can you tell us
some of that well it's kind of
everything right it's it's it's got all
these very advanced tools for
refactoring for doing performance
monitoring remote development you know
we're kind of the poster child for
end-to-end right we do desktop JavaFX
apps we do clad up out loud applications
we did our own no sequel ish database
server and we do embedded Java in a
robot yeah that's cool and and netbeans
deals with all of those right you know
the fact that I can set a breakpoint in
a robot in the ocean is pretty cool I
get quite a kick out of that yeah that
was great so tell me about your in the
embedded space now tell me how is that
different developing for in the embedded
space rather than what you've done in
the past um well I mean I've actually
done a lot of embedded stuff over the
years and you know you're dealing with
real physical objects that have real
physical concept consequences right you
know there are there are motors that do
stuff you don't get to pause and say
you know they you know and these ones
are really crazy because you know
they're designed to cross oceans they've
crossed many oceans with these robots
they deal with storms really well last
last summer we went through 14
hurricanes one of which was a category
four wow that's real yeah and so we're
doing this there's this new generation
so it will do even better in severe
storms and you know when you're when
you're building something that is both
hardware and software together and the
hardware is just crazy I mean it's you
know it's exotic composites it's it's
you know machine titanium it's you know
weird motor controllers and embedded
processors and network links I mean it's
just everything all mixed together into
one system sounds like you're having fun
with it though I'm having a lot of funny
good I'm glad thank you so much for
talking to us well thank you this is
Tori wit with the Oracle technology
Network and we were here at javaone by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
