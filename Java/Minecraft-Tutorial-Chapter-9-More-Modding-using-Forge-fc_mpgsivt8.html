play minecraft I also like to mod it
this is the third video of a second part
of the minecraft tutorial series in
which we will learn how to mod the game
I hope you've enjoyed the series so far
and today we're going to build some more
advanced mods so let's look at the game
for some inspiration this is the world I
created in the last video and you can
see it's got a bunch of random stuff
here so I'm going to clean my inventory
and then like villager so let's look at
villagers but a villager here and the
diamond sword so here's my random
villager I'm gonna kill him now I need
to drop anything villager come on give
me something you give me something I
hate you will just just drop something
already darn right so you can see that
villagers don't drop anything so now
let's take a look at how we make them
drop something the packet we have to go
to is that dot minecraft the entity dot
passive and we open up villager and
we're also going to be squid for this
one and you will see so as soon so we're
going to need the method drop few items
so now villagers don't drop anything but
squids do and that's why they have this
method so i'm going to copy it and paste
it and villager so now it should have
pasted it somewhere here it is so with
the squid you can see it drops this
thing called dye powder which is
basically an ink sack so we're going to
change that to an emerald because
villagers trade with emeralds and if
they don't have any how can they trade
with them so when you kill them you
should get the emeralds they have now
let's test it out
now we'll go back to this world here and
I'll kill this random villager there you
can see he dropped some emeralds i
spawned a villager dealt adoption
emeralds another one so they're all
dropping emeralds now let's look at
something else one thing I find really
annoying is you can't find command
blocks anywhere in your inventory so if
i go to search item in a search for
command block it doesn't show me
anything so now let's change that so
let's go to the clips then i have to go
to net minecraft block and then block
command block and where i am right now
need to add new line this dot set
creative tab then parentheses creative
oops cutie tabs dot tab i'll make a cab
redstone because you have the power the
redstone let me explain what we just did
this is a java keyword which is
reference to this class block command
block what we're doing is we're studying
the creative tab to the redstone tab now
let's take a look at what it did
so this is my restaurant tab and as you
can see the command block is now in
there and if I searched it up here I can
see it right there and I can place it
down and let it go not weird okay so i
can place it down do i right okay that
works just like a regular command block
away now look at mushrooms I think
they're interesting because you can make
them grow into big giant mushrooms so
I'm going to get both the different
types of mushrooms out and some mycelium
to grow them on so I put these to my
students here and turn at the right time
you can see that they don't give off any
light now we're going to change that
we're going to make them flow let's go
to eclipse now here's a cool feature you
can use you can go to navigate an open
type then search whatever you want so
I'm going to search for a block mushroom
which is this double click on it to open
it up then I want to right click on
block mushroom to find out where it is
used I go to references then project
it's loading it then it should double
click on this and it will take me to
block mushroom here's another cool
feature if you double click on blog java
or whatever file you're at you can
expand it to make it easier to read and
you can double click on it again to make
it smaller again you can see that a
brown mushroom already has light value
of an eighth of a full light value I'm
going to change that to a half so it's
easier to see it then we're going to
copy this code into brown mushroom I
mean the red mushroom not brown mushroom
and then let's try it out
so you can see the same mushrooms are
sort of glowing now because you can see
these these blocks around it are a bit
lighter another way to figure that find
that out I like a dig down a bit more if
i make it daytime you see so if you keep
going for a bit you can see it's kind of
dark here and you can see the mushroom
is glowing in this little cave i have
created now let's look at zombies let's
look at what they drop you need you to
drop anything come on zombies stopping
annoying drop something ok this one job
blood and flesh but that's the only
common drop they have so I want to
change that we're to go to eclipse and
or I want to go of course I should
minimize this I'll go to navigate open
type and search for and titties on B and
I can see entity zombie here but I'm and
I'm also here in the package Explorer
but if the place you right here and here
don't match you can click on the sync
button and you will whatever your heat
wherever you are here you'll be in the
same place here i'm also going to need
some code from skeleton so i'm going to
need is drop few items and I copy that
and i'm going to paste it into zombie
then i'm going to open it up i'm going
to take out this part because only
skeletons we need it and we don't need
it and you can see that there's an extra
racket here so let's leave that then i'm
going to change this here too rotten
flesh and how it's working here is there
two loops and they'll randomly drop
rotten flesh bones or maybe even both
now let's see how that works
so my spot a zombie you can see he drops
some bones and some rotten flesh now
let's build the last mod for this video
I'm going to need a crafting table
because just what to do with crafting
recipes also into your pumpkin if I
place the table but the pumpkin in you
can see i get for pumpkin seeds but
usually pumpkins have a ton more seeds
than that so i want to change it so they
make more seeds so i need to go to here
and then i need to go to think it's down
here net that minecraft item-crafting
then i go to recipes food i do not know
why there was space here it just is so
you can see this recipe here is adding a
new recipe which is shaped so it has to
be in a certain shape it's giving you
for pumpkin seeds which is here and is
crafted I pudding so here is showing
gift but one of em which is a block it's
a bumpkin so we want to change is we
want to change before to ten maybe so we
get more seats and now let's try it out
so I don't know why that creeper is
there but my dick another pumpkin I ran
into / I put it in here you can see i
get 10 pumpkin seeds instead of four now
i want to blow up the screen / because
it's so random and for myself at the
survival and he doesn't give a lot he
doesn't wanna blow up come on blow up
you I got you super creeper anyways
let's summarize what we did today we
don't have to make slightly more
advanced mobs such as villagers drop
emeralds command blocks are now visible
in the creative inventory mushrooms will
glow zombies or sometimes drop bones and
pumpkins give you more pumpkin seeds
thanks for listening and happy
