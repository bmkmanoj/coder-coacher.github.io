Eclipse con to talk about large-scale
adoption of hot Hudson I am an architect
on the fusion middleware architecture
team and I've been working with Winston
on a project to roll out Hudson across
Oracle so who have been explaining it to
people is today if you sort of stand in
the middle of Oracle campus you will
find you'll look around to all the
different buildings and Hudson will be
like if you imagine a light for every
Hudson instance that's running the
campus looks like a Christmas tree we
have little Hudson's running all over
the place and what we want to do is we
want to pull all those Hudson's together
and we want one big light and we want it
to be in salt lake city but but
basically what we're what we're trying
to do is we're trying to use Hudson as a
platform for rolling out plugins
projects integrating source code control
integrating QA processes and and we are
we're demonstrating that that Hudson can
can be that platform for a large
organization like like Oracle to develop
so yeah we've been we've been working
with with Hudson with a with Winston I
like to call you Hudson we working with
Winston on on this project and Aspen
doing great yeah my name is Winston I
the project lead for eclipse Hudson and
one of the things I always hear about
the customers are the uses of Hudson is
that scalability so when the number of
jobs in the Hudson ingresses then
there's a scalability issues and then
hutchins crashes crashes or it runs out
of memory and all those things so the
talk what gym do today is very
interesting because it's exactly what he
is trying to accomplish how we can scale
Hudson in a large scale so I heard you
talking about that if you cannot run
with one Butler then you hire more
Butler right then the problem comes so
if you hire more Butler then you have to
have a another Butler to manage all this
work life so how do you do that yeah
yeah so i've been i've been calling this
project Carson it's a Downton Abbey fan
and so Carson is the is the head butler
and they are idea for Carson is is that
you you should be able to a developer
should be able to go to Carson and get
their own personal Butler and they
should be able to develop projects they
should be able to develop new processes
they should be able to develop plugins
and it should be very simple for us to
integrate those processes into a larger
production system all all coordinated by
by Carson so yeah that was that was the
bulk of the talk yeah it's a very
interesting part so as you know that a
lot of people came and asked you that if
this Carson will be available for us to
future to have news
do you think that we can make this
available for these people in the future
I'm not sure I think I hope so I I hope
so i mean i think the what we're proving
out here is that Hudson can scale to or
two developers at the level of you know
five six thousand developers and so our
yeah the next I think the next step in
our journey is to try to understand how
to how to capture these patterns and
make them available to everyone else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
