technology Network we're here live on
the floor at javelin Shanghai and I'm
talking to members of the java community
lucky enough to have a minute of Steven
Chin's time hey Steve okay how you doing
pretty good so you are the Java one
content tier tell me what that means so
for a conference like this we need lots
of good speakers we have lots of
international folks who are visiting
from different countries and also
submissions from China and so my job is
to help make sure that we get a good
representation of Oracle contents and
also content from community leaders
around the world so how did you do any
job well this year we actually did we
did really good with our content so we
have a lot of different international
speakers which some folks might done
folks like we have my computer moon oh
yeah cool job right yeah Joan yeah
Tricia GEEVE from the London java
community yes nice bird Birdman uh Jay
fall so let me think the Netherlands jug
yeah yeah and we have a whole bunch of
other phone with Kevin Nelson from the
Bay Area mm-hmm who are representing
international speakers as well as you
know bigwigs from Oracle like a rune Jim
Weaver
a bunch of local speakers as well so I
think we have a good representation of
you know javaone content for an event
which is very tailored for the Chinese
audience here that's good so how are the
sessions going are they you know it's
really it's really good the events
organization team here is impressed you
know they're used to dealing with
executive events or corporate events but
they're like why are these why does
everyone stayed for the keynote of the
sessions they don't leave they just they
just sit there and pay its and we're not
even giving anything away yeah like yes
you are you're giving away really great
content right yeah yeah so they're not
used to such a dedicated audience and I
found out this past weekend on the geek
bike ride that the the java community
here in China's huge right they had the
green tea job user group meeting yes and
they have tens of thousands of members
and wow so there's even Brazil a run for
their money right oh yeah nice person
yeah Beijing has huge job development
community there well that's where were
made Oracle offices here so i started my
my own
way ball account oh you're pronouncing
it correctly apparently the rest of us
are not we're saying we bow in it yeah
we're do it again way ball way ball okay
I learned that in my session today from
me it's ending oh so it goes in both
directions which is really nice that's
kind of what communities all about
that's the equivalent of Twitter for
China because you can't access Twitter
here right right so it's not a Twitter
community it's a weibull communi yeah
excellent so that's what I keep hearing
from everybody I talked to that there's
a lot of passion a lot of enthusiasm
about Java we've got a really good story
across the Lord right so tell me some of
the highlights the areas of that were
covered in the keynote yesterday um so
yesterday we had a nice demonstration of
Java 3d and such my name is earl weaver
jim weaver doing things on his service
because he has an instrument he built so
he takes an ipad he plays his elves by
five string guitar paul 3d right it's
very impressed and he he actually liked
his skills yeah people actually
recognize the sumantti was playing yes
yes that was cool yeah and you know
Simon talked about lambdas mmhmm mm-hmm
which you know good technical stuff he's
gonna be doing a lot more sessions on
that and then Arun did all the ja ve and
I made an attempt to give my forces the
keynote
Chinese how did that go the audience was
polite yeah they were airplane and I
made it through with my broken Chinese
introducing speakers and the conference
and even you know cam caught me on the
spot he introduced me on stage and he
said oh let's let's speak in Chinese yes
and then I flipped it on him yeah and I
started talking to my Chinese ah ok so
cool that's nice so it's nice to have
that a good sense of humor yes that
local connection Chinese audience so I
know you're really busy so I'm gonna let
you go but thank you so much for
dropping by the otm lounge I think it's
been a really great conference and I
know there's a lot of enthusiasm and
we'll look forward for people to see
