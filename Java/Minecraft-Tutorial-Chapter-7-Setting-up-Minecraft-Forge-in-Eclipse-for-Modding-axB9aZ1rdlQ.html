play Minecraft I also enjoy modding it
this is the first video of the second
part of the minecraft tutorial series in
which we will learn how to mod
'minecraft there is no official modding
API from Mojang and we have been hearing
word of it for a long time now and we
don't know when it's going to be
released but in the meanwhile there are
many other ways in which you can mod
'minecraft
for example there is bucket but that is
primarily server-side so you can't build
any single-player mods and is also Forge
which is both server side and client
side and sort of going to use that so
let's find out how to get started in
Minecraft for it first you want to go to
this URL here and then if you want to
find the right version they will be
mostly listed in the promotion area
where all the latest forges are so I'm
using 1.6.2 so I'm going to look at
recommended 1.6.2
and then look at the source and download
that the rocks are a bunch of other ones
like the latest 1.6.2
with maybe a few other extra features
and then there's the version of Forge
and then minecraft version and the time
it was released so if I hover over the
source link it will show me add flight
slash a random number slash the actual
if we want so you want to copy the link
with everything except for add fly and
the random number because add fly is
just annoying so you download that then
you have to install it as per these
instructions and this URL it's basically
the minecraft forge wiki now we can use
many ideas for using it for modding with
forage there's NetBeans I really like
but we had some library issues with that
so I couldn't do it there's also Eclipse
which is the one we're going to be using
for total comes with a default eclipse
project and that makes it a lot easier
to get started so let's start modding I
already have Eclipse open so I'm going
to go there and now I'm going to import
the minecraft project so I go to file
import open up general and I say
existing projects into workspace then I
browse here and here's the directory
structure so I'm in Forge 162 then MCP
then eclipse there is they open and you
can see to collect Scott did the
minecraft project and there's a finish
and here it's imported the minecraft
project
now let's open up this project and see
what's inside this folder here is a
source code folder where all the source
code is located and a bunch of different
packages and that's all we're going to
be changing now let's run the Minecraft
and see how it looks you can click on
this green arrow to run minecraft and
it'll start running it so now I'm gonna
notice here make it a bit bigger okay
you can see here this new mods tab which
shows three mods there are the ones
we're going to be using to make more
mods so these are like the basic mods
you always need also you can look at the
mods you have over here and the versions
of MCP and forge minecraft larger and
also minecraft forge so let's summarize
what we learned today we learned that
minecraft forge can be used to create
mods we also learn how to open the
project in Eclipse and how to run the
Minecraft thanks for listening and happy
minecrafting and modding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
