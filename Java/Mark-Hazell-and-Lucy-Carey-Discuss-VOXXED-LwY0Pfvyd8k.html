Network and I'm here today with Lucy and
mark hi and we are going to talk about
the new website right the foxed websites
what is that about mark so we launched
this today during the opening keynote of
DevOps in Belgium and the new sites are
all about trying to bring together the
kind of best of Java and related content
from around pretty desperate and
fragmented online media for space now
and pull it all together into a single
site so i guess the reason for this came
about because when we come to events
like devops or java one or j focus java
land all these cool events around the
base there's such a concentration of
outstanding quality of content but it's
it can be quite difficult to find that
on a daily basis where do you get your
daily fix from and I think we used to be
able to get it and it's more difficult
now so we kind of sat down and said
wouldn't it be great if it was all in
the same place so we've started pulling
together written pieces news tutorials
and features and we put it alongside a
heap of rich media as well so you can
then view presentations from Java one
for instance interviews presentations
from here at devoxx at devoxx UK and
having all in a single source so that
there's related content that you can
discover and i should add in just as
well it's not just rather it's kind of
the whole ecosystem things that dart
expertise also JVM we've got cloud
methodology kind of future Big Data
mobile so kind of that whole rich kind
of field of it so similar to what is
covered in the in the conferences so
yeah basically yeah i think these
conferences tend to have nine or ten
main content themes
just felt that was too many so we've
concentrated on 60 gum on the side for
now but we don't really miss stuff out
so everyone you know there might be
something on architectural security and
although we don't have a comp a
specified content channel for that it's
still it's still important so we put it
into the into the right place so is the
I mean who is the audience who are you
targeting developers developers team
leads anybody who wants to learn about
the latest innovations the latest tech
development but also anybody who wants
to understand some of their tales from
the trenches the war stories so we're
trying to encourage people to contribute
to the site now it's not just about me
or Lucy putting information there it's
about getting contributions from all
over the ecosystem because so you accept
like in specific topics you just accept
like my open SMG you can go into our
site and there's I think where you can
go and upload your story and it will go
delivered straight to us we'll check it
over do any necessary edits maybe get
back to you but anyone can basically be
a writer for boxed yeah and it's
important as you can add images into the
article submission you can add code
lines in there as well and it'll come
through and we're well as we grow on
till we need some content moderators so
here's a shout out to anybody who wants
to wants to help us edit things your
land oh you should put your hand up on
that one maybe but yes to help us
moderate some of that stuff but we want
people to submit its when we said that
we were going to do this I think we said
that we could just say to their sector
hey we've got a great idea we want to
create this but then the response yeah
so we've said that will spend a couple
of months building something so that
there's at least a first case there's a
platform there
there's a first iteration and now it's
down to the community to decide where
that goes and what it looks like going
forward so at the moment it looks really
nice it's easy to use it's got some
great content on that but it needs to
evolve as the community wants it to and
so are you also creating content or
you're reusing content that other
people's indicating contents yes it's
kind of a mixed say we've got a lot of
people some giving people's blogs kind
of they can have the opportunity to
share content if there's something kind
of in the news if they're the related
post that they'd like to kind of bring
up again and we're also kind of
featuring our own in-house written these
articles and we're going around in
Turing members of the community so it's
a real mix so you more you care more
about the content where many regardless
of where I was used before but you just
want to leave me yet absolutely and so
one of the one of the key things here is
if you've got a blog you shouldn't stop
blogging yeah it's really important but
why don't you share it with us as well
and when we publish it because if you've
got a hundred thousand visitors to your
blog site and savox gets a million in it
better if they're in both that
informations in both places so they can
discover it and one of the next
situations that we're about to work on
is how do we then pay back the guys that
are contributing to the site and so we
want to be able to if there's any ad
revenue going through decide we want to
be able to share that back with the
individual contributors as well ok and
where do we what is the URL of the site
of the website so you go to fox com
boxed yeah come and check it out from
now one of one other thing I'd like to
say is as well as the website boxed is
also working with local user groups and
community leaders on a new series of one
day events as well with vox days and
that's where guys locally run their and
plan their own events but they have the
backup of a event professional team
basically so Stefan Yance and myself you
know Stefan runs this in
DevOps here in Belgium I run DevOps in
the UK plus Ellie Mae who works in the
team over in the UK as well and so what
we're trying to do is help those guys to
deliver professional events so we are
going to give them a website and tools I
could call for papers so they don't need
to do this stuff themselves and we can
introduce them to international speakers
we can help them get sponsorships and we
can market those events as well but
they're really locally run propositions
we have a local flavor and they might be
partly in the local language they might
be all in English it's down to the local
guys to determine that but it just means
that we can spread this spread this
knowledge and expertise into further
reaches there may be some media
companies who run conferences wouldn't
be interested in and we want to be able
to help people share that and kind of
any related materials from those
conferences as well for example we've
kind of sauce because if they want to
submit any kind of supplementary
tutorials to kind of things that they're
doing here for the site so from the Vox
days as well so you kind of have that
extra element of taking your conference
global even if it's just a small one day
event so how is box and Polly's how are
they connected really so parlays has got
all of this rich media it's got what
five and a half thousand presentations
on there now it's getting like a half a
million in unique visitors a year what
Fox will do is relate all of that
content and and and glue it together in
a sense so if venkat writes a piece for
us about about a particular topic then
ultimately we were able to showcase not
just phone cats presentations but
related presentations and you can get
there directly just just one dreck so
we're kind of spending quite a lot of
time linking all of those things
together right now
great looks like a wonderful opportunity
for speakers really yeah I think it's a
great opportunity for speakers for
people with something to say but also
just anybody who wants to consume
information and learn anything because
you can come to as many events as you
like but they don't happen that often
and that's maybe when a lot of the key
learning goes on now we just want it
kind of the devil's daily was how we and
we kind of it almost badged it to begin
with before we chewed up the words and
turn them around the letters and turn
them around sorry so yeah comes box
check it out and give us feedback yes
thank you so much for yes thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
