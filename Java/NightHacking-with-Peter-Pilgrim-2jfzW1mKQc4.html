hacking with Peter pilgrim hello guys
thanks for getting nervous so for those
of you who don't know Peter he is a java
champion ya know that affects javi yeah
scala hacker yes I am and a member of
the new globe in London I live in London
and I recently joined the London java
community and I used to be a job leader
of a separate group until a few years
ago you might remember the job of web
user fee ok so where were we we were
talking about scholar and scholar
effects yeah so I think the all right so
I won't explain how this works for folks
so to join the stream go 2nite hacking
calm and then you can watch the stream
live you can also comment in a social
chat and tell us how things are going we
love to hear you know people's
experiences with the stream and we're
going to show some Scala hacking we're
going to do some maybe chat about your
book yeah all sorts of all sorts of cool
stuff so all right we'll show your
desktop yeah you have some cool stuff
going on there right so let's see are
you showing it to you so what's the
sources project so this is ok so let's
go back to put it this is scholar
affects the whole project so which is on
mercurial if i go to skul effects page
this is where code google com for /p for
a slash skull effects and at the moment
we don't have a artifact for you to play
with so you need to build it from source
and so you can just use mercurial clone
the repository
and build and Kapoor maybe a month ago I
put them so why would people want to use
the scholar facts well I'll see you then
if they're using scholar it's so it's
kind of yes it is you're right in the
skull language yeah so you you get some
some support for scholar features we
also had as a comparator kerning Java
facts and genre it should be smaller
less lines of code and it should be much
easier to code in and probably for the
Builder methods in yeah for small
examples probably they're very close but
I suppose for larger examples it's it
becomes pretty declarative and it's not
quite there with javafx quit we pity job
effects good a lot yes new with java
flex 2 now it's only the Java language
which is great it lets you code and pure
Java but it tends to be a little bit
slightly more verbose than the
equivalence javafx script was in javafx
13 and prior but skoloff x is pretty
close in terms of ease of use as a
language like to let me let's go back to
the code that's golf Xcode that is a
scholar effects code and so this is an
example this is a port and it's not not
the most concise Scala code and this bit
but it looks pretty reasonable and
that yes you can compare side-by-side so
if I can just run this example and and
this is oh oh oh it's dope okay that's
yes it's not the one I wanted to run
that was pretty cool yeah okay like this
go strong I don't need to show you an
error Eva all right I'm stewing master
in my IntelliJ keys so this should bring
up the cube sample demo so that's the 3d
kids butts that looks like it might be
taking advantage of the 3d graphics
capabilities of Java facts yes from a
scholar application yes so so a direct
port of I don't know who wrote it in and
oracle team France Jasper wrote this or
which one had at the head of the code
compared between the java version skull
fixed version in which yeah well i need
any big ones well the big ones were
converting and that I supposed the way
you instantiate or the Builder syntax
between the two different code bases
like you would have to say what's it you
need the static create method from the
rectangle builder object and then you
would set properties in the same sort of
way so this meant changing them to more
laughing jar for Scylla effects
properties the scholar has this idea of
unified axis principle and we take
advantage of it to make at least
property setting look similar to the way
java effects script was the
and it looks and as it weed for example
you have you're creating a rectangle
here and you're setting the width and
height and the color and translating it
a bit in 3d space and that rectangle
makes one of the faces of the cube the
bat face yeah so it looks it looks kind
of like a builder syntax yeah it's
actually not yes it's not so when you
think when you go to organizing a
politician the implementation you'll see
those those are actually variables
you're setting off yeah a delicate
objects yeah each of those the same way
you would set them outside of the
construction as well that's exactly
right and so you and Skylar allows you
some nice trickery and that you can
rename packages so here we're renaming
the Java effects scene shape to believe
reiated j FX SS and that means we can
disambiguate between the two all right
so I think it yeah like work yeah so
it's just good to show the
implementation yeah of this but yes it
could be a bit of cheese skull well so
there's this there's two levels of using
a library right so you've got the scala
facts app which your shine with ya very
simple yet elegant and then behind it
you've got a dsl yeah and the goal of
the dsl is to make things simple elegant
yet itself it's sometimes complicated
simpsons let's come out of it it's good
to show the implementation but i think
we just point out to folks that you
don't actually have to write code like
this to you scoffs yes
library writers are writing this code it
should be writing this code for users ok
so what let's go back to the example so
so while we've been chatting so Russell
gym and a whole bunch of other folks are
on the stream I guess yeah hi and
they're making fun of both of our access
apparently you you seem to our British
accent yes and I have a u.s. exit yes
and we're both wrong repay fun depending
upon which orientation you have we're
both remain wrong we're both cousins
come on pieces so by the end of this
dream I think Jim and Russell will
figure it out they'll figure out what
Jackson is the right accent yeah yeah
all right so this is a cool demo for
cubes and how much good this end up
being I let's have a look so so I'm 142
and I I happen I think I actually have
the original do you have an ensemble I
do have D is I want to bring it up here
and I'm be sure just find it oh ok you
do you do you're all those I have yeah
those of you that know ensemble is the
first javafx or java application for
that matter in the App Store download it
so we can get the number of downloads oh
my jesus christ initially for crash that
would never happen oh here we go
prosecute must be okay let's see what a
3d stuff was so yeah so this you keep
that's it yeah so the source code is it
doesn't give us line that that's that
looks like a lot more code yeah i'm
willing to bet anyone anyone stream what
about how many lines this is type type
fast we're check yeah i'm going to
accidentally oops i won 55 55 okay but i
think there's a lot clearer yeah oh yeah
so do i look at all these these wreck
definition
yeah short yeah actually the other thing
we could check is number of characters
yeah and you look at the rec definition
here and then you gotta do all that
extra builder yeah I mean it is a little
bit more noise but you know um perhaps
we should have started with Java as the
squid team man yeah no I had nothing
yeah I think I only lost 18 months but
but we learned to lolly was three years
yeah okay the last three years yeah okay
so that just shows us um I'm at one of
the cool stock in well I was well let's
show us show the actual video team so
this is not India in sample and but it
was part of the java java one last year
2011 2011 and i try to recreate this and
but it's not quite the same so those
applying its plane move your home basis
with you yes but
the performies different movie sets pain
trailers and we can do this yourself you
can see download it from somewhere and
the internet popular video site and you
can download
summer
got some messages here warned me not to
anyway and you can have a look yourself
Mike
that's better distortion of my thank you
very
the vinyl
what type of lead email
snow
is a little bucket and that shows you
we're not quite there yet so let me show
you how many lines of code that is
that's about 2 37 and what I did here is
create a custom component and you can do
and the problem here is that where it's
best to be seen so if i get uncomment
this line then i suppose the when doing
artifacts will show and not it's still
and i don't know where that is really i
don't know what the jabber one or javafx
team did you know to sort this so
actually what I've done is put a just a
backing rectangle and its just oh what
else
maybe I have a fix and five kids ok so
that's why I fall originally so what in
solar code isn't so ya see you like your
depth test there at exactly the same
depth um so what you want to do is
where's your where's your backing
rectangle this is my back in rectangle
so are you saying I should translate it
by Z or Z ok so where's the position X Y
yeah and with I had as a Z code set
somewhere else it's that get sent here
and the fact the fact is I've probably
done it quiet elegance yo so you've got
a media of you sitting supposedly on top
of a a back in rectangle and it needs to
just be slightly in front ok this is the
size of the cube that's the size the
size the cube yeah which of these are
for the faces and which use for media
players these look like the media but
yes it's combined were the faces the
faces are defined inside this class
sorry yeah oh I see I see you you is
like a stack um no isn't it disagreed it
properly I yeah it's not it's just a
second yeah it's well it's a list of
children yeah yeah and then it's what
was the type of media you cube where is
it extend its extend squeak ok so it's
group yeah ok so it's just group with
two elements yeah inside of it ok so we
might be able to do is just for kicks
let's let's make this slightly yeah can
you do is EDD probably know it might be
my sense may translate yeah okay let's
try that try that that had occurred to
me and I didn't quite work okay so
Russell Russell wants to do groovy
effects version of the same the same
application i assume he's talking about
this one yeah oh he's hitfix ice great
it's I tell you well mostly first I
think it yeah it was just it was just
looking yes I think it's not
but you see it's more specific you can
fiddle with that
okay so early do ya do it you need to
offset of flight
oh where
we're going to get the video Cuba I'm
the URL let's see this checked into the
skull effects for you post.really oh
yeah you have to write ok it's let's see
you go to source and then we need to
view it don't we not browse it ok so
let's see so the URL is
where's the URL still being open open
the projects they got that's the UI okay
yeah so just ask Allah 0 yeah ok so
I'll just love people that is checked
the video cube am and did you put a jury
push it I haven't pushed it yet I'm just
trying to find will be checked them yeah
enter the scholar Fox repo yeah here it
would appear that we don't have a demo
dead yes we do have a demo folder so if
you're still looking at the screen there
is that's not the last thing I did is a
couple of weeks ago three weeks ago okay
so let me push that fix in is it and
hopefully I have do have an up-to-date
version ok Skaar love you guys you guys
are seeing live yeah that's aw yeah yes
please we did a bug fix we're doing a
remote push into the scholar flex repo
video kidada and Russell Russell
volunteered to do a groovy effects
version of the sames yeah we I want to
see I want to see her I want to see your
groovy effects version idea from I need
to push it how do i do push yeah hey
ricura got on the Carolinian
might and might oh yeah he might have
mr. i push trenchant remember you're
walking known off the top of my head is
her she'll go girl bargain I thought I
did this already yeah but IntelliJ
doesn't matter if you push from the
command model problem yeah okay let me
HD push do it yeah oh yeah oh you've got
on ma I gotta unlock it after cancel
cancel it and try now you know what
probably is i did probably change my
google account over account all right
can I then pause the screen nobody's
going to see it all shows are the stars
huh because I can't remember it my
google account and as far as well oh
I'll take you off screen yeah and I'll
push it right now all right you're off
screen go do your thang here and in your
secret I say this is it this is a good
time to ask questions about the sky
effects project if you if you have them
for Peter that's pretty look pretty cool
project yes I know obviously someone
else was using so who created us all
fixed up hey you didn't he would swen
lemus yeah I was both of us yeah was
enough a guy actually lots of personal
to contribute yeah so it yet and I star
bit before jawbone last year and a whole
bunch of guys from Brazil have been
helping us uh yeah and Peter too yeah
under pilgrim yeah yes and now I've
contributed a Gradle build
so far you know I should be in what do I
need to do just do the same thing from
there go back to the command line from
go back to ya later your password me
Anna oh I can use my ordinary pass yard
okay I had no idea I could do that earth
forbidden I need a special log in before
I know yeah
okay that's the one and you can't change
that always the way of changing that you
can you can actually for google code you
can actually turn on authentication
where you use your normal google
password marathon a generated one yeah I
need to figure that out okay okay take
that off screen yeah ok I will go back
and back on that in there yeah there you
go look back in back from that that
water way back alright so so now we've
got been in google code yeah check it
out here Sophie browse I mean where'd
you put it into demos not the time to
demo up the top yeah and grant graphics
3d graphics we did Somalia and create
video cued mo there you go it's okay so
that's the code directory you can check
out the video cube example of Peter just
Peter just you hacked and you push yeah
active pushed it okay all of our lights
or else what else we're gonna show oh
well I'm we can move out from joba
effects and talk about know so um yeah
jim has a request he wants the video
cube to play the stream clips clips from
my back well it good idea mess of a
because I don't miss miss sort out and
so I think I think that close to 30
videos from this whole night hacking
tour wow so i'll do a final blog post
listing all of them but it would be
great to see what folks can do with some
of the video I've yeah Bernama folks
problem is is a with that content you
probably want to download a couple
number on storm locally I mean you put
in Java flex you can put the an Internet
HTTP URL they're fairly they're fairly
low bandwidth okay yeah I go work yeah a
plane capable work and if you
in that way yeah we got fiber oh no
problemo No or you could just do like
one clip and yes playing all the face
yeah yeah oh yeah different right so we
have another question from and I wish
your give me twitter names mm-hmm
because I know who this is and I just
can't okay it's okay Philip will you a
question from Philip yeah he's wondering
why the javafx seen paint color and not
skoloff xine paint color in your class
why don't you use the scholar fix color
class this gotta fix car well what you
assume i assume he's looking Edwards
maybe not this one manic you okay so
this was a straight port was it and
probably incomplete no neither these
knows no color all right so Philip we
don't we don't see what you're talking
about at least in these two examples but
anyway you can use either the javafx
color or you can use the scala facts
color pretty interchangeably because of
the scala implicit so it'll
automatically convert between the two
yeah the reason we created the skull
effects color class was because we
wanted to add on some special stuff to
it yeah okay I don't remember all around
what they were so let me just look at
the source code for scale effects yeah I
see we also need to clear up some of the
API because some of the public methods
don't have explicit return types so well
I learned from Joshua refuse works at
typesafe and the same food public
libraries you should really should
return a nice return type as we see here
is it the color delegate there's some
other thing here where we should
basically say where it can work out what
the color is I don't need where there's
some
well so there's another one over we
don't usually type it on yeah ah yes
this let's see all right where we where
we have you can find out well I can I
mean because I had to change it pika but
but in general the the way the scala
facts architecture works is there's a
set of proxy classes for every javafx
class yeah if you just stick to the
skoloff x versions and your scala
effects code that's pretty brain dead it
just kind of works but you can also mix
in javafx ones as well which witch
wished demos at philip he's saying it's
one of them ok soon I don't know I'm ok
so this thing here is called a what was
it called I think scarlet color well it
is this yeah it was this guy chain one
it was the color and what were we
missing a time yeah yeah it was example
this yeah but you don't need to take
that well I because it's a sincere since
you're simply setting it up as a method
yeah then the type is known it can infer
it off of this method it's going to
return the exactly the same time yeah
somehow it was an issue anyway I found
and so it didn't actually we were we
this is a problem because yeah with
desaturate should be returning the
scholar effects color not the no because
it's a method it's not a like this this
is a color object it's for actually
these are wrong too yeah these are all
wrong so it shouldn't it shouldn't be of
type color because it's it's a it's a
method it returns it's a method which
returns color right so the method is
returning because I like the type is
method the type is not yeah where it was
something going wrong with the in place
it's there or we probably have to
investigate a bit more why yeah this
little subject you into the skull and it
will go to confusing people you don't
really need to know what the color class
looks like to use Collins you can just
use it and if there's any problems just
got a message to the dev listen we have
a look so else you want sure if it's
gone office I start talking about your
book um I say anything else um okay
let's not wait yeah so what book a run
here I'm writing a reference for java ee
7 on your browser so i can go which
browser i just closed it down and when I
was a browser maybe yeah oh oh it's a
book yes coming from packt publishing
and we're aiming or the schedule is
planned for may 2013 and or june so that
would be the time that java ee 7 his
belief but i I've had to change the
first chapter because I started writing
it in the summer and then it was
originally moving to the cloud so the
first chapter has to be rewritten
because now there's we are no longer
moved into the class so so is it or your
time here to line up with the Java 8
Java 7 release yes about the e7 say I
caught a bit of Antonio presentation at
devil yeah yeah it's running on this
book as well but these four different
publishers yeah so we explicitly we've
got the same issues with the speckers
changing is difficult to get real
information so what was your favorite
job is southern future I think it is CDI
contents and dependency injection and
and as I get further into the WebSocket
stuff which and the jax-rs stuff I think
those features will be very important so
I you did an example we've sort of a
spring spring example widow yes I you
can put you do the same thing with java
ee i was just using that as an example
of this green technologies yeah hello so
really good example and okay so i can
I've written some example code and
where's the project for the Java EE and
it's looking at the closest window and
which is looking at CDI contents and
dependency and jet injection and to
actually teach you how to use it and so
and so I interesting thing about CDI is
that you can use it in the container and
the way I was thinking of teaching
people about CDI and was to not use it
within the container but start with CDI
outside of the container and I was
looking around for a way to do this in
standard Java EE and there isn't however
there's a thing called jboss weld which
is a implementation of CDI outside the
container but specifically for jboss but
you there's also something called Apache
web beans just I think does similar yeah
ok so in if I find my unit test here
example CDI container this is the way
that you can create a CDI container and
what it uses is something called Delta
spite which is allows you to instantiate
weld or Apache web beans and therefore
you've got in it a way of testing CDI
outside the container there's some phone
to standalone application or it could
use that with job offers yes you look at
you can so yeah you can build them java
effects that were an application that
way and yeah but really the
disappointing thing is is that CD I
outside the container won't be
standardized in java ee 7 8 like CDI to
when i spoke to david Blevins
dev wats conference hehe yeah he said
well there's probably too much and the
other one that I ok so I in the book
I've got a this very any stage of the
book of what an example of writing the
unit tests it seems to be like some of
the companies of 14 haven't bothered
with the unit tests at all so sorry ok
so that's not the one oh right so this
is proper CDI outside the container
where you can inject a travel service
and there are two types of travel
services and outs and it's basically an
interface and there's a couple
implementations there's a budget one
which is annotated with a premium and to
look at that annotation it's just a
simple annotation with something called
qualifier and the whole point of this is
that you don't have to use any xml file
I also follows on a spring or any other
or that was older and dependency
injection frameworks and what you can do
then if I go back to the tests that let
me see gone to the test again the type
of service test you've got two types and
all this does is check that the
container can inject the right container
work the right service and you can find
it all that you see got to scroll up
since you didn't see the output the
output is coming from Delta spike which
is a really cool thing and it's
configured to instantiate the weld
container and and then you can you can
see that it's actually pulling in
different travel services
depending on the qualifier and yeah I
think you can build a sort of like using
juice then to those us example Gary
partier but yes it's going to be pi
liable okay so that was that so that's
going to be with some modifications I'm
of it's all going to change by May
twenty so have you done JMS 2011 of the
geysers and no I gonna new like in the
new queue easy to configure cues I've
heard I forget stuff about nature yeah I
should be quite useful yeah when when i
get to that chapter you're going there
now I'm getting there there's a lot to
be written alright so when you when you
get that chapter like what Alex know
what you think of jameis yeah yeah I'm
enjoying this it's all good yeah yeah
I'm toying with the idea of sending
people further into enterprise
integration which would bring them into
camel or spring integration but I may
not get that far and the publisher may
check it out of course I'm okay what
else I'm the other one is I do one more
which is I'll Killian and you might have
seen oh yeah we had a great so if you
guys don't know much better kill ya we
had a great night hacking interview with
dan allen yeah and hurting my brain I
forget I forget that what the lead
developer for Killian oh is this um not
done now that is it David Blevins they
said my climbing up yeah anyway while
you're while you'r science exam all good
football yeah ok so the sister the test
example that they do I'm so what do we
have here of course a closed I have the
same sort of
CDI annotations it's at its accredit
down alone as like as slack yeah that's
see I was member to meet dr. yeah he was
a great guy at devoxx and I heard very
fast yeah awesome coder yeah it's a
shame because I knew he was there are
you sure you should hang out us and then
you were to go through other people's
yeah I came down with and raised hacker
garden and the jboss guys I could see
them where there's so busy hacking away
and that's our I'm not going to bother
there we go so we have a premium credit
processor which is then going to offer a
premium credit to people and what have I
done with the budget one with the budget
1 i've called it the economy this is
actually showing off the benefits of a
factory it's actually instantiate in May
one who a factory method this is known
as a producer in CDI and then the other
side of it you can release this credit
processor which is obviously going to be
dear economy and actually the it's
actually in a class inside this
household credit kind of makes sense so
that's also i think that's going to stay
into may next year and so the unit test
for this
it's here and the interesting thing
about arquillian it is that you it
deploys to a wheel server so oh yeah
great upgrade oh yeah let me jump to
Gradle very quickly for you want you
getting people's head explodes yes so
Grendel is much better than maven so at
the moment so it just this will just run
it will download the Internet including
glassfish nice and the killian but it
will run yeah so Gretel oil to put is
his dependency management with not all
the the angle bracket rain yes oh yeah
and stuff so yeah so and so youryour CDI
examples going to be available on github
and 19 yes i will put them but you
probably have to wait until they get to
the publisher so you're seeing this
right now and your publisher yeah well I
need to speak to them I need to have
that conversation ask them when we when
we did the book for a press we just pull
our code out didn't ya cuz it was all
gonna be published for free in the end
anyway yeah I need to ask them yeah and
of course so bacteria ok so this
processor test users are Killian yeah
the great thing about our communities
that you get to say and specify how you
want to build your jars with this I
don't know how they've done it with this
shrink wrap job archive creator and you
can supply Eva unique classes you can
also supply packages and so you can
write and really fine-tune crest and
process so what this test should inject
is there it's the household credit
Street credit processor processor so
let's run that and just see what happens
if I go back to that be the fastest
thing I don't i'm not sure how we're
doing for time but ok i'm sure wrap up
yeah ok so it's a very green bar we
straightforward tests and the
interesting thing is that it builds you
a jar dynamically puts all those classes
inside it and actually you can print out
this jar fire to see the results of it
and you can see the street credit
processor being created and if you go to
that the household credit i think i've
defined some methods to show you this
yeah and the final one is a user's
injectors so if I it's sort of a
transactional transaction credit
processor and you've got a post
construct and the pre destroying and an
interceptor
around it so I work I won't bother
explaining all of this but you just
studied the output on the output well
she just shows you that is again
creating a proxy a processor and you're
getting the Interceptor before it
executes that transactional method and
then afterwards and you go so very
simple examples actually sell about 50
pages of pay up tech so far so and
that's just a basic CDI and to probably
be an advanced chapter in it all rights
rollicking far as your box yes I
couldn't risk get right in it than
completing it anyway that's it all right
i think i think that's that's a good
that's a good hacking session so um i
wanna well i thank Peter for being my
last night hacker yeah so the the
benefit you get is you get to close out
the show yes for the deadlock store it's
a congratulations thank you very much
the disadvantage is I'm all out of
stickers it doesn't matter I gave my
last one did you get a t-shirt I got
tisha awesome let's even it that's even
better than a sticker we did we had a
bunch of t-shirts for folks in the
audience at dev off yeah and they all
stood up during the keynote which was
great yeah okay so let's talk a little
bit about what's I don't want to also
thank the skills matter yeah yeah
we should I thanks the skills matter
Wendy and Nick for allowing us to use
their offices and and without this we
wouldn't ya know they do lots of great
events like they ran schol exchange
today which your was that I helped they
run Scala days yes as well alright we we
can we can we don't have a nice banner
but we want them this one here there
suppose matter you've seen you seen them
at conferences okay so next for the
night hacking tour this is the last
stream of the tour but i will be posting
a final blog and then i'm going to put a
little survey there but what folks would
like to see next yes so there's some
options there can be you know additional
tours we could do some follow-on shows
virtually with people they're going to
do like a monthly or biweekly show so
there's a lot of stuff we can do with
video and you know folks who actually
like coding maybe we do some hackathon
sessions with with wider groups kind of
google hangout style so i'll post a
final kind of rapper blog link to the
YouTube videos and show them what
they're all doing parlays yeah and let
folks participate but I also want to
thank all the people who participate in
the stream you know folks who actually
watch this live helped ask it questions
on the stream you don't you know who you
guys are and really support us through
the entire torso thanks thanks for being
a knight hacker and yeah i'll hit you on
the next run through Europe or or
wherever you live yeah yes it's been a
pleasure and and you've been on the tour
you've been on the stream as well Peter
I I have so that's been awesome really
good yeah and yeah i'm i'm toying with
the idea of setting up something with
java effects and and next year I don't
know what it would be and admire your
app to get your book public yeah I've
times but no sense yeah get the book out
that door look out yeah I might find a
bit of Java effects in there but but the
book is very important all right so
thanks for everybody and hope you
enjoyed this edition of night hacking
with your heater pilgrim okay thanks
