gonna chat today a little bit about chat
BOTS yes so yeah yeah boy spots whatever
so what what do you guys what do you got
who's good who's winning the boys spot
worse do you think so in terms of
ecosystem and the landscape today I
think that Amazon are in the lead they
were there first they or people using
their yes they covered much more ground
in the early days but the interesting
part is that we are doing today talk
about implementing kind of a custom
actions and skills Amazon Alexa and it's
actually Google assistant which is
implemented in Google home and and I
think that from our experience Google
home has a much more pleasant easygoing
and modern approach to writing those
extensions as a developer writing
extensions the Google platform is a
little more yeah I would say that they
both very nice start up some time ago
called
AP I don't I I we just call it
III for the sake of they then renamed it
by the way like like last week it's a
dialogue flow now ready right it's
interesting and and this this startup
makes the does a very good work in
implementing this cross-platform chat
board infrastructure yeah it makes it
very easy very pleasant and all the
things that you need to kind of bottle
in when you write Alexa actions are just
not there when you write Alexa skills
are just not there when you write Google
actions and and that's for stealing the
market agency point is that you know it
reminds me like a JavaScript market like
some time ago like there's every week
some new framework and in this case like
we're already doing this like the talk
for for quite some time any month three
months yeah in quite some time three to
three different conferences and we
already like redesign this a lot of
things internally like this if yeah I
just done a few bands the API serve all
day yes what's important more
importantly to leak involving and the
more and more features becoming
available so for example like we're
starting with a simple like a boys like
text responses now we've all them into
like adding intonation pronunciation
correct pronunciation of current certain
words now it doesn't sound like a
robotic hello people I am a robot
now it's you can you can add specific
tags to the speech so it can more
natural especially for terms which are
more like technical or just won't get
right normally yes and and I think this
and of course some Amazon is trying to
catch up the the gap but this API I I
gives Google quite an advantage and if
you ask me that's the opportunity to
steal the market because the market is
about the third-party integrations and
the easier it is to write those
third-party integrations the more
integrations in this this is like a
repeat of the the app market for mobile
devices just on a voice platform exactly
exactly and I think by the way that
interestingly enough and it's kind of
the it's a little bit different players
Google are there as there are on a
mobile market but here they are battling
who is amazon and not with apple but did
this thing of we will make it easier for
the developers and maybe it won't be as
sleek as the other guy but we will win
by the sheer quantity i think still
stands for google those days and i guess
the difference between like Apple Google
and Amazon at this point that they
trying to kind of promote their platform
cloud for platforms which is not only
you know place where you can you know
put your code which is both of them kind
of steer you towards use our thing right
so when you use an Amazon
when you write Amazon actions Alexa
actions they kind of you go use lambda
it's the easiest way and when you write
Google they're like here is a very
simple way to use Google App Engine
Google functions but it's actually
doesn't have to be right all the
fulfillment the back end of those skills
is just an HTTP resource so it can be
anything it could be yeah they choose
the the most proprietary part of their
cloud offering recommends well it makes
sense for them of course but I think our
point yeah here is that it doesn't
matter it doesn't have to be that way so
one of the use cases that we'll explore
and it's like a invoking some third
party API for example JIRA right now
which is we using JIRA is a resource of
the data for example we can we develop
in a assistant for stand-ups so when you
go to stand-ups you can ask your Google
assistant or relaxed hey how many
critical issues do we have and in this
case it will you know scale itself will
transfer you know Big O of course if
you're like in a stand-up meeting and
you're wondering like is there a new
version of any of our like you know
dependencies then you could just ask the
system you know
exactly so so we tried a couple of
different ways and I did a skill for for
Jenkins in which you can ask what's the
status of the build and was the side of
the branch which is nice but it's usage
is limited because you don't normally
interact that much was your CI sorry
it's usually an infrastructure that you
get notification if your build past or
or failed and that's pretty much it but
in this interaction actually there's
something very I think useful this day
least and a persistent can actually be a
very useful tool for those daily
stand-ups because people talk and if you
have a resource in which you can ask
questions like where are we in terms of
items that need to be done towards our
end of our
or sprint how many critical box they are
is there a new version of the library I
think I need to create a skill for my
stand-up replacement which will answer
questions about like what I did since
the last stand-up and what I'm working
on
exactly I'll update the program each day
yes and and then all people need to do
is update their status in their skill
and it will help like five or six
devices that it will talk to each other
yeah yeah have the device is physically
talking and doing a stand-up many people
exactly another cool thing that is you
know using this like a voice-activated
thing is like a it's essentially like a
streaming data that allows me to you
know collect this input to the streaming
platform great like Apache Kafka
something like that
I don't know I actually I actually
seriously working on the you know kind
of the demo where the people on the
booth can ask a lecture about the tweets
about the conference and how many people
tweeting about like a certain hashtag
for example which it would be very nice
that you know use of the technology so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
