welcome to the night hacking interviews
like to welcome everyone here okay so
the sound sound sounds a little bit
better now all right no yes it's kind of
weird here okay so all right so welcome
to the night hacking interviews and I
hope you guys enjoy nning the hacker
garden so you know I invite everyone
here to join all those nice people here
at the hot garden tables to hacking
things are you guys hacking things over
there yes hey man who are you hacking
beer over there yeah excellent so so no
so you have beer hacking we have 3d
printing hacking we have netbeans a guy
coming like with a frog frog is there a
frog in your throat oh no it's in your
shoulder so no I mean he's the
interviewer if it's written over there
that I'm interviewing him so but no it's
it didn't start yet so we aren't doing
it we can't inside right now yeah yeah
okay so all right so no thanks thanks
for watching and the night hacking
interviews and here at that Fox right
live from devoxx one of the guys have
been interviewing amazing people is this
guy here of me is Vin Reimers heisman
how are you doing man good man very very
good so there for me so he's been you
were here at devoxx and you're doing the
haka garden your own eyes all the hot
garden you interviewed all kinds of cool
people here yeah and but you're also do
you give in talks yes it gave talks
right and you know and you are also
hacking openjdk you're hacking that
beans yes you know what is that you're
not doing here at devoxx you know how
can you actually find time to do all
those things probably i'm sleeping less
here's living last right so that was
like a i was attending hang around like
the the last couple of conferences and
that box last year's and so the typical
organizers like a heatheravan kura and
they are mere a they weren't available
ok for running the garden so they
thought well my we
asks when people do okay okay so you
know about the things like saying no yes
up my mind i'm not a guidance we go we
can't say no right yeah we can't say no
that yeah so so so that is that no
you're telling me that you are one of
the guys doing the port of java to
freebsd way back hand when before
freebsd extra was able to run java so
was that how you start it also someone
said oh he's really going to do it and
you just go and he did it ah no what's
probably more like i wanted to run a
freebsd and I there was like it was like
like today you know you you stick things
onto each other like a you take your
host and then you put on a vm thing and
then you hook on like Tomic host and
then put on duck her and then you put
like containers in the dock her rent on
yeah right so it was like running
freebsd running linux emulation on
freebsd and then taking the back down
part from Johan right yeah so Anna I
didn't know you're on back then but take
it out last later on that urine was the
guy want one of the guys behind back
down uh-huh so and then the word were a
set of patches you could apply to the
blackdown port to make the JVM run on
freebsd so I was always trying these
things out and giving feedback and so I
was not that type of like a deep core
hardcore C++ C hecking JVM internal no
no it's not right okay but um give them
feedback I'm trying to get things
running and I started to like put
together links to documentation things
like you want to do java and freebsd
well here's from all the resources and
it was very the early days you know like
right yes I guess all right like I can
remember running a WT like like like
before a collections were here that's
not like like ancient stone yes yes well
you know we did run aw there's yes ok so
you know so you've been working a Java
for a long time and one of the things
are your hacking a lot two days and that
means right yeah so so I know so you've
been hacking on Java VM you been hacking
on NetBeans all kinds of open source
projects um you know it was hard to get
started on those things um you know how
no not really
cheers oh so the answer come on get get
to be right there oh man oh come on all
right so um was it hard to get started
well no no no not really so just a um I
think it's the the major thing is like
do not get like wow this is big no it's
less like figuring out what you want to
do and just get shot at one simple point
right and then take it from there and
that's like it just grows like so first
thing is like you may want to have like
simple things changed and then you start
to look well what you can do and you get
interested in house works and you read
things and yes it's like it's like like
kind of incremental process right and so
when you started on phone hacking on the
freebsd vm i know your parts appearance
on Friday man just just get this as an
example when you start your hacking on
this you said you start with
documentation right yeah and so you know
is this is this a good place to start
with a lot of developers want to
contribute to open source project they
don't know what yet our documentation is
is so nobody loves to do documentation
documentation is very essential for
anyone to get started yes so if you
figure out something about what you
didn't know beforehand get a documented
go find a wiki Absalom lists wherever
just to get make sure that your your
knowledge is not lost right that's
that's the starting point very easy so
yeah and one of the things that I a few
things that i like to say about
documentation is that you know he gets
for example one one of the guys is
that's like the most non guy from the
NetBeans community getcha getcha yeah so
gurjen uh you know he's loving all over
the world for all the great war doesn't
that mean his and he started by doing
nappies documented everyone knew him
because he was the one to write in the
comment a shin yeah and that being
started being education started as a
technical writer right and he was like
oh still holds documentation figure well
that's the great thing yeah i'm just
like very enthusiastic about it and so
we went from being a technical writer to
being like the
manager yes so just by doing stuff yeah
so just by starting right yeah just so
it's like documentation is really
essential yeah really so even if you do
so so I'm there so this actually we have
nice tools to do in documentation like a
ski doc so like it's like easy to write
documentation you don't have to fill
with like well okay yeah just fire up
your favorite text editor and just get
some things done yes look it's quite
easy today pretty cool yeah very cool
and I like gay if you figure out some
like Java doc I'm the openjdk is like
broken for you yeah try to fix it and
send it to openjdk and I think
documentation chain is just a good thing
to get started for Pro Open JK all right
that's so cool so let's switch gears
since we're gonna talk about everything
here right yeah so let's switch gears of
Java where any of Java yes it's you know
how long have you been doing java 97
maybe 97 it's like 19 then probably your
19 at that time no no no I think it man
thanks Oh like 19 years of Java with me
only 19 years of Java or item so yes yes
okay all right yeah that's that's quite
some time yeah but probably did 20 years
man I yeah I've started I've started
leaving before 120 yeah I started with
with alpha both offer yes man alpha chew
this is first job first John he and i
use it Wow yes so you still know about
the the oak thing well actually when i
started with java inside son he was i
know i started I I learn about Java a
week before it was officially announcing
Wow right because I had just joined son
okay and and there's a guy from the US
that came to Brazil to give a training
course and he told me and he told me
about oak okay so when I access the
internal website for son he was already
named Java but that guy called it oak
okay so was quite light and the process
to change the name yeah well yeah I
don't under ex Ollie when you change it
but but you know when I when I met
original you're still from the early
beginnings yeah okay well you know and
then you know you start with Java 19
years ago
and and you know fast forward right now
netbeans a dot one just was just
released it last week right and you know
you are one of the netbeans ring team
guys yes right so you being or behind
all of this the netbeans evolution
you've been helping out you've been
reaching out to the community you mean
so how it is to be you know all those
years working with java and you know
you're helping out this great tool this
great development tool that actually
keeps you know java available every less
version of Java is available because of
NetBeans right you know how is how it
should work on that cool project that's
great it's great feeling to to
contribute things so um why i thought i
was like a we try to figure out a like
trading concept at the company I was
working for and I wanted to do like well
we want to have a software engineering
we want to build to train better
software engineers uh-huh so the hell
about what can we do and then there was
this very new thing called find bugs
yeah and there was an integration for
well another ide and I said well we will
do the teaching was that I de because
they have a fine box integration is that
no that's not the way to go so if you
like a tool because it's good well get
the integration for you too so that
evening I started to write the five
bucks integration for netbeans oh cool
nice so let's go down man that's what
got me started and them and doing all
this I figured out all of the Eternals
and yeah so things like like progress
and you get you've got to be part of the
dream team because you you you
contributed to NetBeans alone right and
now you get like a like kind of inside
information like well you discuss things
and you can can get feedback on well we
don't like this probably you should
evaluate if you would like to have this
right like we say go there and they do
it but it's like well they are listening
so it's it's a it's a quite big group
and quite a solution group I think so
you know it makes sense to we get sleep
back on how we how we do things and how
we use netbeans and what might be
missing
and so we I think the the new additions
like a very very very good javascript
support so we had a interview with say
gershon today about nice our script
support NetBeans ok as like like awesome
they even added new things like no chair
support a rated one right and so that
things up for netbeans is like so that's
interesting right because if you are a
Java developer I'm sure there's some
JavaScript code some wearing a project
yeah that means a complete to you can
you actually have that and there's a
special edition just for JavaScript
html5 developers ok so they don't get
scared away by all the things that the
ID could do as well right download the
very sleek slim version for Friday
channel five shots get so ok that's
pretty nice so now you touching one
important things is that you know your
your participate on the NetBeans open
source project yeah and you know of
course you don't say duties and people
just go and do it because that's not the
way the open source project works right
now is it you actually don't get to tell
what other people going to work on right
and they don't get to tell you what are
you going to work on so how does an open
source project really works if everyone
is working on the things they want and
no one's can no one can tell everyone
anyone else to actually work on some
specific thing so probably this is one
of the things I liked about the name the
NetBeans open source project is you can
extend the IDE in any way you want for
yourself so even if it's not part of the
domain distribution well the plugin
architecture allows for your special
feature in your personal version of the
IDE go for it do it use it and if enough
people well so you can upload it to the
Napa dragon portal other people can use
it and if there are large pile of users
maybe sometime later it might be
integrated in some or other way so yeah
it's like you can't get every feature
from your open source project but maybe
you can do your own bills or influence
how influential the the development both
take shape like the Rope map things like
right look at this we're doing all of
this stuff and it might be interesting
for you to support this in any way and
sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't but yeah that's life man yeah
that's that's that's ok so you know
we're talking here it was V&amp;amp;A you know
he's been doing so many things in their
walks that's we have to jump from one
place yes so and you talk about you know
contributing and hacking on things and
that's what's all the hawk garden here
is all about right you know come here to
hack on things so from all the things
that you hack it doing this this this
days here at devoxx what is the thing
that you found most interesting here
decorating um I know I know you're I
know you're working with gorgeous system
yesterday yeah where was that probably
of the day so so so so we did a bit of a
tweaking the tweet wall for them for for
dev ox again so so you know customer
requests coming and very light like it
all right yeah you the color of the the
phones of like well please make a black
so I can read it like from right 100
meters oh you're talking about the
Twitter yeah that's running here yeah oh
yes so it should we fixed that one but I
think the most of anything was like we
try to do some jigsaw hacking ok so like
taking the tweet wall thing we already
had and just like try to pack it and do
more you'll things with dicks oh and um
well I would say it works but there's
the tooling support from ideas like
non-existent at the moment right well
but then you should expect that it's
like it's really working correctly yeah
yeah yeah yeah it's like floating and
moving so a moving target so yeah but um
the tools from jigsaw they work get the
latest bill figure it out so we just had
a discussion about um guys from canoe
they further a new platform they build
their own like copy kind of copy of
javafx properties and binding stuff
because they didn't know that there
might be a simple javac space module on
JD canine that just separates out all
those things that don't don't they
really are associated with graphics but
just our API so huh so um so jigsaw is
really a nice project in terms of
cutting downs real big blob of code into
really good digestible chunks ok very
little so much fun so you're looking
forward for 44 jigsaw in Java nine now
yes absolutely so yeah all right very
very cool and and so I you quickly
mentioned is but your talk here was
about the Twitter wall right
yes okay so so can you tell us what the
tweeter wall is and how it's being used
here dev box so last year Stefan Johnson
was challenging us so the javafx
community like huh look here we got the
slice online JavaScript version could
you do that in javafx probably you have
two big Walters played on here so yeah
we took the challenge and we did a 3d
version that was well not so readable so
we we fell back to it like 2d bowl and
um yeah we did it all in javafx okay and
it's running on a standard PC but you
can run on a raspberry pi as well or
whatever little device you have so for
your own conference uh-huh and yeah I
was just doing a presentation on how
lowly volved and where we started and
how we get further and now it's quite
simple style moves so if you're running
your own event somewhere out there like
a box days or like a local netbeans day
or whatever go to github tweet wall
effects clone ads for kit whatever at
your own CSS property things and you're
good to go nice excellent so now you
know we're talking here several deals
interviews I'm conducting here we're
trying to see what can we tell all the
developers are watching us right now you
know things that they can do to improve
their careers right because career is
something that it's our responsibility
our personal responsibility to care of
all right if we don't care if you don't
improve our own careers no one's gonna
do that for us right yeah so and you
have been you know you've been working
on all kinds of open source projects
you've been you know looks like you hold
your whole career you were contributing
things and all of these is volunteer
some of these I think your company
you're doing things that your company
benefit from but mostly you're doing is
a volunteer how how can I you know being
a volunteer actually improve your career
or queries of people are watching us you
know because I don't I don't I know your
volunteer job is groups I know your
volunteer project I know your volunteer
volunteer some other organizations you
know like oxygen the you can pull simple
it's you learn to know people like Bruno
Souza
no just kidding but the major thing as
you you learn stuff uh-huh you learn
stuff you will never learn if you're
just sit in your office you your daily
work so it's like like like robbing your
your your horizon you you figure out
different things you you you open up new
dimensions for yourself and don't be
afraid no once no one's will kick you
out out of anywhere so I'm give it a go
it's like like improving on yourself
learn new things everyday so it's like a
how put think I'd put it like a life
begins at the end of your comfort zone
yes I think our own group test arun
gupta yeah yeah blind shubhankar here so
yeah what yes yes yeah yes actually
thank God said you need to get out of
the comfort zone yeah right i really
don't like that but yeah and then you
know just she closes here uh James Ghazi
sad that you know you keep learning yes
the end it's a lot easier if it's fine
yes absolutely so yeah so um took me way
long to get a usergroup running but um
yeah it's fun it's fun right yeah okay
people like it alright so thanks for
watching and we are here directly from
dev aux-in in belgium for the night
hacking and doing interviews with very
cool people like vin okay and i hope you
keep watching us and keep learning and
keeping invest in your career because
that's your responsibility we all have a
responsibility to improve our curious
thanks a lot thank dr. McMahon thanks in
good record</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
