tour we're here in Stuttgart with jug
Stuttgart and Verner kyle is going to
give a short presentation on jsr 363 so
welcome welcome to the night hacking
tour thank you so yeah I'm just going to
show a little bit of code or the actual
demos no slides so it's a really
hands-on cold experience so change our
363 was actually just past the review
and now the executive committee starts
started to watch a moment it looks quite
good but most of them are generally a
bit lazy or have to ask the lawyer so
until everybody finally votes it may
take still a few days but I think some
people have already cast a vote in the
last couple of days and since we also
did a presentation to the executive
committee in January while we met in
Santa san francisco which they were
generally convinced that this makes
sense for the Internet of Things error
so that Java also has something similar
to other languages that say like C++ or
F sharp that have proper unit of
measurement support for quite a while
now yeah and that'll be helpful with i'm
going to show a bunch of embedded demos
so yeah so this also raises oh this is a
good tired good good segue so i'm going
to show a couple of different demos the
first one those who wear a chapel end or
select the quick video may find it
familiar that's a child I've ex-demo to
demonstrate it for the desktop and for
Java s ii
so there's an Android application for
unit conversions that's called a flip ya
know it's like a joke why they called it
like that but it was quite natural to
call the javafx part of it FX lip
accomplished in their server coalition
air no it's just signing I don't think
there's a competition goes it it's
always signing
Oh still find the truck wash illegal
with us that yeah
yeah that's good ok so did it go so I
thought it's always signing the charge
so that you can even run it by our java
web start for example its way to the
learner so the FX leap application is
modeled by closely after the android app
called a flip so it has a couple of
buttons for different quantities so what
do you want to convert any any
suggestions let's just start with a
length so I don't have any lambda
examples where ever it slam defied under
Java s ii obviously if you have I don't
know I think they're there was something
that's in summer american restaurants
children that are under a particular
height get free meals so you could do
something like this like i said since it
has to be compatible with java me8
embedded which i'm also going to show
briefly there's currently no lambda but
the SE implementation of the API when
run under java SE eight obviously worked
with lambdas since Java ME embedded
eight has not got lambda support for
most decisons there won't be any
London's if you run it in the me8 way
but the API itself is cross-platform so
it should support both just click meters
to feet yeah
so 3 meters would be approximately nine
point eight four feet where is actually
the exact value anything else yeah I
think you mentioned about the airlines
yeah okay so one of the things which
which I have trouble with is you can see
I carry a lot of hardware my um my
suitcase limit is exactly 70 pounds in
the US so I have to make sure I waist up
and get it precisely this right weight
but when I come here to Europe they
measure it in kilograms and I think I
think they give me about 30 kilograms so
which ones bigger 30 kilograms or
airline but I think pretty good about is
a little yeah so I don't spoil down to
the 30 kilograms is a little bit less
than 70 pounds it would be 31.75 so yeah
so next time they start me and they say
too heavy I say no no no no 70 pounds
and actually I believe when I when I
came back from Los Angeles from social
media we can had a few goodies that I
got there I had to repack some of them
so I yeah America they yeah they exactly
270 pounds yeah when they stop you you
tell them no no no 32 kilograms but I
think for most European airlines at
least inside the continent it's it's
usually only about twenty three
kilograms but for example Turkish
Turkish Airlines has particular grams
that's rather exceptional case okay so
this was the chava FX demo for java SE
so although we are some raspberry PI's
lying around here i don't i don't have
one at the moment oh oh well I'm even
lucky later on anyway this was an
example that we ran during the chopper
bond
better challenge and after it was over I
also added some units of measurement
magic to it
so this is running in tomcat but in the
course of the embedded challenge we were
actually running tomcat on a raspberry
pi so here the the heart frequency is
basically mocked back at javaone i think
you well so there is wrapped it around
my own chest and it was really measuring
live data here it's marked but the
important thing which you'll probably
only see in the console is here it
really measures it in a type-safe way
that this is really 87 beats per minute
so there are two units beat and minute
and then with an algorithm of the pit
per minute is also done through division
so it is it is doing a division of two
units and then the result is a combined
unit that is p / meeting in that
particular case technically from the
akhand of you could also just say it is
a unit technically finest feet per
minute but to demonstrate how the api's
work here i actually decided to do it
with two different units that are then
divided as a result and from se now now
we actually have to write hard
frequencies but as I this is just random
value but when it's green it's optimal
and it's right it's too high and when
it's down there somewhere then either
something is wrong or the patient is
dead hopefully something is wrong with
the hardware not the patient and now the
last one which is not that visual but
nevertheless important is the Java ME
embedded example that most of it has
been contributed by Michael package for
the chase RV to come in Brazil
so they ran a little demonstrator of a
Java ME embedded H provides and one of
it is the so-called leaflet
functionality to provide reusable code
inside article applications and the
other one is also a service so this
consists of a second application that
provides a service and here temperature
sensors also mark but as you can see
this is measuring temperature and it's
represented here the little ugly are up
against a that looks a bit like a
Scandinavian character that touch
according to I think there's a lens to
look yeah let's try it so you can you
can't do to to console okay then let's
okay yeah so I think I hope the
characters are somewhat readable I was
not sure if net beam supports the lens
I'm here well that's a guy I will I will
make it bigger oh there we go okay yeah
a little better so yeah the pumping as
you can see here it's degree Celsius the
little character that's between the
number and we sign that I spoke to
Terrence power charland and he figured
it's probably still a back this is the
first preview i will try it with the
second preview and if it so this is not
the back of our implementation of the
API this actually looks like it's a part
of the underlying implementation of Java
me8 embedded or I also discussed it in
the tool expert group or calls and least
Roger who's too speculative cldc eight
said that we have lives in previous
versions normal he he actually admitted
or confirmed that the definition of cl
dc-8 is not forced to have full unicode
support so yeah I only see one colleague
of mine working at a palace but we
between two different windows we also
occasionally come across things where
one wind are only supports us tea or
some different encoding and the other
one supports full utf-8 and then if the
two applications talk to each other than
of course sometimes it comes to way out
results this is somewhat similar here
but according to parents either the
preview to and the final version should
already have it fixed and otherwise also
further back cool
it's it's supposed to be standalone so
there's a there's a nice diagram where
Terence recently presented me8 and
that's talking about third-party cheese
arbs whatever that is the basic chase
after the not led by Oregon that are not
part of the Emmy platform and so this is
one of those there was one for j2me that
we aim to partly replace that was just
called Center API for j2me by Nokia and
that was also always an addition so
especially in Emmy and MVP there are so
called Profiles it's a little bit like
in Java 8 you have three profiles that
are just the smallest version and then
to that are bigger in md 8 you can have
a lot more different profiles and if you
have a particular profile that's for
example targeting a device that has no
UI both the m.e embedded chase r is
fully modular right we do the same here
so well is it sort of you blow up here
now I can make it bigger at all
something's if we make this hard a
little thicker as you can see here those
are the parts of the actual API each of
them is a maven module so the core is
the one that's mandatory and that is
required as a minimum requirement so
that contains a couple of basic types
like dimension measurement quantity and
unit those are the helpful additional
functional interfaces that mainly make
sense in with lambdas the few of them
are also used by these basic types so
even if you cannot use the lambdas they
would still be in the API some of them
we could potentially consider making
them optional too and then all the other
modules are optional
us you may have some temperature sensor
or that as a absolutely no UI so it
doesn't make sense to add formatting and
parsing and you I representation that's
why the format bundle or module again is
optional that contains things like unit
formatting and housing the parser is is
again a a foundation for things for
example you can use it with unified
units of measurement or different
measurement systems so the parser is
then to be used with some of these and
then again for example we have you cumin
implementations out there already at the
project that i need at eclipse called
omo and there for example it also relies
primarily on the base types like unit
and quantity it does not need what's
also an optional module and that
contains all the physical quantities
that exist and each piece is used by 0
generics to ensure that operations are
always type safe so that for example you
cannot simply take a mass and convert it
into a length or vice versa
so with with fights and pillow fights
there's full support for all possible
prefixes like not just steelo but all
others you mean a range or something
like validation so one thing that's in
the optional util package I could also
show some of the console tables although
they are not that interested but if you
help me with my demos you mean by adding
fighting each other of them yeah the one
thing that we added that there's a fort
or provided something that seems quite
inspired by earlier unit API is
including the chase our approach to 75
that most of the members of the current
expect we're also in that expert group
but at the time nobody knew that the
Internet of Things existed because the
term at least was not defined by anybody
at conferences or similar occasions so
at the time for java SE 6 or 7 it was
found to be too specific so that's also
why at the moment we do not propose it
for java SE to be included in a jdk but
for example the m.e targeted
device access API that's currently an
Oracle proprietary API potentially this
could be open source as a chase are in
the future version of Java ME and it's
aimed at Java ME eight at the moment but
it is also potentially applicable to
java SE embedded i think at the moment
it it's not supported area but they plan
to port it also so this chase r is a
good example where it works in both
platforms already as you saw and if a
future version of a particular señor EE
profile that's let's say scientific
feels that this chase Isaac is a good
foundation for it then it may be part of
it but since we are talking about
channel versions that will be more or
less modular any waiver just say chicks
aww that's why at that point we don't
say this has to be a mandatory part of
the JDK but it may be an optional module
that a particular application can
retrieve and use for the emmy part the
new functionality the so-called lip
'let's is where we see most used for
this chase are in any embedded that the
reference or the m.e aspect of the
reference implementation and there may
either be a hybrid reference
implementation that works both on Emmy
and se or if more feasible there will be
two then the the Emmy side of it will be
made available as a so-called lib left
for Java ME so that's different Emmy
midlet or applications can can use it
without having to duplicate the code
every time
yeah like there's still one or two
consult a much but most of them are not
that impressive so I'm not sure if there
was a demonstration of the of the range
for example where I extended it for
hurricane scales I mean I guess that's
probably more interesting to the
us-south if you want to see it or are we
holding time demos alright so Thank You
Werner um so would you mind staying here
and helping me no I mean I already moved
over to the embedded heart so I'm modern
yeah yeah okay so that goes a great
segue to do demos so here's a toy for
you here so does anybody know what what
burger is holding I know what your calls
are marked in Denmark yeah yeah yeah
well first of all who's the mascot here
what does he look like Duke okay good so
you guys you guys know your Java
characters that's very good and Duke is
built using the Lego Mindstorms that's
not a good sound ok Duke need some
surgery as well he's been having a rough
trip but Duke is built using Lego
Mindstorms ev3 and one of the cool
things about the new version of Lego
Mindstorms which just came out here hold
the sky for sick is that inside the
brick here it actually has a full arm
processor running inside of it so I
think it's a satara 300 megahertz ARM
processor this is the reboot procedure
remove the batteries won't this run any
embedded um yeah so I believe you can
run we don't have we don't have any
embedded distribution but it should run
fine on any embedded and what we're
going to show today is se embedded
running on the Raspberry Pi or writing
on the lego mindstorms ev3 and the the
library we're using is called lejos so
let house worked on the NXT and maybe
the RCX
I think I think it worked on the rcx too
but in those two cases they cross
compiled for the rest for the Lego
Mindstorms on ev3 there's actually a
oracle JVM which runs on lego mindstorms
they have the links to download and get
everything set up and then you can be
running directly on our buddy here Duke
with java SE all right that's a better
camera shot okay and another side effect
of it writing on this guy is that it's
very slow so we're going to hook him
back up and then let him sit on the
counter while we do 10 mo number two
because i'm very impatient i'm not going
to wait for Duke to boot so he's wheels
look like a sec way yeah he has two
wheels coincidentally just like a Segway
one two three four okay Duke go ahead
and boot the second thing we're going to
show is Java running on the Raspberry Pi
so raspberry pi is a really low cost
embedded processor one of you is going
to walk away with one of these and it's
a nice way of showing the capabilities
of Java ME and java SE both around the
Raspberry Pi it's currently our
reference implementation as well so all
the new versions support Raspberry Pi
and on the sky we have a little cheesy
popular what's the on this one where
it's the same recording it's all good
wee little LED switch and all this stuff
and let's see so first we need to give
us some power the Raspberry Pi for power
requirements simply needs an about an
amp of power so a good way to power the
raspberry PI's to use a cell phone
charger or a cell phone battery as long
as this applies an amp of power you're
you're good for portable power for the
Raspberry Pi except it's booting now
let's see how far I can hold it up okay
so there's little lights and stuff
happening on the Raspberry Pi i'm going
to plug the LEDs in which should not be
lit up right now so hopefully they will
turn off soon and we're going to try to
hook up to him over this cable via ssh
so what I'm doing is I'm turning on
internet connection sharing on my
computer and then we're going to give an
IP address to the Raspberry Pi from this
computer sitting here what do you say
wait you going to do yeah so I have an
ethernet cable and then I'm sharing the
network via internet connection sharing
on my Mac so this guy will get both
network and also an IP address from my
computer and then I'm going to ssh to
them from the local computer here let's
see here now you guys can see exactly
what I'm doing terminal
let me get rid of that there we go um
okay let's see if we got an IP address
for him the other way to check is in the
in the finder he should also show up as
a device here because I've turned down
bonjour on the Raspberry Pi so he'll
also show up as a device here we go LCD
test board so we should be able to do
SSH route LCD test board
raspberry PI's are very very fast
computers you can tell by how long it
takes to open up an ssh connection
actually they're much better for
graphics we're going to do a graphical
example in a sec they're much better for
graphics than they are for stuff on the
console oh wow he just doesn't want to
talk to us one unhappy little bugger
beep beep beep
okay unhappy demo number two we're going
through these demos really quick ok back
to Duke her up Duke so yeah we have Duke
and he he happens to be on the same
network wow I can't even get out of this
ok 10 dot 0 dot one dot 4 is his IP
address he's responding thankfully and
we need a second volunteer from the
audience as well hand this to somebody
thanks for letting me know yeah you're
just going to we're cutting your power
ok so on here I already copied over a
jar file you can copy you can develop
right on desktop and there's a J run
script which adds in the EV the ev3
classes into the classpath and we're
going to run ev3 way which is a segue
algorithm for the Raspberry Pi so the
way this works is back to camera okay so
put them on the ground murder
lay him on his back yeah and you see his
little he has little button in his hand
press the button in his his right hand
Duke has two hands one of them with a
button press the right button in his
right hand my thumb now lift him up
quickly on his wheels lekha alright so
that's the basic procedure lie them down
press the button lift them up and try to
get them balanced a little bit none i
get slimed down first that calibrates
the gyroscope so used to be perfectly
still now lift them up all right now
what murder wanted to do is he wanted to
show you the internals of how thick is
constructed so you can see there's a lot
of small motors for wiggling the arms
and it's a little hard to see but inside
of is a gyroscope no arquillian inside
no and one of the trick is things about
doing the model like this is um this is
I think this is like version five or six
of Duke and the first few versions
wouldn't balance using the algorithm
because his body wasn't rigid enough so
to get Duke to balance successfully on
two wheels you have to create a fairly
rigid and stiff frame so the wheels are
quite tight and then I did a lot of
infrastructure to make sure that they
don't move it all one side
Thanks all right so you ready again all
right so the way this operates is kind
of an inverse pendulum whenever he
starts leaning it gets the angular
velocity using a gyroscope and also his
current angle and it tries to compensate
by moving back or forward as not perfect
so that's why he stutters and like weird
stuff happens but for the most part he's
he's balanced depending upon the floor
surface so you have the remote in your
hands come over here gotta get a little
closer to Duke because um you know the
bet the battery is not that strong in
that so the way this works is the top
two buttons move left and right and each
time you click it at increments a
counter so pointed at his buttocks where
the IR remote is and try clicking one of
them get behind him yeah behind him and
try clicking the left and right arrows
maybe get a little closer yeah nope no
no okay so sometimes the the IR remote
has issues and there's a very how do you
guys fix stuff it works intermittently
at work like you view a test that
doesn't pass you just run again right
okay so yeah pick up the corner Rep dude
okay and I kicked off the program a
second time and we'll try it again
alright so find out near the drill yeah
it's like set them down a little baby
that needs to have to pappas change
click it again maybe the program wasn't
started yeah all right and now try
getting left and right buttons on the
top oh there we go all right now press
the big button to stop him the top of
the top yeah and then the bottom ones go
forward and back it's the same thing
don't hold them just click them yeah and
the big button to stop him yeah
all right you must have driven RC cards
as a kid you drive radio control cars ya
hear you're doing quite good it's not
easy to control him so all the kids
doing down at the books for kids tool
yeah but they only crash Duke they don't
actually right okay all right give our
volunteer big round of applause pick up
dick again runner go chase him yeah
question ok yeah it's good question so
on you know on a big processor like this
there aren't a lot of you know it's
powerful enough to do real garbage
collection so it's not like a small
embedded chip but you still hit
situations where you have pauses in your
program and the the solution is if you
really need to do something where you
don't have garbage collection you're
doing something real time you should do
it at a lower level than from your Java
code so like don't use Java code like
run the motors in your arm in your
quadcopter
well I mean the garbage collector is
fast enough that it doesn't usually yeah
yeah and I don't have a large heap on
this it doesn't have a lot of memory so
for most applications it's quite fun to
have a few GC small GC pauses going on
but if you're really doing something
real time like you know doing motors on
a quadcopter you probably you probably
don't want to do that from your embedded
Java code you probably want to do that
on a on a native API and you can access
native API is just like you do for them
for desktop using Jay and I okay let's
see if demo number two is happier hang
angular velocities also along the types
that are supported by shares off 363 so
if the Lego API provides that in a way
that's readable then yeah you should
usually with that you should update the
segue code it's open source give it a
try yeah most most of our stuff is
already on keep up as well I have no
slides but if you look at units of
measurement in a unit of measurement of
work that still contains the the old API
but a pointer to the nutrients our page
or if you look on both github and Chava
botnet health projects or communities
that are each code units of measurement
and you will also find especially on get
up you'll find every single day mode
that I have presented here today you can
run it yourself if you want
okay and what about the raspberry pi no
name nor server name provided or not
known that's a wonderful error message
here you can you can watch me hacking so
where I rebooted him and we're trying
him one more time if that fails we have
another Raspberry Pi tempah so this is
the Duke pad oh wait wait wait it worked
we have we have a login now okay we'll
get to the Duke pad will still show that
yes we're logged in and we're gonna
we're going to see how strong verner is
your you feeling particularly strong
today all right travel and I I had to
chase behind it for you all tools trying
to explore all of the venues oh yeah
yeah definitely heavy yeah yeah all
right so we have jdk 8 running on here
and we're going to run a jar file from
the city let's do the force sensor first
we'll see how strong you are and these
all run using java SE embedded that
should be quite interesting for sure
software can swallow all right now now
grab grab that fingers on ya fingers ah
1,300 1,400 pretty good may I ask what
do you need of this that's the raw data
from the sensor unit all right you're
doing you're doing okay last night our
attendee got above 1500 which was that's
the highest I've ever seen it go
wearable stuff that was in darmstadt
okay so that's an example of the force
sensor and we're also going to show the
LCD pie plate it's not a particular unit
of pressure it is it is literature stir
so if we wanted to use something like
that with the unity I would have to
calibrate it and actually ensure that a
particular value is mapped to a to
appropriate SI unit yeah yeah okay so
I'll try to get the camera close enough
that you guys can see what's going on
and someone else from the audience want
to take a try at this yeah come on up so
just come over here and give it a try
the force sensor is this guy right here
black one none of this also like are you
all right and we can't exactly see the
values on screen so read them out for us
what are you getting 1567 Wow oh that's
pretty good guy awesome yeah and then
try to cover the light sensor here and
see how low you can get the second one
too it's like 80 76 yeah yeah not bad
okay give a round of applause
okay and the last demo we're going to
show is the Duke pad and I know this
works because it's already up and
running so the Duke pad is a tablet
created with a raspberry pi as the basis
for it and it is a pi camera and some
other hardware inside of it the the case
was actually designed by Jasper pots and
we just we laser-cut them at the local
tepesch op so all the designs are online
if you go to the Duke pad website and
then you can actually build this whole
thing yourself just using an
off-the-shelf touch screen and raspberry
pi and battery and there's even an
open-source user interface for raspberry
pi why is the date just something like
must have been a chava one so it's not
the current date yeah okay so raspberry
PI's do not have battery they don't
remember their dates because they don't
have batteries so they connect to the
network to get the current time and we
hard-coded it to be correct once
okay so universal number everyone knows
that we can do calculations we can do 3d
maybe 3d okay so here's a 3d cube using
javafx 3d i mentioned that as one of the
new features in java 8 we can also do
interactive stuff like games so this is
the the fossil game are you doing it at
this game burner here see if you can see
if you can beat the first level so just
um you know click on stuff and it will
blow up on the same oh it's always like
mind my sweet I think it has to be like
three or more together of the same type
or bum bums are good click on the bumps
yeah yeah there's another one go for the
bum bum bum very nice Wow combos level
complete good job alright and the last
thing which raspberry PI's are really
good at you wouldn't think about this
given how bad they are on processing
stuff but they have really good GPUs in
them so I'm they make great home
entertainment centers and this is full
you know 1080p video playing off the
raspberry PI's little GPU that's
integrate on the chip so you don't movie
this is earner yeah I've seen it you've
seen it yeah yeah is any good I think
the virtual ones what better but it was
ok ok Larry's son would be very pleased
I didn't see any Oracle ads in the
proton but maybe I miss them you
probably miss stuff I'm sure we had an
Oracle add in there hidden somewhere
alright so that is a quick overview of
what you can do with Java embedded so
just some wrap up items the Java mag
issue for marcin april's out includes
lambdas and Nash horn date and time
api's Caroline the editor for java mag
is interested in getting some folks to
to write for the magazine so if you're
interested in doing magazine articles
you don't need to be a professional
writer just let me know come up to me
after the meeting and I'll introduce you
to Caroline you're going to write an
article Dominic alright nice security
article well I think beetle combos also
including the current wall so also
there's a developer challenge going on
and to decide who so you can win one of
nine free passes to Java one by
participating in the developer challenge
all you need to do is come up with an
Internet of Things or embedded java
application show it running on the
Raspberry Pi I think there's a video
involved to show exactly what you built
and then you could win a free trip to
Java 1 plus expenses and the deadline
for the contest is May thirtieth for
entering the contest so to figure out oh
and this this is a gift from you lon who
runs the contest so she gave me some
raspberry PI's to give out so to figure
out who gets the Raspberry Pi murder is
going to ask you guys a very tough
question about either lambdas or units
or whatever he wants and the first
person to to guess correctly or Gil
Turner into agreeing wins okay and then
while he's thinking about that the last
thing I mentioned is Javal in San
Francisco so I'm the conference chair
for java one so if you're interested in
presenting the call for papers is open
and we just open registration wednesday
i believe for the conference and there's
a special promotion running for six
hundred dollars off which is a special
deal just for the Java 8 launch it's
lower than what we usually discount the
ticket to and i believe it's valid for
the next few weeks so if you're
interested to come out for java 1 i'd
highly recommends to to book early hotel
prices do not get cheaper as it gets
closer and it's a great conference to to
attend and find out more about this
stuff ok so again information about me
and our question burner if you have to
look up the answer then it's probably
too hard for attendees so yeah you know
that the answer to universe life and
everything ok now I don't have that many
pies to give tearing which is their
topic how many degrees Celsius are 42
for annoyed well let's just say whoever
gets closest
pusan sticks okay winner it's all there
let's go such a sixth and pacquiao all
right think so thank you everyone and if
you want to look at the demos feel free
to come up otherwise have a good evening
