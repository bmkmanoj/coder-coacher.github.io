clicks record good luck yeah once you
close that window we now actually need
that open and I'm starting their court
okay now recording cool all right let me
just post a quick message to folks to
tell them we're back all right so so
back alive or take two with bed and we
have no more ads in with better quality
video for code and beer well I have beer
you're picking wine
alright we go we are little
alright so welcome to night hacking with
ben evans this is take two with the
author of the wall grounded java
developer and we're going to try hacking
on a library called jf x mm which is a
memory visualizer for drama effects
while memory visualizer for java
applications written in java ethics so
correct ok um it should actually be
loaded in that she worked in your
machine now Steve yeah that would be
dope be really nice you see in written
for those of us in our international
audience we have a show called Blue
Peter its famous because it occasionally
does the same way they they they make
things in the studio anything which is
too old or too complicated feathers cash
trade which is and here's what I made of
it it's okay I've seen those I see on
those cooking shows yeah all time
exactly so and his alma mater Lee okay
yeah all those jada and their peers and
other issues are all gone now we were
memory what yeah what am I looking at
here around okay so it's a basically if
you give you see if you will this thing
is basically is good it's going to demo
how a Java professional uses memory and
as we'll see there's something's bad
which is slightly unrealistic but you
see the blocks are basically like chunks
of Java memory I have a time UT
agent says this is some even yet these
are the slightest places this is bring
old chum oh look at all those objects
Scott probably should information to eat
yeah that's that's bad we got to fix
that because those guys don't really
want to be over there they're getting
killed off I'll see now it's filled up
excuse me what else is good we're
getting a whole bunch anything yeah you
see people here see this yeah I wall I
scopes are guys you got see this in
verse now okay so yeah so now down have
the same and it's actually gonna gonna
do a full collection oh oh and now about
memory oh oh oh you can see the section
down here is close let's go gaming okay
so David actually rail remember it's a
shamanic memory so there's there's
several things we want to fix it okay so
so basically this evening start hacking
session was really special about really
finish this and really making sure we do
things like we do without a phone
reception properly and basically the
things should probably just quite free
terminate when it actually runs out a
memory so the application is showing its
own here but you see it it's not it's
not actually quietly the actual
application he was from there to tell
the Washington it was nice background
from music
yeah I'm just telling what switching off
because it's making a lot of noise I
mean it's awesome people on the streamer
ok now we're back just just us it's just
us listen um so yeah so there's lot of
things I wants to do with it I wanted to
I want to basically have a deal with
after only exceptions that more
basically okay i also want to to refine
some aspects of the model so if you can
bring up your new oiee okay and the sort
of history is probably of this project
is sort of this strange because when i
first came up with the idea it was but
it was but I was going to produce
several different visualizations in time
for job one talk and I was going to talk
about three or four different things
yeah and instead of which the memory
management one kind of grew out of
control so in fact getting to one of
actually written by the time job one
came around without so every management
memory management that was really good
but it's really good okay and underneath
the underneath what you actually find
this you find that actually it's
essentially a reasonable imitation quite
a lot of the memory management model so
cool what you'll find is the key files
here is is a thing called allocating
thread so if you can plan our cake and
vote ok all right ok so basically this
this thing has has two parameters to the
choices as in the construction it takes
the memory interpreter and a memory
model the murine model is basically
where it's going to pump all those
changes to and the memory interpreter is
actually the thing which is which is
driving its allocation behavior so
memory temperature is just a very simple
interface which basically provides new
actions to take so if we open your
interpreter into this
memory interpreter random memory yeah
you see this but I got I got a bunch of
conditions of this high memory free are
you an are you and I fam you see I
actually like me I like my life and I I
like I formal iphones ipads I well black
book there's no I there's no I in that
book no no there's no lion and much fun
either which is really how so so again
the lamb conventional I for an interface
I I do athletes the point of it big
because you can't open the file and see
the word interface thing um well I think
this late in terms of code is big red
much more often minutes written and now
having things which are visual clues
okay so here's my here's my why is your
microphone over there um because I'm
Maloney I probably to go hard for people
to hearing on your microphone isn't even
nearby okay it is that better people I'm
a people in the formal on the phone yeah
that'll hear all your buddy here so
basically um okay so here's my here's my
auntie argument for why the electric you
mentioned well no not just in general
why you don't create conventions to tell
you something about code and the reason
for that is because it lies because you
when you start rely upon it it's not
guaranteed budget by the by the second
one sure but you know I i would say this
as part of the natural language
evolution so what happens is one
language has a certain way of doing
things a certain coding style which
would it basically is encoding is a
pattern and then the next generation of
languages come out and they have
language level support for that yeah so
you know actually like to see what for
all the netbeans guys on a string
I want I want a different icon /
interfaces and class files and netbeans
okay and then I can tell when you've
missed and I some were and I could pick
on a fourth okay i will move them out
only one I want to be able to you know
when it's two o'clock in the morning i'm
incredibly hungover and I'm under Mason
spread one on the shift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
