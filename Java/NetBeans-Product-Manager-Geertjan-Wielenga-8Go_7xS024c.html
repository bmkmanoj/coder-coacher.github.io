technology Network we're here at javaone
Brazil talking to members of the java
community I have a couch in willing go
with me hi here too hi Tori how you
doing pretty good so tell me your role
in the java community well I'm product
manager in the NetBeans team which means
I go to conferences like this and your
presentations and meet people and I look
at computing products internally and
compare them and analyze the future
future requests for nettings ok so tell
me what you've been hearing about
NetBeans at javaone Brazil well walking
around javaone Latin America I've seen a
lot of buzz about JavaFX at the at the
Java one key notes at the sessions at
the booths the big news is really job FX
and whenever job FX has talked about
it's always NetBeans because this is the
way we deliver javafx solutions so it's
been really cool from a NetBeans point
of view excellent so tell me what
released as NetBeans on and what's
coming in a future release well NetBeans
is at the 7.1 release where the main
feature is javafx so that's the main
thing that we're reading with and we've
got templates and wizards and a whole
library of samples to get you started
and tutorials and a real beginners kits
and also more advanced stuff for anyone
interested in javafx so that's our main
feature but in addition we have many new
enhancements in the Java editor itself
so for example a battery factoring tool
to convert all your projects to Java 7
or to whatever you like because you can
extend it with a declarative language
based on jackpot in addition many other
editor announcements enhancements in the
maven area which is very popular
NetBeans is definitely the leading IDE
when you want to use maven also great
glassfish support weblogic server of
these on Java EE 6 but it supports it
out of the box with netbeans PHP you
name it we've got to get out of the box
for the first time so no downloads no
installation it's just part of the the
default distribution of NetBeans so it's
looking really good excellent and tell
me a little bit i've heard some buzz
about the NetBeans platform tell me a
little bit about that right so the net
platform is a framework underneath
NetBeans IDE but you can take that
framework out of NetBeans IDE and use it
as the basis of any other desktop but in
particular desktop software so there are
hundreds that we now have but probably
thousands of applications out there
especially in large enterprises in
military and defense and oil bank type
applications on the netnews platform but
the interesting thing is that there is
no mandatory gooey parts of an abuse
platform which means you could create
any kind of gooey on top of it so there
are experiments being done with JavaFX
on top of NetBeans platform for example
which gives you a docking framework and
a module system out of the box or a scar
on top of Neptune's platform or really
anything you like so it's really it's a
it's a framework for correcting any kind
of typically desktop and application
that you can think of especially when
you're interested in modularity because
there's a plug-in system built into it
it's really interesting and there's lots
of stuff happening around that excellent
so you had an interesting blog that I
have to ask you about that you wrote I
think just during devix where you were
saying the big buzz at the show is
everybody's developing for mobile and
nobody develops for desktop anymore and
so what what did your blog say in effect
well in effect I mean what happens at
conferences like like Java one like dev
works like any conference is that
obviously when selections are made of
topics for the conference the the
interesting topics are chosen and
interesting topics are normally new
topics as people don't want to hear
about things they already know so
typically what ends up being accepted
into a conference are topics dealing
with mobile and web because there's a
lot of buzz around that with html5 and
Android and so on but the desktop
there's a lot of stuff going on as well
that is kind of hidden like as I said
before in the enterprise behind the
firewall and in corporate environments
where they can't even even if they
wanted to wouldn't be allowed to talk
about all the stuff that they're doing
so just it was my blog and she was just
pointing out the fact that there's a lot
more going on even though you might not
see that at conferences and kind of
stating and concern that future
direction of products might be based on
on false premises because of that one
buzz rather than what
what's really going right right right
okay so it sounds like NetBeans IDE if
you want to learn Java effects if you
want to develop if you want to develop
for the desktop or mobile it's a great
tool to use right it's all there so
they're just downloaded it's free it's
extensible where do you get it netbeans
a dork there's a very big download
button right at the top just click it
and take another button and you've got
it okay excellent thank you here chin
it's been great to talk to you and have
a great show Kermit this is Tori wheel
