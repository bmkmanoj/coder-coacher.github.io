technology Network we're here on the
floor of an embedded world and i'm here
with krista boy yay is that correct guys
nice to meet you nice to meet you what
are we looking at here we are working on
smart energy Network and we provide a
demonstration on smart energy a twix
meter on data concentrator connected to
data some terms this demo is more
representative for ethnicity providers
and we ZB meter connected to that I
concentrate all that get all the data
during the day and computes all these
smart data on storage on Java embodied
ok if I have no idea what zigbee is tell
me what that is CB is a wireless
protocol ok it's a standard just found
out yes and the meter is connected to
the DC the DC stores that are some to
the data center and that means that the
HTC provider can bill for each customer
ok and there's some intelligence that
goes on on the collector right here yes
we have a Java Sea embedded in store on
the DC and he's doing a lot of
intelligence computing the dynamic lives
with the instantaneous consumption of
the meters and from the ohm and also we
have a client showing what's the data
store in the DC we have electric
consumption computed directly by
JavaScript engine install on so DC and
here we have the performance of the
application on the DC also we can
administrate the data constant water and
the the browser is the admin tool from
the DC and an opera e from the activity
provider can set up and configure OC DC
installing in building and we have a set
of very smart components that doing some
stuff as a JavaScript engine we have a
restful clients where we connect it to a
very back end and also we have some
aggregate or system to manipulate on the
data as a specific JSON format
and we can start any components update
the components excellent so we're here
on the floor of embedded world seeing
all the cool things that Java can do if
you want to learn more joining us at the
Oracle technology Network thank you
thank you thank you sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
