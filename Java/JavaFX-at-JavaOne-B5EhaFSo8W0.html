technology Network we're here on the
floor of Java 1 talking to members of
the Java community I've got Kevin rush
fourth with me hey Kevin hi how are you
doing pretty good I'm doing well so tell
me about you've got some really cool
demos with Java effects here yeah we do
Java FX is our current client technology
that we're making available it's part of
FX for Java on JDK 7 and what we're
showing here is what's coming new in JDK
8 with Java FX what excellent
so let's come take a look at the screen
here and show us what you have ok so
this is one of our demos it's called
ensembl it's basically just a showcase
app that allows us to take little simple
samples showing the different things
that you can do in Java FX so that the
top one the featured one there is just a
example of our charting API so we have
many different types of charts available
in Java FX this one is just a candle
chart so for each one of our demos it
shows you a little example of what it
can do we have
a set of related samples and tutorials
that you can look at we have the
documentation for each of the classes
that are used here so you can look at
the Javadoc for the class right in line
and then for each of the demos you can
see the source code and you can download
it and export it into a NetBeans project
so it's just a really good way for users
of JavaFX to get started in a way that
will allow them to take these and then
create their own applications so another
example of a charting API is our pie
chart and it's this available now or do
people have to wait for eight
well it's available both now and it's
only for 8 you can download early access
versions of Java we just made a
Developer Preview available but weekly
builds are there on Java net and this is
available for download right now from
java.net Wow so the future is Java it's
all about 8:00 you can get 8 now and
we're gonna hop over and take a look at
another demo here so let's jump so tell
me what we're looking at here so here we
have a chess-playing program this was
something that we showed at the keynote
it's a program that allows you to
visualize the chess game in progress our
development team wrote a chess server
where you can play a games between two
people and then they wrote a client
where you can just observe a game in
progress and it's drawn and rendered
using our new 3d API so they modeled
these pieces in 3d and we have in fx4
jdk 8 new 3d graphics API s that allow
you to display this so this is just
something you could also download and
run today wow it's really cool and then
we have it happening in the real world
right so tell me about this exactly so
again all hooked up to the same chess
server they what they did is they took
these same models that you saw rendered
here and they exported them to a 3d
printing service and they had pieces
made from the exact same models so these
are the same chess pieces only printed
in 3d and and cast in plastic
and then we have a Raspberry Pi running
the JavaFX are you sorry Java for arm
controlling this robot servo wow so Java
really is in the end right so this is
very cool and if I wanted to learn more
about this demo is it over after the
show or will I be able to see more of it
somewhere else not quite sure we'd have
to ask the people who are in charge of
the robot they guard it very carefully
ok so wow so it's a good thing we've
captured the video of it I want to thank
you Kevin this has been really
interesting and I hope you have a great
job of one thank you thank you very much
all right bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
