technology Network we're here at javaone
India talking to members of the java
community I have group reach such diva
tell me about your role in the java
community thanks Jodi roasting me so
I've been part of you know the Java you
know community and i've been using java
technologies since you know around
packing 15 years and right from the days
of java one or two onwards painful days
right yes yes have you certainly moved
ahead you know from those days right so
I'm part of you know the Edison group
which is based out of Gurgaon and it's
predominantly a telecommunication
company and we make applications for we
also make applications where I tricked
my role fits into for various kind of
customers and applications have been you
know used javis applications have been
used in various segments like you know
network management smart energy media
health care so and so forth I have also
you know in using enterprise edition and
which we used to call you j2ee earlier
right and I've used I think almost all
the major implementations like jboss
tomcat weblogic oracle application
server so I've been you know quite
involved with this technology area since
a long time okay so I know you did a
session on garbage collection right so
tell me a little bit early so I had a
session yesterday for Jeevan garbage
collector so it's a new collection
framework from Oracle folks which work
on the JDK part essentially we even have
today you know we have three options for
garbage collection they have certain
limitations especially when it comes to
very high heap sizes to the range of six
gigs or so and you still expect low
latencies then you know CMS you know
kind of doesn't suffice in that case
so that is why you know this new garbage
collector has come in which promises
that you know Layton sees a pauses would
remain you know equal to a lesser than
200 milliseconds even with very high you
know each sizes eventually it is
proposed that g one is going to replace
CMS completely but so now it is
complementing cns in you know in these
areas and I have advised people and I
take this advice myself also that we
should not just immediately jump to you
started in june oh come on it's a new
technology you just gotta jump on it
whether it fits your needs or not right
not failure reasoning because if you're
already working with CMS and the heap is
not very high or you know the pauses are
okay I mean the kind of bothers you want
our kind of fine it's okay you can
continue your CMS if you if your data
requirements increase or if you want
lesser pastimes then yes if you start
moving to your jeevan and i guess as you
mentioned eventually i think the
proposal is that this is going to be
only one garbage collector framework so
everyone would have to use you and i'm
not sure whether that happens in java 8
or 9 but probably that's what's new
today right right very interesting so
tell me a little bit about the java
developer community in india and i know
you're involved with the jug yes that's
right so we all know that India's the
software powerhouse and the thousands or
maybe lack of people working in Java and
although I would I must say to be honest
that I would have expected you know much
larger participation on these kind of
conferences or blogs and community
forums I think these people are catching
up we still do a lot of catch-up but I
do see a very vibrant atmosphere for
java I have you know visited many
campuses college campuses as part of
recruitment drives and you know college
festivals etc and I see a hunger and the
student community
java to make projects in Java and you
know to take jobs involving java and of
course the youngsters who are coming up
in industrial so they're very keen in
Java and I guess we need to kind of
promote more you know the user groups so
I have been associated with this delhi
area user book it's not big it's just
started out and we are trying to
encourage people to you know participate
more and more and so that we have more
people we have more vibrant discussions
right and I know a lot about jugs and
I've seen them over the years and I just
want to reassure people if you're
interested you don't have to be an
expert as a matter of fact nobody in the
room is really that much of an expert
and that's the cool thing is you can
learn a technology together swap tips
get information right yep yep so
gurpreet I'm so glad you dropped by and
I look forward to seeing you again
should I hope you had a good job of wood
thank you alright well thank you very
much sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
