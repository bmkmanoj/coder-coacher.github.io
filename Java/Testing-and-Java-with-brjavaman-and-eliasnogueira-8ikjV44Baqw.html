at CDC in sao paulo brazil and i'm here
with an amazing guy aaliyah's Nogueira
he is the coordinator of the test track
here at CDC and it's such an amazing
track that this year we are repeating it
twice right there's going to be chewed
track test tracks rides the same the
same content different content the same
content the same coin cell phone the
same content twice because it's so full
of people wanting to come to the test
track that idiot is putting together so
you know put your hands together with
Philly is Nogueira takes a lot of leah's
thank you x-men to have you here man so
aaliyah's uh you know talking about
casting and you know I think you are
your guy that you kind of developers
have to talk about tasks right on time
in a lot of times you know you have
developed a sale or don't want to do
testing or test is not for me tested for
that test team it's not for developers
why can't it take in y'all is about it's
totally wrong come together with me yes
so sorry wrong right because no yes no
no Paul developers needs to do test
writing the systems we advocate all the
time in the test track about dancers
make the test stuffs automate and do
some mono tests but it's really really
important developers test as well right
because it's the base of the we call it
out omission pyramids if I don't do a
units tests in my my project probably
after you with a user song test
automation testing you use interface I'm
gonna get a lot of favors right so so
how does this work so you have the
developers and then you also have the
test team get it all together how does
that work in the industry way we call it
an agile projects we have the auditing
together and sometimes or all the times
dancers a semi Java deluded create some
bearing
strategies to make the automation
testing just unity and components tests
better I some testers doesn't know how
to create some test the unit in level or
component level but they can give some
ideas I'll give some new tests dry
developer implements okay alright so the
tester is the guy that you know he
understands the serum he descends the
problem and he understands how to do the
test but sometimes you know but they
develop the one that I actually go there
first needs to write code item they code
and write some tests right that's going
agile projects also helping people
understand under standing about test
alright and try to create this new
scenario for tests and for developments
all sometimes all test case are used I
use it to make the projects to make the
functionality or the required or
something like that right so now we you
know we have the cloud track we have the
DevOps track don't track they talk a lot
about automation yeah you know is
automation also the future of testing or
still a lot of manual testing as we
don't know now with Ajay methodologies
we need to do some automated dancing
right to get in track with the the other
distraint seeing all the releases if you
do some 10 taxes you probably will be
the boot lignin right oh yeah the zest
estes manual we get stuck on their own
they're on the pipeline anytime yeah
okay interesting now do we have today
the tools to actually do the whole
automation of everything yes yes we have
all the tools in the last over 100 I
presented tools to automated testing
rest api for web and for mobile projects
oh cool nice and some of these tools is
the same tools is the same base so you
don't need to
to understand or try to search for
another tools it's all the time in the
same tools create some tests like a
webby and mobile we have to call it
selenium webdriver it's really popular
in this right in for testers and we have
another two colored a peon in AP has the
same base of selenium okay with the same
codes right for different technologies
so it's really easy to create automated
tensions for okay that's Rico so so if
you had to list a set of test tools for
developers to learn what what it should
what did you do I mean what are the two
de should learn to learn you stash is Ju
initiate a Shinji as well is common
right register it is an API to automate
recipe ice is really easy and give it
brings the BDD styles to create some
code is really really easy to question
any any tests with recipe I
selenium-webdriver is almost nine ninety
percent testers using this tool I
developers as well and a pew is a really
good tool because you selenium behind
the scene is right and how it can create
some automated tests for mobile native
Native mo bio and image apps oh hello
nice okay and how about do you have it
like you know what are you choose the
testers use do the test which is the
same to you same two or did you have
some other likes you manage testing
things unless the same toes essentially
saying is also like everyone works the
same thing what to drive here lots
tussling just a sleek fit there
somewhere no test links fits nodding at
your project anymore okay because so
many projects needs to create some
documentation or some tests in different
language or different style like we in
Bidadi we use gerke to express some
testing systems as tense bacterias a
test link doesn't
support OIC writing does nigga things
like the old star the old style manual
yeah yeah okay interesting all right
okay so um and and and one of the things
that you do a lot of here on auntie DC
is that you try to merge you know the
test the test testing community with the
developers community writers in current
so how hard it is to actually get tested
and develops work together it's really
hard it's very hard we try to make some
like a que se and bring first two
testers saying that developers is really
our friends right and try to make
developer and see the test as a good
thing right in the developer process
first we out time do the odd jobs with
the testers first two after go to
developers and try to make de
understands the importance of tests
using how is important for day job and
what is what do you think this is why do
developers have this mentality the test
is not good do you have any idea why
because in the past is at a juice thing
then I tasks because three four six
years ago we don't it doesn't don't have
some tools totem a test and test at that
time is really really men oh so they
sometimes I think they they think is a
really boring to test because it's all
the time it's manual yeah so now with
this new wave of automated hose it's
bring that some I don't know how Tate
was it's really easy to create some
tasks it's really fast to create some
tasks mainly for developers because it
helps all the time is our development
stuff yeah yeah yeah okay that's pretty
cool so what a KHL is about testing and
development is everything I get you know
i'm not sure what what other question I
can ask you because there's what you
have a lot of 10 I think it's the new
wave now for
testing in for automated test is about
the infrastructure testing right oh yes
infrastructure says yes it's a really
important in and not all developers and
testers that give some advice or what
this is the whole scenario line so you
know you're talking about infrastructure
testing right so I think there's a new
wave of tools on automation of
infrastructure also know things like
darker and containers containers you
know it's like ansible to automate the
creation so so can you can you do touch
with all those stuff yep yes now it's
growing some tools to create some codes
to test that infrastructure defensible
with darker chef and puppet if some toes
that's pretty nice alright so we are
actually in a strong wave now when you
start talking about DevOps DevOps you
kind of create a whole pipeline right
and testing is part of this pipeline so
my plan is so every time we talk about
DevOps we really should talk about devs
test Auggie ups yeah right it should be
like I the whole team has to work to get
right yes it's not just a development
and the operation we need to test all
the time in this whole process right
because sometimes make you a lot of
mistakes in infrastructure in the codes
right it just assured that is okay
really okay it's with testing in all the
parts okay that's really cool so that's
aaliyah's Nogueira directly here from
the TDC in some pollo thanks a lot of
leah's for you hear of us and it was
excellent you have you here so keep
watching because we still gonna
broadcast more excellent content hear
directly from TDC thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
