at the stage for another community
interview and right now today I have
Jenny Jepsen here with me hi Danny hi
thanks for having me Heather all right
thanks for coming back to talk to us so
one of the things that I do in my free
time is I help teach girls how to code
and one of the most interesting feedback
that I received from doing this
sometimes with girls only audience
sometimes mixed audience was that the
girls really appreciated seeing women
who could serve as role models so that
was something that they were lacking in
so today I wanted to talk to you a
little bit about what you do at your job
and you know how you got into that and
um yeah great thank you so much okay so
we'll just jump right into it and maybe
you can tell us Jenny a little bit about
what you do at your job yeah so I'm a
mantle coach and sometimes I think the
the term coach is overused but what I
basically do is help leaders and team
members people in organizations create
places where they want to be where
they're getting results where they're
focused on value and using agile
methodologies as a way to get there so
that that's basically what I'm doing
every day all right so you are a coach
and you're working with what types of
companies yeah a lot of financial
institutions actually but also
manufacturing companies as well and
service industry so it's not just IT
focus necessarily but most of it is with
IT teams so it might be companies who
are manufacturing or financial base but
working maybe with like their
specialized their internal in-house IT
department yes I do a lot of that yeah
all right so um how did you get
interested in being an agile yeah it's
crazy it was a crazy journey because my
background is in
communication and change leadership and
I was at a yeah I was Anna board of
directors for a group of women's group
women in the Outdoor Industry and one of
the board members said to me as we were
leaving the the convention center after
the meeting she said Jenny are you ready
for a new challenge I was like oh that
sounds interesting yeah call me on
Tuesday start called and she said that
I'm running an agile think tank in
London the following month and she
thought that it might be interesting for
me with my background to come and I did
and I learned a lot about agile i went
to the agile business conference in
london hung around a lot of really smart
people working in the agile community
mostly in IT and just got inspired and I
thought okay well what can i bring to
this community and can i work in this
new world with the background that I had
and and I could but it's been a it's
been a great journey so I mean I highly
highly encourage women whether they're
in the the tech world or not in the tech
world this is a place where where you
can come in and succeed no matter what
your background cool maybe share like a
little bit like you shared what you do
in the in your job but like a typical
day like what are some of the things
that you might be doing as an agile
coach okay on site with a client yeah so
in a typical day i might be working
closely with the leaders in the
organization to see okay what can they
do to create real choices for people and
not force different processes down team
members throats basically okay no um or
I might also be working with a team
helping them prioritize and plan and
figure out okay how can we tweak our
processes to make it even better to make
it valuable for the team and not just
something that the organization says hey
you have to do this because that doesn't
work so it's really about helping people
feel like they have a place to feel
valued cool yeah so what's your favorite
part about your job
yeah my favorite part is when I run into
people who might be working with one of
the leaders or one of the team members
or scrum master who say something about
the new sort of behavior in the person
or they talk about something new and
better in there in work environment and
I think yes yes yes you know I am some
little tiny way help make that happen
mm-hmm and I think that that for me
feels really great so it keeps me going
even when things are frustrated yeah
that gives you a feeling of success yeah
definitely cool so maybe tear a little
bit one of the other feedback comments
that I get quite often from girls and
young women who want to get involved in
tech is they think they can't have a
personal life and they're only going to
be have to dip dedicate themselves to
tech and not have any other things so
maybe share with us a little bit about
what you like to do in your free time
when you're not working as an agile
coach um when I'm not working in this
world I love to sail and and ski and
cook and hang out and drink wine so
definitely there's there's place to have
a personal life to the thing is I think
when you get into this sort of worlds
that usually feel so passionate about it
that that it's no longer sort of this
work life balance it's just it's just
part of the entire life and then you
prioritize the other stuff that you also
like to do so so what's your favorite
part about working in a stem job I this
is gonna sound like a cliche it's the
people okay so really getting to know
different people and different
perspectives and and seeing how how
quickly we can get to some really
fantastic results and have it be
interesting and creative solutions and
yeah I think that that's my favorite
part of this cool yeah I mean I when I
do my talks about developing your career
I always say you know communication and
collaboration those are going to be the
skills that you're in need no matter
what job you choose even if you're a
developer these days
fifty percent of your time is going to
be dedicated to being able to
communicate and work effectively as part
of a team not just alone so it is all it
has to be about enjoying the people that
you work with absolutely absolutely well
I had fun talking with you thanks for
sharing a little bit about being agile
coach I know you know a little bit more
about that thank ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
