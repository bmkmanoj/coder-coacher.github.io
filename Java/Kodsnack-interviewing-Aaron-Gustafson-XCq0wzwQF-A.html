podcast on yeah thank you so you're
you're the web standards guy one of them
well one of the many yeah yeah so yeah
do you like to be called the web stylist
guy who sits so i don't know i mean i
i've been doing it for you know I've
been doing the web standards thing for a
long time I know I'm fine I'm fine being
being somebody who stands up for web
standards I'm sorry not the only one so
but I enjoy it I mean I think I've kind
of gone my career certainly gone through
phases where you know I was more known
for JavaScript at one point and then I
kind of found my niche in the
progressive enhancement space and so I
you know obviously that's that's where I
focus the the lion's share of my work
but um you know at the same time I also
love accessibility stuff and you know I
still love doing JavaScript work and you
know mainly I just want to make the web
better and make the web work for
everyone but it can possibly work for
sounds oh so how did you end up on that
path I mean it's sort of who fools into
web standards and how does it happen
right so so I actually started out in I
started out in journalism way way back I
was running a magazine and I came to the
web by trying to bring that magazine
online around about 1996 yeah so you
know framesets and all that fun stuff
and then I want to say it was probably
in two thousand well i started my web
career in earnest in like nineteen
ninety nine where I was actually getting
paid by somebody else to do web stuff
and I was working for a newspaper at
that time and i literally would go in at
eleven o'clock at night and I I'd prep
the the paper for release like sometime
between usually midnight and 5am yeah so
at that point the stories had gone into
the terminal system and we're being laid
out in quark number press and so I would
take those Park files for the different
newspaper sections as they were done and
I would choose which stories I felt
needed to go online so i would take
those and i would drop them into a dream
over templates you know do all the the
mark-up that I additional markup that I
needed to do and then use fetch to push
them up to the site it was very low Phi
I was the content management system huh
I was also the editorial decision maker
for what was going on line you don't
have enough business card that says
content manager no it would have been
really funny if I did but yeah I used to
work from like 11 until like six or
seven in the morning which was just kind
of chia awful um but then so I when I
left that was when i was living in
florida i was working for the breynton
harold i moved to Connecticut and
started consulting for a lot of larger
companies like Gartner and Deloitte &amp;amp;
Touche and folks like that and i think
it was around about 2,000 i stumbled on
Eric Myers work and some of the stuff he
was doing with CSS and I had dabbled
with CSS here and there i think it was
mainly for link hovers and stuff to do
it without javascript and that was right
around the same time that things were
starting to stabilize a little bit on
the web the work of the web standards
project that had been done today had had
worked to to get us towards a standard
dom that all of the you know Dom level 0
that all the browsers were implementing
and so the kind of crazy spaghetti code
that we used to have to write to make
JavaScript work in netscape and internet
explorer and an opera if we were
considering that because you know they
all kind of had their own thing going on
it was it was really painful and so I
started to see the work that Eric Meyer
was doing and then through that ended up
looking at a list apart and looking at
what was going on with web standards
project and I really I kind of I saw
that as being the only way to build a
firm foundation for the web of the
future because without a solid
foundation you know any any building is
not going to be structurally sound right
so so these foundational web standards
we're going to make it possible for us
to to build the interfaces of the future
and not have to write as much awful code
and not have to maintain that stuff over
time and so that's when I got the web
standards bug I kind of I set this seed
in my mind that when day
I was going to meet Jeffrey's oldman and
I was going to be Eric Meijer &amp;amp; and I
was going to be involved in a list apart
in the web standards project and those
were kind of dreams at that point around
2000 2001 I gave my first conference
talk in 2003 on XHTML and at Comdex and
the nice yeah and and that was where I
met Molly hull schlag and Somali umm
Sami talked and she thought I did a
really good job I was of course insanely
nervous and like you know stumbling over
all my words but she was she she was
nice and told me that I did well and
Eric was supposed to be there too and
she and Eric we're going to co-present a
a talk on CSS but I want to say that
that may have been around the time that
they adopted Carolyn their first
daughter and and so he was unable to
make it and so she asked me if I wanted
to to sit in in Eric's spot like on her
talk and like no chime in it was like
are you kidding me like sort of a joke
um but anyway so I you know I said I
would you know I'd be happy to I don't
know how much i can add but i'm happy to
be up there and and so she wonderfully
invited me onto her talk and you know
asked me like to weigh in on the stuff
that she was discussing which she was
completely capable of talking about
Allah sure cuz you know Molly's amazing
but she really she presented an
opportunity for me that really started
the ball rolling and she was a huge
mentor for me and in in terms of web
standards but just in terms of my
overall career and she opened up a lot
of doors for me which I am forever
appreciative of and you know through
through that I got interested in you
know doing more web standards work and
and some of the work that we were doing
ended up getting the the advertising
agency i was working for at the time up
for an award at South by Southwest for
web standards usage for CSS usage so I
went to South by in 2005 which was weird
for me because I I'd gone
they're in the late 90s and 2000's for
the first for music well I mean the
music part of South by Southwest started
all the way back in nineteen eighty
seven oh I think it was a long time ago
when they may have even been before that
I think it was somewhere in the 80s but
uh but so I had gone from like 1996 or
1997 through 2000 for music and film and
when I went I went and checked out the
interactive conference in I think was in
two thousand and it was literally like
the corner of the trade show floor there
was a guy selling a content management
system that he made in the filemaker
there wasn't really a whole lot there
were maybe like a couple of panels and
stuff but even like soso was weird going
back in 2005 and going only for
interactive and not going for music and
film but um but by then it had grown
quite a bit i mean we had in terms of
the the actual conference programming
for interactive we maybe had six rooms
in the convention center and you could
meet everybody who is that at the thing
like we would all be sitting on the
floor in the hallways in between
sessions like one bobbing right and and
that was that was where I met Eric for
the first time that was where I met
Jeffrey for the first time I met javi
and I met all of these different people
I had at that point gotten to work on
with jen robbins on web design in a
nutshell i did some contributions to
that and so through that met her and met
Jeff inai met on tech shellack and all
of these other people who I knew from
following all their blogs but now I
actually got to know them and that's
actually at that South by Southwest was
where I established a really strong
friendship with Jeremy Keith and Andy
bud and Richard rudder who then went on
to form clear left and well it was kind
of neat to see all of that stuff kind of
form out of there but that was you know
that was kind of my path and then in
2006 i was invited to join the web
standards project which was amazing and
then a couple of years later and glenda
since Derek Featherstone and I became
the leadership of the web standards
project which was also
kind of amazing um yeah it was kind of
like my journey into the the web
standards world of time so yeah I mean I
I basically decided I set my sights on
what it was that I wanted to do and you
know whenever there was an opportunity
to help somebody out that you know might
you know create some visibility or or
something like that to to enable me to
meet people I would try and take
advantage of that and obviously you know
not not in kind of a self-serving sort
of way but trying to add actually
provide value and do that good to help I
cannot wait to write exactly so I mean
my whole relationship with a list of
heart started when I asked Jeffery if he
needed copy-editing help because I mean
I had been an editor for a magazine
before coming to the web and I was like
I could I can shortly copy at it like
that'd be that'd be fine and then he
realized that I would also be valuable
from a technical editing skill and so
that's how I became one of the one of
the tech editors for a lost apart for a
number of years yeah so it's just you
know you see see ways that you can help
out and then you join in that yeah so
take the chance to swim but be prepared
and take the chances when exactly
exactly up here yep yes so this is the
rib is there anyone who should should
get more involved in web standards who
isn't right now I mean some type of
primate I think we we always need more
people to be involved i think it's i
think we always need new ideas and you
know the the w3c has some invited
experts but traditionally hasn't had
that many invited experts to the CSS
working group at their meetings they've
always like made it opens that if you
wanted to come in and talk like i was at
the the tpac in boston in 2007 2006
something like that and at in cambridge
and i was able to sit in for two days on
the CSS working group meetings and i
mainly just listened so kind of sat on
the side and listen to what was going on
and then very nicely at the end kind of
towards the end of the second day they
they just kind of turned around and said
you know you've been sitting here for
for two days listening to all this you
know what would you like to see like
what are you interested in and which i
think is a really important thing for a
standards body to do because mentally in
a lot of cases the browsers are driving
things so much as to what what they want
what scratch their itch is because in a
lot of cases they develop software as
well right yeah they're very much
scratching their own itches but and then
there's like the flipside of like these
would be interesting things to do from
from a academic stamp yeah but I think
hearing what actual designers and
developers want to do so the two things
that I threw out them was like I really
want to be able to do rotation which we
haven't been able to do hadn't been able
to do at that point which it apparently
brought up been brought up multiple
times on the working group list but had
never come to fruition and then the the
other thing I said is I want to be able
to do polygonum arjan's I'm going to be
able to basically you know do what I can
do in InDesign or in pagemaker or quark
and actually be able to have an
irregular like follow the shape of an
image which now we have a CSS shape so
like there are two things that have come
about I don't think I had anything to do
with them coming about but as you know
it certainly helps to to have people
saying you know this is what we want
this is what we need to take web design
to the next step and so I think you know
certainly blogs our way of talking about
that conferences our way of talking
about that participating in the mailing
lists or a good way of doing that even
writing up silly ideas around how to do
things like I actually put together two
little PDF says to like what I wanted
and what I thought the syntax I look
like right things are going to get
interesting in the future for
participation of folks who are more the
workaday practitioners the people who
are who are in the trenches building
websites every day there's the in the
w3c there's the web incubator community
group or it might be the web platform
incubator community group but basically
the idea of that is to create a play
zone basically and some tools to help
people to to come in with an idea that
you know maybe they have no idea what
the implications are from an
implementation standpoint but to come in
and try and convince other people that
this might be an interesting idea or at
least worthy of exploration and then
they can work with people who work at
the different browser manufacturers to
potentially build a polyfill that would
make that or a prolly film maybe that of
what the the thing might be might become
to draft spec ideas kind of along the
lines of what the the responsive images
now responsive issues community group
did where you know there's a use case
right like and and we very much focused
on like your the different use cases for
responsive images and then we worked to
try and figure out what sort of market
patterns could support that and then
work with the the browser makers and and
you know people who had been involved
with specs in the past to help us figure
out like what what are we missing what
you know what we don't we know since we
aren't really you know a part of this
process where we're just the people who
want the the solution so so that's
something to look for them yeah yeah I
mean I think that's it's an area that
more people will be able to get involved
with and should get involved with
because who knows you know you you may
have the great idea for the next great
CSS feature that yeah don't we have yeah
or someone could tell me that this is a
bad idea because this and then I can
come back and write and repeater refine
it or you know at least have a
conversation around why it's a good idea
or a bad idea or why it might you know
where it might be more useful or or that
sort of stuff because I mean CSS for
instances implications beyond just HTML
because you can use it to style SPG or
any xml documents and stuff like that so
you know while there may not be
applicability in certain areas there may
be in others and maybe we can help to
make other specs better you know maybe
like one of the one of the things that
like aspect that I had a lot of hope for
that I'm kind of dubious about right now
is like the the network profiling spec
that allows you to know whether you're
on a whether you're on a metered
connection or a non metered connection
so basically like Wi-Fi vs
your cell phone data no and right I'm
paid Wi-Fi versus other right and so I
don't know it doesn't seem to to there
doesn't seem to be a marker to let it
know whether whether you're on on like a
paid Wi-Fi network that I'm aware of yet
I mean and the other piece of it is
let's say you're on your phone but
you're tethering your phone to your
laptop your phone is a classy yeah a
paper bit connection and your computer
only sees it as Wi-Fi so you know I
think I think we need to kind of go
beyond just the the browser knowing from
the device but it there may need to be
something about how the network traffic
is is routed to indicate that a
particular router is delivering
something this is a metered connection
and so that's aspect right now well yeah
there's a speck that just is the metered
on metered thing but it's not like it
doesn't from my last reading of it which
granted has been it's been probably you
know a year and a half easily two years
possibly two since I last looked at it
but it didn't it didn't support kind of
that that extension of things and maybe
that's an area that we need to explore
more and you know maybe maybe it's
already exploring that I haven't looked
at it for a while because it didn't it
didn't serve that need so it seemed son
it seemed like a good idea but the the
utility when the rubber met the road for
me and in terms of what I was working
out at the time wasn't as great as what
it what I could see it being so maybe
that's an area though that somebody has
some interesting ideas I know nothing
about networking so once you get into
that area I'm like I don't know what you
could or can send you know over it's
over the network that respective sort of
been in progress I oh no Charlie using
the right terminology but yeah yeah I
believe that the the trying to remember
what the exact name of the spec is it's
basically like the might be the network
profile API or something like that but
it and check it out yeah but your link
in the show notes yeah yeah I'll find it
for you huh yeah now I was just
wondering about as aspect like that a if
if there isn't yet technical support I
mean technical support below it sort of
would it still be able to like go
through the whole process and sort of
released as a standard so the way the
way that the standards process works is
that you know you you have typically a
working group working on the spec and
and kind of evolving it but in order for
it to become a technical recommendation
it has to go through being a working
draft for a while and then it moves to
being like a candidate recommendation
and there's like feedback processes
throughout but it becomes a candidate
recommendation and then it requires two
interoperable implementations that are
it to indo my bra interoperable
implementations so you know for for our
purposes either it would need to be in
WebKit it would need to be in blink it
would need to be in the edge HTML
rendering engine or it would need to be
in the Mozilla rendering it now so that
could never be sort of a forward-looking
recommendation yeah when this can ever
make it to the technical recommendation
but it can be flowing around us a right
on this kind sometimes people you know
sometimes people will do implementations
based on you know even a working draft
sometimes yeah here because I mean like
Apple for instance they dropped linear
gradients into the w3c after they had
already implemented their their first
run version but that spec got inter now
it got iterated on at the w3c to become
the the final version of the the syntax
which they then also implemented behind
find the vendor prefix so yeah I mean
you can't have people do early
implementations but that's why we have
vendor prefixes or feature flags and and
that sort of stuff in order in order to
indicate that this is experimental
potential to change I don't know that
many developers who you know just read
somebody's blog poster or go to stack
overflow and like to get a question
answered if they really understand the
vendor prefixes mean experimental I
think in a way but I think they're so
seductive sometimes well I mean I yeah I
agree you know you you're like oh it
works and now move on because we've all
got other things to do right yeah
exactly i mean this solves the problem
nicely in this browser so except then
the browsers get rid of it or in the
case of like the
the gradients you know the old syntax
went away yeah but now kind of because
we used the old syntax only in some
cases browser other browsers are having
to support that and like Safari
continues to support the old syntax
because people were only using the old
Macs and they would break the web yeah I
mean you've you've got the Microsoft
edge browser which and I mobile which
you know in the precursor to Windows 10
which actually implemented some of the
WebKit prefix properties because the web
just didn't work yeah our devices
without that I found and Firefox did the
same thing in firefox mobile yeah yeah
yeah i think my feeling is a developer
is that most most developers are aware
what the prefix means it's just that it
tends to work too well sort of yes the
good the good kind of problem in a way
but I'm not is easy to get stuck there
yeah well and I think I think it's kind
of on on the folks who respond to to
answer people's questions on stack
overflow or who write about emerging
technologies yeah 22 really caution
folks that hey the syntax may change but
also when when a spec is has reached you
know not you yeah its reach maturity it
hasn't hasn't maybe been finalized her
it's not it's not got every
interoperable implementation but that
that you do the standards version
without the prefix as well so that your
future proofing what you're building yes
which also doesn't happen a lot of times
maybe they should just break their
prefixes things more often so people
sort of you could like me that bug
that's why I mean that's why browsers
have experimented with feature flags you
know Alex Russell a little bit ago wrote
up kind of a treatise on why feature
flags might might not be the way to go
that you could have he floated a couple
of different ideas like allowing
companies to participate in a public
experiment where essentially the feature
was turned on
for their site for a specific amount of
time and then it would be turned off
again which is he floated some really
interesting ideas which I you know I
don't know what the right solution is
ultimately going to be and it's probably
going to depend on the situation sure
and the particular thing that you're
dealing with whether it's a JavaScript
API or whether it's a CSS property or
something like that but vendor prefixes
have kind of fitness in the ass oh yeah
and so you know we need to there's got
to be a better way than that yeah so
it's good that it's being thought about
yes we know for sure yeah I think it's
being but it's certainly being thought
about Google it's being thought about it
microsoft and i can only imagine as
being thought about it mozilla yeah my
new browser wants to get get out from
under it I guess yeah yeah yeah are
there any like common misconceptions
about the standards work um I don't know
about necessarily misconceptions about
standards I think a lot of people have
the perspective that the standards work
moves really slowly and you know it's
it's really interesting given that we
have like the the what we G and then
we've got the w3c and the way we G is
like okay now we're not going to version
HTML anymore and you know the w3c is
kind of like creating versions of specs
and stuff but I mean the way I kind of
look at it is languages evolve right
sure even even like English as a
language evolves we add new words you
know we're fall out of favor you know
all that sort of stuff I'm sure it's the
same thing in Swedish and every other
language right and to me when you a
dictionary is kind of a it's a point in
time that's a reference to what the
language was like at that time oh yes in
that place with some politics in there
too in terms of which new words made it
in which ones didn't so I kind of see
like the HTML spec the CSS specs and
such being snapshots in time of the
evolution of HTML or of the evolution of
CSS and I
like the modularity of of CSS I think
that's going to allow that spec 22 as a
whole the language as a whole to evolve
more quickly I kind of wish that the
html5 spec was modularized in a similar
way because to me there's like html5 the
the markup language and then there's
like html5 all of the the API is for
JavaScript and stuff which are all kind
of lumped together and Timmy as you know
somebody who's come from the building
the web you know not not necessarily
working for a browser maker even though
now I work for Microsoft and I'm not
doing client work so much but to me like
the HTML spec like somebody would be
like can you build us an html5 said I
know what do you what do you want to
talk about like like what's html5 out
with you expect you um because there's
there's a lot of different
interpretations of that you are using
html5 based elements or are you using
api's which api's are using you know
certain HTML quote-unquote html5 aps
like though the web DB or web sequel
rather that disappeared because you know
that Microsoft and Mozilla were not fans
and so we got index DB which is now the
the client-side database option you know
it's it's interesting I think I'm
hopeful that maybe that'll become
modularized in the future and it'll be
able to you know the markup language
will be able to evolve on its own yeah
and the sum of the api's can evolve in
their own specs so the things can kind
of speed up you know I think I think the
other I think if there is a
misconception around standards i think
that that there's a misconception maybe
that we don't need them that they're
holding us back I mean I know I run into
that a lot working in kind of the
progressive enhancement space there's
been a lot of pushback especially from
people in the JavaScript world who see
who don't want to have to
poor older devices or different os's and
things like that and I and I don't
necessarily I don't necessarily blame
people for having that perception but I
think that it's all about what your
experience is and and what you've what
you've seen my my first experience of
the web was via the command line and i
was i was using i'm fairly certain i was
using gopher to access the web and all i
saw when i went to visit sony com was
literally the words image image image
image image and i was like this web
thing is bullshit um but I think because
that was my first experience of the web
it made me understand that not everybody
has the same experience of the web
because that site was obviously designed
for somebody who had a visual browser
and when my school eventually got a PPP
connection went to point protocol
connection i was able to use I think
Netscape was probably the first visual
browser I used and then I was able to
see Sony just fine of course all the
text was locked up in images though that
was kind of the way that we did things
way back then because we didn't have web
fonts and people weren't happy with the
the type of fonts that were available to
font choices that were available online
but so I think a lot of people who've
been newer to the web who you know have
have come to the web in the last 10
years or even the last 15 years have a
much more excuse me narrow view of what
the the web is and how people experience
it so I try to work to broaden people's
perspective on that and to help them
understand that you know there are
people who access the web without a
mouse there are people who access the
web without being able to see which
you've put on the page without being
able to to understand the hierarchy and
the relationship that you've established
because they don't you know they're not
sighted or a heavier that have problems
interacting with what you've created
because they're a power user and they
want to use their keyboard only and they
don't really use our mouse
or that there are people who you know
maybe on a quote-unquote smartphone but
that smartphone maybe a $35 Firefox
phone because they're in India and you
know all they have is thirty-five
dollars to spend on on a phone they
don't have you know 799 dollars to buy
the latest you know Samsung device or
have you this seems like a touch device
but it's a Windows 10 desktop with a
touchscreen right i mean there's there's
so many different ways of accessing the
web and that's the beauty of the web to
me i mean that that's its powers that
can it can go anywhere and be used by
anybody but when when you only have one
sort of experience like I feel like one
of the things that's holding us back as
an industry is that we are mostly Mac
users we are mostly chrome users and we
don't experience the web the way that
everybody else know right so I think the
more that we get out there and
understand that there's a lot of
variability I mean even even just as
simple as like different monitors
displaying colors differently I mean
that you're a really simple thing not
every met monitor is calibrated the same
no a projector for that method more
gorgeous showroom right exactly and and
viewing you know even the exact same
device in in like outdoors versus
indoors like color contrast matters yeah
that and and you know we get focused on
you know some if somebody has a mouse
you know I can make hit target smaller
well you know sometimes stuff happens
and like you may have broken your
dominant arm and you're trying always a
mouse with your other arm oh yeah you
like crap at it right it's not an
accessibility thing it is absolutely an
accessibility thanks you for exactly so
I mean I think that we we as an industry
need to start embracing the variability
of experience and and creating
opportunities for people to access
content however they need to access it
and that's really going to empower our
our stuff to go further I mean if you if
you think about it
I think about video games today and then
you go back in time and you look at
video games like zork right that was
purely text-based command-line stuff
that may seem like ancient history from
a video game perspective but in a lot of
ways that's the future of interaction
design for us because we're heading
towards this world of voice based
interactions with the web and and with
our software and stuff like that so how
do you design for a completely non
visual you I yeah right you have to
think really hard about what what the
content is that you're writing how
you're describing that content in order
to make it accessible to somebody purely
via speech so screen readers are really
pointing the way to how that interaction
is going to go so the more that we think
about that stuff now the more we're
going to empower our our sites that
we're building in the applications that
we're building to be able to be used in
that future because you know not not
every piece of software is a photo
editor no right most are exactly so so
you know if you're if you're writing you
know a slack type app for you know for
instance having it so that that could be
done purely via voice would be insanely
useful and why wouldn't it exists with
this text exactly and I think you know
the the more that we can can kind of
view experience as a continuum the more
the more power we give to our stuff and
the more value we create the things that
we're building and you know honestly the
more money we have to eventually be able
to make or as we can reach more people
it just struck me now that we were
talking that I was reminded of this emma
differences in the browser she uses
stuff like that when I started trying
content blockers for latest mac OS yeah
and the phone and suddenly some sites
don't load I can't log in right and and
also we're talking about enhancement and
making money you block all you block
lots of ads and companies a really
worried if they had used like
progressive enhancement for their ads
they wouldn't have a problem right
exactly its kind of we I can't believe I
want them to make their ads more
accessible
well I mean it's yeah i mean i think
it's it's it's definitely a challenge
and i think a lot of that has come come
from just agreed on the part of the the
advertisers were like i can get access
to more data i want as much as possible
although it's you know the the privacy
has become you know a big big pusher for
a lot of that stuff and so you know
that's why we have the content blockers
but at the same at the same time because
those ads want so much information
they've become so bulky and just that
slowed down the overall web experience
it's not just a privacy thing it's a
performance thing same thing with web
fonts web fonts gonna be great but they
can really bogged down I mean yeah
anytime I try and go to wired on my
phone even if I'm at home and you know
my my wireless is really fast and my
internet connection at home is one mega
or I mean a 100 bags up and down so I've
got a really fast internet connection
yet wired on my phone will take each
sometimes six or seven seconds just to
load an article and I'm just sitting
there waiting for it to get the web
fonts which is that's the problem it's
got it'll load the rest of the tech or
the rest of the page that'll just be
white you know no no one wants that
flash show on style comp which I'm fine
with i would i would rather have I would
rather be able to start reading your
article but I took armor i remember when
i started using gostrey and crumble and
some of the other content blockers that
are available for chrome yeah some sites
just wouldn't load at all and that was
because they they were actually
requiring that the ads be loaded before
they loaded any content yeah and it was
just bizarre Jim yeah really really
strange stuff it took me so long to
realize is when sites were lonely like
blank with like blue lines here and I
said oh it's the fonts not gay yeah I
can't remember I don't remember which
which site it was but there was there
was one and I tweeted about this a
couple months ago it was you'd like the
economist or one of those sorts of of
magazines that I went to the site and
literally the site
would not load without ads and if you
think about it you know it may I guess I
question whether it was an intentional
decision or whether it was an
inadvertent one so because if it was
intentional then it seems like their
judgment call is that serving an ad is
more important than delivering content
mm-hmm I would like to believe that it
was something that they didn't intend to
happen and so that would be something
that they would fix as opposed to like
actually enforcing that in the latter
but I would hope yeah yes you also you
also mentioned yeah when we were
discussing by me male subjects you also
mentioned performance so I was just
curious like in which which way perform
web web performance in general or in a
lot of cases download performance and I
think you know that's that's certainly
that's also one of those things that's
really easy to start like oh no it's not
that bad most most or people are wired
most of the time yeah no yeah it's easy
to make that assumption and it's you
know it's not the case even even
something as simple as just the tunnel
effect of being on a being on a train
and be on your phone and then all of a
sudden losing network connectivity or
hotel Wi-Fi or conference center Wi-Fi
or whatever you know there there's all
sorts of I mean they you know even the
Wi-Fi here I get kicked off every now
and then because there's too many
connections so it drops out and being
that you know I'm only in Sweden for a
couple of days I didn't do an
international data play also I don't
have anything to fall back to ya so you
know if I think our focus oies needs to
be on delivering a baseline experience
that somebody can do what they need to
do and then we can bring in those
enhancements after the fact I mean I
think you know a good example of that is
you know a landing page for a magazine
or newspaper on a large screen
thumbnails are really helpful because
they draw your eye to the most important
articles on the page right
but on a small screen you don't have
that competition for space so don't load
in the thumbnails on those smaller
screens like at all and don't just
display none the image because in most
cases they'll still be downloaded yeah
Tim Catholic has some some great
research into when images are downloaded
and when they're not but you know find a
way to bring in the images only when it
makes sense to do so yeah and just be
always focusing on you know what is what
is the core you know what is the core
message of this page what is the court
asked that the user needs to be able to
accomplish how many dependencies do I
have that could be not met and caused
them not to be able to do that ya know
the stuff on tin you know you need it
exactly and and so reducing the number
of dependencies that you have I mean I
think a kind of a classic example that
that really illustrates this is your
you're creating a button to submit a
form right you could use an input of
type submit or a button of type submit
either of those would work you could use
an anchor you know we've seen those
certainly a lot and we could use a div
yea so with the input or button we get
the look and feel of a button by default
in the browser so we don't necessarily
need CSS for that it will still look
like an interactive element it will
receive focus using a keyboard so it's
an interactive element yeah it is
clickable using a mouse using the
keyboard either with the I think it's in
Turkey or spacebar would activate the
the control and they're both capable of
submitting the form yeah okay now with
the link it can receive focus because
it's a link it's an interactive element
but it requires CSS to look like a
button and if you're see if there's an
interruption in your CSS being
downloaded then you know it may not end
up looking like a button
it requires JavaScript to submit the
form it requires JavaScript to enable it
to be activated with the enter key the
spacebar will will activate a link but
the enter key won't so you know you've
you've added for dependencies basically
to make that happen now the div you have
all of the dependencies that the anchor
has but you also have to make it capable
of receiving focus which means you need
to have it add a tab index to it and you
need to make it activatable using the
space bar so like you're you're just
increasing the number of dependencies
and the number of potential things that
could go wrong they could cause your
interface to fail to work now and you
know dependencies in general are you
know not a good thing like you don't
want to have too many of them yeah sure
um it's all about building something
that's more robust and and so you know I
think and that's just a button like
we're talking about is a totally simple
thing and yet it's you know it so as you
get into the more and more complicated
interfaces there are ways to accomplish
what it is that that you need to do and
you know the way that I kind of benefit
from having been on the web for as long
as I have but um I look to how we did
things in web one point oh like when all
we had was HTTP and HTML basically right
how did we accomplish these things we
had most of the same types of sites that
we have now yeah maybe we didn't have
web based photo editors and web based
code editors and stuff like that but not
you know like the vast majority of stuff
that we build for the web is not coded
not code editors not online photo and
video editing Suites and stuff like that
that's you know a very specialized
subset of things but you could
completely build base camp you could
completely build harvest you know all of
all of these different applications web
applications could completely be built
using web one point I college ease you
know maybe you wouldn't be able to have
a javascript-based timer on on the web
page but you know you could probably
accomplish the same thing with a frame
you know
and I frame with a meta refreshing page
in it like if you really wanted to have
that right like you there are ways to
accomplish these things and so you know
I I like to look at that and like okay
so that can be my baseline experience
and then now now how do I make it better
how do I make this a snappier experience
for somebody how do I you know remove
the friction from their experience how
do I design something that's better but
at least I always know that I've got
that fall back but if you know if
something goes wrong if one of these
dependencies isn't mad I'm still left
with something that's usable yeah yeah
makes me interested now to think about
more off we could make our web
application more yeah more progressive
sort of yeah well shameless plug my the
second edition of adaptive web design
will be out in December so that goes
through a lot of this stand also two
sessions tomorrow right yeah two
sessions tomorrow here one on forms and
then one on and basically dispelling
excuses for not doing a progression so
and they will all be out on the on the
web as well hopefully it yeah
progressive or not who knows thank you
so much yes it was really interesting
lot better Yeah Yeah right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
