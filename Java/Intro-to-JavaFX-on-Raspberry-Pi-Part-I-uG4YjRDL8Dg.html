JavaFX application to play with
Raspberry Pi
actually it's not about Raspberry Pi
it's about JavaFX period only because
all the connectivity will be through
REST API right so it doesn't matter if
your application is running on raspberry
or desktop but there are a few things
that you need to adjust to make your
JavaFX application to run on a Raspberry
Pi to build an application doesn't
matter to run there are a few things
that you need to do we're going to go
through a little things so um you guys
have probably NetBeans if you don't have
that's fine because the JavaFX scene
builder it's a separated application to
design the JavaFX UI so it's like a
drag-and-drop application and it's linux
supported right now it's the version is
1.1 so if you plan to build a JavaFX UI
go to the bitly slash JavaFX download
that's the link to the JavaFX
scene beuter page so you can download
this pretty cool application here you
can just drag and drop the components
through the board this will generate an
F XML file and then you can load this F
F XML file in your java fax application
it's like building an html5 application
okay but the runtime is JavaFX and not
the browser right okay here comes the
things about raspberry pi
points one CPU overclock let's need it
so whenever you run
raspy config you can overclock to the
minimum should be like 900 megahertz ok
you can one for 950 but I don't
recommend to run over one gigabyte
because then the sdcard might burn ok we
don't want you to spend your time
reinstalling the SD card all over again
alright so keep the clock between 900
950 the memory splits also necessary
because uh here's a pretty cool thing
about run about JavaFX it doesn't use
the x windows on linux it sends the data
the video data directly through the
frame buffer to the GPU so you don't
need the operational system the desktop
system of linux okay but we need to do
the memory split and give more memory to
the video processor so it can work with
the JavaFX application if you remember
split of 128 megabytes and also define
hard-coded in the raspberry pi
configuration the framing buffer size so
you're going to it's like setting up the
resolution of your monitor so ii gonna
edit this in a text file on raspberry pi
and give it that option so CP
overclocked is pretty easy you just run
recipe - config with sudo if you want
the whole documentation except actually
this is not a documentation it's an
article that explains a lot of things so
you can go to beat lee / recipe
overclock and that will give you a lot
of explanations on things and why you
should not run on one Giga Heights okay
now it's going to burn the SD card to do
the memory the CPU overclock it will
bring this configuration interface you
just go to overclock option and and then
you select a few options already
available you can tune that by hand but
it's better to just
use the predefined configurations we
just select the hi option which is 950
megahertz
okay split what we do is we run again
raspy config select the option memories
plate and a huntin wait is the best
performance for video 64 might work okay
depends on how heavy will be your
application how many nodes and this is a
java fax term how many components in
your Java FX application that might be a
performance issue if you run a very
heavy application over 64 so you select
memory split and then you just tell
raspy hey give the video core 128
megabytes or 64 but the default is 16 it
would never run okay
just console at this size situation to
run this application JavaFX application
on raspberry pi you have to edit the
config dot text in under /boot slash
this file will set up in this file
you're going to setup the frame buffer
size the width in the hate so it's like
the resolution of your monitor after
these three configurations you are ready
to go just restart your Raspberry Pi and
you are ready to run Java FEX
applications okay it doesn't have to run
Linux X Windows desktop you just need to
start the java application like you have
been doing for the last 10 years Java
- jar and then your application okay
these here's a hint when you run Java FX
application raspberry pi it comes on
full screen already obviously there's no
despot behind right so there is no asset
option you have to code a handler a key
handler or in Java SE 8 there is a
variable you can do
underscores debug equals one and these
will enable a key handler for you
control C will kill the application or
you can just connect through secret
shell and cue Java alright that works
two final parameters for Java FX and
raspberry pi if you don't need a virtual
keyboard which probably you guys will
not need you need to add this parameter
here okay it's - Deacon dot Suns Java FX
is embedded it's like a tricky we're
going to tell Raspberry Pi that it is
not on an embedded device so it won't
come up ever with the virtual keyboard
unless you want that then you just leave
this on default which is true for Java
effects on Raspberry Pi but this one is
required
it sells Java FX that it is running on
Raspberry Pi and to run the output to
the frame buffer so you add this
parameter here always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
