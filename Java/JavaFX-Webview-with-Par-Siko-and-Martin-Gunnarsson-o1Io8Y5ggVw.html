at Oracle Corporation and I'm with first
first / is a perp our booth it's both
it's yeah it's / parsi CO and it's
Martin Gunnarsson Martin the machine gun
Gunnarsson I used and yeah yes that's
kind of my gangster named that is
gangster named yeah are you West Coast
Greece goes west coast let's go slow as
are your East Coast yagos that yeah you
have a sign for East Coast yes so these
guys are javafx developers and also
colleagues and friends of mine over the
last several years it seems like I meet
these guys at conferences and then as I
travel the world and go to conferences
these guys are always there speaking and
so we've kind of got this bond and and
I've seen several the presentations that
you guys have done and I've always been
impressed by the what I call the Dean
Martin and Jerry Lewis kind of effect
that you guys do you kind of play off
each other yeah I've always been
impressed at how much how little time I
see you though at the actual conference
because you do so much rehearsing back
at the hotel room to make sure that your
you know your presentation systems are
spot on so I I do appreciate that and I
always like to attend your your sessions
so much so that as you know that that
you helped me in my session yesterday
the University session on the javafx
bootstrap so you guys have a couple
presentations coming on with dev box
what what are they going to be about and
what kind of antics are you going to do
what we have I guess the big thing is we
have our presentation from Java one
sucks and it's it's a presentation about
how to bring web content into javafx
applications so we have a very powerful
web view in javafx too and it's a webkit
browser basically that you can you can
have really good integration between the
JavaScript running in the web view and
your job of Xcode so you can sort of
make the web content a fully integrated
part of your application and we kind of
show some pool and a bit crazy demos for
example of things you can do with this
technology both both useful stuff and
some a bit more goofy and fun just be
like what goofy oh ok actually I've
created a lot of you know useful
examples is that you can you can give
you some production I'm Martin I don't
know what well you've been doing you
know all the rest actually it's kind of
the other way around I created some
really inspirational good examples
showing really reasonable real-world use
cases for the web viewers and things
like this and you created some kind of
beer hunt application I mean I I
appreciate the bigger always but I don't
know I mean yes for years yeah yeah so
some of the stuff are a bit more out
there but it's all they all show off the
powers of the webview in javafx gotta
kiss a really powerful component as we
like to use a lot that's a really
extremely powerful it is yeah now when
you guys aren't presenting at
conferences what are your day jobs what
do you what do you do for a living what
do you do I know well seriously I I'm a
consultant I work as a developer for
different clients and right now I've
been working with JavaScript for a
pretty long time rights of java chip
based applications which has come come
in real handy now that we're working
with webview Injun Joe effects I can
sort of
focus on the web stuff that doesn't
really know about a okay and he can help
out a bit with the java facts that we
both know i said okay so i don't know
what you're contributing but i do all
this stuff I mean I'm the programmer I'm
the one who knows you know how it works
sorry a day job I do a lot of on a long
time swing developer oh ok yeah and but
for the past couple of years we've been
doing more and more javafx and a day job
i also do android so but only client
side I mean that's what I do blind side
I guess we have that in common in yeah
we've been using we've been working a
lot with the front and hind sight
technology and that's what we think is
fun okay we like you I stuff and
graphics and all this not so much
service I don't know it's you know and
in our presentation is really good
because Martin is really good on the
fluffy javascript HTML CSS and I can do
the the core logic instead so we can
combine it and that's what makes the
magic I think that's yeah I think so and
you're pretty good I mean I got to give
you that because you're really good on
the sign and I'm more like a general
programmer I mean I'm I don't know I
can't see I mean I'm I can't assign a
good-looking application but morning can
so but that's the only thing you can I
well but I think that's pretty common
among developers it is it's very hard to
kind of get that
and I 44 design is pretty much something
you're born with you either have it or
you don't like it or to kind of like to
learn it the essence I remember when I
was visiting Malmo Sweden that you guys
were leading a jug I believe or export
or and you were doing some type of
created some type of an activity where
the jug members were going to do a kind
of a hacking session and create a game
can you go into what were you doing what
was that all about having fun ok yeah
think so but we created this robot wars
where we had the engine so we so we was
a German effects applica yeah Kevin flex
application the user interface was
really cool good looking so you can run
around with your robot then and shoot
and it was explosions and stuff like
that so the only thing the attendees had
to do was great the algorithm for the
robot and so yeah so no no user
interface just a you know a single
method and we applied the intelligence
on the robots and we had this great war
between the robots kind of robot battle
yeah winner takes it to all the kind of
thing ok that's it that was really fun
well I'm impressed how you got the you
know how you got so many people in you
know in the in the user group to just
spend so many hours in the evening just
playing with job FX it was really really
cool i was very impressed yeah i think
putting you it's kind of a game and you
put the game in the hands of the
developers so you're kind of tricking
them into learning stuff so it's a
I think it's a good way it's just plain
fun and they learned a bit to our job
effects and all sorted out with the I
mean from the beginning it was just a
hobby project you know using Java facts
and we thought why don't we do something
serious about it and we had the UI and
we had the robots and so why don't we
create some kind of competition and
that's so Java flex was the starting
point and then it turned out to be
really good competition right now if if
you could have one or two asks of the
four of javafx things that you would
want to see in javafx or see improved in
javafx and of course now that is
becoming open-source what you asked for
we're going to be asking you the most
are you contribute but what kinds of
things and improvements and capabilities
would you like to see with javafx the
obvious ones are you know on on iOS and
Android so but other ones I think one of
my pet peeves throughout the years with
Java has been deployment okay you know
and actually that's kind of been fixed
now you can easily export like a mac and
windows up straight out of NetBeans okay
so I'm pretty happy with that that's
always been like ah yeah why do I have
to have my users jump through all these
hoops to get my app running yes and now
there are tools for that so at the
moment i'm pretty happy but they're
pretty happy but papar are you are you
having your we have the webview okay so
it's not a feature that I request
because it's already motivated there and
I really like it so I'm satisfied but
what I would like is Oracle and the
community to to continue with innovation
because it's been it's been a few years
where nothing happened and our current
is pushing Java facts and the
communities is on board and working so i
just i just wanted to continue and more
delivery and more stuff more innovation
I think it's great to see that's stuff
or something stuff is happening again
yeah we're getting news about Cal
effects and Java in general you can rely
movie well would ya very excited what's
been great connecting with you guys
again thanks for your help yesterday and
and good luck in your sessions for the
rest of javafx thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
