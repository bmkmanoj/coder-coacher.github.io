today today I am in I'm losing track of
which wich country now I'm in Denmark
you on in the open deafening in Denmark
and we're at the Republican and I have
two guests tonight so Werner Kyle who
will be on in a bit and we finally
located him I'll take responsibility for
putting the wrong venue on the night
hiking calendar that happens that's life
you know and we have Soren who is well
known for a lot of his work in the
groovy community running the great
conference and tell us a little more
about what you've been doing well I am a
Java developer but prefers to do groovy
and grails and I've been doing that for
the past four years my guillaume caught
my interests at what's a cold the
server-side symposium in proc in 2008
you were there ok cool and i heard the
same talk with Guillaume in at devoxx in
December in 2008 and the Danish jalwa
user group had him speaking at a
conference in 2009 in January and right
after the conference i asked him well
the groovy and grails one-on-one talk is
great but it's getting kind of boring to
listen to the same stuff so don't he
know some who can tell us more and about
a week later he contacted me and said
well i know a lot of people that would
love to say more about groovy and grails
and in about a week later we decided to
make a conference so that was the way
great compost
and the first year we had about 80
attendees in Copenhagen in may and the
year after a little more and in 2012 we
were around 150 people and this year
we're about so you really talk about
this conference right I'm talking about
that conference excited oh yeah and
Guillaume came up with a name and I
think it's great so actually I was at a
great cop as a speaker last year it was
a lot of fun well the venue is really
nice because there's two amphitheater
style rooms and you know with only two
sessions going on Tom currently you can
almost see all the stuff you want to
almost almost and we have tried to video
out the previous year and this year we
we think that we have finally finally
found the answer to doing it right so we
found a small hot web option that can
record the screen and and video and
combine the two on the fly nice what's a
limit let's work yeah because it's
actually the post-processing that's the
hottest work yeah yeah I you'd how much
post-processing I do on this show
probably whole know that I do 0 you just
do see your post the moment we finish I
immediately push a button and it goes up
on ustream at YouTube done cool that's
pretty much what we want to achieve this
year's well so we hope we'll be able to
not live stream like this show but at
least publish or shortly after the talk
is over that's our main goal this year
yeah and also at one of the features of
great cough is great beer oh yeah great
here that is true and the crew of Great
Khan or actually the company behind
great conf get ain't et they we need and
we brew our own beer and they are the
sponsors of the beer and last year we
had a great beer and groovy ale and next
year or this year we might even put in
an anniversary beer of some kind and
yeah there they are classic type a small
picture though I have to push it live
once I make it as big as it will fit on
the screen yeah those were the beers and
it was pretty good beer it tasted pretty
good yeah and that's one of the
conference it was you're just like I've
had beer before conferences where they
just take like a brand name beer and
they slap a label on it this is not this
was actually that was weird hombre all
well food at a small micro brewery where
you brew yourself and you come back two
weeks later to bottle it so it's it's
done by us so yeah we're really proud of
it cool so we're actually we're going to
we're going to attempt to hack on some
groovy you know or movie FX groovy
effects and to be honest I've never
tried it and then you very much forward
to it yeah so we'll see we'll see how
far we get is that this will be this
will be at the very least it will be
very entertaining so to level set I I
found I found this nice little
presentation groovy effects which will
hopefully show us a little bit about how
to use it and then we're going to
attempt to apply this knowledge in and
actually do some groovy effects hacking
so what is well groovy first of all you
you know a lot you know a lot of that
groovy tell us book rubios well groovy
is a
the superset of Java inspired by Titan
and rails and small talk and it's a
dynamic language but in groovy 20 they
have added the possibility of doing
static compile for those who prefer the
static compiling static type checking
yeah yeah so that's pretty cool and it's
it takes away a lot of the boilerplate
that you have in Java or getters and
setters and it adds closures and had
closest way before Java even thought
about putting closer into the language
and maybe even in Java 8 they might even
have it yeah they say they said told him
in Java 7 i've heard i've heard a rumor
that that might be coming at jdk a yeah
and yeah well a good friend of mine once
called it a java on steroids no i think
that describes it pretty well it's yeah
so let's say we actually we have some
how good is how good is your eyesight
can you guys are actually read this
probably probably not but I'm left we
have some wait a sec we've lost even
with glasses yes so the left we have
some Java code and on the right we have
some groovy FX yeah it's kind of the
same as looking at a Java class versus I
a groobee class and it's much more terse
and without a lot of ceremony from that
there is required by java so if you
actually did counter this up the left
side the java has 40 lines
under ninety nine characters on the
right has 29 lines and that half
slightly over half as many carrier but
that's a lot less to type he had a lot
more terse and actually there's there's
one line we could get rid of there and
that would actually make it under half i
believe the scene graph builders not
needed anymore for groovy effects so
there you have it write less code so
here is what a groovy effects
application looks like the scene graph
builders not actually needed anymore so
when i show you the code in IntelliJ you
can just ignore that line because it
won't be there and declarative stage
definition so you actually write the
code kind of like a hierarchical
relationship you can declare the
properties as a name two parameters yeah
very cool feature really nice and terse
you know for putting stuff in you can do
binding using a nice Ruby syntax and
binding as a feature in javafx which
lets you take two properties like for
example in this case when you hover with
the mouse it's going to change the size
of the stroke the width of the stroke
automatically if you did this in swing
or other UI frameworks you'd actually
have to add event listeners and then
modify properties when the event changes
and there's a lot more code this is a
nice way just to tie everything together
and then nice groovy isms this is this
doesn't look anything like Java nope but
I didn't know there was a method times
on integer yeah well the thing is that
that's one of the cool features about
Groovy's that you have a metaclass and
the metaclass allows you to add new
methods to classes and in this case you
add a they have added a times method
that takes a closer and it executes
whatever is in that closure the number
of inches of times nice so here's
example the animation to your cell
that's in groovy effects and they did a
nice job with kind of making it read
exactly like how you'd expect the
animation to be expressed even to the
point of you're updating the center
property you say change property to and
give it up a new value which is kind of
nice and durations which in javafx are
strongly typed and groovy you can simply
do for us for 40 seconds or hours or
minutes yeah whatever you like which is
pretty cool there's the keyframe dsl and
you can even do tweening so tweening is
changing the speed of the animation
commonly used to kind of speed up and
slow down at the beginning and end so
feel smoother and you can do this just
with adding up tween keywords choosing
one of the built-in tweens so pretty
easy and then event listeners which have
closures which you mentioned yeah it's
good and close your sis well if you
don't know grube you can think of them
kind of like at all levels in the
classes but not quite closest can be
assigned to variable so you can pass
them around us as a method arguments
which is pretty nice cool so in this
case we're adding a mouse-click closure
getting the mouse events which is
optional oops and then have a timeline
which place when you click on it so we
should we've we've been chatting for too
long let's try some code I have I've
IntelliJ here with some
groovy and I basically I just cut and
paste the code from the sample the
vanishing sir yeah you example stage and
remove the stage definition which you
don't need so pretty straightforward
same code here's our time line with our
animation here's our pine d I'd in fines
to hover should change the stroke from
420 and then it creates some 50 circles
of varying sizes animates them around so
let's just run this
alright and now we've got circles let's
try hover what's good pull and then if
we click on one of these and see if our
mouse handler there we go so that is
just using little animation so I mean
it's a really really simple example but
it shows you what you can do in groovy
without a lot of code to get you know
some advanced graphics in effect some
things going really nice and really
terse it didn't take long take didn't
take much coach at all yeah yeah and
that's kind of a graphical example of
groovy effects but there's a whole lot
more you can do with it for example you
can do properties this is what Java
properties look like if you defined your
own properties yeah there's a lot of co2
set and get yeah this is like I just
like anything this is like setting get
on steroids because not only do you need
a setter and a getter but you also need
a foo property method to return the
property object okay yeah and there's
little tricks you do to make sure that
like of the property is null you create
it so you don't have to like evilly
create them yeah and then getting and
setting it inside of the setter and
getter so you properly synchronized with
the underlying property etc etc it
sounds like something you could easily
do in a one-liner in groovy kind of like
that like that a little bit of a st
magic yeah so they actually they use the
groovy AST feature which lets you
rewrite the code pretty much on the fly
and this will generate the same code you
saw in the previous slide underneath the
covers but all it requires is an
annotation on you should
to do it which is pretty cool and it
even handles the initializer case so if
you set an initial value it will do the
right thing with returning that value
from the getter without even creating a
property so that's efficient on the
first gap and then if you set the value
it'll actually create the property
object sent on the property object and
return that from the getter after there
so it only creates the property object
when needed nice okay and then you know
nice groovy syntax for getting a setting
values no good so yeah and even you
could even have made it nicer if you
were initializing the object you could
have provided name properties in the
constructor oh I hope you need a nicer
there you go you should you should help
out a groovy effects project I should if
I happen to you know making conferences
takes a long time well you're only doing
that for the next couple months yeah
what do you do the rest of the year my
day job you know and family and yeah
yeah and then some binding and speaking
of binding and curvy effects this is an
example of putting the annotation on a
whole class and all the properties in
the class suddenly become findable they
become full properties
which is pretty cool you can also do
tables and groovy effects oh actually
this is in Java so you guys will notice
what's the most prominent feature in
this code what do you guys notice lots
of well strong setting the cell value I
don't know how not to chance to yeah but
I mean what kind of you slick look
looked at this code let's step back and
looked at it what do you see a lot of
angle bracket yeah yeah yeah so that one
of the nice things about the JavaFX
table API is it is entirely genericized
and type safe so you define the types
for the columns and for the rows and for
the cells and then everything is you
know checked and it makes it very hard
to make any mistakes but also very
verbose but if you're doing this in
groovy effects that's it yeah nice just
to tie your property tax and the last
one even has an example of taking a date
and then formatting it into a strength
for better display so tables layouts
this is what layouts look like in Java
and you notice that it actually uses
static methods to set some of the layout
constraints set H grow set be grim and
the reason for that normally you think
well wouldn't I just have a method on
the layout to set those right why do we
have to do a call a static method pass
in the layout then pass in the
constraint and the reason for that is
because if you wanted to have arbitrary
constraints for user-defined layouts you
know then you need a way that people can
set create new layouts new constraints
for their own layout and so using static
methods like this lets people to find
whatever sort of constraint they have
besides just H grow vigra
some of the ones which are commonly is
but part of the reason for that is it's
you know you can't add methods to
classes in Java all right but you
handing movie but you can't in groovy so
in groovy effects you can see the same
thing but you're actually defining for
example the padding and the spacing as
properties of the layout yeah and they
can do that because you need to simply
annotate stuff you can add additional
methods and stuff to your layouts which
is pretty cool and that's what it would
look like if you actually ran that
layout well actually this let's try that
one later I won't say a good one to try
awaken you web views fun all right and
then on at a larger example of a grid
pane layout and groovy effects and this
one would look like this if you ran it
and also shows the grid lines which is a
nice feature you can turn grid lines on
for debugging of here of your layout so
and groovy effects we have well
animation binding gradients layouts you
can even load F XML files that's the
what scene builder creates the visual UI
designer tables charts trees and media
yeah so really cool example if devix
where they had a video playing and it
will split up and pop swooped float
around with a video playing in each pot
yeah I me go that's pretty cool and part
of the reason that works is because the
UM the media api's are broken on to a
few different tiers you have the view
which is the visual component the player
which control starting and stopping and
then the actual media that gets loaded
off disc and so you can have one you
could have multiple media views pointing
to the same player ends file so it's
only playing one video
but then you have like all different
views being transformed and showing
different bits of the video it was very
cool all right so that's that's the
quick groovy effects overview but let's
let's do a little bit more hacking so I
was thinking this one a webview example
looks like fun something like layout
table table layout one how about this
yeah we'll do something like this up and
this is also a good time if you're
hanging out on the stream to ask
questions so feel free to ask questions
here in the chat and we will check back
after some coding
alright
first our friend IntelliJ it's the
webview is kind of cool it's one of the
new classes which was created with
javafx too and it lets you in bed full
browser content into your application so
let's do a groovy what do you test
all right now to start with we need to
import there's a groovy X and groovy X
dot javafx Ruby effects and then what is
it stage like at the stage let's let's
check out where we're going to shoot and
check start start that stage
okay so that should give us a stage and
then we can give it a width and a height
what do we want to do stage seeing how
they put the sea and they put the width
and height in the scene but they put the
title what do you want to call this mmm
whatever yeah exactly whatever review
all right so just to get started I'm
just gonna fill the scene the flu and
I'm gonna set the arbitrary with
800 and a height of 600 maybe that'll
work then we'll pop a webview and that's
some of our stuff
start stage with my
I think I know I did I think they used a
static static import oh yeah
there we go that should be better
blue okay be a big big one big blue ball
so it's very easy to create blue boxes
and curvy effects we found out all right
maybe she had a web view our big blue
box
what do you give it a URL 0
no such property I bet this is a layout
constraint my tip important anyway let's
not worry about that right now wouldn't
a static import on the old Ruby FX solve
your problem maybe maybe ok so now it's
filled with the webview you know and I
bet we have a URL property let's give us
a try
both the java web site oh you should
have a lot of the great convulsion no
URL property
or it just takes
so when you're hacking and you don't
have the API is this when you pop open
the API Doc's right love you with you
web engine whip engine location euro
okay so you got to give it an engine
okay so i think unless the docs are
outdated the dogs might be outdated too
they want us to do a web engine
like that location I was a location
wasn't it location oh you know what
let's try that stuff because I think
this is I think this is the old style
yeah let's try that because they change
the job api javafx api's at some point
you used to have to construct a web
engine object no such property location
whoever you may be they kept to this
but
great
alright so for folks on the stream I
just allowed links so try links again if
it didn't work okay so back to the web
view so we got web engine location euro
let's try exactly what has see if that
works
and if this doesn't work I'm saying the
docs are wrong and then we're going to
dig in the code and figure out what it
should be alright so here we've got an
error do call missing property no such
property SG for class okay so that's my
dad
no signature of method web engine is
applicable for argument types okay so
can't construct the web engine with a
location on it alright so I've so maybe
it just takes some strengths are
nominated and we're going to dig into
the code so if you guys want to check
out the groovy effects code they've
moved over up there they've moved all
their code over to a new repo like it's
and get up now yeah here's the new site
and you can download the code or you can
look the source repository so we're just
going to browse the source repository
online so it's downloaded and I bet
their demos online or better maintains
than the ones in the docks
and it says the answer is aha what
engine that would okay I bet this one
works
care about
have
but the
as interesting risk WV to find or it
doesn't have to be to find anywhere and
groovy and know if not just a script
all right you know we have the java page
loaded that is cool and one of the nice
things about the java web view is that
it's a full browser so you can actually
see the Java scripts working here it's
based on webkit so it'll behave very
similarly to Chrome or Safari or most
mobile web browsers and you can eat a
real look on stuff nobody likes a real
web browser yeah any real whip browser
all right and now that we found the
mother lode of demos here in the repo
let's try let's try one more it looks
good how about a table view demo that's
pretty cool it's not too much good let's
try it not the whole thing so this is
this is some nice code written by Dean
thanks thanks Dean for the great sample
Dean Iverson is one of the co-authors on
a pro javafx book together with Jim
Beaver who's always hanging on the
street and help supporting us
let's do a table test
in court looks good yeah anything is
running
that nice and nice looking to me and i
wish i had groovy effects when i was
doing swing devos and the java javafx
tables you can even drag and drop the
columns to reorder them which is pretty
cool that is cool and then the sorting
comes for free as well although you can
you can change the implementation if you
want you server-side surgery cool and
that's not much code for doing it so
this is the view code setting up the
columns looks like they're editable too
oh yeah they are wow wow and then you
should probably change it to me
otherwise you might mad so order how old
are you we have to we have to make sure
this is accurately updated he looks 29-9
2914 I will give you the benefit of the
doubt you'll pretty young it's fashion
week cool nice alright so I got to go
home and take a look on it yeah so you
guys have any questions about groovy
effects and same thing for folks on the
chat
yeah yeah holistic paint on between what
the lab is using the swing I guess the
question is what it uses to paint to
paint on the screen I'm just repeating
because you're liked so what groovy
effects what javafx uses for painting on
the screen is it actually takes
advantage of the prison pipeline which
is a new pipeline that uses carrboro
rendering so it'll take advantage of
your graphics card if you have 3d
graphics acceleration and it's written
from the ground up so it doesnt sit on
the old Java 2d stuff it's actually a
completely new implementation which will
give you better performance than with
swinging and other previous applications
is that running on both windows and mac
and linux yeah on Windows it will use
direct3d and mac and linux it uses
opengl as the layer it sits on top of
nice and then if you don't have graphics
hardware which it can use to accelerate
it will fall back on java 2d so well
when they come up dialogue costs i can
do you find we let me native over that
okay so question was of a file dialog
since whether those are native or not so
I I think the answer to that they were
there actually missing for a while but I
think you can you can access the swing
file dialog and then it's it's kind of
the funky not quite native dialogues and
then on windows and Ju system it can use
the native dialer as far as i remember i
100% sure them yeah i think it was a
long time example user was not since
i've used this week so i might be wrong
yeah so feel free to correct me on this
gel if you're on the stream but I
remember that being not quite native
alright so for folks who are interested
to find out more about groovy effects so
the the question there was a question
about file chooser dialogues in and in
javafx Jim and I forget what the current
state of them is I know for a while they
were missing and I don't know if they
actually got patched and editor we're
still recommending folks borrow the
swing file chooser dialogues jim was
asking that on the on the chat all right
so if you I see more by crew defects you
can check out the groovy effects website
groovy effects don't work grief xorg and
a nice little website excellent yeah
yeah they did a pretty good job and I
think that concludes our perfect session
anything else you want to add sorry
another the moment yeah one thing the
conference dates might be important so
when one is great cop recon EU
it's in May 22nd to 24 and the call
prepares a couple days which is still
open for another 15 days so if you have
any groovy effects stuff you want to
submit and now is the time to do it it's
good we need to have you got any gravy
effects submissions yet and I don't
remember let me just do a quick can
check yeah but if you if you haven't
submitted yet please take advantage of
that go to our homepage alright cool so
what we're going to do on the stream is
we're going to let the stream continue
to run but we're going to take a short
break in the recording i'm going to i'm
going to skip recordings so we can swap
and get winter up here to do to do his
bit and if you're curious about the the
answer to saurons question about
submissions for groovy effects will also
answer that on the second half the
stream so thanks for watching and we'll
be back on in just a minute with one
