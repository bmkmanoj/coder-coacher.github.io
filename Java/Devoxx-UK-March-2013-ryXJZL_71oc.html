Network and I'm here today at devoxx
talking to Ben Evans and Martin Weber
welcome thank you so we've just
announced a new day Vox London so yes
absolutely
can you tell us about it what is it okay
so is we're gonna bring the the devil
expound of the devil energy and the
network's family to London that's
basically it's the same style the same
the same energy the same by developers
for developers that we see in Antwerp
and also of course in in Paris
only now staged in the wonderful city of
London wonderful so when is the event
it's going to be the 26th on the 27th of
March 2013 which is actually the same
week as DevOps Paris so the idea behind
that is that it enables speakers and and
sponsors to to have a very easy way to
share speakers between the two events so
that we're able to have very big known
speakers hopefully fingers crossed come
to come to London and then just get the
train to Paris and they can kind of do
both conferences in the one week and
it's a very efficient way of doing it so
how did you think about this I mean why
why are you having this conference why
okay so I think we would probably
started with them with us teasing Stefan
about a year ago two years ago two years
ago at the NOx party and we were just
like oh well you know you should come
and you should come to London and it'd
be much better and most of it and
apparently he took us rather more
seriously than we might have thought and
weeks ago we got a phone call from
Stefan and just completely out of the
blue I'm sitting in our office because
my time I want to start up together and
sit next to each other so so there we
are and my my skype goes off and it's
Stefan I'm like that's funny
wonder what's up picked up my headset
and he's like so if I tell you something
in complete confidence will you keep a
secret
yes of course and I thought we were
gonna get the keynote yeah I was like he
see our someone's pulled out we were
gonna need you to step up forever no
Solomon no instead of which it was we
think we are actually in a position to
to expand to to to London and I would
like you guys to just be at it so it was
a great honor and very very pleased to
cedar box in London and it's kind of a
strange thing that maybe people don't
know too much about how the the where
people come from when they come to to
Devil's Belgium we do have quite a few
attendees from the UK but not as many as
people might think so I think it's a way
of trying to take some of the pressure
off the main event I mean the kanopolis
venue here and Antwerp is is a great
venue but you know that there's no
denying that we're at capacity and that
there's really no where else that's
obvious that would be as good a venue
would that would be larger and I also
think a lot of the feel and a lot of the
things which make devil's a box if there
were twice as many people here you would
just never find any or friends it would
be you know hard to get around I think
that the logistical problems would
escalate so if we can't get to a bigger
venue well we'll just have to distribute
it's like any any solution if you can't
scale vertically you square horizontally
and you split it up you hat you have a
distributed device so so that's kind of
what we're hoping to do it with a fork
android framework and action conference
absolutely so we'll be able to have a
little local flavor but still very much
the the underlying spirit and the the
unifying community energy which is just
the most important thing about about
dogs and the devil's family I was I was
thinking traditional English ales and
the ploughman's lunch well we can't have
Belgian beer obviously so why is that
why are the the British actually not
coming here I mean well you why do you
think we need really like an event or
more another event in London hmm it's a
good question and partly I think it's
it's because any straight and economic
times a lot of people are not willing to
pay for you know for the travel and the
accommodation which is obviously to
Toronto represents but whereas you know
let's not forget London has between
fifty and a hundred thousand developers
and and yeah they're overwhelmingly
pretty much Java so that's a huge number
of people who are working in and around
London for whom you know okay so maybe
their employer can't afford to pay for
them to come to our trip and and but
they can probably afford a couple of
days and a two day ticket
we're basically we're trying to price
things we've squeezed the costs and
really bringing every last drop out the
costs that we can to keep the prices
down
want to put this conference within reach
of ordinary developers so even if their
employer can't afford to pay for them to
go that it's not an outrageous amount of
money then it sits within the reach of
the ordinary developers you know
spending money in budgets
we're pricing it out about roughly about
a third of the other major conferences
that go on in London so and we again it
submits the by developers for developers
that's there that's absolutely critical
the heart of what we do so so compared
to a commercial conference we really
have you know try to bring all the all
the costs out so we can we can get as
many people who want to come as possible
and we're hoping for well of a new class
t-tops are around about a thousand
people we would certainly like to - well
we'd like to beat the French because the
French obviously sold out six weeks
before Paris and they first go around
and if we can do that you know even
better than that that would be fantastic
always a common rivalry of the French
absolutely yeah we anybody so say yeah
so the court papers and registration
will open at exactly the same time as
France so the first of December we're
forming the content committee we've
secured a fantastic venue which is in
Islington a really nice bottle London
just one stop from the from the Eurostar
so if people who are Anglophone
developers who are living in France and
you know maybe maybe they should come to
to London instead of Paris and I guess
the other key thing is that like
deadlocks and Belgium and idea Vox
France this is very strongly backed by
the community in London so Finn and I
helped run the London Java community
right which is about three three and a
half thousand active Java developers and
we hold multiple events per week it's a
really active passionate community and
we certainly know will have their
support and their their encouragement to
to have devoxx in London and it's going
to be a really exciting time because
that they haven't really had a marquee
conference to go to before in London
that's it's been affordable in and by
the community for developers so we're
we're really really excited to bring
this across
great from so you're not worried about
being like having a venue that isn't too
small
well we did think about that but we've
you know we really realistically you
know it's got to be the right venue you
know I mean we've all been to
conferences where you're just basically
in a hotel or some other place and it's
just really like a big shed you know and
it's not it doesn't feel like a proper
conference and you know I know I keep I
keep saying this but the the community
energy is just so important it really
has has got to feel like the right place
tell always it's building isn't it
absolutely it's it's it's an old oak
cultural hall which has been repurposed
as a specialist conference and business
center but it has you know so lots of
stained glass and lots of natural light
and old Victorian you know wrought iron
beams and stuff so it's actually you
know a really a really good space and
and what the first time I saw the venue
I was just like yeah this is the space
were so new straightaway okay so call
for papers is in what two weeks yep
December ok and the dates again is the
26th and 27th of March 2013 the website
we are DevOps doctor at UK is live and
up and running yeah
and as we as we move towards the thing
that's going to be more and more content
there we've already had some some great
feedback from her from a number of
companies about about people who want to
come and sponsor and partner with us so
I mean I think there's there's a lot of
excitement everyone we spoke to here is
really excited our sponsors and partner
companies are incredibly excited as well
you know we can't wait but we're
obviously incredibly excited yeah this
is going to be fantastic and it's just
it's strange to think that it's only
well just over three months out now four
months but we've got a very focused team
we're bringing him to people who have
helped run DevOps Belgium and devoxx
France to help us on the steering
committee so that continuation is going
to go through awfully stiff arms gonna
be heavily involved yeah well so you
know we've got a great team behind us
and we're absolutely looking forward to
yeah and you already have Oracle as a
sponsor I really have Oracle's of
platinum sponsor which is absolutely
fantastic that nook amendment to the to
the devil's community as a whole has
been has been great you know so they
really have gone above me on to Salem
and beyond that as well so for us as a
London Drive user group we have a great
relationship with Oracle and they've
always pulled out the stops to assist us
wherever they can and yeah we've really
enjoyed that relationship and it's great
to take that forward to a conference as
well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
