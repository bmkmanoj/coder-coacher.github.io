goes where um we need to put this into
our chat yeah just go to a night hacking
right hecky naw naw nee yeah we need to
yeah we need people to fall ah hacking
should Steve Steve on Java all right you
want we have no idea what we are going
to talk about some well yeah as usual
yeah we will win it for you I was
yesterday night yeah I've been there
just you know for a couple minutes now I
skipped it yeah we we we have this very
light sessions party people sit in their
corners and drink alright so when line
okay so I am it was very nice I I really
like the same island I saw him at the
geek out last year this year and it was
amazing like the number most images yep
let's go there yes seriously yeah you
can see us yes I sawdust yeah did the
one ball the i won nice guys
that was creepy that was algorithm he's
always creepy I know I know so what's
the add / yeah yeah and it should
complete this work oh no the other way
around / at swimming no no add / yeah
add / oh that's for sure oh so it's even
worse than the Android wanna yeah right
is it too quiet I can hear myself from
the speakers let's try to run by level
it's good all right you and the rest of
the world when Weeden watch every nine
thousand thousand thousand people from
internets okay so we I think we can you
rate the people in integer internet hi
people in the internet and we're gonna
go life yes we ladylike will ready light
record that yes that was worried show
yeah let's record it to the show now
remember your line in english now good
evening good morning and all that okay
so we'll try volts right but you do the
you the host here right or we do it like
it's your line all right you know take
it from you hello with welcome from
javaone 2016 from San Francisco
California going to your life is jboro
hmm and the Musa Victor hey that wasn't
your line yeah my line was good running
okay seriously don't begin w h of the
brutal double anoche it wasn't Russian
meaning a debris meaning them yeah
meaning double okay it's a good morning
good evening good night a good day good
afternoon wherever you are because the
people over the internet and we
streaming live or maybe some people
watching us recording I don't know what
you would do this but actually like lots
of people watching in your in recording
and yeah anyhow that was a really
screwed-up opening that's fine that's
fine that's all right maybe some people
me did wake up yet after yesterday the
one of the hottest events of the Java
one is the party one catch your pokemons
and stuff too many pokemon suppose
yesterday but yeah today we're going to
do like talk about let real stuff you're
serious data and there are three things
that are hot in this season yes semi on
nitrous your biker services devops and
safe are only on the other parties so if
you if you wanna a want to see the semi
on you probably can see him next at the
joker but today we're going to talk
about DevOps and micro services all
right so I'm gonna represent
microservices bar we can represent
DevOps I don't know how can you separate
those two between two people because
they are very very much connected yeah
okay and and one of the common things
between micro services and DevOps is
that no one have any idea what they are
and can define them many people has
their own definition based on their
understanding or based on their use case
on the best based on the way how they do
these things right these microservices
things or DevOps things so what is micro
service so microservice is the in
essence it's just a architectural style
of an organizational style of building
software building teams and delivering
software i guess so i mean that means
that i need to write small classes no
not necessarily the microservices mean
that you actually need to build smaller
sub systems with isolated functionality
and you know that that particular sub
system needs to be responsible one one
particular thing so yeah so I think
there are two major concerns here first
is the release procedure has to do with
DevOps that we are going to talk in a
second and the second is the
interoperability between those modules
right when you em when in Atimonan is
it's very simple their own the same all
the classes all the functionalities in
the same class path you just call
methods and you're all fine you have
some dependence management probably
spring and you just inject modules one
into another and
everything looks great now with
microservices stop checking your phone
every couple seconds no I'm just
checking the hour of bowl media positive
feedback yes to see how people are
enjoying that yes people are enjoying
this okay good now stop doing that so
it's alive its alive this is what would
you do it's a live show all right all
right but my question is in when the
microservices architecture is applied
and you have those microservices
deployed they are deployed as isolated
applications yep and they need to
interrupt with each other a somehow yes
and I guess swap with xml-rpc will be
there well do do the thing absolutely
well yes no I know okay good now because
you were too sis yeah it's a sarcasm so
you'll get your throne so chat sarcasm
me and I'm playing along so this why I'm
Alex but thank you for this
clarification sarcasm yeah good we have
this that we need to have this yeah so
I'm how to do it how we do it right how
can we make this inter communication
between the modules in the micro
services world easier so one of the
patterns is to implement the concept of
events tour so microservices they
essentially isolated from each other
however that might be very common the
backbone system that will just you know
the one system can publish message and
another system that would be interested
in this particular mission would sit in
there and subscribing for these events
so in this case the this backbone system
like or you know I don't want to call it
like a message bus because in this case
people star recalling like Enterprise
message buses from from soap and stuff
yeah but many other like a solutions
that people use for for that for that
use case and another option is like a
direct call so some of the system will
expose some certain api's or they can
expose the way how the other system can
discover a space be up this api's and a
very natural i guess and the de facto
standard these days is used like
stateless protocol like HTTP plus rest
so the CP used as a transport dress uses
a way to describe the API describe the
results and the way how they like
publish is they can use like hypermedia
to to to explain or like to allow to
clients discover the what services and
what they do like what they provide well
my problem with using rest resting pies
and HTTP as a protocol is that HTTP is
by definition a text protocol yes and
when we are talking about modules that
need to interrupt with their internal
messaging in using a binary protocol
have advantages over a text one yes
right that the text here is really an
overkill that you don't necessarily need
yeah so the question is is it a more
efficient way to make this inter inter
communication between different modules
more efficient by using binary protocols
instead of using JSON and other tax
representations I guess if I wearing
this t-shirt I need to plug something
from from hazel cast so the way how we
doing this our like the if our clients
takes employ the hazel cast as the
backbone of communication into their
system they use crystal case clients
that each and every client implements
it'll cast open binary protocol and the
payload is binary and we provide
different ways how they can sterilize
their payload also we also provide the
ways how the in in one of the
serialization format that we support
those who support versioning of messages
so yeah the binary protocol all those
features they are probably supported in
the Jason serializers and generally a
Jason solutions for interoperability as
well right now if I take some some am
Jason a point ends on both sides they
can do the same thing conversion yeah
they can serialize etc etc but it
doesn't show your problem with texas TX
4 here we go so we get the same level of
support for transparent serialization
and cumin
creation yeah but we benefit from the
fact that we step one level closer to
the machine and instead of sending text
around to represent binary data we
actually send binary data itself that
makes it more if you have that
represents actual objects or for domain
right so serialization into text it
doesn't make much sense when all we need
is passing objects around and then we
can use tools like hazel cast to
actually go and do it in the right
representation channel which is a binary
representation why do you think about
the what do we think about the concept
not so rest essentially it's because
it's based on the document format and
document format because it's HTTP it she
pees the hypertext Transfer Protocol and
every resource is sort of like a
document but what do you think about
like employing the RPC style of
communication between services so
instead of just you know doing the like
resource style for accessing data do
like our PC style like the things what
like the Apache thrift or Google grp see
thing so what do you think about this
one yes and that's that's exactly the
same the advantage of using those on top
of HTTP is that they provide a binary
representation and actually use the
right thing for the job isn't the right
tool for the job and not abusing those a
text protocols to to work as binary
serialization channels okay but in this
case we sort of losing the we're losing
the isolation so the the providers of
the service they need to publish the
disk in the schema they need to publish
their like the client libraries so the
other consumers can like SDK type of
approach so in this case we're losing
isolation and well I don't think I don't
think we have any isolation in any way
there is no generic tool that can parse
unknown schema and do something
meaningful with it because the business
at least we have a semantic when we have
a published client or published SDK so
at least we have a semantic oh
model we have this semantic anyhow that
the question is where are these
knowledge resides yeah right when we are
talking about structures protocols we
have this structure describing what we
pass and when we send just generic JSON
files across the wire we still have
these knowledge to recite somewhere yeah
because there is a business logic that
need to refer to certain fields yeah
poor Jason yes or someone knows the
protocol yeah and if you break it in the
other side maybe the parser will cope
with the change on the other side where
business logic want cup with the change
in any way so when we change it change
need be made yeah right and having this
schema make actually fail faster on the
changes yeah right because you want this
government in the run time you discover
it right when you bundle those protocols
together yeah and so I would say that in
some in some way having schema full
communication channel is more about them
caring families which brings us back to
soap and XML where we have a scheme is
that much all right so yeah let's let's
shift this like discussion a little bit
into the from the like technology and
communication more into the people
approach so now oh yes like systems
doesn't system doesn't build system so
people build systems and as you know the
technologies are perfect and people yeah
exactly so the thing is for many people
say that big microservices concept you
cannot just bring it to every
organization so it's it's not only
architectural style for building
software but it's also organizational
style that resides in the company so you
have a multiple um I'm gonna say
isolated but they are how school like a
self-sufficient teams that they work in
on the piece of functionality piece of
of the other huge system and they also
like working together with other systems
you need to communicate and need to
communicate I need to deliver the
software they need to install software
that brings us to you know DevOps I is
it is it like a person is it
what yeah yes so so you're completely
right a micro services approach
complicates delivery a lot yes right
that's the problem instead of having one
pro one product with a very clear a
release procedure when it is released
how it is released like a bitch and what
is the what is the versioning how you
test it how u q8 and that's not very
clear now we have a whole mess of tiny
product than have their own approaches
to a QA to testing there are different
languages may be different language
different stacks different release
procedures different release dates
different versioning schemes they are
just as switching from one product
company too many products many very
different products company and that
requires a cultural change and this is
exactly DevOps so DevOps is not a person
there is not a position DevOps is not a
set of tools DevOps is a culture DevOps
is the behavioral style when we are
talking to you similar to microservices
that's why a micro services and DevOps
and Sam are on all come together exactly
right yeah it's a way of life at style
yeah exactly into dance for when when
someone is coding so yes this is a and
then that's a cultural thing and it
means that if you want to streamline the
release and you have to streamline the
release with to provide microservices
you need to a behave differently I do
not have this process of a sealer
develop similar development testing and
operations and just throw the piece of
software running you down as we are from
from one so it needs to be a child yes
Franco truly yeah that's another fancy
name for our job and it means that
everybody need to work together which
essentially means everybody need to be
able to do everything okay right what is
what is the what is the common what's
the common like a pattern for DevOps
delivering software in the
Microsoft's world these days like I know
you guys doing lots of like a DevOps
these days you're that's that's an
ecology wise I i I'm not sure there is
an answer for something common okay so
we have wings how many how many we have
like in 15-20 minutes for the session
you spent three hours last week yes
exactly right Lena DevOps to fellow
developers in Boston we went to a Java
user group in Moscow we had like almost
300 people who came to learn what DevOps
alien you still fail to explain after 3
hours and some of the people got it ok
that's good that's good at least some of
them ok so can you like give like a
executed summary of the things that you
know you and Korea what but you are
delivered we can talk about the concepts
know each other so no changes every
three months there is a new shiny
framework that claims to support this
culture of Devil's better ok and and the
fact that it's fast moving actually
brings us battle tools it's a good thing
it's not it's not stagnate it's not even
a standardized or anything there are
tons of different things and you can
choose what feels right but the concepts
are there ok so one of the concept is
everybody should do DevOps that means
that em everybody should know software
and that means that the hardware should
become software so in this case you need
to fire admins and teach your developers
to do admin tasks we need to teach
everybody how to treat hardware as
software ok it's a learning curve for
everybody because the developers need to
understand how hard works and the admins
need to learn how to write code oh it's
it's an effort that comes from both ways
I would generally agree with your
assumption that it's easier for the
developers to code hardware than for
admins to code hardware yeah suffer
because yeah in personal code right and
because generally the developers it's
cold it's cold right so it's different
a little bit it might be different
language yes I beat some different
structures yeah but but generally a lot
of Ruby by the way yeah but but it's
called anyhow when the sysadmin guys we
used to play with actual hardware now
need to learn something completely
different yeah i'll show how to
provision in the cloud how he
provisionally using like these different
tools to I don't know if that's enough
to just fire them even before they try
no no no of course not it was like very
loud statements and I guess like Oh
admins gonna you know find me and try to
kill me and they will do it huge bald
Russian guys that can actually take on
you if there are three together yeah
they have a chance they have a chance
only if they were there like a five
years old sweater right so what it's
yeah I want so so what I mean yeah it's
it's it's a big change for everybody and
probably for the elements more a bigger
than for a firm okay so now we have this
concept everything is a code right so
everything is a code what next so now we
have the train train of the the admins
that understand what the developers
doing like in terms of software holidays
you how they you know writing this like
interaction between the the systems etc
so what's next so now next step will be
automation okay now automation is is
another pillar for a successful DevOps /
procedures because when we are talking
about microservices that means that we
always release a hard software and I
spoke about it in my both we talked
about liquid software yeah you can
actually talk about this little bit
because not everyone joined out
yesterday it was like a huge success
like yeah it was back to room and all
right I actually like very was I was
very surprised that many people come to
this ball like at the ATM p.m. yeah it
was in research RT going on yeah and we
have like full room yeah we had like
four people yeah that was crazy on stage
three of them were on the stage no no no
no no we have foreign their names and
free on stage yes speakers were actually
outnumbered by the audience which is
like completely
yeah so in one of the topics yes
obviously is howdy how we're going to
deliver software in the future yeah and
one of the concept that we in Jeff Roe
believe is this concept of the liquid
software and and what we actually mean
by that is that the software is being
released and delivered constantly there
are no more release trains as we know it
when we have this process of having
versions that people can refer to so you
had instead the features are delivered
as they developed during the through
these DevOps priceline sugar to micro
services are you saying that okay so
eventually java 9 will be hit not to
java java next well with modules will
flow into our system right and you if
they will follow likely any new blog
post about strains from mark no brains
know that there will be of course
deadlines for features but they want we
won't need to wait now for java 9 to get
released to get something which is
perfectly works today yeah because now
let's say the jigsaw is the bottleneck
for java nine but the other features we
could use yes we can't because there is
this rigid thing of version that
everything is released together yeah and
what we envision is no more okay so
let's let's like bring this like idea
into the micro services how it will work
in organization that employ the micro
service at the pattern of building the
systems and they employ this DevOps
culture with the concept of the liquid
software I think it works very nicely
because it means that those pieces of
your big software which are different
modules will be constantly updated to
provide more functionality and the one
that depends on them will learn about
this functionality when it
have when he when it receives its
counterpart oh great yeah so it's like
I'm learning a new language and I'm
ready to speak in this new language with
you in a second you are ready okay and
that may be the other way around right
we need to be able to adjust to a
constant change in each other when we
integrate I understand okay so I
understand this idea of living software
and I understand this concept of DevOps
democracy but what about scalability so
now we're talking about features
delivered and features what about the
you know how we can resist like growing
audience so away we design these micro
services like like you guys did with the
bin tray and now like people start using
you train more and more so how we going
to solve the solve the problem of
scalability in microservice what one of
the reasons we believe that we had to
design in bin tray in the way we
designed in the a in microservices is
scalability one of the biggest
advantages of having finality separated
into different functional units is the
fact that across our application
different part have different
non-functional scalability requirement
okay so for example in bin tray we have
the Download Center at the download a
server which have to stand in huge
constantly stand a huge load especially
when the Chinese hackers try to oh no
just because I try to upload something
or don't what something from this no but
generally even when very popular a
packages like spring is distributed from
ben tre bindry stands a huge load yeah
okay it's the biggest repository of Java
components in the world majorly it sends
you a huge loss yes so the download
center should have should be able to be
crazy scalable and relatively simple yes
other parts of the application have
different requirements they may have
more evolved functionality but
let's of scalability requirements and
let's say the the starter logs yeah they
have an end business insights they have
a relatively complicated logic of how to
tether mine who downloaded your software
okay was it a robot was it a person
we're also you right except sort of like
a jobs overnight which organizations
they came from and and this service it's
not even real time it says like five
minutes delay yeah you will get logs
live logs that will actually be a five
minutes ago it's a badge because because
we need to put because there is time to
process it yes right Serena and that's a
completely different environment from a
computing point of view from scalability
point of view etc right so it's a
different it's a different story they
trying to cuddle on come on that's
already took over the station yeah so
what are the things that means that we
can develop different modules as
microservices with different
requirements in mind and then we can
have five a hundred servers of the
download service in micro service and
fifty of the statistics and logs yep and
and this is all elastic and goes back
and forth shrinking and expanding on
demand but only the piece that needs to
be shrink or expand it yeah based on the
based on the load so one of the things
that the we recently actually like learn
from many our customers that hazel cast
actually help them scale the micro
services because ability if to embed the
library into their product that allows
them to you know scaled a product
without thinking about the the oldest
like underlying thing so they can you
know if they need to like bring more
instances of their machine and they this
instances can you know for example
there's a one of the consumers of the
hizzle cast that use this to talk in
other instances about new artifacts and
stuff so yeah in this case the this is
like very interesting choice in terms of
you know external technology terms of
scalability and
you know place very well in in this like
a micro services architecture and yeah
because it's embedded so you don't need
to actually maintain separate
infrastructure so it's going to be also
like a part of the build part of the
automation part and this you know
shrinking or expanding and shrinking
it's a part of of the tools that you
know also can be automated based on the
Lord's exactly that's exactly the best
and the complicated part about those
builds about those pipelines that your
liquid software is going through is
actually knowing what's going on yes
because if we don't have versions it
doesn't mean that we have less aim of
the ability for additional informational
pieces it means that we have more
something is being constantly releases
yes and of course what we need is much
more metadata about what we have each
and every a part of this microservices
world is a different piece of software
that we need to know exactly how it was
built where it came from how to trace it
back to the source okay so that brings
us to another topic that we discussed
yesterday but I guess this is a whole
new story that we're going to talk or no
unfortunately with a recording from
yesterday talk because we have like a
very nice ideas that will flow around
but i think it's it's time to wrap up so
we can make it to our podcast man
yelling we can't because but in our
podcast we don't have any limits but
here in the conference of the time we
let's try to cut us out yeah so just to
be said our normal podcast recording is
two and a half two and a half hours by
flowers it's right over in average yeah
and what is going on here we're under
half an hour and they kept us off I
think it's outrageous but what we can do
yes I once again I remind you that that
was a box of the Gorske from j-roc and
Victor gone from hazel cast and we came
to you live from Java one night hacking
stay tuned for other speakers of us
again they're frozen twitter follow us
on twitter jai guru Edgar Musa season
but I server by
and we are all recording and now we can
start the post the poor posture okay so
let's see let's read like a tweet yeah
let's check let's check how popular we
are yeah let's let's okay so let's see
our chat so the people saying oh a nice
haircut thanks thanks very thank you
very much okay translation youtube
streaming blah blah blah okay okay yeah
okay people okay people watched um right
shaking how bubble aware oh yeah Jordan
yeah bunch of tweets yet so stay tuned
before who's gonna be next we do we need
to announce next speaker oh wow super
nice don't know if we even have like
Yolanda said that the schedule is
completely screwed so she not argue the
next interview no we're just watching us
we have an audience yeah thank you all
right should we say something smart
people are actually expecting us to say
something smart I don't know like will
they will reset everything that this
month at least we need to like it'll
charge for a couple more minutes to say
some smart so that's why we need to
cracking jokes I don't know like I was
wondering like x-ray will jokes no image
anyone actually watching old Java jokes
about Duke there are any jokes about you
java jokes hmm I don't know took your
engineers how many how many how many
java developers can you change libel do
you know this you know so essentially
zero because it's a hardware problem
yeah but now with dev ops you cannot say
that anymore why because it's a it's not
a horror you can automate it is not to
wait it out and you cannot blame the
hardware guys now for if something
doesn't work how do you need to be able
to take it by yourself I oh gee here you
go are you glad embed JVM in every light
bulb and it will replace it up very
cylinder we want to give this up I wish
that you need to stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
