devoxx for no hacking i have some
special guests back with me and also a
prob pisa yeah people been wondering
whether actually rode around your own a
motorcycle but i think should i bother
waking up bicycle to say you don't know
how can you walk on guys yeah exactly no
I didn't work hard i just i sat in a
little a little chair yeah and it
cruised around push though yes I listen
to you guys so Daniel Bernard yes and
Stefan but if anybody if I doubt and you
guys both work on sale on yeah what I
welcome you gotta watch stuff it really
works on Salem's yeah really cool for
those of you who are joining us for the
first time the wave night hacking works
is you go two nite hacking calm is the
website for the show you can tweet with
us on a live stream we have the chat up
here so we can interact with folks who
are watching on the live stream and also
the recordings are available afterwards
on ustream job youtube channel and also
highlights good okay so tell us tell us
a little bit about sale on its so I know
I know I know it's a JVM language yeah
it's a JVM language okay so yeah guys
have to share I'm close to that
literally the IT guy for said on so I
have boots from the project talk with
Gavin which
the founder of the project but I have
built their website make sure they have
a proper get up setting and so on so is
Erica session man for say you know
whatever works it pays the bill so it's
a deal on her to Stef we actually walks
on seven full-time so yeah I work on
salon which is a new programming
language for the JVM and also for
JavaScript we have a modern programming
language that we're in the final stages
of writing were a couple months away
from version one who can go to sell em
back nine org and yeah you see the the
nice website ideal actually oh that's
good work there be honest you didn't do
this tiling anyway carry on so so yeah
one of the goals of salon is to make a
new programming language that is both
modern and also readable and
maintainable and predictable but more
than a language it's also a complete
platform with a new type system and you
SDK the tools that go with it like night
for the module system and
the ability to compile both to on the
JVM JavaScript so you can actually go to
try the salon langa torg you can start
hacking a salon code that will be
executed on your browser so it's an easy
way to try it if you go on the salon
lying the touareg website you will see
code samples that you can then go and
run on the on the web interface so I
manuals can see you guys I think I've
heard you guys mentioned multiple times
that it runs on Java and JavaScript how
hard was it to get it to work on it
across both languages cleanly actually
the the fun thing is that it's it's hard
to compile anything to the JVM right
yeah it's practically trivial to compile
to JavaScript right because it's indict
so basically whatever type system that
you have that is not compatible with
Java and you can you know it's hard to
make it fit in Java but it's on the JVM
but it's trivial to make it fit on
JavaScript or you actually about like
libraries like getting the same Java
libraries or things or on JavaScript
it's just a language and you use
JavaScript libraries underneath right so
so that's one of the reasons why we have
it is decay as well which is that you
can then suddenly if you use the sonomas
decay you get it compels you get
versions implemented for both the JVM
unfortunate script okay I'm watching you
typing and I noticed you did a string
question I think I know it that's for
but why don't you describe for the
benefit of a grade when I just right
carly sam i'm just an IT guy all right
so here we can see a couple of things on
what he's typing the first one of which
is this thing called value which is a
keyword which says essentially i'm not
going to type the type name the compiler
is going to infer it from me so the
compiler will look at the rights I am
saying right type efforts yes its type
inference yeah so so it's statically
typed it's not dynamic it's not a
dynamic language but the compiler is
able to look at the right side and say
it's a string so the type of name is the
string then we can see another thing
called the question mark after the
string it it's because in salon whenever
you see something of type string then
whenever you see something of type
string over it most people that I
strengthen us but int type string it
means that it can contain only a string
it can't contain oh so whenever you want
to retain underneath whenever you want
to declare a type that can contain
either a name or nil then you need to
put a question mark at the end which is
I guess inside and so on am I saying it
right so long so long we've heard from
many that were supposed to pronounce it
single reason it's not Cylon and you
guys should say hi to Julian poem he's
like doing I interviewed him and he
wants his t-shirt he's still waiting for
so long t-shirt yeah they review of
those at the moment it's easy to walk
out I think I think the way it goes is
if anybody asks publicly on the stream
for a t-shirt then they'll probably wear
it enough work will pay itself off so
those people probably deserve a t-shirt
and then for the rest of the people who
who don't you should be watching online
and asking for t-shirts at the
appropriate times ok so on your
missioning it sounds like the types are
no is not allowable to type by default
you have to explicitly say that this
thing can take null values is that to
get rid of common programming errors or
see it's it's it's to get rid of new
pointer exceptions in particular because
those are a very special data exception
we just wanted to catch because what
happens usually is that you get a value
from somewhere u-store-it you pass it
around and you you know you keep track
of where it came from and then when you
try to access it that's that's where you
get your stack trace it's too late to
find where it came from because you know
the sack trace isn't helping so Neil
safety means that we can get rid of that
by making sure that whenever you have
something you know that string it can't
be new you know so how do you how do you
deal with existing Java libraries that
take know just by default the signatures
all have question marks from Ceylon and
so it's a good question we have fully
interoperability with Java so you just
import because we have a module system
in salon you would if you want to use
the JDK for instance you have to import
the chick so modulate so which I've
added bass or Java dot whatever other
modules they have in 60
I'm pretty sure we're probably the first
implementation of chick so it's not
really an implementation of chicks it
but we're using the package grouping
that they are the cottages so it's kind
of conceptually aligned with we're
chicks right all right its current
jigsaw implementation is it i guess the
goal would be once what is it reason to
be in the JJ you guys just sure fit
right on top of it which was that's mark
mark ryan home will be very happy all
right we're not waiting for them so we
have we use Geo's module on the name to
be though all the other isolation okay
very nice so whenever you deal with
interrupt when you when you have when
you call java methods because Java
doesn't have this distinction between
something that can or not be nil then we
consider that the parameters if they're
not primitives then they can accept Neil
values okay and whatever it returns we
consider that it's not new but if you
want to check for it then you can you
know you check that it's me a lot and if
you don't check for it and you try to
assign something that comes from Java to
a variable of type string it's alone
which cannot be helped then we insert
mill check at the frontier where it
passes from Java to salon which means
that you know the exception that would
occur because Java is unsafe regarding
mill it occurs at a place where you can
catch it and it's meaningful all right
so Jillian had a question on a stream so
he was he was wondering about the string
concatenation syntax which it looks like
it's spaces you're just identifies next
to each other all right so the string
interpolation syntax is whenever you
have something that starts with a string
literal and ends with string literal
then you can you can put any expression
in between and they're automatically
converted to strings okay so that's why
he needed the core quad at the end
because it has to be in the middle
right otherwise the grammar is not
Jamaican it's gone the drawbar company
okay so Jillian was wondering why not
use something like a lot of languages
will do inside of the quotes but will
have a different escape like you know
dollar exactly right that's enough but
that means that you essentially have
mini syntax and expressions inside
strings which is almost the same as the
rest of the language but not quite and
as soon as you try to do something more
complicated if that involves dollars or
Stephanie so program is effective this
is actually more free in terms of what
you can do between shirt because there
are expressions you know there's no mini
syntax which I put on there generally
speaking we are so we keep having people
asking you know why did you do that or
that line so and you could have a look
at the the quick intro of salon just to
get the gist of it and then do a tour
which will take you probably a good half
a day if you actually find us well okay
text me off a day and anyway there's
every now and then we're like oh you
like wonder why we decided to go for you
know x instead of y and there is a heck
a fake you about the line design
decision we took some arbitrary most are
not so at least you understand where we
come from so we didn't decided that all
of the blue they were reason for most of
the time this
joint in to do this demo do you want to
do the other one or have we shown Alice
how about you show one of the cool stuff
which is union types philip has a
different type system than then Java
right we have as I mentioned it's a
platform where we have a different as UK
we have a different type system a module
system built in the language and and so
it shows that you can do you know things
that are different in so long that you
would do in Java let's start creating a
project by the way we have a guide easy
for from the walk in front of the camera
please ok thanks are you lying right now
yeah and so yes we have an eclipse ide
which you can download from the
marketplace or from the update site
which you will find oral on our website
and once you get this I even you can
create a salon projects and then we can
start creating a salon module demo
alright once you get a module then you
get it give you a couple of new files of
free become so control everything
install new files as well so we have
here a holiday after phone okay after 10
files but you get you needa pro line
series enterprises wow I got a good deal
for four loops as well and so you have
here what is essentially a function but
it's not within a class so it's at the
top level now you can have functions and
attributes at the top level in salon
this one is called run by default and we
can say hello night makers and then
try to run this this is the equivalent
of like a Java public static final main
public static void main no because this
is actually no meaning you can run any
top-level method as long as it doesn't
take any parameters ok so you we just
call it run but it's all around our you
can actually execute yes if I manage to
find the right click button on the Mac
ok today's run as one is compiling into
Java and then executing it the other one
comprising to JavaScript that we know so
jazz too nice I don't have no json my
machines so we're going to going to look
for modules you know we have this module
system which all right so they the folks
online are complaining your phones are
too small how do you mind popping it up
and we have a second request for a sale
on t-shirt Russell Russell Russell
winder would like one alright well just
send anywhere to steph steph i'd i'd
sell and ashland an organ that ill did
reduction already speaking about gears
so that's a cool feature I mean that's a
cool tool I use as a developer on my
hands are cold when I develop so it's
called me ten in France in French I
don't know how it's not just as fashion
statement no that's definitely usable as
well and it said my life the last two
winters so you know how you recommend
you to use that it's I don't know five
books maybe somehow fashionable coding
gear ya know it's exactly why I should
get another one at some point yeah so we
have a modular chief from the get-go and
we also wrote a module repository that
it's kind of the flux of github for the
social aspect rubygems for the user
friendliness and ease of use and kind of
feedback you can get on the modules and
maven as in integrating in the tooling
so literally the compiler will push the
into the repo and you will be able to
download stuff from the repo and that's
where we were out right and this this
repository Explorer is able to query
remote repos by a REST API and local
repos as well and so I am able to
actually find modules that are from the
SDK that as that are defined
on our module repo online and now I can
go to the module descriptor which
contains the name of the module and the
diversion and then I can add an import
of fisting and I'm also going to import
salons on zoopla yeah json so you can
see we have completion which also you
know queries remote because dynamically
yes and so now I can start doing some
things oh we don't have internet you do
we have yeah we gotta get into the
turret so let's try to parse the string
as a URI here to pass your variety it's
a top-level method again from from jason
i'm going to import it of the net back
from Ned package so much how much
internal adoption do you guys have a J
Vasa of Ceylon that's the funny thing we
actually are pretty good at pushing this
stuff outside but no much attention to
the people inside so they know as much
as you know that's something we need to
fix actually
you know have some internal chat some
people are quite excited we like I said
it looks like I saw last year and was
still coming along but this looks pretty
ready for for real application
development it's not production ready
yeah it's pretty close it's really terms
we have just released my stone for so we
have like the feature focus my stone to
my salon 5 and after my stone five we're
gonna do the release 10 and from there
we might not have a full and complete
SDK of course but you will have like a
compiler that is working nicely and
you'll be able to use part of the SDK
and of course helpers will be a sticky
on top of cool so when I just adhere the
parse the string as a URI so the type of
this thing is a URI which I can then get
it gives me an HTTP requests which I
execute which gives me an HTTP response
here and then when i get the contents
then I get this jason from the module
repo api which gives me the list of
things but it's a string so it's a bit
boring let's try to show how we do chase
on insulin so i'm going to import object
ray and farce
so you know we can also define if you
don't like the names that we gave things
that you can say its parts Jason can add
es things when you import them
so so you guys are are getting
additional comments on the on the stream
as well flips rubygems Julian's happy
and I think we have it we have an
overwhelming majority of French Watchers
for your stream well apparently you guys
are a little popular in France Stephanie
to every CEO of 2,000 people in the
friends and talk about so yes I didn't
do the only person like you Oh full of
people very unhappy right yeah my name
is that will be careful but we are
excited so we try to combat people and
we tested it on French doing good so far
yeah so it supports other languages too
right today we have a version with only
French keywords so what I did here is I
parse the string contents as a JSON
object which is defined in salam Jason
and if and then I can pretty print it
and then I can also navigate it I can
see so you gotta you gotta request from
i believe is emmanuel in grenoble he
wants you to come and visit Grenoble
yeah I'm going to end
defensive the snow is coming this year
but Ollie yes take it at your own or are
you more of a snowboarder or skier I use
your snowboarding I for minis keys
because it's just so much easier it's so
much faster I guess I gotta give it
right I've done I've done a lot of
skiing I've done my dangerous game but
I've never tried snowboarding I've heard
like it's a couple days of pain to
switch and then it's wondering I love it
I'm a snowboarder it's good for for you
know fresh snow yeah when you stay on
the Beast trying any skates because
that's a larger a lot more fun and
guidance I see no don't stop
snowboarding good now i see doesn't work
but mini skis you can break a nice you
know like a like and like nothing you
actually almost died once that's when i
switched will say that story for the
next time we do you hide acting so the
beyond the captain okay we should get
json object and i can access what's in
Jason and if you know what what adjacent
type is don't have internet yeah we have
internet so let's break this up with
facts
Safari so I tonight search here since
version listen price so in Jason at the
top level you have an object which is
essentially a map of rocky value right
the key has to be string and the value
has to be straying number object array
true/false milk can be you know dates
for instance when I'm one of that about
right and this is something that you
can't really expressing in Java because
in Java the comments of the type of each
of those is channeling object so you use
a lot of information you know because
might have enough such as an object with
us either so then you need to be
implement your boolean your integer yeah
that's my fav data types so what we do
here in salon is that we have something
to show this later on we have union
types and we're actually able within the
type system to say it's one of this that
that poor that and not one else and so
it's a lot more precise what you get so
what we do here is we access the value
pointed by the key results which could
be any of those so we need to make sure
that it is indeed the JSON array and so
that gives us the list of modules so now
we can iterate over each of those
modules again I'm not defining the type
of mod because its type inference will
tell me that it is truly an integer
float object and so yes you know a
single actually
you try come on our company Russell
Russell and no we haven't tried on Jenna
87 Russell says now it doesn't Anika
tried it but we do in terms of
supportive the minute it comes up
yagatama counts presumably before all
right so also you're being recruited to
do sale on instead of gravy hacking now
you might be enough so now what I'm
doing is that you know I eat right each
of the modules which is could be of any
of those types because it's a JS in the
rain and if it's an object I need to
make sure it's an object so I you know a
check and once I've checked that it is
an object with in there I can already
access it because the type has been
refined to chase an object so I can look
at the module then I get the list of
module names the other cool feature we
have is we're very good at expressing
hierarchical structures from within the
language itself natively and that's not
a dynamic language that's a very
strongly typesafe language but if you
look at what Stefan is doing is
literally writing a JSON object that we
represent what we're doing right now and
you know frankly that's quite readable
yes that's not pure chess on but that's
you know very readable even if you don't
understand the syntax and here we it's
not a special sugar focus in tax it's
just the an alternative way to call
constructors in salon that makes this
hierarchical way of expressing
structures very easy so you can think of
JSON you I representations something you
would put in XML anything like that yeah
so you can see here yeah but it's if you
try to build tree like objects in Java
what you end up with is you create the
tree and then you have add this and then
you get the new thing inside then you
say a dad and get an iodine and it's you
distractor everything and it looks like
a lot of lines but you don't see you
know how it's related as a tree whereas
with its with a syntax like like salon
where you can actually oh this is not
one of those but you can actually name
parameters as well and so on when you
pass parameter sign name then it becomes
really obvious when you look at the code
what it looks like in the end another
example is the one we saw on the website
which was represented the web page
this so here's how you were you know
pass parameters my name you say hi it is
this body is that nice nice that's how
you do so this is this is kind of a
selfish question but there's the salon
work with javafx not yet but we had a
lot of people that actually you know
mention that they would love to write a
binding to just like like a lot of
things like even that syntax you're
showing now is as close to the the old
kind of sequence syntax and javafx for
that discreet yeah and it's it's easier
to of those two groovy as well its
visual layout which is a tree in a
format like this than it is with um you
know object to raise yes bear in mind
we're very early on the sdk so you I is
not it's not exactly the first thing you
can real yeah but that's the things were
a responsibility and yeah Java Sea
genetic seems to catch the point well so
that would be a natural natural binding
force cold
so I guess that was set up yes yeah
another that was a fail to get
introduction river to the language is
there anything else you guys wanted to
offer so I'm gonna I think you guys have
done the packing you deserve a nice a
proper night packing sticker and it was
like a magnetic one that you put at the
behind your car you know like when
you're not frisky now magnets and
computers don't not really yeah I really
kind of a purist but this year I gave up
and decided to put the Creative Commons
logo on what do you see like i did a
nice little touch with this so it's it's
um transparent and if you if you get the
right angle it will shine through so you
can actually get a little visual missing
bling to conceal promotes the ribs and
it's also it's a man of a nice model it
will peel off easily it won't leave a
mark on your laptop that sticker looks
like it will never come off without an
act of God called white spirits
alright and you can see that there's not
many left so good thing you guys were
not the last let me stay 1 2 3 we have
exactly enough for the remaining it's
good if you dun Alyn at the end because
it usually takes about two hours what
everyone has sex on over so make sure
you bring food and water yeah save a
life what else can we talk about let's
move a bit away from God because I've
been walking a lot on the invalidation
yeah yeah and we yeah we tried to
shuffle things with the Java 7 guys to
try and get the best of bean validation
integrated with the rest of the platform
so if I had to describe two things that
are not going to be seen in the spec
bean validation itself is air we have
everything open source to go to be in
validation that old you will see how to
contribute even the website is actually
on github so you can fix my typos so
just just do a pull request and you're
good to go you got the contributes page
to see the level of things you can do
for us and help us improve it and if
something is wrong with invalidation
that's your fault you should have
contributed it's all I'm saying and the
people have been warned exactly when
they come to your session after the
specs were ratified and they complain
about x y&amp;amp;z I say screw you all right so
we also have the other world map where
we say you know we worked on this it's
checked so it means it's in the specs so
we have a civil level we start
discussing on emails then we wore the
proposal on on the website its marked on
contents with various discussions and
then we push once one we settle once we
settle on one we go under
push that to this man cool that's a
pretty cool and what's interesting is
that when somebody like 25 years from
now will say you know what did you do
that but we'll probably have the bus
that brought us to them yeah let's go so
folks should contribute now it's a good
way of getting involved with the current
jsr ongoing yeah and the other one that
is not gonna be shown that much in the
spec is the fact that we are we walk
hard with CDI the Jack's arrest guy and
generally speaking you're being Shannon
and Linda to try and see where we can
bring the new staff that roof design
method validation across the whole
platform Oh see the idiots ceylon you to
leave validation what else here involved
are I do a lot of hibernate thingy
projects so hard on it so yeah that's
very much well I think that's where you
give that your big name from Oh
following Kevin watch you guys oh I was
one of the guys that actually what
hibernate and editions and entitymanager
and JPA on top of five minutes yeah that
was me and then the recent baby is
higher than 80 GM which is a non failing
experiment to see if hibernate could
walk from North Korea databases so we
decided no it's not going to walk let me
prove you that and then so far we
haven't proved it so we that's literally
why's that no no we are very big plan
for the project but I started very
humbling humbling
under still hungry how come story 12
stay for friendship yeah
what do you want me to talk about I
don't know now that's good i think we've
actually we've covered let's give
covered a lot of ground so thank you
emmanuel thank you thank you Stefan you
have to bring it back to read bi I gotta
yeah I gotta drive it and actually I
found outside you know I bought
motorcycle of cars there's a left
steering wheel in a right steering wheel
and so it's not as easy to drive them on
the correct versus the right side of the
river all that is deca incentive to be
on the right side yeah but with
motorcycles i figured i'd be fine but it
realized the headlights they're adjusted
to shoot for signs on the opposite side
so i was i was flipping off people with
my lights in their eyes on the opposite
so i would show you on the highway yeah
yeah actually one guy did he got a whip
said he he started like sheathing up
behind me and going around me I didn't
understand what he wants it but that was
the problem yeah hey random next thing I
alright thanks and enjoy the deluxe
comforts thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
