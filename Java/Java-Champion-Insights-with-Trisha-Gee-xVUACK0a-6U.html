for the night hacking stage here at the
hacker garden space at devoxx Belgium
2016 with me i have three sha ji fellow
java champion three shayne hello thank
you for me yet we're sorry that's very
loud oh yes of course I can't turn in a
live it down yes I feel a bit like I was
the voice of God you are the goddess of
the idea good thank you so true so what
do you do on your daily work um that's
an excellent question what do i do i do
a lot of variety of things but as a as a
developer advocate is that meant to be
it's going up now as a developer
advocate I kind of mix in I do a lot of
presenting obviously at conferences I do
a bunch of of writing not just blog post
but also I write a bunch of the very
technical tutorials for IntelliJ so
things like um not just how do I use
this feature but like when would I want
to refactor to java 8 for example is
like a tutorial in the IntelliJ docs for
that sort of thing um and I also do but
in order to do that usefully I have to
carry on doing code as well so i have to
do development i did develop an awesome
i saw staff and i also do a bunch of
like trying to create proper working
sample applications that are like real
world stuff so developers can kind of
get their head around stuff how stuff
really works awesome that sounds pretty
good so I said you have a champion what
do you do we with the communities what's
your involvement with the community
overall so the good thing is that my job
means I do a lot of outward facing stuff
anyway and I kind of see I work for
jetbrains because i really like IntelliJ
as an IDE and I kind of like the fact
that I can help developers kind of
upskill themselves so it's kind of one
of the reasons why I do this job and one
of the reasons why I think I ended up
being a Java champion because my point
is to kind of try and talk to real
developers find out what they do and
help them be more productive and do
their job in all productive way but
that's kind of part of my day job in
terms of the wider community
I'm a founder of the Seville jug in
Seville Spain and we haven't done so
much of that recently this year because
we had a baby and that tends to put a
bit of a crimp on your social life it
turns out who knew and so I mean so
we've done some more stuff like I'm
still trying to be involved in the
virtual jug because that's a little bit
easier to do from home and and there's I
still get involved the london java
community as well because it's a very
large community and they have it's
easier to see from a large community
what developers are doing what trends
are interesting to them what things are
difficult for them and to be involved in
such a diverse community as well right
and that's a nice segue because i was
about to ask you about your involvement
in the birth of jog and also i correct
me if i'm wrong but you also a member of
the java council yes i am a member of
the java council thank you for asking
and you will see us on stage with the
closing keynote later on and yeah so the
the virtual jug and the virtual joke is
great for me because i worked remotely
so i can do a bunch of presenting
through the virtual jug the virtual jug
is good for us in seville as well
because we are not London or New York or
somewhere like that so I can point the
the jug to our local job to material on
the virtual jug so they can see like
top-class speakers talking about
features or language stuff or whatever
without like us having to fly them all
the way to Seville so for us in a non
Hub City the virtual drug is like super
useful for me as a speaker and for us as
a community and then Simon kind of roped
me into being on the Java council so we
do a podcast every month every month but
since me Simon and Martina all had
babies in the last like two years and
then it's kind of an ad hoc schedule how
that sort of happens and but that's cool
because we get a chance to kind of catch
up and talk about news and talk about
like what's happening in in the wider
community and also invite guests on and
find out what they're what they're up to
as well awesome well this growing fine
rubber this sound to me a little bit
like a call to arms for those job I use
your boobs are out there that sometimes
feel a little bit in trouble to get the
speakers to get to generate some kind of
answer so this
come to just get close to the beer tell
Java user group and I know for a fact
there are two brand new Java user groups
in Columbia my home country they just
getting started last month and I'm
pretty sure they are hungry for content
and sounds like a brutal joke it would
be a nice place to stop it's cool i mean
we ran simon riches java 8 talked and we
showed the video from the v jug in the
real life jug so we all got together
physically and and had a drink and start
and then we could discuss things like
the Java 8 features and kind of what we
like to what we didn't like or what was
confusing to us you don't necessarily
have to have an expert speaker on site
to have a conversation about something
and so the virtual jug is quite cool for
that and then if you do have questions
you can of course always ping these
people over Twitter so you don't
necessarily have to have an expert in
the room talking about things the other
thing that Java user groups are really
good for and again doesn't rely on
having some sort of expert international
speaker it's kind of sharing stories
about your job your career path in the
city like recruitment maybe it depends a
bit i mean i come from the London scene
which is very recruitment driven we
switch jobs like every year every two
years and one of the reasons we network
is to find out who's hiring like which
jobs are kind of cool which companies
are good to work for but the jug is
quite a good place to do that as well so
find out who's doing cool stuff and
we're so if you are looking to to
improve your situation then turning up
to a user group is good for that sort of
thing all right well thank you very much
to risk for for these insightful
comments and for everybody else watching
well what you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
