like to show you a project called the jf
extras project
Jeff extras is an open-source project in
which contributors have created controls
and other capabilities that haven't made
it yet into JavaFX it's more of a labs
kind of experimental environment for
ideas for controls that that would
eventually that could eventually make it
into JavaFX so the homepage for the Jeff
extras project is Jeff extras org and
from here you could download the jar
file and the Jeff extras jar file and
actually use it in your project and
there's other ther are other things that
you can download and try out here's a
list of the contributors to the AF
extras project and if you want it to and
get involved more you could actually go
to github and download one of the
projects or clone one of the projects in
github so here's Jeff Xtras labs where
all the controls and gauges I'm going to
show you are but then there's also a
project called Jeff extras ensemble and
as you probably know in JavaFX there's a
demo application called ensemble and its
purpose is to be able to show you the
controls and other facilities that are
in JavaFX and and how to use them a lot
of code behind them documentation etc so
in Jeff extras we've leveraged Ensemble
and we've created a version of Ensemble
that shows the Jeff extras controls and
gauges so you could clone that project
and build the dispersion of Ensemble
very easily with NetBeans and you would
be able to then run this application
called Jeff extras Ensemble so I'm going
to run through some of the different
controls and gauges that we have in here
very briefly for you so here's one in
which if you had an application
that was a calendar based or agenda
based you could use this agenda control
to allow users to edit an agenda also
there's a object called the beam path
adapter and reading from the description
it's an adapter that permits plain old
Java object fields to be bound to Java F
FX controls without the need to manually
create Java FX properties so as you can
see each of these examples has a
description and some source code and
then like the ensemble project for Java
FX you can save a NetBeans project or
copy the source in the example of using
these different controls so here's a big
decimal field it's a text field that
holds text that holds arbitrarily
formatted bigdecimal values and then
here are several different calendar
picker samples picking years and months
here we're sliding the hours and minutes
another sample here here we're showing
we can pick multiple dates and ranges
here's a calendar text field
and then here's a time picker sample
here we'll go ahead and show the hours
and minutes some text field settings
this is a mini icon button where with an
icon button you get some text and an
icon this one allows you to specify an
extra miniature icon and you can also
animate it to draw attention to it then
here's some here's a radial menu this is
a rather nice menu kind of control where
you can select options either one level
or two levels and then here are some
spinners and here's some more examples
of those same spinners with different
configurations then here are some
windows for a an MD aya multiple
document interface kind of style
minimizing dragging around here's
another one where we're showing a video
and just providing different effects
here shrinking growing rotating course
minimizing then here's some gauges some
of these gauges like bar graph augment
what's available in JavaFX here's a
battery gauge that allows you to
programmatically show charging by either
a flash or a plug indicator and here's
some nice clock gauges that would be
very useful for for an application for
instrumentation here's a throwback
dot-matrix segment gauges five by seven
dot matrix and here's some indicator
gauges these would be good for
instrumentation these these LCD gauges
and then some led gauges here's a matrix
panel
throwback to the 60s where numbers are
showing up in vacuum tubes called Nixie
tubes here's an odometer kind of a
smooth-running kind of car style
odometer these would be good for
instrumentation as well these radial
gauges these come from the steel series
that Garrett Grunewald created and he
ported these to JavaFX here's a rater
gauge for providing ratings a 16 segment
gauge here's a split flap gauge it's
kind of a throwback to the 70's style
alarm clocks a step indicator that could
be used for wizard steps then finally
the classic traffic light that can be
programmatically controlled so I hope
you've enjoyed this tour of the JAF
extras project and I hope that you'll go
to Jeff extras org and use these
controls and maybe even become involved
with the project contributing controls
thanks a lot bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
