little bit about some of the things
we've been working on around Java
technology and IBM specifically around
Java and cloud and Java and some of the
trends that we're seeing around hardware
and new languages one of the areas i
think is really interesting is this idea
of multi-tenancy or density and how can
we move up the spectrum what happens is
your hundred instances of your app
server use twenty percent less memory
and come up thirty percent faster
because you are actually caching
computation loading time and getting
time thirty percent is a big deal so
that's what we mean by share more what
we've done with our Liberty profile
introduced this year is we've created
what we call a lightweight runtime for
the cloud we cooperate with live at
migration so if you're going to tell an
application we're moving you from that
machine to that machine no problem
however if that application is not very
cooperative it's dirtying memory that
high rates of speed it's garbage
collecting it's getting if you cooperate
you can support functionality and cloud
like 2x faster app migration now this
one's cool so I'm going to take a little
time here system z mainframes cheer if
you love mainframes whoo right there you
go Oracle and IBM work together on Java
but we compete and we compete like mad
competition drives innovation we are
head-to-head competing and innovation is
good for our customers who get better
performance highly optimized run times
and its really really good for
developers job I think finds itself now
in a world where it is one important
member of a collection of technologies
that developers are using to build their
applications and we need to make sure
that Java works well
you
