and so as a java champion so what do you
do with the community i also do a lot of
things here so one of the things that is
community-related is juke is an open
source library and there's a ever
growing community of people using joke

maybe completely separately so that's a
lot of community work and i'm also on
the board of the java user group

two hundred members mean in the meantime
so we have five venues across
Switzerland in the major cities where we
have events more or less 60 events per

them and that sort of thing alright if
anything else that you'd like to add so
well what does what what do you do as a
general champion is there something that
adds this is a title java champion add
something to your daily work is
something that stays up this is an extra

couple people recognize the brand of
java champion and they recognize that
the work that went into becoming one and
these DC that well they have already
seen me before before I became one but
they see that this is a very nice thing
in the world as well as a kind of a
contribution to the community and I
guess that's what it was alright well
