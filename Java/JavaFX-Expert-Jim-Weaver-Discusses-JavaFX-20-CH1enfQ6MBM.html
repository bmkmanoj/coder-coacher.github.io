technology Network we're here at JavaOne
Latin America talking to members of the
Java community I've got Jim Weaver with
me hi Jim
hi Tori tell me your role in the Java
community well I'm a Java FX geek I'm
trying to push Java FX forward as a as a
development platform
excellent so tell me what your sessions
are about here my session yesterday was
about the return of rich client Java and
as you may know back in 95 we kind of
went to a web-based development
experience rather than continuing the
client-server experience that we had
enjoyed up until 1995 so ever since then
we've kind of degraded into this trying
to shoehorn the web into being an
application execution environment and
platform so everybody then had to
shoehorn the web into doing that by
writing lots of HTML and JavaScript and
XML and and you know Ajax things like
that and a really made life hard for
developers it's hard to write hard to
maintain and so with JavaFX coming back
or with JavaFX and with allow the
deployment technologies that are
available now rich client java can now
return and that's what that's what I'm
about is making sure that rich client
job it comes back to where developers
can kind of restore sanity to
application development Wow so it
sounded like it was really painful it's
definitely it's a bat it's a bad scene
it's really hard right developers have
gotten used to that kind of like a the
old proverbial frog that you put in in a
in a fan it keeps getting Warner but
everybody is used to that and so when
you say hey let's go with rich client
job people aren't really used to that
because they're used to web environments
but but really this the same way to do
things and the easy way for development
is to write your applications in rich
client Java so that's what that's where
we need to go and that's what I'm trying
to
advocating at this point great so tell
me some of the features in Java Java
effects pseudo that your that are that
you're excited about lots of things
there's a the scene graph of course
where you have a very powerful scene
graph to where every note in the scene
whether it be a rectangle or a control
or a web view in which you're rendering
a browser those are all nodes in the
scene graph and you can transform them
give them a fax those kinds of things so
it's a very powerful flexible kind of
scene graph and there's all sorts of
other attributes that are in job effects
as far as like for or back-end you know
the fact that you can leverage anything
in Java to hit the back end like you
know through Jason or any number of ways
there is the web view that I talked
about there's a lot of the things that
that came from JavaFX the first version
1.3 that are in job FX 2.0 a lot of nice
things that make developers lives easier
like properties and binding and
observable lists and the ability to
declaratively express user interface
through the Builder pattern just on and
on so lots of exciting things about
JavaFX 2.0 that makes developers lives
easier great so if i've you know shied
away from JavaFX and i'm ready to take a
look at it again where would you suggest
somebody start well the natural place to
start would be at JavaFX com obviously
there's my blog which is JavaFX / comm
Jaya
JAV AF x PE rt.com there's a excellent
blog that is created by the and
maintained by some of the Java FX
engineers richard bear' jasper pots and
Jonathan Giles and it's called FX
experience FX expe are ience calm that's
where you can really get the latest kind
of news on a weekly basis and examples
that's a really good place to start
obviously downloading the job FX 2.0 and
on Windows it's available on Mac it's
available and early access and or you
know kind of a Developer Preview kind of
thing and so getting your hands on that
actually trying out some of the samples
doing some development would be a great
place to get started great and and I
also know personally that you've written
a lot of articles for the Oracle
technology Network I want to thank you
for that
so OTN Java there is a lot of technical
content that you can take a look at
right so I want to thank you and it's
good talking to you thank you for your
time and have a great chat Thank You
Torian alright this is Tory wheel with
the Oracle technology Network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
