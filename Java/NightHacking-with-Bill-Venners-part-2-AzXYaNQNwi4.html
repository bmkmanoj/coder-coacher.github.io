better networks the conference Wi-Fi
conference Wi-Fi was kind of iffy to
take take three with with Bill where
we're going to show scale cones yeah so
let's just cut straight to the chase
change and show some show some pills
this is a great way to get start with
Scala we discovered yesterday when we
gave this out 250 people in the room and
they just look to town wall on it and
really liked it so what you do is you go
to skeletons in org and you download
this zip file and unzip it and you have
to say dot slash SBT I was running a
different version of SP teen was very
frustrating a little while ago she
downloads a version of SBT that works so
I'm going to unzip it I'll show you how
to unzip case you don't know yet 10 days
of course like d marsh dot slash SPT
gets you to run SBT it'll see you up
some words of wisdom
here goes okay I can really feel that
the meditative power of the cones I know
right down here of course I didn't read
instructions this is what I'm supposed
to write I'm supposed to use this guy
that that doesn't an order so I will do
that I say run the cones and then it's
going to take a while to compile them
can come the Jeopardy Tim this is a good
thing to do during compiles to do
usually I'm the Jeopardy to internal
files my head in your hand yeah all your
been saying well I think I gave you time
to ponder and contemplate right it's
good thing right otherwise you may not
notice your life going but if you didn't
have long compile times yeah yeah well
yeah I wouldn't do that it was not too
bad because now we we can have something
to meditate on leave account oh it's a
different one please meditate on phone
asserts can take a boolean argument of
sweet about asserts which is different
than the one we had before so in a
directory this doesn't work anymore
because I
felita this one let me go back up to
where I am L scala clones to city d
marsh okay here-here's the directory
top-level trivia and zip-tie say source
and then i go down like 20 directories
and find the source code and she said
about 01 more directly about shirts
there we go a search can take a bullying
argument that's his first one it says
it's a cone right false what does she
say she said basically a search fall
seems like it should be true so I can
just change it to true i mean you would
just guessed that right and then you go
over here and because they wouldn't tell
de in front of Tilda test cash only
because P will watch for changes in the
source automatically every kapowee belt
and runs the test again it feels like if
so we also met it out and hit on a
search can include a message so you're
here that's the next one again this I
would just think I changes to true
and back over here and it quickly does
not get a yellow one otherwise yellow
true and false values can be compared
with ship matches of sweet about asserts
that's still about sirs so that's this
one so i can put it this is a little
blank you can fill in looks like okay
that was i save it save a bowl hopes go
back let's running that one bullying so
basically get the idea and it just leads
you through and there's a ton of these
and it's each one is really simple oh
and people had 100 it was a that's life
don't know walk with her you didn't
quite make it you know work on your
limbo technique um that's that's very
cool so it's kind of like it's kind of
like documentation but in tests yeah it
is diana marsh so dick hall and I'm a
mission I didn't lie i had started it he
and i started in a hotel room at her
yeah third match conference yeah several
years back i didn't really happen to be
any of it but yeah IM did much either
way she's taking limited 12 stones he
said or so yeah and there's our hands of
justice ain't nobody's recycle to
meditate i'm not sure about is a really
cool conference yeah check it out it's
in a water park yes it is that was a
very family friendly yeah and you know
like the inner kid friendly too mmm
there's a whole night where you has a
hangout a splasher out yep
not that that box isn't a good
conference be like the boss a jealous is
a great conference but it doesn't have a
water Burke it's very generalized to say
Diane bar so I didn't hadn't really
tried them I mean when they can I do our
style training de cual and I we we
actually use a cones kind of process for
our exercises but but these are sort of
open source and they're much smaller
nuggets and that's I think the key to
its just really simple thing in but each
step along the way you learn something
and it's kind of fun so these were
teaching about scholar testers will also
teach online scholar this is just the
first one is stella test ok so what what
else do you learn to the code what's the
next one bullion in the shirts contesta
called because i'm not going to just
jump ahead we were able to be two would
be breaking the meditative stamps will
be cheetah that's right just make sure
to one at a time sometimes we expect you
to fill in the values it already
expected us to do well that would be to
write two equals one plus one so now
it's going to go on the next one and
that's about ballot bar right that we
looked at last time he about the balance
our i just did that and so now I'm
actually learning about the difference
between a bar and a bow hope I can
reassign a bar because it's going to be
seven and that should work
Oh
but wait a minute did I screw it up bars
may be reassigned oh yeah see it's still
broken look at that say like I'm not
being a very good performer here I
completely missed oh yes right vals may
not be reassigned that's the next one
now you can see that this guy does equal
five I want to uncomment here Oh what i
get is it so it teaches you that you
cannot reassign a so I was actually I
was in it I caught partier your talk
yesterday elliptic about Scott will be
giving is so you guys you guys were
chatting about like vol and var what
type of which one you'd rather be you
said you were a dog I yeah I'm loving
the dick was more of a little arm it's a
bell guy too he was just joking yeah I'm
not sure which part you were referring
to is other any scholar programmers who
actually like bars or bars just
considered like like yo Hawks it's
interesting there's people who come from
the hassle community who consider
borrowers evil hats and they really want
to stay programming in that style of
pure functional haskell style kind of I
mean I think because it's really a nice
style yeah that's the guys got to it
would use mana instead of touching a bar
uh yeah
and monitor nice i mean the rachel is
great stuff it doesn't fit as well on
the JVM as it does on whatever Haskell
runs on but those people who come from
Java to come to scala and I've never met
someone who really wants to keep
programming like they did in Java they
always want to learn the functional yeah
style so I've never met somebody who
just really wants use VARs all the time
but at first when you first are trying
to learn your language or when you first
come to stall it's okay to actually
program like Java without semicolons
just get moving and over time you can
learn something that's one that a nice
way that's actually one of the things I
like about the glue on your
specification for Scala is the way that
the grammar is strict it's a statically
compiled strict grammar but they have
very clever rules or basically getting
rid of semicolons almost everywhere you
probably want to get rid of yep that's
right you can add them but if you break
your lines and in normal places yeah you
don't even play and you can learn what
how to break the lines yeah so cool so
anything else who has showered if I just
one of us won the pumpkin question yeah
I was going to say we're gonna we should
we should we should respond to kirks
earlier you have about permgen and Scala
classes being yeah so really outrageous
do you want to defend yourself come to
this on the table because the camera
because you got to focus even though
that's your better side I think we
should I was just making sure that bill
had something interesting to talk about
why we're getting that large number
files no hey actually I think that you
know bill and
and although dies in Scotland and been
doing a wonderful job developing this
platform form and moving it forward and
I've been fortunate enough that Bill's
been asked me to tweak it hairy down
there so so I think what you're trying
to say is you you actually love scala
because it gives you more opportunities
for performance improvement I'll go with
that yeah yeah thats cal is an
interesting and a platform that's
because it's really lots of fun just to
be involved with it as well as little as
I can be wish I had more time as it was
wonderful and yes it provides more
opportunities for performance tuning
yeah so the one we talked about which is
interesting every is it makes you very
efficient at generating class files
because it does a lot of basic you don't
have to write as much code to generate
class files whoops right and there are
things you can do that actually caused
massive numbers of class files that's
kind of one of the things that I was
trying to figure out how how this is
happening yeah and we have had problems
with like to get the thing to even
compile we have to increase the memory
sizes of the available to the compiler
yeah I do it for Scala effects pretty
quickly so this this might actually be a
case for what I call a custom profiler
that we can basically an agent we can
throw into the compilation process and
it's a technique I often used for these
types of problems because i'm pretty
sure that you know what you you know
well i'm confident that we're going to
find that something in there has just
decided to generate all of these things
and whatever that thing is going to be a
fairly dominant activity and a
compilation process and and if we just
tune the garbage collector to look for
something that's making these class
files i'm sure we're going to find out
what causal execution path is for that
hopefully clean it up that would be that
would be fun right yep or find out what
it is or at least I know what it is like
when you write a scala program what kind
of things to avoid it
you know that it's causing these
pathological cases so yes I'd like to
forget oh yeah thanks Ted so yeah so use
for context we were on the street Miller
with Kirk Pepperdine but you can watch
online at night hacking calm and having
a good to shout about permgen and the
implications that's that's an airport
express which you don't want to stop you
don't want to touch or it will kill my
my life doesn't occupy my livestream I
like your t-shirt though yes yes you to
be on this side if you want people to
see it on livestream hat they did see it
all right yeah that's good so um yeah I
thing else we should chat about them no
that's good i just actually mainly
wanted to share the Cohens because I I
kind of discovered yesterday how how
nice they are forgetting going in Scala
cool all right well thanks for joining
me thank you for inviting the night
hacking show and next up we have a
manual bernhardt and some folks who are
going to show us say long so that's
that's coming up at on interesting in
another half an hour so some around
there oh cool alright thank you and
enjoy the rest of compass thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
