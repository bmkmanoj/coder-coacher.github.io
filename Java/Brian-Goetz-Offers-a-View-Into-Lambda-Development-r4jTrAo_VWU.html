technology Network we're reporting live
from dev ox and I've got members of java
community that we're talking to today
and I real honored to talk to Brian gets
Brian best beauty he is the chief
architect for the Java language and he
just did the keynote this morning at
devoxx that was great yeah thanks okay
so I just wanted to ask you a couple
questions about it you actually talked
about why did lambdas take so long right
and I thought that was an interesting
answer could you share that with us yeah
so this is this is a you know comment
that we get quite frequently you know I
when can we have it people are excited
to have these new language features and
depending on how you count we could say
that it took three years or four years
or six years or 15 years depending on
how far back into history you want to go
but we started this project about four
years ago was actually on stage at the
keynote of devoxx 2009 when Mark
Reinhold announced to the world that we
were finally going to take the step of
adding lambis to Java and this was
something that had built on ideals that
have been in the community and the
concept of lambda expressions has been
around since before the days of silicon
based computing but in the years
previous there had been kind of a
vigorous debate in the community about
if and when and how to add lamb mr. Java
and after that is sort of initial set of
debates burned out we made the decision
to actually go forward with it and do it
and it was about six months later that
we really got started in earnest and
we've been working on it for the last
three and a half years and the question
that people ask is all right what have
you been doing for those three and a
half years they write the things that we
wrote on the slides three and a half
years ago and the things that we're
delivering look somewhat similar so what
have we been doing since that time and
the reality is it's easy to add a
language feature if you're willing to
let it look bolted onto the side but the
thing about language features is they
don't exist in a bubble they interact
with all of the other features of the
language that have been added in the
last you know
17 years and so it was working out the
interactions between lambdas and other
features and making sure that those
interactions were smooth and predictable
and free of sharp edges that really took
the time and that the biggest example is
one that people don't even see is the
interaction of two features that most
people don't even pay attention to in
their daily work method overload
selection and type inference so much of
our work was just overhauling the way
these two features work together so that
the code did what you expected it to do
and without doing that work under the
surface it would have looked bolted on
and people would have said okay lambdas
are a nice hack but they nailed it on
the side right and I saw the code today
and it didn't look hack like at all you
guys you and your team did an excellent
job I have to say congratulations thank
you i'm really pleased with how it came
out i mean i've had the luxury of being
able to program with lambdas in java for
the last year and a half because I've
been working not only on the language
features but also the library features
and so you know I was one of the guinea
pigs and I have to say it's it's really
a pleasant thing it's something that it
just feels right and when you know
looking back you wonder how did i ever
live without this it's really going to
change the way people programa java
right so you say it's going to change
things so as a new developer is this
steep learning curve where do i get
started what's a good way to think about
it yeah so a lot of people you know do
sort of have that initial feel fearful
reaction of oh my god you're adding big
new features new stuff to learn i'm not
gonna be able to read people's code and
the reality is it's not that bad there's
a few new concepts to learn but they're
natural and they're also of people who
have programmed in other languages such
as Java Script or Ruby or Python have
already seen a lot of these concepts and
so learning how they're surfaced in Java
is not going to be is not going to be
terribly hard what may take a little bit
of time is learning to how these
features enable you to write better code
because if you have if you if you have a
new tool it's not necessarily going to
work exactly the way the tools that
you're used to working with our and so
it
take some time to sort of discover the
right technique but you know when you
get to the other end of that that
process you know people say I can't
imagine going back right so it's a nice
brain stretch but it's not a brain
explosion right and it's not you know
throw out everything you think you know
it's it's not that it's an evolutionary
change but it's it's it's a good one
okay so can I take a look at lambdas
right now oh yeah absolutely so the you
know we've been doing all this work in
the open through OpenJDK so all of the
development has been visible you can
you've been able to download preview
builds for you know for two years or so
on you can go to OpenJDK and download
the the Developer Preview binaries for
jdk 8 and it's in now it's now in the
standard jdk builds it's not just in the
special lamb to build like it used to be
while we were you know building it in
the in the sandbox right so it's pretty
stable and now yep and now is the time
to do is get it now is you're absolutely
what I love some feedback yeah this is
absolutely the time to go and download
the JDK it builds try them out you know
run them with your existing tests if you
spot issues please report them this is
definitely the time great thank you so
much Brian thank you for your tireless
work we're delighted to see lambdas out
there please take download it now and
take a look we can we can fix things we
can make them better but we need to do
it now before it gets released
officially thanks thank you very a time
good to see you are we out with the
Oracle technology Network
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
