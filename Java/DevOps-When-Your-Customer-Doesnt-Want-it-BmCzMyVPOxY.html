here with me thanks jalan for for the
opportunity and we are broadcasting
directly from the developers conference
here in San Paulo Brazil and i'm here
with Everton Tavares hello everybody how
are you doing in good good good though
I'm happy to be here in TDC nice
excellent so we are here night hacking
and Everton gave a talk to this morning
on the DevOps track and talking about
how you can implement their votes when
your customer does not want yes is it
possible to do their bombs when the
customer doesn't want yeah because the
verbs is not only on in production and
you I can we can adopt you the tools and
techniques on another environment right
so you can do the intestine yeah
development I had that not in in our
case the the problem of development was
sovet with dev ops right the darker and
another tools okay so use a darker and
I'm several other tools to implement
DevOps on your development vironment
because really if you do on the
development environments later on it's a
lot easier to move to testing quality
assurance in and production eventually
yeah right and they did the tokens is
about the experience that we did that I
have we're on 2014 I I wasn't on TDC and
I go to to to my to my job you is so
excited to implement the button on my
company right and so because so first
thing why were you excited about brains
DevOps is you know you heard here in the
talk yeah you got interested but what
you thought oh man this is really good
for me yeah well they dip the
possibility the possibility to to
automate entirely
the system in and stopped to to lose
time with a man old things right is it's
very good to to my job b22 to use this
time choose to do to improve my system
right and this is the the best thing
that I see on the wops excellent so you
know how to make things you automate
your whole pipeline yeah press a button
go do something else right now repeat
repeat repeat yeah yes okay so so you
know so you swallow these and then you
come back to your cousin say hey look
this wonderful let's go ahead yeah I and
I have this did this possibility I i
started a new project and the customer
no no here no I have uhhh uhhh uhhh i
see that you mean that we deployed the
system you you want to do it manually
right yeah we're not gonna do anything
automate it's too dangerous yeah it's
gonna do manually we're gonna repeat
gonna make mistakes manually has some
has someone on this company kid he is
has the privilege to to do the deploy
has the privilege to to insert a new
column on some young table and database
so a customer I want to be stuck with
that guy yeah you know he goes on
vacation I'm gonna I can't deploy
anymore exactly that's okay so so then
he says no and what did you do we see
that that that that problem and I think
that is fer forget I can automate you
the deploy I can automate the database
migration but we have another problem 00
developed in you you have to ask you to
access david a database with a VPN right
in the VPN always down and they develop
it stop it when
a VPN down right yeah let and I started
to to get the database it in input on
the UNA docker machine right to have did
the controller on on my elemental system
yeah so basically you say okay I'm not
going to access your database anymore
just I'm get the data and put here in
this little darker environments and I
can just access locally yes I I I put on
a darker I ultimate ultimate automates
out automated a with a highway highway
right I saw I saw your talk you see oh I
saw your talk yeah so your automated
flight way yeah and then and then you
are able to bring the data into your own
doctor environment exactly in the VPN
problems stop it right did they develop
it and goes faster yes goes faster in
the CD the team will give a did the
ducting has morphed happy Jimmy is
happier more productive yes you deliver
software earlier to your customer the
customers happier yes so everyone is
happier yes okay good so now that's what
your first step yeah its database what
else you did you oh the database and we
and the database has success after this
we we put the the system weblogic the
application server application server on
a doctor machine oracle has a oracle no
head head or a rod or coke or coke head
I image it oh yes that you has problem
has overdosed or problem ok cool so so
actually Oracle has a a weblogic image
yeah reaching bye bye bye the guy has
the same way as me as brutal gorgeous
right so brutal gorgeous did a docker
container image for weblogic yeah
that one yes yes excellent that solves
our problem right so then so now you
have a weblogic server a database server
both each one in their own docker
container yeah you're automating all
these so what why use this for for
development and testing whatever
development for testing is for four
tests did a problem with that with the
database access because when a database
down we need you at you to access
another database right and then with a
stalker it's so easy because we only
stop the data bit our database huh in
another database we oh because your
chassis like load balancing a little bit
of the database that's pretty cool
that's a cool idea so you know with the
cool with containers you can easily
connect one's Kinect another one and see
how everything works yes yes excellent
excellent very good and what's your
customer happy with all that yes but he
don't adopted a talker it is not
document action yet right well is one
step at a time yeah as you know you did
your part you get you another part
that's excellent so and so do you
suggest you all the develop that they
should try to implement DevOps in their
companies yeah I i suggest you to go
step by step you can adopt adopted
daughter on a size of the system on the
database on the server not only own
entire system at the same time you can
do this only are by your development you
can do this Oh always to the pro to
production and you can get the benefits
of the daughter of the drops systems not
only to production to chew continuous
integration two containers deployment
excellent ok so that's advert on I
speaker for the DevOps track here at TDC
