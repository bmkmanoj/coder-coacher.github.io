today my guest is Julian plunge yeah
she's right it took it took a few tries
for free and to get that perfect well as
close to perfect as an American I always
say it would say he's perfect and I
think you're best known for I CPAC yeah
which is a compression to Leroy in Java
it's not this compression it's a tool
for making starters for any kind of
application so it's a project that i
created something like you Devon years
ago but now so I'm sick part of the
community but I'm not maintaining it
anymore I've you know passed the torch
to others to either out here doing it
while hiring on the open source project
you're also a assistant professor
professor yeah so associate professor
Xie professor at a local what's the
university name so the university is
inside yo which is a quite famous in
we're ranking in engineering school in
France so I'm in the telecommunications
departments and I'm also doing my
research in negril labcorp the city lamp
so we have people in a doing stuff right
radio communications to up to people
like yours doing dynamic software and
then so it's kind of interesting
environment and free dynamic and pretty
young so okay and you get to work with
lots of cool technologies and projects
um I guess that is that were romanji
winter so Omar was it was missing this
department she was indeed just pure
computer science department okay but
same universe a Sammy rasiya cool and
then we've been writing articles
whatever sort of stuff have you been
doing recently so some of the I've been
doing recently of treating with the
colleague of mine which who is called
for the am well so as part of our
research we've been you know ginning lot
with invoke dynamic so we've created a
tool called you free which is a fun in
French someone translated it's a very
French and this is about you know doing
dynamic effects on the JVM using the
book dynamic go so we've been doing
research on that because we can take it
sure that it is a better performance for
you yeah well we have good performance
but the thing is we showed that we can
use that for building dynamic aspect
runs middle rails okay so in the future
we want to take advantage of that and
embedded systems using bigger boards for
stuff like that all those kind of cool
things you could do with nearly embedded
systems yes the bagel board and its
larger breath brother and a panther
Pollard use processors which are
probably that as fast as computers when
I years ago those Arab chips yeah
awesome yeah it's not those aren't
really embedded anymore but yeah you
have a real job i see i remember on a
bigger bowl i was running you know
glassfish so yes the other guys alone
javafx development ready for it too so
it runs full job yeah which is nice so
what sort of what sort of stuff do you
want to show today well I think we can
talk about you know bike word in general
and the kind of hacks you can do with
that so I think I have a bunch of cool
demos that I did in Devil's France last
in a sterile with my colleague for the
egg so we showed some stuff you could do
that and I think afterwards we can talk
about input dynamic so i can try to you
know try to make you understand what
inorganic really he's on technical
grounds because most of the time at all
that i've seen is you know just general
articles about info dynamic just as a
family goes into the technical details
are pretty much the bike night eh team
so you have people I charnot or who's
working on JRuby we had some very
technical stuff like that but most
people say well it's just gonna make the
dynamic languages faster okay then how
does it work so I can show you a few
things about it another go get to the
details so people actually understand
yeah I'm both dynamic or so how many
who are watching now just so that I know
if I fail afterwards all have been
tricked so we can already see how many
folks are online and for folks watching
on the stream the format of the show is
we have a live audience and the
recordings are available later if you
want to send messages to us we have to
chat open here so you can go to night
hacking calm or the ustream night
hacking page and there's a social chat
there where you can type and you know
select if you want to publish on Twitter
and Facebook as well also and we're
watching the chat here so stuff comes up
we'll respond to directly to the folks
online by talking to you guys so let's
switch over to your desktop icon Rennes
and the the videos in the bottom right
corner I can move that ok one some nice
very nice it doesn't really matter on
the stage ok all right so what I suggest
is so to get started we will you know
just make a simple hello world and you
will see that i love hello wars because
everybody understands so then you can
really share some stuff so I'm just
going to switch to Channel seven so I
have you know just small thing to switch
I can show you what it's like that it's
just about sitting the bath and i'm
using openjdk wheels i'm not i'm not
using oracle GDK i don't have it in my
machine just hitting a burn gtk+ that
I've been building myself using w have
you been using openjdk seven since
before it was yeah yeah yeah yeah
because I obviously I was like oh my
jesus i couldn't wait yeah so i had to
jump on it and i mean i'd just like to
thank a guy called ana gomes who was
building you know open gk fields for a
long time because otherwise we couldn't
be doing this today even so thanks flow
through him so I'm just going to check I
have the good version of Java right so
that's fairly recent build and then I'm
just going to go
and temporary folder because I just I
just want to make you a hello world so
not nothing fancy here today just head
over just going to clear it take v i
would say hello so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to trade the hello world
I'm going to combine it and just show
you the bytecode so that we can just get
a basic understanding of what it's like
so my main method is going to just going
to have a main method sorry Boyd name so
this is just the traditional boilerplate
you can see and also just I'm going to
say hello world which is awesome well
that's a great app awesome and I don't
make a good article yeah and it doesn't
really use you know into the Elm
obviously dependence injection right so
nothing from City sounds are going to
compile it and and of course I forgot
some things I should save every class so
that's actually I should be out looking
over your shoulder and being a good
pairing partner picking that stuff up
yeah but anyway and of course it works
so that's not too bad but there's a tool
you can use if you want to comply by
kozko jab AAP and it's coming with every
jdk so you see so as you said Friday see
so the sea flag is used to decompile and
the private flag is to say well just
give me everything you have it in the
class and you could even had roles if
you want all the possibility tales what
we're not going to do that just show you
something pretty simple so that's what
you get with this simple class so what
you see here is that you know obviously
you have this default constructor that
was provided for you so what you see in
here is not really fancy you have
something called a load
which means that you will take the first
reference which is this basically
because the constructor is player well
it's acting on this on the object size
so the object has been already allocated
in your just invoking the constructor so
you have this element and here with the
inbox special you will just invoke the
constructor from the class of top form
your superclass and then you had the
main method and in this one method what
do you get well you have a good study to
get the out object then on the stack you
put a constant so you use LDC and you
have a reference which is the number in
something which is called the the pool
so this is where you had the constants
extra integrals or reference and classes
and stuff like that so you put it on the
stack and then you invoke the virtual
methods from french stream because out
is a prince trim and this is French are
right okay so this is just by code and
the thing is so if in most project you
don't have to d into by code usually
usually you just and i would say ninety
nine percent of the time you don't even
trillion to do that but there are number
of cases well you have to actually dig
into byte code so this is especially
true if you are you know implementing
things like application servers how so
people I gave us spying on this many
years ago they had to make a spectral
runs in programming so they needed to
modified by code if you look at play
framework for example in the version one
people are using that just to have a
nice programming model they had to move
to play with biker as well if some
people work on Android you have you know
the there is a live layout library which
is used by applications to to make the
layout of forms so for that on necklace
you have a plug into
to use it and actually what they do is
think they take the wheel android layup
library and they change biker just will
go to charity so this is why hide it in
Eclipse so sometimes well the point is
sometimes you have to play with Viper
yeah there's lots of projects where you
if you really need to to taken on stuff
like this and it's fun it is pretty fun
it's not as hot as you think yeah so on
oh and say hi to Tony Apple he's taking
a break from you know Tony hi Tony he's
taking a break from w Jack stone to
watch this dreams oh he's possum well
thanks for everything else awesome so
what I see something more complicated
than hello world and I cutter you're
sure so while there are tools if you
want to modify by could so if you see
you could be using a.m. which is a
famous library then if we go back to
this much later there is something you
could be using and that you know many
people quite know which is a spade g
yeah so splegg G is as the name suggests
it's being used for ya bring aspects
tujhe project so i have another hello
world example and at this time it using
a specter and that's manipulating yeah
so this time we have spectra just going
to check if I have a spingym stove yeah
I agc some are going to go into LOL so
my hello world is a simple program but
extremely complicated one and what i
have is i have a bunch of respects so
for example i have an aspect which is
called tracer so i don't know if this
really clear so this is the code that is
here and the idea is that here you want
to intercept again
of the run method above all right so you
want you to just make the minification
so if you don't want to make the
magnification using a nearby car engine
library you can just use pages and if
you suspect you you will say for example
here that before you get to the run
method while before you call this method
on the hello world class then we were
insert another trash okay so it shall if
it works the ship went out calling run
and then hello world exactly which is
not super fancy good let's just see
hello world without anything and so
we'll just say hello world yeah and then
we have a GC so a GC is the spec g
compiler and you can take some fire and
what it can compile a spec g source code
and java source code so one thing you
should say is like the java c compiler
you need to specify the source and
target version otherwise doesn't always
work so it's the other world and we have
odds now going to try sir but AG so this
thing is going to compile and then when
I say John head over of course you get
the grass which was inserted yeah yeah
very nice as you would excel file the
little tyke heads so what is it to the
base that is a very good good question
so I can show you so what I'm going to
do is that I'm so I'm going to compile
the original hello world as a knife so
I'm going to decompile it such as
without a aspect yeah so this is with
other aspect I've let the extra thread
run so we will see the difference yeah
i'm going to show you a diff so this is
hello world and let's talk in this
bottle we put this in a file which is
called original and then we compile
again with the effect and we compared to
modified and then we can just make a
nice diff your Universal GF between
original and say modified and we will
buy this for text made it will just look
good and so that's the difference so I'm
going to zoom of course and show you
where it's like okay should be what
about the bottom line is constructed it
should be nice like this so what we have
here is so this doesn't really matter
this is not where the modification is
being made the grid modification is
going to be around here just before the
call so what you have in your eyes
before what you have in green is after
all right so what you see here is that
hear you have a new so still allocate
the hell or class right you still call
the Deconstructor so this is not a
chance but the thing is here before you
are invoking the one method and here
this has been changed so you introduce
two viable using s2o so this is used to
push the so ello this 0 is this so this
is the this element that was in the
stack before on the stack you also get
the instance of hello world so by using
s21 so2 you put those objects in two
variables right so this is essentially
made to stay saved this state before the
call here you have an in work static on
something called tracer would expect off
so this is the so tracer is going to be
my comp I'd class that had the aspect so
we get the instance and put it in the
stack and then you will invoke the make
a virtual invocation
method with a funky name is called ages
it's all run some numbers haha actually
this this method is the method that was
generated to head my before word right
so this is the code that is going to
make me have a burger and then you get
back to calling the method that was
expected to be called so using a load
you get back the state that you had on
the site before an algorithm alright so
that's a pretty simple example so added
looked like six additional instructions
yeah to to do a simple before point cut
yeah but the thing to understand is that
it works by so for each aspect you would
write in spec g you get a class yeah so
it's a whole class plus that what
conservative answer it yeah yeah so
everything we just blank hugs back to
the DSP class that bitch is in
generating okay the only exception is
that in a spec g you can make what they
call in two types modifications which is
the ability to for example change the
inheritance hierarchy so you can make a
class in average from another class or
you can make it interment in other
interface or stuff like that so in this
case is going to make direct changes to
the class okay same if you want to add
new methods new fields and stuff yeah ok
so this example wasn't really fancy
there is one which is maybe better which
is about caching so I have an example
that I guess everybody knows which is
Fibonacci and which is the example that
you always use when you want to show
something so start with our worlds than
Fibonacci simple programs everybody's
seen before yeah and I'm not agree going
to go much deeper like I'm afraid
I'm going to support your your your tour
I guess so this is Fibonacci right and
everybody knows Fibonacci which is
getting increasingly slower so if i
compile Fibonacci and I say java fever
for example well you see that the more
what the bigger n is a scape solid
longer is going to be hip slowing down
now yeah so one or two musician we could
do is obviously to cash the results of
previously computed things yeah that
would be much faster of course but more
number it depends if you have any 50 50
values doesn't really matter well yeah I
mean this this algorithm theoretically
runs without in constant memory the
cached version runs a non-linear memory
right yeah yeah yeah just a little bit
yeah but the thing is okay so huh so
doing a cash you could do it by yourself
you can introduce a hashmap you know
just modifies you energy and just make
it faster yeah but you can do using an
aspect if you like so I have an aspect
here i'm just going to show you what
it's like and the my VI curve for syntax
highlighting is bad just in a make it
affect like channel theory it's a good
better so the idea is that we have an
aspect call cash people right in this
suspect we're going to have a cash here
which is just a map from long long too
long values which is the hash map and
the edges that you're going through
we're going to use an aspect advice
which is around so around means that
you're going to replace method and maybe
you will invoke the original method back
but basically you yeah so you're placing
a matter for the new definition yeah
exactly so whenever you call
she bore people with the lung and the
argument is and then you're going to put
this round so what you do is obvious
what you do is you first try to hit the
cash see if you have a key for the value
which is the pre computed value so in
this case just get back to it otherwise
you can just seem to compute the value
so you do proceed and pretty means call
the original method back okay then you
get the value you're putting in the cash
and then and then you exit so this is
pretty simple so if now I have a spec g
and i have sauce once target 106 and i
have fever and i had the cash so here
i'm just applying the aspect and then I
ran people obviously is going to be much
much faster because I have the best 60
tuitions pretty fast that way past
pretty much faster so we had tweet from
Emanuel who says that I have nice he's a
my ringer here never yeah obviously he
isn't like my safe much I think yeah
because he's a biker he's a biker yeah I
mean do the bathroom okay didn't he tell
you yesterday no yeah yeah yeah so
anyway so I have annual thanks for
coming on the string say something in
chat for us if you have any questions
yes please if you are poking fun at us
distract us alright so yeah so we've
improved it with a little bit of aspect
to cash values may go much much much
faster all right what a little bit by
code again I see oh we could you should
like um so same principle I'm going to
well let's just set in this case does it
do something similar it just yeah
obviously is that we will see so just
say see private and this is feeble so
this is the set amount of hydrogen yeah
I'm mortified thanks and then I'm just
going to combine again
version let's save that so special and
original okay so right now so high I
like here I like here I come Emmanuel is
very cute yeah we can see this guy is it
the only guy that I know which is using
linux and KDE and you know so you did
look credits for that trip very nice so
let's make a diff again and so original
modified by get textmate and the weather
the irrelevant thing here is going to be
that piece of code and as you can see
what again you get your spanked and you
call the this method which is the around
with you advice and that's pretty much
it so yeah it's not free since very
different what the difference is not
very big yeah so by the bigger
differences in the method you replacing
right now because it it replaces the
favicon with this but inside the other
class file now it can invoke this logic
exactly oh ok ok we could you combine it
as well if you want it so just to show
you what we're in a specs is like so it
should be cash feeble and you should
look at this while we have lots of junk
methods but your robot method is yeah
there are a bunch of method likes so
this is the one method mm-hm nice
triangle may I don't matter now yeah
very flex Carolina can finish off
however long strolls launch the wall
troll do do some trolling and scan a
stuff like that you this is you know I'm
gonna nothin gonna my letting I think
Mike were not forget us okay so we want
and for there is this person method but
the thing is yeah you have a bunch of
code which is generated for you right
yeah so that was a spec G yeah we shall
anger bite manners yeah i think by train
isn't it is much much fancier know so
does it doesn't try to do it for more
stuff in the class it's it's a bit
different because bite man is dynamic
yeah so we will see that we can do some
fancy stuff like running and
applications an application plug into it
make some changes live which is less
boring i would say to be sure so let's
go through bite man so again i have so
one doing demos okay you get the
environment it should be fine okay just
going to launch another tab because i
need several tabs and fight maitre d
okay now so no comments nothing but i'm
not there just an all-around bytecode
expertise here 00 what are sleeping
other way so having another hello world
example yeah i said i'm just going to
compare it right and just start it so
this time the hello would need to be
different because every two seconds you
get an increment and you print the value
ouch it more exciting yes this is like
um hello numbers yeah nothing very fancy
so i'm going to mean i'm going to lead
the application running and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to plug right
mine on to the application because it is
the debugging API yeah it is the gvmt I
China so it's been it's about who can do
the application nice which of course you
shouldn't be doing on your production
servers what you can you can if you like
but some people have been using bite
mine too you know Mulder yeah when it
like my drink like monitoring on
production servers so they can attach
what they need to and then get the thing
is yeah those people are we have
standards
courageous yeah they're crazy dangerous
so those are two Kentavious if you don't
know it gives you the P IDs of the Java
applications on your machine so for
example I know that my hello world is
has this PID all right so there's
something called BM install and you get
DP I did right so my application is
still running nothing happened but it
keeps going up it keeps going out here
the Batman is on it now it's been good
bye bye Badman so what I have here is
I'm going to put some rule and the world
map is something that can modify the
application so for example here I have
say calling print which is very like you
know an aspect so you say invite when
you say I have rule and you have
conditions and actions so for example my
role here is calling friends in hello
world so it's just name description that
the chicken we can give so it's like a
little dsl for describing effort
modifications exactly nice so it's all
it even condition action world so for
example here you can specify the target
so you say I'm going to focus on hello
world the class i'm going to focus on
the print method which is the one that
obviously prints something and if true
which is the condition because i don't
really want to check for anything but
you can do fancy changs right now in
this case are going to try to print a
dress and get dollar one which is the
value of the argument like all the
string right some my applications
resisted running as before and i'm going
to push this role so there's a script
called BM submit you push car in print
okay so it says that the rules been
installed and then when you get back of
it deputation has been modified but ice
so now it's telling us what it's going
to call exactly Ln is calling it yeah
which is nice okay but you so this is
this is like real we're real hacking now
we're actually yeah we can imagine we're
on some fine
she'll transaction server and we've just
started pushing funds to our offshore
account unfortunately there's no blank
around here well but anyway maybe three
safe in your best words I just watched
you on an airplane yet banks start yeah
do that Susan is not too far so there's
another one which is decorate print
which is going to add some other things
so for example here are you decorate
prints so instead of just saying y
equals you put brackets around here so
you can plug as many you know rules as
you like and okay you can even remove
them so if you say for example the
intimate and you said install using the
U flag you will remove it so you have
one less or here nice and you can even
remove the first one which was calling
print and you just get back to what you
had before oh well so that was one
example I have fancier example so still
based on this simple thing so this is
I'm going to compile all java code so
this is demo that we do the debug france
and somehow people loved it so i'm just
going to say Jenna hello world again so
it's still doing the same thing and then
so again I'm going to get PID of my head
over d'application plug white man into
it so it's 43 88 and then I'm going so
the application is running and I'm going
to submit some rule that I called
something the good folder on exchange
drag me into error world and ubm some
mids and use plumbing so here you can
see something and you guys get a GUI if
you like can do see you actually hooked
her up so there's a user interface
it's being updated yeah based upon the
function calls use action so this is
really a hack so so you know why phone
likes this one so because they've been
staring at the terminal whole session
and suddenly ha I user interface so I'm
14 G's nadja my effects we agree should
fix that now Oh some guy to do you if
you want to generate a straight right
now me we're enjoying right now we'll
fix the put the javafx version running
java 7 knows java thing oh yeah but it's
nothing Judy keep build and I don't have
a pal I don't have java fixing it versa
I'm pretty sorry so when the when java
flex gets fully open sourced in February
there then you'll have it in your
openjdk pills yeah pretty because this
is the open G effects project right they
have been GD k yeah yeah all right all
right so I'm with a question from
Emanuel wondering about security well
what about security well this is crap
basically so shouldn't you well you
should be doing this the thing is well
as long as you can log on to a machine
and you have NF you know permissions see
unix permissions you can plug into any
JVM application so your house is not not
secure it's not secure with the goal is
not to be secure rights the goal is to
make dangerous things I would say but
things you should be not be doing normal
environment but that you can do so maybe
for civil ps4 Emanuel's projects you can
use that I don't know so anyway to did
you have to compile the java program
tiny special flags to to allow remote
debugging no this is just pure Gemma and
the way bite man works is that which
reloads classes then exchanges on the
bytecode never so that's a pretty simple
way you want to change back on fri which
is not too bad there are many good
usages for white man so this was you
know
so this is good for doing demos but you
well normally you don't get food by
doing demos is if I thank you so you
teach for a living so it's kind of yeah
that's kind of the same thing all right
at the same time yeah somehow I did this
damage to students and they loved it
yeah yeah it was much better than you
know not much better than just writing
yeah correlations on the board going
through slides what the logic much
better yeah and I was actually so things
you can do with that is a much better
example is if you want to say simulate
Harold's in test so when you write unit
tests you can simulate things like
failure on the disk you can see similar
that the disk is full and you can see it
network failure while all the things
that are hard to do in tests ever okay
so yeah lets you simulate all they are
conditions that you might get but we
would have difficulty actually doing
exactly yeah so if you want that I have
a project and get up I can be kind of in
my browser yeah it's good blood stool
okay and while you're doing that also
yeah i'm setting that oh no it should be
n-not at all right oh yes like it
because otherwise I won't get it written
my friends now okay what's your hero
block threw a rock through okay alright
so this application is it's a kind of no
sequel database that I did just to show
how white man can be used and the edgy
is dead so you can look fight and when
you have finds you compute their you
compute a hash which is going to be the
defining and when you had that you can
just store it in a fuzzy two key value
based based on on the continent of the
fight okay and the thing is well there
are many things that are hard to test if
you want to check that the software is
world is like in a disk rushing
cross-trained disk for other stuff so
just look at the project we're not going
to dig into that against but just look
into that so maybe shy one of the tests
yeah I don't short death value so one in
one of the test so there is a bite man
during its integration which is pretty
nice because enjoying the deaths or
testing g test and you can plug you can
say that before you run this test you
will use a wheel from from bite man so
oh cool oh yeah yeah yeah so far is
great so I am NOT wrong it's the good
one yeah so how you do is pretty simple
let me just check one which is not too
hard to read for example this test right
so this test is about you know
simulating that you have an i/o error
when you want to trim from the fine so
just to check that basically the disk is
going
22 to die in a few minutes so just you
won't do that defeating the display
yourself because it goes too much yeah
that is how to reproduce perfectly so
you'll run out of disks of you every
time you run a tab that you break your
desk basically yeah so yeah you could do
that yeah but I mean like it would
eventually you run out of disk stuff one
of this and i remember in java one in
2008 you will you had james gosling
doing that with a chainsaw on gsm just
usually ZFS but yeah then everybody's
jumping on java wait maybe for your dell
box download this here well i'm going to
Davos the Box friends well maybe the
worst friend so it's frankly that yeah
when I got a chainsaw on my show this is
one way you can test I o or use by
Marcus fiber which is so I bet I bet
they would let you bring chainsaw in
just for that so so if you want to bite
mine you have a bite p.m. scripts
notation just to say use this script
with this fancy name so it's just going
to apply the rules before you run the
test and the other thing is you just
need a special runner so in the case of
g-unit there is something called dmg
inch run out in a cup and you this run
our efforts so use the runner then you
have your separate file and I refer to
it in annotation ok I'll see they on
file lets you define good idea so it's
in a resources and bite now which one
would it did you remember I said I on
the name make this one yeah nice so this
is a simple rule invite man and
basically the thing is when the folder
needs to be treated for the internal
storage of files you're just going to
check to to make it fail right
when your firm what I have a method in
my brother all right which girl open
bloodstream and at entry which means
when you enter the method if true which
is every time you just throw an
exception no matter what what is fine
you can have more fancy words like you
can can say you will let have three good
white weeds and then you crash so you
can have controls other applications of
Batman can be to synchronize threat so
if you have how to reproduce
multithreading issues while you can just
try to reproduce them but by having
threads being frozen or waiting for each
other so you can do anything yeah and I
leave it out to dating or June yeah this
looks like a nice way of um if you find
test weird conditions in your code yeah
without having to modify the code you're
testing yeah or if you're trying to make
your test more reliable you can actually
fix thread synchronization yeah and the
thing is while you can see i'm just
going to do to mock objects but
sometimes not just convenient or
possible to make marks mhm so but many
in those cases batchman is it is usually
very simple and it works with sorrow so
yeah I highly recommend using bite man
it's not really hard but it's making me
no change to biker life and can be used
for you but it looks like we are making
our honor yeah yeah the lights coming in
behind us i was tricking the camera and
so nobody nobody can see else yes it was
creeping slowly as he returns nice much
better so there was white man i guess we
can move on to something else but yeah
yeah so the only question i guess Tony
Tony like super chainsaw well so I
should uh she asked Antonia tomorrow
when I'm in Paris if you can bring a
chainsaw sort of experience
love to all right so I think I think you
you've earned a night hacking Wow
amazing thanks it occur this is a
limited edition amazing some i'm going
to put eaten in micro no going to put it
in my laptop it's going to be yeah yeah
so your lights up right in the same wow
these beautiful so look at ya what up
what up night hunting dukes okay so I I
would apply it from all love this
evening yeah it's pretty good thanks so
if I want to move on there is a project
so i can just show you a quick demo this
of a research project which would read
with my colleagues in the lab which is
making dynamic effects on the JVM using
glue dynamic and then you can compute i
guess by showing you into a dynamic
culture yeah a salir el invoke dynamic
not just I'll just fake you look down or
you know talking about in breck dynamic
without sugar is like sharing the real
pie cuts yeah some going to need a few
tabs so again what I'm looking for here
just did you know effect so just so just
it's not something nice and then we will
talk a bit input dynamic so the project
is available to get up as well so I'm
going to give you the URL it's on
dynamit which is the name of our
research group in st lab and the product
is called jus flux twice you free of
awesome satellite you can fill time it
to food
then x yeah exactly ok so that's a
research project we have prints so we
are highlighted for example on the
Oracle website then it we have an allied
with the link to the article that you
date so if you want to get more details
you can and you can start to play with
it so again i'm going to switch to java
7 and i'm going to get back to so it's
taking a bit into the example with
drifting so the thing is this is going
to be a big bit crude because i'm going
to use jconsole which is absolutely
powerful i can say so just just to
explain this is a fairy well this is the
prototype with your research prototype
so it's not a product that you can use
yet what we are trying to make to make
it better for my use of it in front of
you and then and not using Jamie's
Council but it takes time and it takes
some budgets you have to share something
so i'm going to use biblio ridges we use
it as a build tool I'm going to you
launch an application which is a simple
application and well lots of logs but we
have we have the oh yeah and hats off to
freedom my coworker because he did this
absolutely brilliant GUI and the thing
is when you'd press go well you somehow
and try that's awesome right great job
Fred we love you so so this is the
application and what I'm going to do is
so this is running with a JVM agent
which is you and what I'm going to do is
well I to be in the good folder I'm
going to last jconsole and I'm just
going to go back because I need to
resume
this so this is hiking you can say and I
have a bitch with me because of the
Rice's copy it so I'm just going to
connect using this um so to my / other
Chavo it doesn't zoom yeah do you think
you can tell desktop presenter to focus
on one application but it doesn't follow
the same it all right well you don't
work huh okay I won't worry about it so
I'm just going to make it as long as I
can so we have an ambien and we can
connect to this ambient so one thing we
can do is we have three basic operations
you can bring us back before and after
and we can change the course I target
which means that we can change a method
life on the application so what I'm
going to do is we I'm going to go into
my cheat sheet so this is going to be
the target that I want to change so
there is a cruel name which the tie the
method and edit signature so this is
something we really improve in the
future don't worry about it we will
accept something and our you know agent
eyes but in the day miss console we need
to input values in a non-tree fancy way
there anyway and by doing that I have
changed nickel site so if I go back to
this application now I have changed the
font which is in metallics and brad is
nice but we can do better so if you want
to do better you get back to this other
example so we are going to change
another co side which is basically the
action listener mm-hmm so so that
something different is being done when
you press the button
so I'm going to change it I hope it
doesn't crash but when we do the demo a
DevOps you didn't crash so going to make
change it's been changed and now if I
click OK I should have gotten a picture
it doesn't work so i guess i'm not in
the right folder still having images but
there was a joke and you would have
gotten Duke but anyway it didn't work ok
so you started the app on a long folder
so the relative or friend Sonia yeah the
orphans along but instead about having a
control you have first joke and the next
time you click you swap between Jews and
that was Duke with the beer so you want
you I try one more time even watching
from home wrecker and see if it works
yeah we can show well I think but if you
get the dye jji at Ascot I think maybe
you can just talk about single day yeah
okay especially hello Donna in the den
right for real and then for fake so I'm
going to just terminate the thing anyway
so that's a project you can try and you
can try to reproduce the demo with you
know what you need vision Duke so now
we're going to see something about in
with an Emmy so before that I can just
give you a bit of context but what I
envy dynamic is so do you have an ID I
know a little bit so what is it so from
what I understand about how about
dynamic works normally if you want to
call Mathis dynamically you have to use
reflection calls so you'd have to put in
a call and I would go the reflection
libraries and look it up and then call
it the book down they added an
additional new by code and and exactly
how
but lets you short-circuit some of the
do what you can all my density to invoke
a method by name somehow this boom okay
so you're very close to what it is so
what you see now what you say is correct
a circuit so if you look at most dynamic
languages so before in vogue dynamic how
they are implemented indeed you have
lots of reflection and you have lots of
you know sometimes 40 generation on
stuff like that but but the point is
that this is slow and another problem
and why it is Lewis that they they have
to emulate the fact that you will call
something that will dispatch and so they
do that using you know traditional
objects and you ecstatic so you move
stack method and stuff like that and the
problem is that all the core sites or
wherever you call a method that should
be dynamic you end up into the same path
and the vm has lots of troubles to
understand how to optimize this so the
vm doesn't doesn't know how to inline
code and stuff like that so this is why
it gets so basically so within bogdana
me you have two things so as you said
you have a new by code so in your
classes you can invoke something but
this thing is going to be dynamically
balanced runtime and this dynamic
binding is going to be made using an API
which is in july seven java.lang not
invoke ok which is the new API so if you
want we can start with something that I
wrote for an upcoming article for oracle
oracle java magazine so this is a
spoiler for you today so what I have
here eyes you can start with just the
API and then we will get to the point
where we can generate classes with the
intro dynamic by code and see how it
fits so for example if you want to call
the start with method in string then ok
which is what i have here so first thing
you need to have is a look at objects so
look at
jack is going to be something you can
use to to get reference to other fields
or methods on objects okay so for
example in my Luca Bob ject you could
use stuff like find construct or ghetto
cetera static method study gatherers and
you can also use reflective API so if
you have a method and then from
java.lang.reflect.method.invoke okay so
this thing called the method amble you
can think of it as being a function
pointer and I can see so it points to
something you can invert okay so by
using that I can use fine virtual to
find the go to start wait method in the
string class alright and the method type
is going to be booyaa because it gives
you back a boolean and it takes a string
as an argument okay so when I have this
I can use directly on method annual I
can perform in the vacations like in the
work with arguments and here as you can
see we pass not just one argument with
two arguments a string and a lot of
string the first argument is what you
put the receiver type so because it's a
virtual method the force' going the
first argument is going to be the I know
this reference so the instance that
you're going to invoke the method on
right what happened yep so except for
static methods the first document is
always going to be the receiver so
because you can switch back if you like
so when you do that you can say you
invoke the method start with on Java and
tells you whether it starts with J or
not same with groovy hello Gil the
gabion groovy another guy from the
French measure but anyway you can call
those
thought that was simple yeah but you can
do more fancy stuff so you can use what
work what is called the Conda natives so
you can you can take a method angle and
you and compose another method or based
on this method and oh so one so you have
a class called metal and all and you get
many Combinator's so I'm going to go
through the wrist which you can do stuff
like drilling so okay these are birds
and Combinator's but you could do your
own comment your own custom things up I
codes as well right well if you do your
own Combinator oh the problem is that
what all those Combinator's today so get
optimized yeah they have placed into the
vm just a group tonight ok so but you
have a good round of stuff so you can do
fancy things if you like ok so for
example here I can insert arguments to
say that i'm going to insert the first
argument to bj but not the frosted but
because zero-based it is going to be the
second one so in that kinda so we start
with j i can just say start with j and
that's just the receiver because which
what you get back is a method under with
just a receiver argument and here you
can save does java start with jes and
the screwy start with gina ok so this is
frost yeah ok that's all that nicer than
the first one yeah because being
purified yeah as before we say oh oh
maybe we should say it's a partially
apply method because otherwise purists
will just yeah that's enough so I hope
nobody mascara guys is looking at us so
that's just a basic example there is
another one which I call simple sample
to all right and here we have completely
different types so the goal is to show
you how you can adapt a close up with a
given signature to collide with another
signature and we are going to do
Ethel Anderson combinators to build
another adaptation so for example here I
have my print all method which takes a
prefix and an array of values and you
just pray in the values which which is
very simple so what i'm doing here is so
what I got when I want to get my target
method angle so this is a static method
such as get it and it has a type which
is void as the roots of value with a
string and takes an array of objects and
then I'm going to bind the first
argument to this string right so it
means that the prophets is going to be
this so it's going to be proven to this
and then i'm going to use another
Combinator which is goes as collector so
as character is going to take the
arguments and rub them into an array of
objects basically uh huh and the idea is
that when i have invoked with arguments
and those values they are going to be
pushed into were collected into an array
and eventually you get back to the print
or method and you get what you would
expect ok so if you run it just to show
you what you get one two three four
which is what you would expect but the
point here is that while you have around
you have a cool site that takes four
objects and you edited do something with
a string and an array of object and this
is something you have to do frequently
when you do the dynamic language on the
GBM ok so another thing where this would
normally you'd have to do something very
complicated to take intercept the
argument since yeah well you'll have to
you know write Java code that does that
but the difference here is that this is
done in a very nice fashion for the JVM
mm-hmm and the other thing is that the
JVM Henderson's method and all so it
knows how to know in 90 times sometimes
that's not perfect but is it getting
better as soon well this is a job for
the Oracle guys so
this is their job and they're working on
it so that's nice but this is just the
API right so at this stage you that you
have nothing with respect to bytecode
yes so if you want to bind a grow site
to a method angle you need something
that you call a bootstrap method so we
do this because when you have an antenna
making instruction you have so you have
a signature just like any other function
education and then need you need to
reference a bootstrap method and the
bootstrap method is going to be called
the first time you get to the cold side
is going to give you back a cool site
object that is going to remain with the
con side see what I mean so once you
have the call site and the cosine points
to some method angle and maybe you can
change the method angle and do stuff
like that so if you want to bootstrap
there is a minimal nature that you need
to have sorry here is a one such example
so you have a method you can name it as
you want but it needs to be studying
methods you need to give you back a cool
site is going to pass you a look at
object which is going to be the lookup
that is a variable from you from the
scope that you're doing the invocation
so you will be able to see the methods
form within the United from the course
ID so you only see the private method
you should be seeing and so on so it
just down to the visibility rule that
that you will expect you have a name
which is a symbolic name for the
function to be invoked and can be
anything you can have columns you can do
fancy fancy things inhale and you have a
method type so exam for example here I'm
going to get a static methods
so I'm just going to get method under to
my print all method basically just bind
the first argument make it a viable
arguments collector to put the values
into an array make sure that the type is
correct and then i'm going to give back
a constant go side so you have three
types of course sides you have a
constant cross eyed which is always
bound with the same method and oh so you
can change it and then you have volatile
co side and you double cross eyed so
mutable cross eyed as you know field
semantics with respect to motivating
whereas bridge volatile coresight as in
a volatile field semantics so it depends
what you want depends if you want the
threads to see the other immediately or
not but the thing is well for those cold
side you can make changes in fri and
that's it so this is the thing you so
this method should be the bootstrap of a
new dynamic instruction and then i will
need well this will give me a concept
that is bound up to eventually calling
this method through a Combinator chain
right yep so if i wanted to check that i
need to generate by code and to do that
there is the ace in library where is
love everybody used to spin around for a
while they aren't votes on top of it
does up yes a while ago i did an object
database nice so i needed to for the API
as I need to buy coconut relation sunday
dress i said 'i suppose this was the
only available the time didn't spectator
names us yet fight man didn't exhaustion
oh well ya and 18 is very nice to be
honest it's pretty simple so you had
their life before java effects uh yeah
yeah but nobody knows it your enterprise
stuff well so if you want to write by
code it's not really hard using
sm so what you need in that in this case
so you can use a sin to reach classes
transfer glasses or just right classes
depends what you like to do so in the
class writer which obviously is going to
write a class and then you have you know
an event epi pretty like you know
emitting XML events as a pro so you will
just omit ms so for example here we say
that I have wondered 7 compatible class
which is public which is called sample
three dot quarter that in your rates
from java.lang.object obviously and then
I will have a simple single method that
will be my main method so it's a static
public method and it takes an array of
strings and it's voice right and here i
will just write some code in it so visit
college just to say well i'm going to
visit the code inside the the method I'm
going to push to the stack two constants
so hello in world and this is going to
be written in the constant pool of the
class because those like constant values
so you can put in the object you can put
anything in the disk on stands to
prepare mine info dynamic invocation
well I need to first get a descriptor of
the the bootstrap method so to do that
for you can just have a string which is
a long thing which is training boring
which you can use it just method type to
eventually get a descriptor bag which is
more readable so you say it it's going
to take to give you back a cool side it
takes a look up it takes string and
takes a method type right so you use
specify that this method is going to be
in the software through class that you
had before and that you're going to
focus on the bootstrap method with this
time again and then you can go on to
proceed with the input dynamic
instruction
so the function that we are going to
call it console.log print and right and
it's going to take two objects so
remember here we have the signature with
two objects and it's going to be for it
and we are going to call a method that
excess trying and an array of objects
and this is why we had ye adaptation so
while doing that we will invoke the
method is going to print hello Andrew
mm-hmm so again we're back to head over
and well the rest of the code is just to
finish the class and alighted to some
fine okay so if i run it this just you
know what it does so if i want to show
you that that it works because it's very
important otherwise you wouldn't believe
me yeah i don't believe you well you
should also go to switch to Channel
seven again so this is something dropbox
made the commands in the article from
oracle and its input dynamic so which
which I should let us get published am
so so this is going to be published at
some point in the future so it's like
here it's in the kyushu that's Jenny's
Janos Nagy a piranha I cannot tell the
wife she's going to be first of me said
I won't say anything all right look for
an upcoming edition of Java magazine
which you should get obviously it's good
stuff yes pretty good self so I'm going
to sing the classpath say because path
and my class was what was the name the
name was some poetry to the core oh
alright Sam of three got color so you
get error world again and if you like we
can just decompile it just to see that
we have any luck dynamic instruction so
see and so here we see that we have in
Busan a hiker for real so really it
really works
I didn't she'd be the thing is well you
see in logan i make you see the name of
the method while in Russian that you're
going to call you have a signature which
is here to objects and you're watchin
nothing and there is something else
which is zero is well I could show you
by using verbals but it's a reference to
the bootstrap method so the first time
you get well you get onto this
instruction basically you're going to
call this bootstrap method gives you go
side and that is gone okay from here the
Jeep can monitor what's happening that's
employing overeat we if we're just in
line and make it as fast as you can yep
let's go crazy cool now that's that so
we've seen on aspectj bite my pan jus
fruit q flu invoke dynamic that's that's
a lot of that's all about hacking for ya
one hour yes so um I thing else you want
to show that I've been poking people on
the stream to give questions but I think
they're an archer that your bike a
genius no I think I was keeping all that
board so so that maybe they just left it
on I don't like it we might get some
questions and responses from the record
video as well mmm comfrey yeah okay so
on anything else you want you all right
well I laughing I'm done I'll have any
question something that that's what what
upcoming conferences are you speaking
but you know oh I have no engagement at
the moment I would have lost too good
today like slept in 14 t travel is
costing so I which dead works world this
year but maybe to divx France the box
France as its embarrass it's much closer
to us let's ask my next up tomorrow
Paris yeah price with Anthony so did you
know the nickname of Antonio no she'd
call him dr. love dr. Wow dr. oh yeah
you would like it really he's there now
we've been chatting behind his back if
ya if I tell him that now as a dumb toy
guy that's right what's right I'll see
recess mm-hmm it's actually tomorrow
tomorrow afternoon same time I'm gonna
be meeting actually a little bit later
on they in a afternoon ago be meeting
Antonia so check the stream schedule for
that this evening will have the room
directly on junk and with all the power
strip yeah but the Liam drug is better
than the first ring right and now the
visitor in France is called 11 Jack
listen love are like like haha yeah the
volcano volcano yeah or is it actually
wholesome la volcano is in camouflage
which is say two hours from here well
it's pretty nice charge and it's made by
friends so it doesn't hurt so I like
next trip alta all to come back and try
the to damage a lava jab yeah let me
call I thought they would all of us here
yeah the heads of is no good if you
bring it up on playa I was great sure
yeah the Alps the off strike was was
very nice as well as a little there
yesterday and they have a picture of
Chucky with some snow work so did you
have people from or I close didn't know
none of the guys from local office shut
up unfortunately so they have this look
good friend yeah these were in us so
it's about the young the teacup the
teacup Williams coming out of a on route
canary I think level the shape of that
volcanoes interesting i wonder if it's
designed to look like something it looks
like the rear wall you can see from from
the season yeah that's our special shape
although yeah yeah it's very accurate
okay alright cool well thank you hmm i
switch back Oh south Tony Tony Tony Tony
loss burger you're going to see the new
dynamic stuff well that's that's his
problem is he's at jacks w john this
week okay he's at a conference so he's
shooting it now mm-hmm I'm trying to get
some sleep
well thank you very much well I think
Steve thank you for the urgent and
hopefully on to the people will be
watching offline if any question just
being at just ping me okay what's the
best way that I can touch you are the
best ways so you can use my Twitter
handle you can just send me an email
well my polish yeah and while just
finding my email is pretty easy just
google me and we find lots of you would
have a website usually now easily
reachable but generally if you're
trouble reaching him you can always go
to my blog Steve on Java calm and
there's a contact form and we have on
another
Tony's Tony showing us the munich munich
druggie well okay there we go here well
shaggy drinking beer nice and bruno was
on last night their house the one who
does all the junkie can love this which
is very cool I want I want to jog in a
puppy it's much better these stickers
are nice but never top it frontier
secure it looks pretty good because you
have you can hit the you know the logo
of some manufacturer say it looks good
that's actually on one of Gosling's
original Duke illustrations so James
cows on duty the graphic awesome all
right cool well thanks everybody for
joining the stream and you join us
tonight for the the old jug ok thanks
