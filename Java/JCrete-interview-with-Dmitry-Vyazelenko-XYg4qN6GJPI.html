skipping interviews why Cook is official
heckler okay so we are recording so
weird the Jake Reed conference yeah or
unconference yeah I'm conference epic
okay on the island of Crete with some of
the smartest people in the world who
have oddly gathered around also one of
the most beautiful conferences yeah
force you know so tell me you're the
diss organizer of Jake Reed yeah I me a
little bit about what it is and you got
started with this okay I'm one of the
organizers there isn't a team there's a
Heinz kibbutz who was kick-started
junker stars kill Pepperdine sitting
next to us and actually I mean also
bunch of others involved also rabia and
so the idea of Jake Reed came about four
or five years ago and Hines was running
the time he's jealous specialist club
also kind of closed circle thing and he
announced that he's making the
conference and but 35 or so was showed
up for the first year I was huge success
the thing we run in in an open
conference format that means there are
no speakers keynote sessions this all
the stuff is being organized on the fly
but yet you seem to have a system for
everything well we we have a system
coined by Kim and K Tucker who who
taught us they didn't approach the first
two years and we have we capture
essentially for example the time-space
matrix day the schedule will build on
the fly what we have prepared we have
rules and principles and laws and kind
of on white paper on the walls so there
is a little bit of system so when you
enter any camouflage there is something
set up but but the biggest thing is
opposed the one where the 12 sessions
over it's over and that's one of the
principles of open space and that
should've five of them and that's one of
them yes and so enough about the the
unconference event excursions I don't
think that was in the original prints
yeah exactly exactly did
the biggest thing about Jake Reed is
that we are run either than half a
half-day format means the first half a
day we have sessions usually three
sessions per day and then second half we
spend in excursions swimming in the
ocean all kind of stuff and it's usually
very very exciting thing because we go
into a places which are not on most
aristocrats that's what we did in the
past science is showing us quite a few
exquisite places and every year we are
kind of enjoy new stuff like this
morning with either what is a five-hour
hard to get so I've Beach tow I feel
like you put in the whole day's work
before we even got here because we we
went to this way up place we hiked there
the whole time we get geeked
conversations hike in the water yes at
the beach and then we came back here and
we're stolen conferencing yeah so now we
have another three hours of unconference
that that's that's how it works and and
then DC we usually hope have thing we
call waiting talks where we are like
lightning talks in the sea that's
awesome you know like 200 so you have
somewhere two hundred meters from from
the shore and you are talking are you
worried about to see like picking up any
tips and tricks on ya I don't know they
might but then there's no flashy life
here around so it's quite safe yes for
us and for the sea life it's not being
contaminated with them yeah so it's also
fun cool so what else do we have in
store for the rest of the conference
this is only the second day second day
we are now in session two so we have
another seven sessions to go on till end
of the week that's the main conference
part then we have on Friday a hackathon
that's going to be with you you're going
to do a hardware hacking oh yeah a
little hard work yeah I ciganda like
three or four hours of hoglah you have
what do you have in store I have nine
like oh my storm sets and 20 raspberry
pies and a whole bunch of sensors
accelerometers light sensors breadboard
its wiring yeah so okay they're alone we
could do cool stuff with it but together
we could create some pretty massive
this is awesome so that's all so much
looking forward to Friday there's going
to be like a nice wrapping up yeah don't
