secrets inside the engineers room and we
have here Pink Moon he is an engineer
almost 20 years working for Sun and
Oracle so it's a big pleasure to
discover some new devices and new
projects here he is also writing a
series of articles about startup and
hardware and Jonathan method so I don't
think hello Vinicius and thank you for
coming into my office where we're doing
a what's on Hickman's desk session so
unfortunately I've done a little bit of
cleanup here and sweeping up but maybe
you'll you'll find some food crumbs and
some things out of place but generally
this is what's the technology that I'm
currently playing around with and
investigating on my desk
very nice so what we have here today
ok so on my desk on this right-hand side
I'll start out with this free scow board
this is an iMac 6 port and it's a
boundary device saver light and what I'm
doing is running java SE e on this
device which is cortex a9 and that's a
armed v7 type of device where it
connects with Bluetooth you see the
Bluetooth device here with this pulse-ox
meter which is a pulse and oxygen sensor
and that uses bluetooth to talk to Java
SC applications running on that board
and so that one I've been testing and
using for the upcoming freescale
technology form conference and that's
going to be in Dallas Texas this week on
the week of April 11 and actually April
8th at 8 through 11 and that's one of
the fun types of demos that I'm working
on now but for my blog if you move over
a little bit to the left
what's on Hickman's desk is also a
Raspberry Pi and of course that's what
most developers use and that's what I'm
using on my blog
to do different types of blog posts
about do yourself projects and one of
the new yourself projects was using an
HEC Hexbug which is a little robot that
uses a remote control that can get
programmed by again Java SC running on
that Raspberry Pi
just like the imx6 board runs Raspberry
Pi runs Java SC embedded they run the
same way and you just write your program
once in Java and you're able to run it
anywhere so that's mainly what's on my
desk now I always run an LED project
that flashes these lights on my desk and
this just tells me that there's a Java
program that I wrote a long time ago
about a year and a half ago when the
Raspberry Pi first came out now I keep
it running just to make sure that Java
doesn't have any memory leaks or any
crash problems that a lot of platforms
and technologies have you can see that
this has been running on my desk for
four months now without crashing without
you know having any memory issues so
that's one thing that I always do on my
desk is is to make sure my my LED
project is running okay I have different
sensors and and you should recognize
some of these sensors yourself it's me
like this one's a IR IR type of motion
detector and if you plugged it in and
move your hand over it it would be able
to turn on and off the GPIO value so
that you can read it in your Java SC
device in your Java SE program and then
there's a blog series that I'm doing
right now it's called how to build your
own 3.9 billion dollar nest startup and
this startup would have a thermostat a
smart thermostat that's programmed in
Java SE embedded as the the outcome of
the project and right now I'm in process
you can see there's different components
there's this LCD touch panel and this is
a color LCD screen that hooks up to the
Raspberry Pi that plugs in with a header
board and
in process of soldering it I need to put
the header on it this is a relay board
so it's got switches on it and it also
has a header pin connector okay so that
you can relegate it but yeah for the
Raspberry Pi exactly and then what it
has here on the orange are different
connectors two relays on the board that
can be programmed by your Raspberry Pi
and Java SE embedded and of course you
know these relays can handle higher
loads than just a Raspberry Pi pins the
Raspberry Pi pins are only meant for 3.3
volts and very very small types of
current like you know you would use to
drive an LED but if you wanted to turn
up on and off a motor or your furnace in
your house you would need a relay and
these relays are more heavy-duty they
can handle more current they can handle
AC current especially if you wanted to
turn on and off your your furnace or
your air conditioner so you would have
to upgrade to using this to switch on
and off devices so that's another thing
that I'm working on is is from element
14 it's called the PI face and that
again you can program in Java to not
just in scene with your device it's very
nice yeah so my question would be why do
you think that for someone that is
creating a new start up creating some
device and creating the ecosystem behind
the device why Java is better and is
well prepared compared to like a
language like C++ or C that people use
to use for creating device why we choose
Java well that's a great question I
think with Java programming language
number one is the object oriented
programming language and you don't have
to worry about things like memory
pointers or or memory references that
way because you have garbage collection
but at the same time Java can handle
much more complex programming chores
like having a artificial intelligence or
having
things like oh I'm back on camera now
we're having things like complex event
processing things that make it much more
intelligent to run as a program on these
devices is making smart devices instead
of just internet dumb devices we wanted
to make sure that these have complexity
in them and one way to do that is using
Java 2 as a platform oh yeah because
we've this is a power with the power of
this board you can make a lot of things
right inside the device even if you're
not connect to the internet or in the
cloud yeah that's right you can you can
make it run autonomously on the device
but there is power also in the cloud
there's of course since we're Oracle we
can do things like have big data
analytics we can have things like
compacts complex processing other that's
also on a back-end to connections to the
cloud to so we also provide that with
our java api s and our java libraries
and our java platform that we learn on
devices very nice than just using the
java knowledge you can create the better
device the server-side
that's intelligence and everything just
with one platform yeah that's right
this is very very moved I hope you like
that that's what's on Hickman's destiny
yeah that's it thanks a lot to me
showing some cool devices and talking
about startup and devices and things
that you can do with Java platform it
will be very useful for all the Java
community thanks a lot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
