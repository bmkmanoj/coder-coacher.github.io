play minecraft this is the fifth video
in my minecraft tutorial series and
today we are going to talk about mobs
first let's talk about what mobs are
mobs are living mobile game characters
and mob is short for mobile so let's
take a look at them now I've already
created this world here where I have
this cage the modeling escape and I can
talk about them and enchant the diamond
sword to kill them at the end so mobs
can be spawned or created by spawn eggs
and now let's figure out where to find
them so I'm going to press e to open my
inventory and this is a creative
inventory where I have everything in the
whole game I'm going to go to the
miscellaneous tab which is a lava bucket
and here I have all the spawn eggs for
all the mobs what you would do if you
will hold them in in the hot bar and you
would right click to spawn the mob you
can also go to search items and search
for spawn and then you have all the
spawn eggs here some mobs aren't spawned
by spawn eggs we're going to talk about
those later now several commands that
are going to be important / game rule
has some game rules you can change to
alter the gameplay and these are all of
them and the names are sort of
self-explanatory did they tell what
they're going to do like dude a light
cycle I'll tell you like if it's true
it'll the day and night cycle will
happen if it's false it won't and like
mob beeping ma briefing is the one we're
going to use now if it's true which is
which is by default mobs can blow up
stuff and pick up stuff and all to the
gate world but i'm going to make it fall
so they can't do all that now there's
one more command / game mode and which
you can change your game mode so
survival is game 10 so I not on survival
and then GF is game mode 1 i'm creative
now and then
game mode 2 is adventure mode or you
can't break anything about the right
tool so I'm going to put myself back
into creative and now we're going to
talk about the first mob which is a
creeper so I'm going to find the creeper
spawning either for free just part of
paper and have a peep responded q
creepers are hostile mobs which means
shouldn't survival they will try to
attack you and they will and they will
blow up if they're near you so there is
like walking bombs and when I'm staring
in hi I pride so I'm gonna turn myself
into survival and show you what happens
you don't want to get cornered when
you're looking at the paper so here's
what is pleased about to go up and he
just blew up so if the game will ma
griefing was true then he would load up
all this stuff and also when you kill
them they will give you all done it I
just died that's happens when you're too
close to paper isn't gonna have enough
health so now I'm walking back to their
i will then flying back to their there's
here's another important point when you
die you drop all your contents of your
inventory on the ground so I take this
and now let's go back to what we were
talking about before when I kill the
creeper when I change its sword you can
get you get gunpowder which can we use
for certain things the next map we're
going to talk about is a zombie so I'm
going to get the zombie egg out now and
here's a zombie hihi you're burning up
take that dummbell they burn up
naturally in daylight so I'm still the
sky and you get water flush when you
kill them they also have some other rare
drops will talk about later and I'm
going to make it nighttime oops yep when
you have the caps lock on then commands
like this won't work so i'm going to go
ahead and spawn the zombie and you see
he's not burning up so i'm going to put
myself into so I'm mode and they even
tried to attack me they attacked by
hitting you the fist like that I'm gonna
kill now and I still them zombies can
also pick up items so if i put i throw
some rotten flesh down here with q I
just want the zombie only some zombies
pick up items this one doesn't want to
I'll try it another one he doesn't seem
to want to either but they say pick up
depends on the difficulty so now I'm in
hard mode and they should be picking up
items with it they're so until I guess
kill them both and that's pretty much
all for zombies the next map went to
talk about our witches which i think is
actually or actually going to evil so
I'm going to get the witch spawn egg now
and spawned
so which is have a hat and a purple robe
and a really big nose which makes them
look really funny when you kill them you
can get a lot of drops they also
regenerate naturally and have more
health than normal mops so they have six
normal jobs in three rare drops which
makes them a good place that good mob
for materials picture myself and to
survival and which here when I want some
healing potions because they can do lots
of damage to you so I'm going to take
the healing patient in here and then I'm
going to turn myself into survival and
the Woodson I try to throw potions at me
see through a poison potion and missed
me and now I hit me so it's giving
poisonous Illinois they throw poison
potions week with potions slowness
potions and harming potions or to mix a
million nine so then I'm on a first
question on myself to heal myself
possibly the other one to enjoy myself
back into survival you feed him so he
thought it looked like the spider and
the which are bad week which is actually
kind of funny it's funny to watch mom's
battle octonauts just kill the both die
you die too and at about dead and you
see the witch drop some spider eyes
sugar and gunpowder also now we're going
to talk about pigs and we're done with
the night and mops I think I'll make it
to daytime and now let me get the pig
egg out this what a pig looks like the
pink can have a curly tail and kill one
I got cooked pork chops because I killed
it with fire but if I just get a regular
dinosaur out and I got use fire then I
just get regular pork chops that's the
drop you can also ride them with a
saddle and control them with a carrot on
a stick so I'm going to spawn the pig
sat on and right click to sit on it and
then use a cure on a stick to steer it
it doesn't doesn't seem to want to go
anywhere which the only do so if if
there is working then they would steer
it would steer the direction I wanted to
look out working so when you're writing
a pay you the right click to boost it
and loading faster so I'm riding a pig
around this cage for no reason and then
i can press the left click I mean shift
left shift to get off and kill it when
you kill a pic of the saddle you also
get a saddle back there's one last thing
to talk about with pigs you can breed
them with carrots to get more pigs so
they have two pigs here if the carrots
they'll want to follow me also the
carrot then I can right click on this
one right click on that one and they're
supposed to make hearts but I don't know
why I'm not doing that and here we have
a baby pig you also get experience on
your breed pigs I'm going to kill them
all baby animals don't drop anything
when you killed on so now I'm going to
start now we're going to talk about
sheep I'm gonna get the egg out and some
died this is blue dye or lapis lazuli
and with what die is used for is
coloring sheep oops let the right click
on a sheep to color it and look at color
then can also share them I'm sure this
guy here and I get the color of will us
wearing you can get one two three when
you share them but you only get one of
it when you kill them sheep can also be
bred with wheat and when you breed them
if the colors they are our mixable then
the baby will become that color if
they're not they'll just come one of the
two colors so here I have a light blue
shoes now I'm just going to kill them
all now so as you can see i kill the
sheep and i got some wool by killing it
too and that's all the sheep
the next map will want to talk about is
an iron golem you go one of the mobs
that you don't need a spawn egg for and
there are also utility mobs that means
you can use them for specific purposes
to make an iron golden you have to make
a t-shape out of iron blocks and then
put a pumpkin on top the pumpkin has to
be last otherwise it won't work iron
golems have 50 hearts which is the most
like the most one of the most health in
the entire game they will also try to
kill hostile mobs like zombies for
instance I swung a zombie dinner I try
to kill it they also have very high
attack strength another one that's going
to kill the spiders and local most
hostile mobs but not all and that's when
you kill an iron golden you get asked it
takes a long time to kill them you get
iron and roses when you kill a higher
and golden and that's all right and
golems the last moment to talk about our
withers they are type of boss mob and
also don't need a spawn egg to be
spawned so I need soul sand and wither
skeleton skulls spy on and so on let me
make this T shape here the sauce in and
then put the wither skeletons goes on
top and they have a health bar top which
means they are boss mob and they make a
giant explosion when when you first and
they get initialized so do that and
right now he's going off to kill mobs
because they will kill any mob except
for supper undead mops which basically
means all zombies and skeletons they
also have 150 Health's hearts of health
and will drop nether stars when they're
killed and if i type I'd to damage to
him he will try to kill me too they also
give you the skull hope to give the
effect wither unmade hit you which is
basically like poison and that's it but
will withers so let's summarize what we
learned today we learned
what a mob is how to find the mob spawn
eggs and how to spawn them and also
about some different types of mobs
thanks for the seeing and happy
