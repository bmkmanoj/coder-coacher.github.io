native I'm here with Michael and myself
Toby some Michael guys probably know is
from Oracle and I'm from IBM so some
disclaimers so today we want to talk to
you about project Panama what is it why
we're doing this what's the purpose of
this project so in short project Panama
is a great way to do native inter up
Panama will allow you to describe native
data types exceed types vector types
read length types so you don't need to
do the tricks like putting pointers
lungs or using unsafe and byte buffers
with you know tracking offsets to
represent structures Panama will provide
you an easy way to but to do that I'm
also Panama supplies a new calling
mechanism so if you want to use a native
library you don't have to write Jane I
wrappers for every function interested
in Panama will greatly simplify that
process while leveraging the new types
available so you get a call of safety
and security and with these things you
can take advantage of the new modern
hardware that's coming out a lot of
these devices have C bindings or
libraries that you can call to interact
with so Panama will greatly simplify
that process before I go too far i
should say approach panama will not be
completed in 9 and it'll come out in a
later java version a lot of the work i
will be talking about is based on my
power prototype at IBM and this will
differ from michael's prototype so to be
aware if you see some differences this
is very early so a lot of this is just
to explain abstract concepts but it's
not spect out by any means
so just keep that in mind so just give
you a little overview of the major
components of Panama so they're our
header file extraction tools a groveler
this is a tools basically read in native
data structures and headers and this
tool as you'll see in the next slide
will output a layout description which
will be used by llarowe in time there's
also the layout description language the
purpose of this is to is provide a
standard way to describe native types
there are runtime libraries that let you
access structured data on heap and off
heap and also native function calling
mechanisms to do calls from a JVM c++
and intrinsic types to leverage flexi
instructions so here's kind of how it
works you take your native structure
definitions and you feed it into the
growler the groveler outputs layout
description and interfaces there's our
faces kind of combined layout and the
karyotype through accessors so I tell
this to linked and the runtime libraries
instantiate the interfaces you get
allowed layout instances native library
instances also runtime libraries provide
a way to allocate memory on and off heap
arm and also provide you know platform
dependent functionality so here is a
little walk through God just an example
of what I just said so you will under
left you start with your native
structure definitions and then I get
scrawled and then you get a layout
description and interface so this is
this is based on my prototype and this
is this is not really what we think this
is a
early version of a layout description so
this is all subject to change but just
to give you an idea of how this will
work so you have your layout description
and then you have your interface and for
each member there are three Exeter's
want to set one to get and once you get
the address of so here's a little
example of how that works and then this
lets you and so this is just to show how
you get to use it so with the library
api's you can allocate memory and then
you know get a layout from that and then
you know p can poke at the at the bits
and then on the right is just an example
of the equivalent that you can do in c
so at this point i hope it's clear you
know the different pieces of panama how
the sort of fit together um now i want
to talk more about the layout
description language i want to motivate
why we need a language a layout
description language and you know what
should be in it so on the basic problem
is that we need a standard way to
describe native types different
languages has different types you know
there's see int there's the cobol
complies even on the same language same
type has different layouts instant logs
and see will vary depending a few ILP 64
LLP or lq 64 um and then there also
these types that you know are types that
are difficult to describe in java so we
need a way of sort of getting all the
layout information into a standard
format that we can use also we need a
way to describe access behaviors how to
interact with the data um you know
different compilers has different
behaviors for volatile there different
rules for atomicity so when we want a
way to capture this information so we
know
how to interacting with the data in a
way that's predictable to users but we
can't encode every type access pattern
or access behavior in the LDL so we want
to the goal is to come up with minimal
set of constructs that ascribed appears
we're interested in while letting users
build on top of that to do more complex
things so I decided to split you know
the components of the audience to cut
into three categories memory layout
which of course is very important access
behaviors you know how to interact with
the data and type information how to
give meaning to their data some of these
are more important than the others and
some of these I would argue or not
really essential failure so for the rest
of the presentation I'll try to motivate
which of these belong in the LDL which
of these could go to different layers so
in terms of memory out I think this is
it's clear that you know being able to
describe where data is is very important
so to this end we came up with some
concepts to facilitate this so the first
is a container it simply represents a
sequence of bits where sizes multiple of
8 bits so very similar to a primitive
and then when you put these together you
when you have a composition of these
containers you have a layout because we
also being able to interrupt with
magnaflow max network formats is
important as an important use case we
need a way to describe types that are
they don't fit the pic granularity so
how's a bit field which is similar to a
container except there's no sighs
constraint it can be any size but has to
fit within a container and then lastly
have a n unis rule where it basically
describes which bites the most
significant in the container here's a
little picture that kind of
how all fits together so in order to get
these types you have to kind of combine
it together so here's some operators
that let you do that composition
basically takes a container it combines
into another one um if you don't have a
container begin with and it's just the
first container this internally
increases the offset so that your next
container starts after it um and that's
the similar except it takes an existing
layout definition and inserts it and
then increments offset by the size the
replicator operator just basically
repeats an operation and i'll talk more
about that later on and the union resets
laughs about zero so that lets you put
continuous in overlap lets you overlap
containers and the pad operator
increments in offset so here is an
example of a fairly complex trucks um is
this how you would use operators to
create these types so the first two
fields and be your basic compositions to
each other and then third feel there's a
nest so you would mess that um the
fourth field is an array so you have an
array of eight bytes so you replicate
composition of about eight times and
after that it's a little more complex we
have a union so we compose the first
member of the union then we use the
unity which we set external upset and
you pad your way back down so now you're
aligned with first field again and then
you compose it so now you guys enf
overlapping and then messing enter the
union if you keep in track of offsets
right now we're on a 4-byte boundary and
we have eight but field coming so we
need a to pad the rest on a 64-bit
platform so that's the pad for and then
at the end its and at the end we compose
another eight bytes so um you know as I
said I this is
you know very still in a prototype phase
it's nothing nothing you know I'm not
proposing any specific grammar but you
can see you even with these operators
it's very easy to compress this data you
know if we just change all these words
into letters we can get a very compact
representation of layout so now I'm
going to talk about access behaviors and
basically this describe rules for
instructor in the data so one of the
concepts is very important is alignment
this basically describes how you lot to
allocate you know load store and do
tommix with a certain piece of data so
you know we feel like this is something
that should be conveying conveyed in the
LDL I think it's a property of the
layout and not the members which means
that they will let you over line on
cases like compressed objects or let you
underline and things like packs objects
concepts like Adam icity and volatility
we would argue that those better suited
for layers above the LDL there's a lot
of variation in how these things are
interpreted and we don't want to encode
that count complexity an option is to
use might be to use var handles to build
accesses and top of layouts or may
provide some annotation mechanism to
supply information that you know
depending on vendor may infinite or may
not but these these annotations in law
and not expect they're just a kind of
like you know compiler options that you
add so now type two names karyotypes
basically a java representation of data
I would argue that these are not sexual
failure because this information is
already contained in the interfaces so
there's no need to have that redundancy
register types as far as purely if you
if you really want to describe layouts
these are important but when you want to
start interacting with the data these
will be important for function calls so
this is one that kind of not made a firm
decision yet but it's something that
will that we need to think about and
then names our dog you are the same as
karyotype this informations already in
the interfaces so it doesn't have to be
in the LDL as well so next I want to
talk about variable types there are some
types that are difficult to represent in
languages like C and Java and you know
there are some use cases for these types
so many steps like Java class files
upper left types are very hard to
represent in you know traditional
structures so previously introduced the
concept called replicator this was used
with a static constant so it's never
changed but if you use replicator with a
variable then you can you can create a
wider range of types which I'll aim to
show so here's the first example we had
similar to the first temple we had you
know is the basic array where we you
have a replication but it's fixed so
there's you know nothing special here
it's simple to deal with but in this
case on the top we have an array where
the size depends on the field before it
so there are additional concerns with to
consider there and in a second case we
have an array of these things so we have
you know an array of variable length
things so the issues here is know how do
you determine how much memory you need
for it
you don't know this ahead of time can
have to walk through it what happens if
you can change the repeat count when if
you are aliasing this data you may have
instances where one has a certain view
of the data and other has a different so
there you could easily create
inconsistencies also access time will
start to vary this may come as a
surprise you know you acts as a field
first time it's fast and then you access
feel that follows it's very slow so a
lot of things to consider there and then
the next example are is cases where the
the size of the length of an array is
not simply a constant or a member it's
an operation on a member an example is
the person pool in a java class file
it's not possible count as constable
count minus 1 or on a TCP header you
know the options feel exists if the data
is greater than 5 so in these cases um
it's not feasible to create to allow to
create a variable length race for every
you know every different variation so we
need a way to kind of let users to
provide that information and let the
layout runtime pick it up so here's a
basic were sent here is a solution that
we are playing with basically you would
implement either a complex verbal a
three or a privileged one the only
difference is that complex one takes in
the value of the number and the
privileged one takes the pointer in
philly out what this would let you do is
that you would employ this function and
describe the how to determine the length
of the ring and then the layout runtime
picks this up and that's the right thing
so here's an example with
simple so you in your layout description
you would say valenta is determined by
this member and this class and the
runtime puts the two together and then
when you want to determine the size it
calls your routine and and you know uses
that instead here's a more extreme
example with constant pool entries as
you know these will hospital entries
have many different types and they'll
vary in size so using the same approach
you can just you can describe constable
entries so this is kind of where we are
with variable types I'm still a lot of
work to do it terming you know how many
use cases as covers is it complete
solution is this important for Jeff
users do drive users actually care about
variable types can we do this while
providing safety and performance so we
still a lot of work to be done in the
future on this and there's a prototype
on github if you're interested that's
right now I only does the simple I've
ever left types but i'll be updating
that soon and i'll put examples of the
things i showed and more legal notices
so i'm going to talk about two different
things i'm going to start with let's see
if i can find the right presentation you
know we are um so i'm going to start
with the very personal disclaimer I'm
gonna following up follow it up with a
more personal disclaimer um so
everything i say is lie but also I as
Toby already pointed out we are
prototyping things and researching and
playing around with things so I'm going
to show you some things today don't
expect that to stick things will change
names are in many cases unfortunate
right now it's just placeholders we came
up with because we didn't know better at
the time so things will change deal with
it did you know by the way that you can
buy these glasses they're actual
sunglasses they can't be
it's pretty amazing um okay so I'm going
to talk more about the the binder part
of this in the wrong time part of this
and then the second part of my part of
this talk will be a demo of what we have
so it's not just slide where we're going
to want to show that we have something
actually working as well so the binder
part is the thing that takes these
generated interfaces and the associated
meta information we have and generates
runtime implementations of that so that
you can actually perform these calls
into native so so that's part of what we
supply at runtime we're also providing a
few other different things so for
example the library manager so in
obviously now you're starting to play
around with libraries more explicitly
and system load library on you know it's
as much as that loads libraries it's not
going to be providing all the
functionality we need so we need to be
have a more powerful way of dealing with
libraries and still be also touched on
we need primitives or helper functions
and things for allocating and dealing
with memory and data so allocating and
accessing in all of these things and
again I'm going to touch on a few of
those things today I the things I'm
going to show today will be referring
obviously two types in various ways Toby
already touched on the fact that there
is a difference between the native types
and the Java types the carrier type we
use on the Java level to represent
whatever we have in native we've made in
our prototype for now the simplifying
assumption that if it's sort of spelled
in on the sea level we're going to call
it in in Java as well and we're going to
blindly assume that they're the same
size and things like that that's clearly
not going to work in the long run we
need to make that way more flexible but
for the time being and when you see me
do things today it's it's something to
keep in mind that it's a simplification
of the real world these types that we
the whole combat concept of converting
between carrier native types it will be
building on the layout language in some
way shape or form and one of the things
that we have introduced and I think both
Vladimir and II
later will potentially be referring to
our vector types so to represent wider
vectors on x64 platforms for example we
have introduced something called long
too long for and long 8 and they're
basically what you'd expect them to be
they contain multiple multiple different
long fields but can be sort of treated
like a vector and we are currently
translating the the vet you know the 256
bit vector type on the native side will
be along for on the Java level for
example but again more work definitely
needed in that area so the binder a
prototype we have has a couple of major
functions maybe methods for weaving
implementations for taking one of these
interfaces and providing something to
you that you can actually use we have
the raw version which is sort of the
low-level it will give you something you
can work with but it may not necessarily
be easy to use if I put it that way what
we're also playing around with and I'll
show an example of this in demo later is
something we call the stabilizer which
will effectively take this very
low-level API up level it the canonical
example here would be a see string
clearly you as a Java user of this
library of this functionality want to
pass in a java string and have it be
automatically converted in some way but
there may be other cases like that as
well so i'm going to show a couple of
demos of that the binder we have
somewhat simplified or very simplified
it takes a number of different arguments
so it takes for example the symbol
address of whatever function you want to
call or whatever variable you want to
access the layout of that on the native
side and the java method type or the
type we want to represent on the java
level and then it magically weaves an
implementation and there are surely
there are a billion different ways of
doing this but we generate bytecode and
yeah that's about it I guess and as part
of that you obviously need to take
whatever karyotypes you have and split
them up or
do whatever conversion is needed to pass
that eventually into the the native
function placing things in registers and
stack positions and whatnot you need to
obviously call the function and then
coming back you need to do the opposite
any return value needs to be boxed or
whatever the the operation is back into
something that makes sense on the Java
level so I'm going to show you a few
examples of that just to put it into
perspective perspective I'm going to
mention a few types and I'm going to go
through these slides really quickly it's
just to get you know sort of a feeling
for what we're trying to achieve here
and again type names may change know
that this is this is not an inheritance
chart in anyway it's it's a few types we
have and they sort of use that maybe the
edges are more it has than anything else
but these sort of build on each other at
the bottom we have something called the
scope scope is all these are by the way
interfaces but I'm also going to be
talking about them when I talk about
this it's not just the interface it's
also actually the implementation in the
background because currently we
basically basically have one
implementation / interface but the
theory is that this it you know we've
chosen to make them interface and then
we'll try to stick with that in order to
make it easy to to combine them in
various ways so scope is something you
can allocate memory from somewhat
simplified it keeps track of the memory
you allocated and it also checks if you
want to access the memory it provides
functionality for checking that the
memory is actually still live so that we
don't use it after it's been freed and
so on we currently have two different
implementations of this in a prototype
one called native scope which is well it
allocates memory in native using malloc
or unsafe allocate memory and we also
have a prototype i'm going to say at
this point we're not really using it in
the in the bindery explicitly are but
there's one heap scope as well and
that's basically allocating a byte array
and giving you the same functionality on
top of that so on the higher levels
you're not supposed to
care really about where the memory is if
it's on the job on your native you could
easily imagine and I started playing
around with a scope that allocates
memory in non-volatile memory so in the
backing and implementation you and map
the file or use the nvm library to to
get memory and so on so on top of scope
we have something we call memory region
a memory region is continues contiguous
area of memory contiguous area memory
and it can again be on or off the Java
heap basically it's a combination of a
base pointer in an offset or if the this
memory region is in native memory that
base pointer will be null and the offset
is the absolute address so this is sort
of the standard to register concept that
we have an unsafe as well and what the
memory region does in addition to using
scope underneath to make sure that the
the memory is still live is that it also
adds bound checking on top of this we
have an implementation called bounded
memory region and before any access is
made to the memory we make sure that
it's bounded in all that this is all an
attempt to make sure that again it's
back to it we don't we on that we will
put still i'm pretty sure be providing
your ways to shoot yourself in the foot
but we want to try to be better than
just encoding pointers in longs so you
know we want to provide these additional
checks on top of it and at least try to
make the world slightly easier there are
challenges i should say we have
something called a layout type so this
is the other leg now which combines the
carrier type in the native types and
sort of keeps track of how those can how
does relate to each other and how they
can be converted back and forth not
going to say an awful lot more about
that a pointer then combines a memory
region with a layout type so this is
where we sort of have all the
functionality baked into a pointers we
can do anything from excessive and get
data but at the same time checking
balance and lightness and also combine
that with type checking so we know that
what we're accessing is the right thing
and the theory some nice Theory here is
that you can basically hand out a
pointer to anybody and you don't have to
be afraid that this anybody does
wrong thing with it because it's bound
checked and checked for you to be proven
you can do the expected things for the
pointer i guess you can offset it you
can cast it one thing to notice is that
if you offset a pointer even even if you
offset a pointer outside of its bounce
that will still work because that you
can do the exact same thing you see as
well you can have a pointer which points
into some weird memory somewhere and
that's fine as long as you don't access
it and finally we have something called
reference and references basically the
same thing as pointed these are the the
exact same concept as you would have in
like C or C++ so you have a pointer you
have reference reference can't be null
and this is what you use to get the
actual data and it also performs the
checks so again this that was very quick
walk through of the various types we
have in the prototype today which will
hopefully be helpful when we go through
the demo but so to summarize basically
what this gives you is and this is a
it's a made-up example the syntax isn't
actually reflecting exactly what's in
the prototype today but the general
theme is still that you create this
scope and it sorta closeable and
normally we would expect you to do a try
with resources you allocate your pointer
and you do something with it and in this
case I've the made-up part here is that
I've allocated memory that is read-only
and why somebody would do that is
questionable but at least on line 3
you'll get a pointer it's 42 bytes
online for you're reading that that
that's good you'll get the reference and
you will in the next step on line 5 i'm
setting a value but again since the
memory was read-only will get an
exception that's you're not supposed to
do that on line 6 I offset the pointer
it was 42 bytes of memory now I'm
offsetting it 247 11 so that's clearly
out of bounds but again the pointer
offsetting operation is okay that that
is that is ok but on the next line I'm
then trying to actually access the
memory and
reference the pointer and that's where I
get the exception and then finally after
the scope has been closed the memory is
actually now deallocated and if I try to
do the same sort of operation i try to
dereference the pointer get its value
then I'll get some kind of use have to
free the exception term so that's sort
of it in a nutshell so that it's
outlining at least the sort of
functionality we're trying to provide
I'll quickly also mention that we have
we're going to have to work on various
helper methods for converting between
native and carrier types and one of the
ones we already have is something called
a transformer which does a sea or native
strings to Java strings and back and
forth so converting a C string to java
string is easy its allocated on the heap
so we don't actually need to care about
scopes and things like that but the
other way around obviously we need we
need to place this string or we want to
place this drain in native memories that
we can pass it in to see functions and
then we do need a scope so converting to
a C string actually does take a scope
argument and converts or creates a
native representation of that screen ok
now for demo let's see if the demo gods
are with us I have created a small copy
of let's say a few key system functions
that I'm planning on using in theory I
should have used the gobbler to just
extract the system headers however it
turns out that system headers are really
complicated to parse they use every
trick in the book and then sums we're
still working on getting the groveler to
parse them correctly and produced right
output so what I did instead was just
copy the necessary prototypes however i
will be using this normal lipsy library
in the background so this is just a
shortcut for creating the interfaces
grovelling the interfaces so that I have
something to play with ok guess i need
to produce that as well
let me do this um no okay I'm gonna go
go bro go for broke um so I'm gonna do
I'm gonna run Jay extract yeah I guess I
have okay let me do that it's a low-tech
solution to this problem I'm gonna keep
scrolling up okay so I in some somewhere
in the background you'll just have to
trust me Iran Jay extract I gave it the
header file I asked it to produce a my
system jar with the graveled interfaces
in it and on top of that I gather the
parameter saying all the interfaces
should be generated into a packaged
called package called my package okay so
just trust me on that for now on oh this
is so gonna suck um how can they still
be a problem in 2016 um oh look look yes
excellent okay that's the closest will
get done Panama demos jvms simple there
we go okay so I'm gonna launch Jay shell
because all cool kids today use Jay
shell for their their demos and I'm
actually have a cooked command line um
I'm gonna give it some imports that I
don't don't have to do that up front I'm
gonna feed it in this my system jar file
which contains again the growth of
interfaces and then I'm going to in
order to work around a SOI have with DHL
which is the fact that the binder is
generating class is on the fly but Jay
shell doesn't recognize that fact it
doesn't know about these classes and I
haven't figured out exactly why this is
yet I've been trying to communicate or
work with the JCL guys to see if that's
something we can work around but they
are two different processes and there
are some MIDI going on so what I have in
the bindery is something that spits out
class files to disc as well just as a
debugging thing and that makes actually
Jay she'll be able you know can pick
them up between the other end and so
that's the rest of this weird command
line it's mostly just to get the demo to
be workable ok we have Jay show so the
first thing we're going to do is load or
bind that the nice new library of ours
so
as I said we have grovelled something
like this so the interface that what
gets created from this header file I
showed you is called my system and it's
in the mice package package and on top
of that we need to help the binder
figure out and this is something we're
working on improving we need to help the
binder know which library to look up
symbols in so I'm saying the default
library it's something that is already
loaded and again this will change as
well over time okay so we got an
instance back that's interesting let's
see what it contains for each
okay so we have a bunch of methods among
them we can see that there's something
returning in int called that yet paid we
have s and print F which returns an int
and so on and so forth so we have we
have an implementation now that's nice
and that's let's use that so I think it
was taller too so we're going to call
get fit and it wasn't dollar to it was
taller one okay yes we got a number so
is that the right number processes
handler handle current get pit this is
the sanctioned way of getting the pit
and they match lo and behold we called
get pitting we got the result back so
that's the canonical example Vladimir
show this last year so it's not exactly
surprising that this works I guess more
interestingly may be calling things like
SM printf for example and sm printf is
interesting because first of all it
produces a string it also takes the
string for the format and then we it's a
very org function on top of that i'm not
going to go into details if you want to
know more about how we've implemented
varg support come to the workshop and
ask questions but i'm going to try to
call that guy anyway so we'll need a few
things i'm going to need to allocate
some strings to pass into native so i'm
going to create one of these native
scopes and first of all i'm going to
allocate the target buffer into which
we're going to produce the resulting
string this again syntax will change to
keep that in mind okay well and as you
can see we get a bounded pointer now
representing some native memory
somewhere the next thing i want to do is
create the format string and by the way
what i'm going to do here is put print a
printf my pit is Coulomb presently so
we're going to do a to c string of my
pit is and we're going to need a scope
so this is telling the transform it to
take the java string and in the scope
allocate native memory and then copy the
bites the characters into the native
memory version
that now we should be ready to call sm
printf we're going to give it the buffer
we're going to give it the length of the
buffer we're going to give it the format
string and we're going to give it the
actual value of the present the argument
and we got 16 bytes of string back so
let's see what we actually got let's use
the transformer to convert to string the
buffer we allocated so this is now
remember s and printf is actually
putting out putting characters into the
buffer we supplied to it now we're
taking that buffer and converting it
back to a java string and lo and behold
it saying my pit is this and that how
many minutes do i have left negative two
or three okay okay i think i'm going to
do both things done or actually let me
skip the civilization later on so i'm
just going to say that another version
of this is using bind instead and
basically what you'll get is an instance
where you when you call sm printf you
can actually pass in the the actual java
strange let's say i understand that
there are questions immediately in your
heads on how that works and again it's
not foolproof in any way it's a
proof-of-concept thing we've done but in
theory at least you'll get a nice
civilized interface which takes java
strings instead of these nasty pointer
to bite things so it's easier views so
okay so the last part of this demo if
again the demo gods are with us the last
couple of minutes as well which they
obviously haven't been so far is it's
something at least I find interesting so
i found on the internet a GL opengl demo
so if you know about OpenGL there's a
library called free glatt or lot in
general and that provides a very
interesting primitive which is a teapot
you can win a single function called
create a teapot without actually having
to describe what it looks like it's just
a teapot so what I wanted to do was to
see if I could get there to work on the
Java side as well so on the left side
here you have the C implementation I
found and on the right hand side you
the Java implementation of it so my goal
was really to take the C code and makes
it as few changes as possible to it and
still get it to compile at work and the
idea here is that if you squint apart
from the the boilerplate import things
here at the top which again we may be
able to do something about it some point
as well you'll hopefully see the same
kind of code on the right-hand side yeah
it does look more like Java because
there's some instance variable I'm
actually calling these methods on and
the other interesting thing is I had to
add an F here on the float Constance
because otherwise Java Sea will whine
about truncation from double but apart
from that again if you squint and I
scroll down here it's going to look
roughly the same so hopefully if you
either have C code it's easy to convert
it or if you know how to write the C
code it should be equally sort of
trivial to do the Java version of that
that's the theory at least there is some
additional boilerplate down here for
loading the libraries which again is
something we're hoping to improve over
time and make more automatic but if I go
back to this guy please demo gods be
with us please them and I'm sure it will
pop up on the wrong screen I'll just
make it more interesting on open Yale
make me drunk so I what I did was I ran
the groveler on the DL the glut files I
compiled the job application and please
ok wrong screens let me drag it's over
here here we go ok this so this is the
teapot spinning called from Java right
ok and yes this is very final remark on
this one of the interesting parts of
this is where we're obviously calling it
a bunch of different glut see functions
but what we also are doing what the glut
library expects you to do is to supply a
few callbacks so every once in while the
library decides that it's time to
repaint something reshape something or
whatever it is and we have you know on
the sea side of things that looks like
this you just pass in the name of a
function so well let's say the idle
function here
is passed in as an argument on the Java
side it looks very similar and as a
matter of fact the idol function here is
called on it's an instance method so
without knowing the glut library decides
that it's time to call the idol function
and it it calls the c function pointer
that it has no idea will actually be
calling back up to java to an instance
method and and there's some interesting
magic behind this what i should say is
that we are likely to have to make this
slightly more complicated for memory
leak reasons but that's that it's a
proven concept so good that was it i
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
