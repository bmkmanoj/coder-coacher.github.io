today at Jack's conference and my name
is Helen Poitier and my guest today is
Simon birthday boday pageant hi I wasn't
sure to pronounce it in French in which
language so that's why is it a litigated
the French pronunciation and the Italian
pronunciation with the tea at the end is
is that was fine okay good that's good
so you had a session today I will have a
session in a couple of hours I'd be
talking about HTTP two and what changed
in the job I ecosystem related to age
should be too so so you did you you
actually talked a little bit about HTTP
one and then the difference also with
HTTP two so what was really the exact so
the the story is is very simple HTTP one
was a protocol that was designed 20
years ago and the web has evolved since
then and htp one is now forcing
developers of web application to
actually work around the limitations of
the protocol and so hb2 was designed
with all this new things that happened
on the web over the past 20 years and
since you've been designed with these
goals in mind to make the web better and
faster and more efficient then it is of
course a much better protocol for
today's web so it is you know normal
evolution of a protocol only that for
the web it took 20 years to actually
happen but it's finally happening and
the the benefits are really big so I'm
you know hoping to present this sessions
and convince people that HB 2 is a very
good choice and something that they have
to go and and at least explore at the
beginning and then possibly embrace it
as soon as possible so what are the key
I mean like you your favorite fit your
feature actually in the in this new
protocol there are two main features of
dhcp two protocols that are really
outstanding the first one is called
multiplexing
it's a technical thing but basically hp1
only allowed a limited number of
requests to be made in parallel to a
certain domain so to a certain website
depending on the browser implementation
this was for six or eight only request
concurrent the problem is that an
average web page today has something
like between 80 and 100 or more
resources to be downloaded and if you if
you only employ six connections you have
to make six requests and then wait for
them to come back and then make another
six requests and then wait for them to
come back which is very inefficient by
the time you have downloaded hundreds
Ursa's in this way a lot of time has
passed and users are very sensitive to
page rendering times and so your site is
going to be I'm going to look slow even
if it's not your fault as a developer
it's just a protocol fold it's it's the
protocol that is old so multiplexing
what it does is basically lets you open
a single connection to a single domain
and then allows you to send as many
requests is one in that particular same
connection so you can have like all the
hundred requests that you need to make
being sent over the network almost at
the same time and be returning you know
in depending on the server how it
process them but basically this makes
the round trips that you have to make to
retrieve the whole page much faster so
that's a huge benefit Anna I actually
have a demo that i'm going to present
that shows this and it's impressive well
and it's really impressive and it
normally gets like the people stand by
by the huge difference that this makes
so it is important minutes would you go
into a car or use a car that is 20 years
old and now you want to be on a new
shiny car so especially if it is the
speed of internet you're just looking
for things you make a mistake you want
to go back I mean it's yeah it's very
first of all my browser would you use a
computer that is 20 years old yeah
I want so exactly up song and I think
also the younger generations are just I
mean we are like still used to the
slowness of X internet but I know that
young lead a little worse because there
are a number of hacks to work around the
HTTP 11 protocol limitations that are
now considered best practices but
they're not really best practices
they're just hacks around the limitation
they shouldn't be there in the first
principle so HP to basically removes the
limitation and makes this best practices
completely useless because you don't
need them if you have a new protocol and
a new which is designed it better yeah
so so so you talk also about HTTP two
and and Java nine yes so so what what
will be new then in the with Joshua Java
right now doesn't have a an explicit
support for HTTP tune it is possible
with the certain amount of hackery to
get it working and that's what we do but
the german i will have built-in support
for HTTP two in particular it will have
a new library new API of an HTP to
client that it's going to be used by
developers to make HTTP to request to
servers so the new API is currently
under development we are discussing
interviewing the implementation and in
the API the API and the implementation
of this library but it's a simple API
that will get java developers closer to
http to and you know understanding how
to use it and be able to make requests
with this new protocol and get rid of HP
one eventually so it's a good thing for
developers so any resources or things
that you think that people should
definitely check ok so the the current
status of this ap is that it is under
implementation is under
view so it's not merged yet into the
main line JT canine Forester for the JDK
project however it is probably going to
soon be and as soon as it lands
basically developers will start using it
and and that's a good thing and then by
using a day of course can report back
there I hate backs and improve the API
or maybe ask for little features or you
know make the implementation more stable
by just exposing deployment a Shinto
multiple use cases so I don't know
exactly the times I cuz I'm not in that
particular group but I'm heavily
involved in reviewing implementation
because in jetty we add this
implementation for more than I think one
year and a half now and so we have
gathered experience about how to do
things and now people is actually the
jetty community is actually using HTTP
two and so we can you know we're more
than willing to share this experience
with the openjdk guys and make this
implementation really cool so what about
HD HD db2 so do you have like a
resources or some things that that you
think I mean maybe with tips on how to
do so the good thing about hep-2 for a
web application developers is that they
don't need to change their web
application in order to make it work
with HTTP two they just need to deploy
their existing web application as is
into a an HTTP to enable the server
container for example Jerry but also
tomconn nine will have a should be to
support in undertow from reddit or
Nettie or I mean there are a lot of
project that are already a should be to
enable so that's that's the good thing
then on the other side they need a chibi
to requires
encryption so one thing the developers
or especially the people that deploys
web application needs to know is that
their website now needs to be over SSL
over TLS and so they need to for example
by a certificate or use a certificate
not necessarily buy it because now there
are entities that provide certificates
for free and so but it's one thing that
you need to be aware of that hep-2 is
going to be deployed in an encrypted way
so it's an important thing to remember
other than that jeddah canine as I said
we'll bring the capability for
developers to make a cheapy to request
and servers are already up to date as I
said Gerry Duncan 9-under tonetti there
are a number of them they're already
supports hb2 so hb2 is already here ok
so it will be easy than four folders so
that's good to know no that's a not
every day that we hear that yeah yeah it
just needs a little bit of awareness at
heb to is there that is stable that its
production ready and people needs to
plan for switching to it because the
benefits are really big and you know
every big players every big website in
the world has moved already to HB 2
exactly because it is so much more
efficient that there are you know
they're rendering times their businesses
is benefiting from this so great well
thank you for for the message for the
pleasure for the information and good
luck with the session this after
thanking thank you thank you so much for
joining and I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
