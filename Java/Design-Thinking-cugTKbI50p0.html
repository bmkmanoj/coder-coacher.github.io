design thinking and user interface and
now this is really really cool things
we're going to talk a little bit about
design thinking and adduce is also soft
developer yeah I have been developing
Java and all the technologies for quite
some time and it sparked by you yes okay
inspired by me thank you so and more
than that I peeled some works for IBM
yeah right so you're here so do some
tell us a little bit about why Design
Thinking is important for developers
well that's a question that we are
trying to answer every day by day and
especially for companies like ours like
an Oracle and IBM this big enterprise
and you have a bigger process and trying
to get in with the agile process then we
now have this kind of a design thinking
process and so sorry so what is design
think you should begin with well right I
mean it's just
Israeli we just started talking about UI
and anywise but it is not what
scientific take care of design think you
take care of about the experience of the
users now all kind of users are trying
to interact a few things interact
digitally and physically then you really
have to to think about how you're
interacting with this the Sphinx and
then thinking it's a kind of a process
but it's much more a mindset that you
when you start developing it serves a
product you have to get the user talk to
the users understand the users
perspective when using your product and
yourselves that's the point getting you
call that user centric design you put
the user at the center of the process
the development process and the building
process and for developers well
everybody knows that are trying to do a
kind of a joke here in Brazil like oh
the
problems is the user the problem is the
user and and then you don't talk your
users you just want to do our code and
programming but also you get that
knowledge about the perspective of the
user you could understand what is what
has have a lead to the users right and
with that you can deliver our work much
better and not wasting our time
developers something developing
something that our business manager or
some analogies and Alice just ask you us
to do that then you're focusing and
outcomes from the users okay very cool
so so we are here we fiducia katya
master of design thinking talking here
and we are actually out of your hammers
who is speaking in english because we're
transmitting all over the world to the
night hacking interviews so i do some so
you know so basically the whole idea of
design thinking we are trying to to
think about the whole experience of the
user and really if you if you want to do
you know you're going to create your own
company create your own product if you
don't think about the user experience if
you don't have a good user experience no
one is going to use your product right
yeah sure pitching the product and today
with a lot of the the user experience is
on the phone for example
right now a mobile app actually you have
to have less features and be more useful
to use right so all of these all of
these design thinking thing about yeah
yeah especially because and you're not
developing mass products or not for the
big markets you are trying to understand
it's kind of mental model of the users
then you design for them and at the same
mobile app or website or landing page or
software has different experience for
different kind of users if you are
talking like it we have like a iot
platform we have almost 22 personas
different kind of users interested in
that platform
you can't treat everybody is in the same
experience you can't deliver the same
experience for all an octet has a
different kind of experience then he
keep their focus and understand describe
the product what what is the capability
and then talk to the business side and
as a developer you have different kind
of needs we want to know how it works
how I can work with that how I can try
is that our kids go over try and buy
very quickly now but let me let me ask
one thing but isn't it so design
thinking is thinking about the whole
user experience right yeah but isn't
this something that someone else has to
worry about I mean you know the
marketing guys or the architect or I
know we developers we only develop the
code right so why do we need to worry
about this thing that's a really good
point because that kind of this mindset
is design mindset it's something that
it's not not its own it's by design team
its own bar ever every people in the
company can own that because they want
the major Jeeter pillars of that it is
empathy
everybody can develop empathy with
people and if you're in a business or if
you're in marketing if you're in the
developer or a designer any kind of
people can developer developing empathy
and koala bear collaboration is
something that join a Kent can join you
can join that team with a business
developer is a designer and architect
and they can't they have to collaborate
in the design thinking process means the
process that bring the people together
to collaborate in hand with the empathy
right working together radically then
that's the point and when you you're
talking about design is not something
it's not a department in the in the
company it has to be an an outcome is a
mindset like agile it is a cultural
change it's not like a a bunch of tools
to use it in just a brainstorm meeting
it's something that you create a culture
I can I can set by IBM IBM we are
developing the IBM design the enzymes is
responsible for developing the culture
of design transforming products to
experience right then
developers designers then which desires
you can get like specific design things
like our UX designers from the front-end
developers and visual designers user
research all these guys are working
together with developers and architects
engineers to create things together like
it a big workshop to understand how is
the persona
how this guy this user is different than
that and how they are experience our
difference and when you do that the
developer share the knowledge about the
user then a le take a hit kidding take
they would much more care about the user
that's very long it's like it when your
development directed to someone that you
know what the user wants right you go
straight to the point you don't waste
time polishing the things oh my design
is very good my stature is very good
know what the user would needs are
delivering value to the users that's the
question that developer can ask right so
that's that's really interesting because
when we start our developer careers
right we usually develop a software for
someone that we know right you know we
try to solve a problem that we have or
probably someone that we know we have
and those softer right really cool
because they actually solve real
problems then a lot of times we get we
we go up in our careers and then we
start getting farther and farther away
from the user and then suddenly we're
writing software we don't even know to
whom right so the whole idea is that so
you think that design thinking
developers can can kind of take
responsibility for the whole work
because they're not only thing about the
feature only about the code they have to
think about the whole system yeah well I
cannot say about the whole world but as
a developers you're you're you're used
to digging up and
the research about the code and forums I
understand the real problems where you
would do that every time right and if
you expand explain that kind of
knowledge to the users and needs I think
it's more comfortable and with that we
have more power to discuss the solutions
you're not just doing things by just by
dude sometimes you want you to code
something very quickly but when you
really know what is the need you can
share the business decisions that's the
point is bringing the developer is
empowering the developer to to discuss
the business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
