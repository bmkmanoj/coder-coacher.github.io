stream from da box 2015 my son why must
I am here with the drunkest Aras and I
Dmitrievich I Inc oh yeah yeah so they
want to talk about bit about Jake Reed
to probably hot the shower conference
nervous so it's a unconference kind and
it's a think it's a personal child
somehow from from John like being a
Greek and being free yeah and a lot of
other people like like a boutique
Pepperdine we all contributed with ideas
and stuff and we have a lot of
co-organizers people like Dimitri who
also is the hottest you know coordinator
on the planet will get us wrong I guess
yeah maybe it's attentional probably so
um so you're organizing John and Kimmy
tree you're just organizing yes yeah so
tell us about it how does it work so you
want to start and then I okay and
basically my role in the whole show is
that I'm running the open spaces part so
it's unconference but actually we use
open space technology behind the scenes
so people come together on thursday and
we all throw in the topics and we
organize the schedule for the whole week
and my my part is is making sure we do
that and you know watching what's going
on during the week helping people out
and stuff and these guys John Hines
carica yeah they they're basically the
minds behind the thing that they make
sure that the whole conference happen
and I make sure that whatever happens
during the days will happen so so you
help organizing the people organizing
the content and John is helping
organizing location
what versions yeah some peaches yeah or
now we have this all you know hacking
sessions that you were very fond of this
year yeah so we're going to have a lot
more hacking sessions this year mainly
but the main thing is that it's not the
typical conference where you just come
there and you just gave a plan you know
we're rescheduling advance with people
are taking effort to make the plant
before we just come there and they just
put ideas so everything is organized the
first day if you go to a website for
example there is no plan for next year
the video you know we're not going to
make one so everything is self-organized
that's why it's called in on confidence
yeah that's great so you just travel
related topics or whatever you want to
talk about or from yeah primarily it is
about Java you have Jane the name is
Jake Reed right but we have lots of
interesting people come in and usually
we have talks about a no process
management how do you deal with people
Cody views and different selves also
language neutral as well yeah and what
is interesting is that over the years
we've seen some some family members come
as well like children or even wives come
in a tent talks and unorganized talks on
some interesting topics so this is a
complete family event yep yes okay it's
like a little vacation lots of people
bring their families and they spend the
whole week or more with more than one
week concrete and this one week where we
have a conference we just spent half a
day in the sessions in second half a day
is fun activities which John usually
helps to organize excursions and visits
to different interesting places and
stuff so the discussions then go on on
the beach and that's true or or by the
bar you know in this way by the swimming
pool or wherever you want and I tell you
most of the times there are more
important discussions and ideas coming
up there than in other than in a typical
conference okay that's the whole magic
out of it that's right we even have a
thing called wavy talks when guys swim
like to meet it is away from the shore
and they start studies got anything I
the garbage collector settings and
whatever it's really excite inside the
sea actually so they
the speaking time is not limited else
they drown her exactly it's great so
it's also fun you did a a Jake Reed for
kids as well I think this year it was
the first jacket for kids actually it
went very well it happened to ye into
cities in chania in the Iraqi on two
consecutive days we had some like
hundred kids coming and we didn't know I
mean we didn't have enough space
actually for them it went quite great I
mean we were also on TV I mean it was
the people just lay the locals just
drove crazy just to join this conference
we had some great lego thing and
something efforts are shown this year of
what you really have time to do some
more made in before next year who have
more many more ideas so it's going to
grow and grow much so much much more
this one it's going to be competitive
compared to we had a lot of caliph from
MIDI box for kids as well but it's going
to grow I mean there's another device
for kids so I'm but the bad news is I
get an invitation I think to be together
Jake Reed so it's just like a register
for it it's like being invited well yes
well the thing actually the thing is
don't don't drag us about that because
we're not deciding and Heinz Heinz is in
control of the invitations but yeah
basically started as he used his Java
specialist newsletter as a primary
original database to create a few white
people and also invite his friends and
Java fellow Java champions and yeah now
we have like you have people that come
more or less every year or every second
year and we also try to get new people
in so this year I guess we're gonna have
like lottery want to rotate people so we
went to what our max is about 80 people
so we want to stay at around that number
but we want to get new people so the
idea is that we get I don't know 30 40
new people next year to get like a fresh
blood into the Jake Reed and get get
somebody else a taste to it okay so all
right our problem is the space so far we
just try to think of ideas how to expand
the conference but mainly this is the
main reason to have the invitation only
that we don't have enough space
and we need the critical expert mass
that will be run the conference then
this is the most important thing it
doesn't sound like a the the way the
conference works will scale like to to
endless people we don't know I mean you
know it seems like we are at the number
of let's say maximum hundred people tops
we carry you physically cannot go beyond
that unless you're gonna split into
different events but a single event that
that's max impact plus you know you want
to stay together you want to go to beach
together to attend a few places and it
doesn't scale if the hundred people come
with families you're talking about 200
people and that's just it it's a free
conference it's a volunteering base so
we just have a volunteers will help and
contribute and so far we have to keep it
manageable if we just invite some 3,000
people like in devoxx it's very going to
be very unknown also double for the time
being at least that's a cool thing this
the conference is for free once you get
once you invited everything is free
basically you pay you pay out of your
pocket to come to Crede but you probably
want to get there any way for the beach
vacation so yeah it kind of makes sense
okay great thanks for being here Thank
You Latrice and enjoy the next trick
free conference of course next year
isn't worth but I cry thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
