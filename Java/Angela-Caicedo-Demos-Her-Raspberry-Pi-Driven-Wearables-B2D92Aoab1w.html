Network and I'm here today at devoxx
talking with angelic I said Oh Angela hi
hi how are you good and so we are
talking I mean you are presenting
wearables right and so tell us what what
do you what are you wearing so um I
always thought about being able to wear
and use the technology to control things
and now technologies actually becoming
really small we have the raspberry PI's
we have the author oi and I was like
okay I should be able to build that
jacket that allow me to go running and
have fun with it like for example when I
run I listen music so I should be able
to have a my media player available to
choose the songs and you know go forward
backward pause etc because I work from
home when I'm running it should be
really nice if i can get my email right
too nice i can connect to the office get
my email read it to me some kind of
working still you don't like even though
i'm really exercising so stuff like that
of course if you're exercising you want
to know what's going on with your body
right i don't know if ever where the
response right from your end brands so i
got one of those and the funny thing is
you know I've been like yeah hell is
going to exercise and move went for a
run here you see the activity going up
but you know when I burned the most when
I get the most activities by sitting on
my butt and folding clothes because your
hands are doing this so that tility goes
really hot so I wanted to do more of my
body tracking so what I did is i'm using
a polar heart rate monitor right and i
do have a sensor from that that allowed
me to collect information from my band
I've one in my band right now and I can
actually display the pulse of my heart
so I can see if my heart is going really
hot fast oh it's going to slow okay so
how did how does it show so I should
just flicking so every time you see my
heart blinking so we have probably a lot
of lies for the heart okay so it we
killing it you want but so it's actually
mine
art ok we have an activity monitor so
you know how you define your activity
per day I'm going to have a pedometer in
my shoe there has a pressure sensitive
as shape and what it does in when you
pressure the resistance of that change
so I can actually detect when you're
walking so I can actually see your
activity rather than just doing this
right so it's not just like a general
sensor methods like it's really you're
walking yeah Oh steps so I just showing
me how I'm doing in my goal per day
another good theme is GPS so I have it
does have a GPS right now the only thing
we are indoor so it's kind of hard so it
actually recorded the last position and
it was just getting in here so once i
get to my destination it was just blink
ok ok a little bit of GPS feedback so
this is kind of hard this is this panel
was built with conductive at fabric so
all this is actually conductive so it
actually sends when I touch it so if I
want to play something let me say we can
actually get something played so it's
all your media controls basically my
raspberry pi my raspberry PI's in one
pocket well the battery that is powering
the raspberry PI's in my other pocket so
that's just for this side or both both
everything is connected to the same
Raspberry Pi ok so you want to even have
some music going on I come to it oh yes
I get it yeah and then we can change
this is kind of a boring song so you can
switch yeah we can go forward let me see
so now we have a different one place
your yes sorry Oh
yep I can hear it holds it wow it's
instanton yeah so and you can actually
with my hand so I have a busser so
whenever I have something going on here
I buzz so I know that you get the signal
because it's hard with a wearable right
so if I say play oh yes is that it boss
if I say pause it was so it actually
giving me some feedback right I know
what's going on and the last part is um
I love the idea of you know having a
display and i found very cheap and
glasses online and but they were very
invasive they have both sides so I
couldn't really see anything so I took
them apart and say you know what I can
actually do my own glasses so I just
used a baseball cap so I'm actually
seeing my screen here so you can
actually see it's actually quite a good
resolution uh-huh so if you can actually
see Wow ok yeah upside down because I'm
right open area so it's just a very tiny
screen with a big magnifying glass so
you know it's just a lot of fun of what
you can actually do let me put my screen
back horn ok so how music you have a
display you have feedback so you see the
songs that your playlist I'm gonna show
you something in the next demo so let's
see if I can do a magic trick for you
it's always about car yes I am guessing
so I'm shuffle them a bit thou shalt not
me right ok if you can pick one car show
to the camera but do not show it to me
I'm just going to pick this one I don't
even know what it is oh well you can
actually see what it is so you got it ok
so now what I want to see is I want to
read your minds so that so you want my
card right so yeah so put your hands
like that and I actually want to read it
so let me concentrate do I need to
concentrate you so I feel like it's a
club q
okay yeah is it yes oh look at it hey
can we try to go time okay yeah sure so
Jay which is like one in the middle so I
look at it I show it to the audience
okay and then I bring your arms let me
see if I can feel it it's a k ty mond
pretty good kid so I'm not really a
magician I'm actually a little
bit really so what it happened is them
this is actually a special car they're
actually rfid-enabled and what I have
also in my jacket is an rfid reader so
when I'm actually putting your hand my
hand on top of your hand I'm actually
reading the car and what I have here in
my display is actually showing me the
card okay I sensed it I see what it is
and then I can guess it so real magic
huh right magic with technology back a
lot of fun for sure so thank you so much
Angela for talking to us and for
building all of this and showing it to
us it's very impressive so thank you
thank you very much thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
