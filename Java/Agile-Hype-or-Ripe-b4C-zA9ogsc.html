technology Network we're here at Jay
focus talking to members of the java
community and I've got Linda van der pal
with me today hey Linda hi how are you
doing I'm great great so Linda you're
the founder of the Jadakiss organization
for women in Java so if you're
interested in that you can go to Jay
Duchess org and hopefully we'll have the
website up soon sellers pressure for her
to update or website yeah let's um let's
talk a little bit about agile because
yeah you've been in the edge of
community for a while yeah I've been
there for ages I guess okay so before we
do that tell me a little bit about what
you won't work you're doing now um right
now I'm in a java consulting I work for
a company that mostly like does
consulting for companies and they do
projects too and some product
development but mostly consulting okay
so tell me a little bit about your
experience with agile um well actually
my actual factual experience with agile
is not that great because I've worked
mostly for big companies like banks and
all my experience is that they're not
very agile there and they're also not
very interested in becoming agile
they're more interested in making their
deadlines okay so they're very water
fail yes centrica big upfront design and
big deadline that's getting ever closer
and the development time becoming ever
smaller as the specs become later and
later and right so the further you are
downstream the less time you have stuff
to do so tell me you're saying in
smaller companies you do CH it will
happen yeah I've done I've done one
pretty much truly agile project at least
we tried our very best to actually be
agile and that was in a smallish company
they only had one development team and
they were developing the main product
that the company was using to sell their
services and well we worked as a gel as
we could we had sprints we change this
length of the springs a bit to make it
fit the business because the business
had some problems with committing for a
set period that for some reason for
companies it's a lot easier to commit
for half a year than it is to commit for
three weeks and not change any scope
interesting Wow so tell me are you do
you believe in edgell as a type is it
right where where do you follow that
school I think it also depends on the
the the company itself whether it will
work because right now I'm in a project
where they say they're working agile but
they're not really doing agile there the
way I see it they're doing at waterfall
the way it was meant with iterations and
moving around towards the goal and
resizing the scope a little bit huh but
really it's just the half year release
and you did we do have the demos in
between to show the customer where we're
going so we can if it's not quite what
they want we can go in the right
direction but there's a lot of things we
can't change anymore because they're too
big of a change and it will tell them
well sorry but we can't do that we'll
have to work with what we've got because
this is our scope and this is our design
we can show so if somebody's interested
and they buy in the agile where's a good
place to get started or get involved
with the community I think
the XP days around the world or a very
good place to get started that's like an
agile community where they have
conferences smoke conferences like the
two days and with a lot of people that
are really really into a gel and they
have a lot of people with lots of
experience in it as well and they're all
sharing knowledge like the developer
community here is it's mostly you go to
a session and you sit and you listen to
somebody to talk about a really
interesting subject so it's good for
learning but in the advil community it's
a lot more active you have to really be
a part of the presentation there is more
of a workshop thing and what I found is
that it's a much much better way of
learning because you're actually doing
something right away right you're using
it as you're learning so not being as
passive yeah it's a very active
community and also where I've also been
going is to like agile coach camps I'm
not a coach but i've noticed that i
might grow into one at one point and as
again that is very friendly open
community where people are welcome and
and they're becoming part of them at one
XP days i had we had one of those
line-ups where he had to stand in line
according to your seniority in the Etzel
community and not like yeah i'm under
one year experience side of the line and
people on the other side with 15 years
like but you've been in the community
for like ten years now how come you only
get one year and I'm like yeah it's kind
of hard to work for him in big ghetto
credit companies to get it working right
so but it's a nice thing even though if
you're not doing it I've always tried to
at least get some real it'll onshore
practices in even if we're doing
waterfall yeah some agilent's in tier
good so thank you linda really glad you
dropped by and
no I look forward to seeing more from
you this is Tori wheel from the Oracle
technology Network thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
