homers in benign Allen the deadlines are
met
hello and welcome to this short video
demonstrating Java effects scene builder
we're going to combine some simple
controls to make a layout that could be
used as a menu design
we begin by dragging a button from the
library and placing it in the content
panel
we copy and paste the button and then
wrap it in a V box container which
arranges its children vertically
we can then double-click on each of the
buttons to edit their text and add the
type for the items in our main menu
we now drag in another button which
we'll use to start constructing a sub
menu for our scenes here I'm dragging an
image from the finder and dropping it
onto the button in the library panel a
placeholder appears allow me to assign
the image as a graphic component of the
button using the inspector we can set
the content display property so that the
text of the button appears under the
image now we copy and paste the bus in a
few times and wrapped in a H box
container which arranges its children
horizontally
in the hierarchy panel we can quickly
edit the text of each of the scenes
submenu buttons
next we switch to the inspector and edit
the image property file pass for the
scene buttons in order to show the
correct image for each one
using the hierarchy panel we grab the H
box containing the scene buttons and
re-parent it inside the main menus V box
once this is done we edit the V box
alignment property to position all the
items on the left we now grab another
image from the finder and place it in
our scene as the background for our
layout at this stage we'll add a CSS
file containing some simple rules of
defined fonts colors and hover States
for our buttons we select the route
container and attach the CSS file to it
seam builder can now size CSS rules to
the buttons in our document we add one
for the selected main menu another for
the rest of the main menu buttons and a
final one for the buttons in the scene
submenu to add a dynamic to the design
of the layout we select the V box and
edit the rotation property
finally using the preview feature we can
interact and test our design
I hope you enjoyed the video and thank
you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
