appears simple really it's a testament
to how easy it is to create embedded
solutions with javafx and java SE
embedded sweet and so forth so Bruno
Pena hello and my name is Michael shamea
our goal was to evaluate a couple of
aspects of sobriety we have an alcohol
sensor over here on the board but we
wanted to do more than that the ideas
that we came up with an hour rain storm
was to also incorporate a distance
sensor to detect if somebody was leaning
stumbling around and that sort of thing
we also have the idea to test reaction
time flash a light press a button when
you get to that yet far as the
technologies we developed in NetBeans
IDE 73 1 i'd eat we use javafx for the
interface we've simplified construction
of the interface considerably we also
have java SE embedded suite on the
Raspberry Pi and I've made it possible
to do rest-based calls to get the data
from the sensor in turn the things API
was used to get the data from the
Arduino and the Arduino itself was used
to actually talk directly to the sensors
so we have we have a sack that really
simplified pretty much the whole whole
aspect of doing this I do robotics as a
hobby and I can tell you that if I
actually have to sit down on you all of
this stuff all by myself from scratch
will it take any days of days days we
did it maybe watch two hours tops so
this is the quick architecture we have
that we're running a client right now on
the laptop but we could just as easily
put it on the Raspberry Pi itself
and the Raspberry Pi has the java SE
avete is sweet it's running the client
side of the things API which talks over
serial to argue no with the things
they've got running on there and that's
where you declare all these different
sensors we have the alcohol sensor or
testing your breath and then a pain
distance sensor which is this little
what looks like the set of eyeballs on
an alien head it's actually a sonar
sensor so so right now you can see I've
been moving up and down and back and
forth that is if I'm you know this is
just a proof of concept but the idea is
if I'm standing still it's going to you
know it's going to produce a fairly
level graph if I'm leaning back and
forth a whole lunch which I'm not doing
right now hopefully it'll actually show
that grab but if I start to lean quite a
bit it should have enough resolution to
pick up that I'm really lit right now
I'm starting to lean back and forth it
pretty soon you're going to see the
graph and I take the step its stumble
and it's going to be a mass again this
is a proof of concept i guess in a more
sophisticated version you would actually
measure maybe a standard deviation here
over time and then you would factor that
in along with the alcohol sensor and
then in addition you would take me no
text rest as you look at the reaction
time and they want to get the drink come
on what are you are
have them my fashion so you know
hopefully you would add in the reaction
time and calculate a value would show
some kind of like a red green blue
whatever i'm going to have to
extensively test these sensors very
thoroughly with various levels of
drunkenness to determine exactly what
the thresholds are and so i will
probably be spending the next several
months working on that drinking heavily
to you know for the for the pursuit of
science so what a rate before making try
20 games back and how this there i guess
i know about how it can measure about
the lab of the hell body so it's showing
10 or 11 until sweaty means the guys did
not Oh barking his breath nothing sweet
dreams invited I should face it and if
you die okay Mikey trying but try
another great if you have to you yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
