name's Steven Chen I'm lead java
community manager and I am joined by
Brendan Greg from netflix how you doing
Brendan getting great thanks so I was
interested to talk to you a little bit
about your talk at javaone I believe it
was on frame pointers that's right which
is a new feature in jdk 8 and you're
gonna have to enlighten me about this
because I actually wasn't aware that we
fixed this in a recent JDK 8 update yeah
it's a it's great to have it enabled and
available in jdk 8 update 60 it was put
into build 19 I was pretty excited to
have it arrived and it's a new JDK
option it's minus xx plus preserved
frame pointer but to give you a bit of
background about it when I I joined
netflix over a year ago to work on
performance analysis we have tons of
Java and I wanted to understand cpu
usage completely and quickly at netflix
we have thousands of cloud instances and
they scale based often based on cpu
demand and so as the java applications
are eating cpu how much they consume
quickly dictates how many instances we
run in the cost so if we're able to
reduce the java cpu resource usage by a
small amount we save money very quickly
and so being able to profile java
effectively and completely is really
important to netflix and there's lots of
java profile is out there and and we've
been using lots of lots and lots yep we
make some of them as well that's right
and they're being really useful in the
past but I was also interested in
getting a system profiler to work and
the difference between a system profiler
is it can see time not just inside Java
but also time when you're when the JVM
is running itself when GC is running
like actually what the GC code is doing
the internals yeah system libraries what
the Colonel's doing and the tcp/ip stack
so it's really a system profiler fills
in some of the gaps that the other
profilers can't see but the problem is
system profilers can't
understand java context and the reason
they can't understand java context is
java as a compiler optimization has on
x86 has reused the frame pointer
register rbp as a general purpose
register and to the upshot is if you run
a system profiler and you've got java on
x86 you just can't see java so the stack
traces are just broken and so I started
looking at JDK to find out how we can
fix this and I took openjdk just as a
prototype I started hacking around see
it's not a really new problem in the
industry you might have heard of GCC s
minus F no Amit frame pointer option and
so it's it's it's exact same thing GCC
reuses this register as a compiler
optimization and that breaks profiling
for many apps ok but then you have an
option to turn that behavior off yeah
GCC we can turn that off but we didn't
have that option in the JDK so we kind
of wanted this is a similar option in
the JDK just to help system profilers
yeah and so I hacked up a prototype in
OpenJDK and it worked we started using
that for some critical profiling and
their flex and then I shared it with the
hotspot compiler engineers and on the
mailing list and Oracle engineering got
involved and they completely rewrote my
patch and later and made it promet eyes
so there's you can now turn it on and
off as you need toes and so it became
the preserved frame pointer option which
is released in 89 and JDK 8 update 60
and so one of the big things that means
for netflix is we know there's benefits
for different types of profilers so Java
profiles and there are lots out there
they can be very good at context and and
really understanding Java object
allocation and other Java behaviour
system profile is a pretty good at
understanding system code the carnal
tcp/ip file systems and to marry that
with Java context is amazing so I can
see what Java methods are causing say
main memory to grow what why the rest
column in top is growing or what Java
methods end up
going into TCP functions yeah and so
Netflix but the first thing we're doing
is lots of exciting things that you can
do with this option very first thing is
coming up with cpu mixed-mode flame
graphs and so flame graphs is a
visualization I came up with a while ago
it's actually pretty simple it's just a
way to show all profiles stack traces on
the screen at once proportionally so you
can quickly figure out where in your
code CP time is spent and so we're
rolling that out a netflix so we can now
do CP flame graphs on our Java systems
and understand this
I'm looking ahead we'll do more things
involving tcp/ip memory real-time leak
detection all sorts of really exciting
topics that this makes possible call and
that's a great example of collaboration
with a third party company kind of
making improvements with jdk via openjdk
so that's where you started with the
OpenJDK good base of the OpenJDK I it
was a I was able to just hack it up
myself just just as a proof of concept
posted the patch out there I was
surprised at how quickly it got into the
Oracle official JDK so we're pretty
pleased so I'm curious do you guys are
you guys actually current at Netflix
also on jdk releases are using JDK 8 in
production yeah we've been rolling out
JDK 8 update 60 in fact most mostly we
should be JDK update 60 right now Wow so
so you guys are really bleeding edge on
JDK updates and it's been serving you
well so you can get updates on features
and I assume it's been fairly stable for
you right and and the netflix
architecture we have lots of different
micro services and we push Java really
hard in also two different ways so each
of the JDK updates often comes with
small performance improvements and we
love to get those because it helps us
reduce our cloud footprint slightly and
save costs so you do like to stay on top
of the the latest JDK cool okay what was
great chatting with you brandon here at
the q con conference right hey Steve we
have one more interview coming up later
in about an hour we're going to chatting
with nitzan from Azul systems and you
know join us today and tomorrow for more
interviews at night hacking com so Thank
You Rendon thank you I got more muted
maybe the screen will shut off
eventually
very good i know you're</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
