Worcester we're here in um Garrett
Reynolds personal laboratory yeah I
tweeted I the way I found your house was
by looking at the Dukes in the way yeah
just let you that's the sign those are
familiar from Java one doesn't want
skies in the elevator right yeah this
one I got from Anton so cool and let's
see some Steve let's do other
introductions your first I'm Michael I
work at the university of frankfurt
doing my PhD and i'm doing visual
programming environments and i do some
research in that area and i also do some
3d printing and IOT stuff just recently
started with that so yeah I my mark or
excellent us on twitter and github yeah
I'm a Java developer year for Minister
working currently at ov software and my
spare time playing around a little with
raspberry pi and some LEDs which we
might see you lay down and yeah i'm
looking forward to whatever hamlets here
hi my name is michael savage I'm a Java
developer allocated at Switzerland and
i'm here to see some way finally device
hanky ok so you see you drove all the
way up here from Switzerland ah he drove
all the way up here from Switzerland no
no just sometimes but today it's very
special day so I'm prepared happy to be
here alright cool so I'll leave the mic
here I was talking can grab it and I
think the plan is working on we're going
to hack on some different devices and
stuff let's see if we can get working so
what should we start with first lab yeah
maybe I'm I was thinking about I'm
leader yeah so the lab data is talking
quite piece that's a maybe for those of
you who know me or follow me on Twitter
so I'm working mainly with javafx at the
moment and
aight on different devices and at the
end of last year I was a little bit
annoyed by the raspberry pi because last
year I get this session javafx on
embedded a lot of times and in the end I
felt like okay I'm talking about javafx
on embedded and the only device i have
is a raspberry pi so people asking okay
what else yeah mmm no other device at
the moment so I was thinking about what
yeah so I started to collect devices
which is some kind of fun and try to get
the javafx running on that kind of
devices so and today i can because
hacking okay we can show some stuff
running on their different devices but
important is to know what you have to
take care of to get these running on
these devices because it's actually an
interview for a sec okay so i want to
give a shout out to device fridge so
welcome to the stream and if anyone else
is on the stream you should follow
Tobias's model and tweet to hashtag
night hacking yeah very good and then
I'm gonna pop the Twitter up see you
good you guys haven't covered by Twitter
so we are back on yeah so i was thinkin
about ya what are some devices yeah i
have some devices yeah i can maybe put
the because i can put it in the camera
it should work so let's let's start with
the first of all it there's one device
which is then your block up from oracle
appointed me to that device it's this
tiny smart thing which is named the
cubox I and that's very amazing because
it's an imx6 quad core with 1 gigahertz
and with a quad-core GPU and yeah it's
quite new and it's hard to get at the
moment so if you back to order one yeah
I think you you won't get one so I
ordered this one last year in november
and it arrived a few weeks ago so it's
really cute it has everything in there
that it has Wi-Fi in the bluetooth
inbuilt infrared it has it's 140 130
bucks something like that and it's you
see it's very small and very powerful
and the good thing is you can you will
find some Debbie and Jesse builds on the
web if your search for the cubox I forum
and then for Jesse Debbie and Jesse then
you will find the links to an image and
if you download the image that the
latest version is really good because we
have support for frame buffer on a
console and that's very important on on
on these devices if you would like to do
javafx you need frame buffer support
support either in the X Wendell's all
you need it in in the console better its
console but on some devices it's not
available but with this build with the
Debian Jesse build there is if you login
as root you will find we maybe can do
this later and there is a there is a
bash script which will switch from X
Windows frame buffer to shell frame of
our support and with this you can switch
it to that and then you can use javafx
directly like you know it from the pie
but this time you get for cpu cores with
one gigahertz and two gigabytes of ram
so that means it's really fast and we
can show a demo later on and its really
stable so that's really a good thing and
because the debian dress is hot float
you can use j decade of course so this
is one one thing that's very amazing
because it's so small and the other
thing i saw some weeks ago is the
so-called o droid it's the old road you
three which is lying here yeah this is
that device this one here only and it's
very hot i have to yeah because this is
a quad core with one dot seven gigahertz
so that's really really fast and two
gigabytes of ram and it's the same thing
it's made by samsung the fit is faster
that or you're just out to do well the
desktop will be faster but but this is
closed epic and it's hot
it's really hot but the good thing is
ice on it and it's a samsung chip it's
the same one that is running on the
latest Samsung tablets so the chocolate
7 inch screen works with it yeah the
problem with this thing is first thing
was to get a debian image running with
half load support which was hard to get
and the other thing is you have no
console frame buffer if you started up
if you connect it to a screen there's
nothing so you can only go to it with
ssh at 02 yeah that's also works but
there is no direct output on the on the
hdmi which is some kind of a problem
because if you started then your screen
will look like this so it's just a
colorful box it's hard to see on the
camera but there's nothing on that it's
really hard when I started it the first
time I thought oh damn it's broken
created the image again broken ok then I
read the forum so your graph yes exactly
yeah exactly so it took me some time to
get used to the console but it's really
nice and so now the next problem that
that came came up to me was how to get
javafx running on that device so there's
a little trick you have to know and i
have to tell you thanks to to daniel
block off to point me in the right
direction because if you would like to
use javafx on an x window system you can
either start x windows some genome or
whatever and then double-click the jar
on the desktop that works but the
problem is with because the javafx uses
the frame buffer you have really
problems with the mouse clicks and
transparency of other windows on
overlaying we know so the trick is to
start javafx with the switch d javafx
dot platform equals gtk that's the
that's the trick and with this trick i
was able to run a job FX also on that
device and i have another one which is
which is a pie it's this little pie but
this is the nice thing about this pie is
that there is an
display an LCD is directly in built in
the case right so it's this is very slim
and with this you need the same approach
so you need to maybe you would like to
show it again right that's really nice
so this is the PI it's an attack berry
case and I have a display directly on
top of that thing here and we can switch
it on later I can show a demo and with
this it was the same so we have frame
buffer support but only in X Windows
that means you can't use it from the
shell like you normally use it in with a
raspberry pi but to get this running you
need first of all to use this d javafx
dot platform equals gtk switch and the
other thing is that you have to hack the
dot accession file for everybody that
don't know this if you would like to
start an X Windows session and would
directly call a program a Java program
for example you have to create a file
named dot accession and in this file you
call your Java code that's the way to do
it and so then you can call it from the
command line directly and that's the
trick that we did here with the old road
and just a few minutes ago I compiled
how does how to switch to the to the
machine to the desktop and we can show
it okay so we have the Michelle here and
I don't know if you can read it it might
be a little bit too small but what i did
i just listened making me see so
first thing of all if you install a
Linux system on your on your embedded
device you really should install neta
talk and avahi because with this you can
use your standard computer like my Mac
here and I see that the or droid is
available because this is using the what
is the name of the protocol it's from
Apple this instant presence sure Bonjour
gonna it uses ponzu so it will directly
show that the machine is available and
because i have no direct signal on the
video it's very important to know okay
is it there or not and if you install
the module stuff the neta talk and I've
I then you can directly login with the
name and you don't need the IP address
which is very helpful so I just can say
SSH the user I name is Oh draw it at
Aldridge's the also done a host name so
i can log in this is because it's
wireless and i had to compile the
wireless driver by myself it was a
little bit tricky but it works so the
first thing to do was creating this file
accession and in the accession fire I
think it's hard to read but the only
thing I do is a file name dot accession
and in this file I just call the the jar
that i created this is just a some demo
application but that's the way to go and
let me see exit and now i just have to
start the x window system by calling
startx if i do that then we hopefully
will see that here now we have something
running on that display alright so it
may be it's hard to see here but yeah I
see it this is the the clock to demo and
I because if you use the gtk switch addy
javafx gtk switch the problem here is
that we don't have really touch support
there might be a workaround I have no
idea but at the moment it's not not
there and so I have to implement stuff
like swype by myself with the button i
see i can switch colors let me see
another one okay maybe a dark i want you
see it it's kind of slow and tricky I'm
happy that it works at these and I have
something up double-click you see here
now the second mode where the clock will
just display the seconds all the time
again okay and I can also switch the
languages if it works yeah so what you
see it's possible to run java effects on
on an old rod and the hard part was not
getting the javafx stop running the hard
part was to figure out how to set up the
Linux in the right way and this is
really the tough thing to get the you
get you need to have a linux with half
load support with the frame buffer
driver installed for the GPU and here if
you are not a linux Ecker and i'm not so
i'm usually use my mac and i'm a visual
guy like Stephen said so not the console
man so for me it's really hard if
someone's there you just have to
recompile the module for your kernel and
say okay hey no idea how to do that so
I'm searching the web and try to figure
out how to do that so now I know you
need to have frame buffer support
doesn't matter if its console or 4x
windows if you have an external frame
buffer support you have to call it with
the gtk switch and if you would like to
start it automatically from the console
you have to create a dot accession file
and I think that's all you have to know
to get it running on on these kind of
devices and i think i will use the old
road as a server because jdk it is
running great and it's fast so that will
be my my MQTT broker in the future okay
that was a lot of stuff I will not shut
on this one maybe Michael can then in
the meantime talk about some 3d printing
and Ike will set up the cubox I for the
for the next demo because there we have
touched the board and all that stuff and
then I can show also this thing
yeah okay I'm just fiddling with the
stream settings now to reduce the
quality because the Tobias and Alex
pointed out that our bandwidth is too
high okay to happily support what we're
trying to do okay okay so I just reduced
it on the fly hopefully that actually
works alright this one an old camera
okay so what I did lately is I started
with 3d printing on an Ultimaker one 3d
printer and what I try to do is to
create a cheap really affordable robot
based on the Raspberry Pi so you can see
a prototype and all the parts are
printed on the ultimate maker so over
the yellow and orange parts and the cool
thing is that the geometry is for the
three parts I create them with Java code
so they they can be parameterised so
eventually i will create a job of X
application where you can create the
geometries you can view them in javafx
3d and then yeah you can control this
little robot and also I have some
prototype for the Arduino board which
you can see here but it doesn't have the
motors attached and then what I'm
planning is to create a combined model
where you have our you know and
raspberry pi together because for if you
do a low level stuff like infrared light
protocols and such then the the arduino
board is much easier to program because
the pie runs a whole operating system
and it's not a completely real time so
it's better to combine those two yeah so
and
the 3d printing is a very exciting
technology so we have some exciting
parts here so you see these years here
and I printed this one it's just one
part it's a popular geometry on
thingiverse so if you have a 3d printer
than print this one here because it's
really exciting it shows that it's a
technology that's major enough to create
robot parts and gets you started with
you know building small devices and that
are affordable and they exactly look the
way you like yeah so it's its work in
progress I will bring the robot to
travel and and then we see maybe I have
something running till then and yeah
don't know yet but it's it's really
exciting yeah cool yeah I have also one
more one more yeah one more I just have
to yeah in my secret I have so many
things here just let me see oh yeah this
is yeah I'm kind of a secret that's a
cool one here yeah this is this is the
project for for java one if it got it
get accepted i hope so so this is um
yeah this will be my wearable Raspberry
Pi so that means I have a standard
Raspberry Pi here and I sold out some
PCB on top where I have a GPS sensor and
this is a polar heart rate sensor and
this is the 3g modem so together with a
battery I can use this system portable
and it's connected to the web so i will
run java 8 on this device and collect
data from my position speed and location
and also from my heart heart rate and
because the pie has an audio output it's
also able to synthesize speech that
means i can send messages to this device
and if you have plugged in an earplug I
can hear the computer talking to me
and of course I have a desktop
application that is showing the location
the speed the heart rate and height and
all that stuff and there you can type in
messages and it will send it to the PI
and wherever you are you can hear the
messages so you can for example on the
desktop do something like a weather
forecast for the location of the runner
and then send him okay within the next
couple of minutes you will get some rain
showers so be careful or whatever it is
so this is a yeah that's that's
something I'm working on at the moment
it's just it's really work in progress
so it works but not reliable but I'm
getting there so it will get better and
better and I have the same version also
running on the Arduino so I can also use
that on with a different kind of a model
I can use the same technology also on an
Arduino you and yeah that also works so
it's a nice stuff here to play with and
if you would like to see more embedded
devices may be Steven can show my little
server farm over there which is Jeremy
with some devices that I bet they are
really in use and on a daily basis so
I'm just missing my various my you are
there a good thing so this is the on the
left side you see a QB board with this
which is connected to a 64 gigabyte hard
drive and this is a MongoDB server then
we have a Raspberry Pi that's my
environment so it's measuring whether
like humidity humidity temperature and
pressure outside and the next one is the
server for my sensor network that I'm
running here in my house with nine XP
sensors and the last one is the bigger
bone black which is running an MQTT
broker and at the moment it runs
mosquito and I also tried hi FM q which
is running on Java so all these devices
running java 8 on linux so it's and this
is my my daily fun projects when I have
some theater
so yeah and this I showed this device
here this is my this is one of the notes
from the sensor network battery driven
and these things are talking to one of
the pies there and I have nine of these
spread around around the house so this
is yeah this is something something else
running java on on sensor networks and
embedded devices so you see I don't have
the money for big computers but the
small ones do the same work yeah how
about your on your watch my watch oh of
course yeah I just forgot this one so
and this is a linux power device with
the linux port operating system and and
I his little brother's arriving here
today because Steve not the same and I
can i can get closer to you so we saw
the the demo with the with the watch
with this clock two and i have the same
code and its really exactly the same
coat on this one but i have to think i
have to get really close to see because
it's yeah hard to see this is the watch
you can see I can oh wait like this I
can switch the colors with swype here I
have all these effects that i need and i
can double click then i have the second
mode as you can see and i can switch
languages of the clock between english
and so on so i will show this demo on
java ln next week in the session of jim
weaver it took Michael will also be part
of the session so if you would like to
know more but I can also show the same
stuff on the iOS device and also on an
android nexus 7 so and if we have the
time yeah we have the time so let's take
my Nexus 7 Becca I got one more board
for you to on what's that first to play
with this week that's that
whoa what's ah dude oh ah yeah so this
um it's an imx6 like the like this small
Vanya yeah quad core that's why has the
massive I think it's the same kind of
because this is also quite cool yeah I
think it's running slightly slower it's
like 1.2 or 1.4 mega this is just one
monkey go that's okay you cubox I and it
also has an atmel chip for doing android
i may not arduino stuff and are doing
our shield interface oh man yeah one
question how do they interact is it is
it you art or how do they communicate I
don't know and it's very interesting
because yeah so now we are talking about
think I found my new portable system
because here i have the arduino young
it's the this one and i told you i have
the same this is the 3g modern and
because this has the connectors I just
don't know how what's the right
connection but it will work then on the
oh that's great okay really good stuff
mmm really nice yeah yes sir you you see
I'm i love this this tiny devices you
can do so many things with that stuff
it's amazing and if you combine them
it's even better because now this is if
you think about this as this has a 3g
modem a GPS sensor and it has Wi-Fi and
it and it's so small so it's really
great and this one is ok so what I'm
going to do is um well we'll cut the
recording here ok and and then we're
going to work on the stream for folks
who are online stream so then you
actually follow because our bin with
isn't quite good enough for smoking
right so thanks for joining us for the
night hacking Garrett's lab session
