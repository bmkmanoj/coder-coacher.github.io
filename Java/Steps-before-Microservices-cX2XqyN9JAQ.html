my guess my name is your employee and my
guest today is Michael nascimento so
well tell us first of all what you do
for a living I know you and now she take
time CTO so please yeah actually
actually I incorporated I started my own
company with some of the best people I
know here in Brazil and we're doing
consulting outsourcing and even offshore
to okay good so and you you have been
talking about microservices right and
you have a fascinating talk because you
two are actually talking about why not
you adopt microservices sure I wouldn't
say it's why not but when oh when right
and why not because sometimes people
they hear about great things that people
are doing and one example using my talk
is like I'm not very much of a sports
guy but I like sleeping you know but if
I want to swim better and I try cheap
simply to copy everything that Michael
Phelps is doing to be one of the
greatest swimmers of all time I'll
simply die I will have a heart attack I
stroke that God's going to happen to me
so first you have to see from where
you're starting what are the logical
steps you should take in it should take
baby steps so I'm actually talking about
things that people should be doing
before and maybe even looking at
problems with a different at a different
angle and seeing that they are looking
for for something there is more related
to a process more related to
communication more related to increasing
the technical level of the team the
infrastructure and not necessarily
microservices microservice is still far
away from them it's just going to make
things more complicated if they rushed
straight into it okay so let's best some
assumptions right so what about
complexity does it reduce will
microservices actually reduce complexity
in my of my project no it's going to
bring more complex siddhant complexity
in it it's going to come from different
things
now now you have lots of services that
are spread may be many many boxes in in
a network that might be distributed in
different zones and uh and you have to
somehow make out these teams mmm systems
and services to speak to each other so
it's going to bring more complex so one
thing that I say is that if you cannot
have your application is not structured
well in math as a monolith if you cannot
make that work as a mammal if you're
just going to create greater problems
that you don't even understand you know
now so it's not like you're you're
getting the spaghetti street you're just
cutting the spaghetti to sue just a
bunch of spaghetti that you have so you
need to work on having some good
architecture first then maybe
microservice is going to solve other
problems that you have so the key is
really is is the the application really
just monolithic or not right yeah you
should you should you should have to the
architecture first microservices is not
a solution that is going to make your
application have a great architecture
out of nowhere if it's not where we
structured today okay so what about fast
deployment you know it should be like
way faster because all my teams are like
developing all those micro services at
the same time and boom theory in theory
yes but are usually when we see that is
because people they I was asking my talk
for instance and I was a little bit
surprised i knew that i would hear
something negative but not that negative
most people they cannot get at least
nine of ten builds working in an
application that just has suppose you
have just a single deployment pipeline
so how can you do that with 60 70
applications that you need to deploy
each piece is going to be unavailable at
a time this application structure to
deal with the with a component being a
vm available out of nowhere because
that's what happens when you deploy so
if you cannot get again if you cannot
bear to work with wedding or application
if you cannot do continuous delivery
with
sink nation why do you think you're
going to be able to do that with 70
maybe over a hundred yep okay so now if
my project as many teams right I want
you have actually more developers
working on different part of this
application and and so again i can i can
build faster it's going to work better
it that'd be a great exemption that
sounds like a good idea but the problem
many times is because you don't have a
clear you don't have a clear process in
a clear chain of communication among the
teams to make things work because they
should be working today firstly should
you shouldn't have problems because of
commission between the team now and you
should have a clear process so that
maybe by having different teams work
either you can do it faster if it's not
working in this sense that you get them
to communicate to be sure that they are
balanced in a way they don't break the
work being done by the others then it's
going to complicate the mass so the idea
of micro services at all is to
accelerate those things if are working
and they are not working at the right
pace you see and not to make them work
out of nowhere if they do not work at
all today that's not the point okay we
can't press things to work if yeah
exactly if it doesn't work already
exactly you have to move from something
that is working I don't think that works
better not for something that is not
working at all right so then so what
would be then you recommission of what
team should be thinking about before or
you know in order to adopt a micro
service architecture so what would be
like all the the checklist basically
good so besides the things we mentioned
here one thing that I noticed that
incredibly people are still not paying
too much of his test for instance so you
have to have good task as then when you
have your own service that you didn't
know how many clients you have in those
men client service you have to your own
service if you don't have good test for
it you know what that's not going to
work you know so you have to have good
test coverage and you really need to
adopt devops amount of meat you know
we need to have continuous delivery in
the first right to have good monitoring
set set up you know in your project one
that gives you the right alerts and
doesn't give you false alerts because if
you get too many also lets you stop
caring about it you know so let first
you have to have something that is
working and in you're having problems
with the scalability not because you
don't understand the JVM or because you
haven't tried enjoy because now your
application is really too big it's Welsh
actor you have good deploy and you have
great communication across rooms but all
of this is now a burden and you need to
scale it more not because none of this
is working if it's not what you know you
were you are going from a fat guy to
trying to do collapse routine you're
going to die okay so it's really you
have to have like best practices best
teamwork best of best testing and then
you can actually go faster and exactly
yep rapid they might consider it right
well thank you so much thank you for the
nice i'm sure this is going to help a
lot of people i hope so right so thank
you yeah and if people want to know more
about it you have my treat handle here
so just follow me and asked asking me
questions okay oh thank you they</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
