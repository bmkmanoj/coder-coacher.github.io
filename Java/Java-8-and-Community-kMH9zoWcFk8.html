and what is the role it's the
relationship between those two so Java
age I think is the release of Java that
has more community participation i think
it's it's setting a new standard of
community participation because with
Java age we merge it both openjdk so in
Java 8 shows all development under the
open JK project with a strong community
participation JCP all right so we have
Javanese groups all of the word are
running those two programs they adopt
openjdk the dr j sr there's one working
with with open dedicate issues they are
the one working with JCP specs so i
think that by participating those two
initiatives and by being able to see you
know those two things in parallel both
extenders process and the actual code
being written I think that it's improve
a whole lot how communities can
participate because you know before
openjdk okay so before I open dedicate
we had the source code of job available
but we didn't see it being viewed right
and I think that by participating in the
process you can see the process much
more transparent it's much easier for
you to contribute it's much easier for
you to see how things are going on and
once you can't participate in the
process you you know that's how you
start actually getting people to
contribute back and is the same thing we
have the JCP because you know one of the
things that that's both so Java and the
lonely job communities to javas groups
that were part of the
JCP executive committee you know we work
very hard to help to make the JCP more
transparent and transparency is also a
key thing in the standard process
because once you can see this tends
being viewed one so you can see how the
process going on that's a lot easier for
you to collaborate and participate so so
the JCP now has a much more transparent
process it's how it's a lot easier for
you to know you should go to our website
and and see how the issues of the
there's being disgusted around this back
and that's the way you know getting
distance parents that's the way for
community action related to participate
so I think that java aids sets his new
standard and we're looking forward to do
much more for java nine because i think
that java is clearly the most open
technology we have right now and that
and I think that's that we are we have
this chance that we had this chance for
parks vidim Java 8 and we're just going
to increase from now so Linda John
community is being involved with Java
and sought community Java for quite a
long time and specifically running into
Java rate we've been working on projects
like a doctor chairs are so doctor is
allowed us to work on the date-time
libraries with this
we'd steven carbon based in London and
the contribution can start from it
doesn't necessarily have to be writing
all the code for the next release it
means we can be sultry urging a mailing
list helping out with running half days
helping out given feedback suspect leads
and I think that what we did well was to
run the half days and get smoked weed
zavala those as well see what I'm then
the spot out the upcoming api's and give
you back to read into that process and
that feedback has helped me to make more
informed decisions based on a wide
variety of users because one of the one
of the good things about HIV user group
is you get people naturally a diff
abilities and different experiences so
you start to see a good example of what
your library's going to look like when
you actually push it and what do you
hear from Oracle or the JCP about what
how important that feedback that you
guys are providing yes so certainly get
very good feedback from from the spec
weeds of the jrs lambdas has been
another one way we've had was bad date
and have got feedback from that so the
feedbacks definitely positive in some
ways I think if we did have good
feedback in be difficult to motivate our
users to carry on but I think
everybody kind of benefits from a promo
process great so as a user of Java how
does that make you feel that you can
contribute to the platforms I think he's
definitely a good things there's a jamba
user and somebody who works with Java to
London daily basis to be involved in the
platform and helping to move in for this
has been sort of great feeling it
doesn't feel like it's closed off
anymore and certainly as things improve
my we've opened JD Kane which
indicates going and people poor people
have accessible built and start to play
around and then such concrete
well java 8 has good feeling for the
community for lots of reasons first of
all there's a lot of a lot of new things
coming out I think that I know lambda
it's very important I think that the
support from all the other language
that's not job running the vm it's also
something that's very important so I
think that's you know first the
technology improvements on Java aids are
a big thing but also you know by seeing
this more transparent and more easy to
participate process and and actually
seeing how oracle was able to to to you
know to do this whole process very well
right to involve other companies involve
other individuals and another whole
community in making Java and I think
that community seen this as you know the
most collaborative in the most open
version of Java and so far
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
