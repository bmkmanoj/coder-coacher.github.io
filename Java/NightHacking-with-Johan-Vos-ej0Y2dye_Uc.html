with Johan Voss for another night
hacking episode and we are in Brussels
Belgium home of fine chocolate and a
good beer what else is Brussels know for
to get that off I Europe you know your
capital of the world just Europe does
here I think it's hard enough to be the
capital of Europe okay okay so Brussels
its capital of Europe yes after the
French would agree with that they do
agree a little later start Duke we will
be a starter good and I took a nice a
nice tour of the city with on Tasha and
Chokey this morning so lots of lots of
videos were on the Flickr stream if
anyone's it was interested to see these
sites around Belgium downtown so we're
gonna we're going to chat about stuff
which is slightly less so less cultural
I think but technically interesting job
reach across from the south so yeah so
it's a it's a geek culture exactly yeah
we got proud about it so very good and
for those of you who haven't seen
enjoyed hockey before so the basic
format is we have a live stream here so
Johan and I can can see all of the chat
comments on the social stream also you
can interact with us and we'll respond
by talking back to to folks who are in
the audience and we're going to show his
desktop here with some projects he's
working on what's what's our agenda for
today we're going to look at some
end-to-end Java and Java effects
technologies yeah well we'll see how it
goes with them I'm working on quite a
number of projects some open source
somewhere commercial the only thing that
they have in common is it should be fun
and to be java so we can get you a lot
so oh yeah she also mentioned so we
didn't introduce your home properly all
right so your own boss is dr. Johan boss
I busy hits that's what you mean yes dr.
Johan Ross has his own company bajan
also he is a resident expert in javafx
and social java technologies he is on
the steering / program committee for
deadlocks the d'box conference at what
else should we mention about you well
we'll probably talk about intimate Java
during the interview um it's actually
maybe if anything is how I got started
with Chavez who might be good to ask me
that question dr. Ross yes mrs. Chen how
did you get start with Java that's a
long story i don't think you want to
hear me ask no seriously when i started
my PhD in 90 96 95 or 96 i was looking
for a programming language i had a spark
station with Cyrus and I wanted to
install linux on it and then I heard
about this new language Java that just
was born but the important thing was it
doesn't exist unless partly in exceed
may have existed on linux so I've seen a
meal too i think it was when Chapman by
that time later calvin austin from sun
but i know you're working on a linux
port can I help with the port to linux
park so that's how i got involved with
the with the JDM itself so i ported it
to the next part and to sum all RISC
processors as well and funny enough
that's the day this is relevant again
with java and embedded java targeting
embedded again so those embedded days
are coming back on your hand i had some
customers that most of the customers of
Java they wanted to do job on the
enterprise and so pretty soon I started
with combining java at the end of price
with Java embedded so that's been you
know my java life has always been
finding the balance between java and
vice challenge mobile and that and now
you get everything in one piece so for
those of you don't know DM there's no
official support in the jdk for ARM
processors which are using a lot of
embedded systems so you can download
Java forearm on the java web site and
also there's a depth preview for java
effects on beagleboard we has another
small embedded farm platform which i'm
good for prototyping embedded systems
and is quite powerful in itself I heard
about the people that are doing for
ticks on the bigger board it's it's fun
what do you think that will work is
imagine that all of this all the native
library square open sourced and imagine
all these embedded systems mobile
devices on the planet end and people the
hackers the geeks I'm going to port the
Java platform and the champ effects
later flight ways to those systems now
that would be a huge ecosystem that
would open up maybe if you go back to
San Francisco they'll talk with your
people there might consider ya neck so
maybe maybe this small ready maybe show
since a doctor ok I saw slow let's show
some goodies you want to switch your
desktop ok
so that's my netbeans so what can we
show what may be the most of the
projects I'm working right now he was
Java vexing the client but most of the
projects i'm working on use some some
source of stuff on the backend and
therefore at low John we have we created
a platform we made it open source and
it's called a leak or there's a website
if you go to turn without net projects
data core this way you can download it
anywhere you can view the code and
participate actually go the goal of data
core it's on the wiki is the java
enterprise platform is cool so oily many
people did great stuff based on java
enterprise and it saves lots of time for
developers you don't have to worry about
databases about permissions about
transactions and so on it's all in there
what we see now is that many projects
many applications they they need to
integrate with existing social media or
they need to to allow users to do things
together to interact with with our users
or data and with data core we have
actually the framework that adds the
concepts of users concepts of users
group content information on top of the
Java Enterprise 10 left so this is like
this is like social java ee exactly yes
so there has been an attempt to
standardize social java cheers or 357 I
think but the chairs are also with wrong
because of many reasons and one of the
reasons I definitely can understand it
this is a broad topic in an
ever-changing world and it's the JCP is
I think good to standardize at the fact
is mi my opinion of standards bodies is
there grey
for taking things which already exist
and are well known and then creating a
creating a compatible kind of framework
for people to build applications than
that but when you're doing kind of
innovative groundbreaking or new things
whether it's evolving rapidly standards
typically don't buy you a lot yeah but
I'm estándares written it's already out
of date and the other people have
implementations which have passed beyond
what you're currently doing and yeah so
what is happening right now is that
there are a number of frameworks and
example if you're using spring us being
social if you're using Gables you can
have a garage or ham well the success of
team social and if you're using glass
fish you can use that core on top of it
and I think that in the end in the long
run but maybe not so long run there will
be a standard and then all these
projects are now more or less
vendor-specific editions they will
hopefully implement the standards which
make you less nervous I was delic Air
Corps compare the spring social and
other other frameworks like that I think
from a functional point of view they
cover pretty much the same the
technology is different so I think if
you're in the spring world then you
should stick in this plane world so if
you're using one component whatever the
spring family components you should use
all those components at least work for
single project on the other hand if
you're using pure java II if you're
using glass fish then well I've tried it
before a number of times trying to
incorporate spring module or jboss
module or whatever inside glass fish but
you end up with with a hole with with
two complete core frameworks and they
don't enter it doesn't work well
together so if you're using glass fish
then daleko offers the social
functionality
so I think the yeah the different is not
much on perfection okay so so an easy
way of describing data core is its
spring social for java or e grand
glassfish um yeah i think it's a that's
a very very very well that Becca I think
we um well it's more crackin it's it's
it's bit it's very it's pretty social
because the concept of user itself is in
spring in a different model so we have
users and content as well and
permissions so it's not always as more
it's more than spring social or the
spring guys watching this no I think
it's that they probably will actually
see the show notes F effing spring
source it is at this moment which has
much more functionality but dally core
contains functionality that know your
screen sure I've been in spring user or
what's the module that contains you need
to play dates the competition after
sauce okay I'm not not very good in the
marketing myself okay all rights ok
let's see something let's see something
running a jelly correctly okay so we
have number of projects actually all our
projects until half year go run on dolly
core let's see maybe we have I'm going
to open few not sure if you remember we
had a elections in Belgium lost last
month and people could check their
profile check their opinion on websites
on this website so not sure it's still
in the air hole destroyed intro to mint
theft this old house my house my a
Flemish de google translate is your
friends okay so this is just some
questions like shoot the government
spent less money on this or that so and
the respondents have to say yes I agree
or don't I don't agree moment today for
the first time click an answer then they
can connect with facebook and compare
their opinion with those of their
Facebook friends in their community you
don't have to do that you can continue
without facebook and in the end we're
not going to do it completely but oh
yeah you can also compare with some
famous people here and there and in the
end you can you can see what your ideal
profile is you can compare yourself with
your Facebook friends if you're using
facebook so you can be a group thang on
elections for all your you and all your
friends er yes it's a private election
too so this is this did was actually in
the national media it was is what it was
a hot topic so i think twit on peak
moments think 20,000 simultaneous users
and we had about 1,000 pages a second
big moments so that's that's running
dolly core so what's da da decor doing
or the concept of the user the concept
where users can compare them they are
content with content from other users
and with and especially with facebook
users or hum well this one does not use
Twitter but you could also integrate a
Twitter with it um by moving your mouse
there oh yeah oh sorry that's this was I
was I know you earlier uh I'm used to
work together with you so not more than
not more than usual exactly ok now begin
working together I I so after after we
finish recording I have some fun stuff
to work on ok so better be put it's it's
a secret beer do you guys have to wait
till dev ops 2 to see the cool stuff
we're going to do oh by the way I'm um
I'm expanding the schedule Adele box so
I have a couple random interviews on
monday and tuesday and wednesday and
thursday basically the whole day i'm
going to be streaming speakers at devoxx
from
the hacking area so we'll have lots of
cool interviews with folks who happen to
be in Belgium for demos cool so maybe
another grace the other applications
it's using our data cord this is in the
Belgium we have a community that
combines all the musicians disney
flanders musicians djs and organizations
that that the concerts and so and what
they have is actually it's sort of a
mini facebook for for the musical
community it's pretty popular so many
big festivals use it so what you can
what they can actually do is they they
can browse through the profiles and they
can organize a competition and then
people can or bands can say well we want
to we want to be in this festival and
decent isn't this sort fact that we can
play and so they can also interact with
the organization and based on that there
are quite quite some organizations that
use this platform also the national
radio stations day every week they pick
one or a few bands that that get some
air time it's based on this platform and
this is also this is this is really
users content and permissions because
based on your commit on your whole you
can have different to a permissions so
let's running a data core as well cool
now this is actually pretty old this is
a thin 33 years old and what we saw was
that we spent quite some time with
bundling derecho over the application
and then when everyone was talking about
the cloud we said what we should
actually do something about the cloud
ourselves whether there will be a
fatality cloud that debt now that would
be a cool name but I could let let's see
oh it don't know a second yeah name is
taken here to that actually I think it's
only yesterday that we moved dolly cloud
total John would come to Bala cloud
so you see we have your number of
applications that are at this moment
already using data cloud that's for
example it's a cycler Focus which is a
website about cycling in Belgium what we
do with that across it is just it's
actually a load balancer in front of a
number of data core instances and we add
it in admin epi where you can where you
can see for example I said it's all
about users you can do all the rest
queries that you do within your
application you can you can check out
from the other interface and if you go
to for example thesis so we have a
project it's an external project so
that's the nice thing it's we don't do
it it's someone else who makes the
project and it then make rest calls to
dally cloud we don't know what he's
doing with its a thing cyclo focus dot
com he has some content and for
rendering the content he talks to he
talks to dally cloud and so he has he
has users content and what you can also
do is add different types of content let
me see how how do we do this thang we go
back we can add extensions of users like
this guy he added a side twist which is
a user but he also has a height or eight
states dates of birth remarks and so on
so let's think maybe enough about the
core data core and learn data cloud now
this is enterprise stuff and what you
can do is you can make communities based
on the talk to dally cloud but the cool
thing is that you can easily connect
javafx applications to to dolly core and
Ally clouds as well together like I've
heard of that technology before
that's like a that's like that's like
you is but you write them in Java
instead of like funky or angle brackets
all right you're talking about
JavaScript no it's a no it's am yeah I
guess Java does have lost something
greater than um escaped yes so this is
no no it's annoying that I can't control
the mouse oh sorry yep apparently not
used with remote desktop sensor I keep I
keep forgetting that I my computer
Trump's your computer yeah maybe your
employer has more power do i or i think
i think i have I think I have a solution
is there's a reason why my computer
Trump's yours and it's because light
lines are night hacking okay my official
night hacking computer so am I is a
white label bandit yeah now we got
weekly to fix up oh so your computer can
be just as just as powerful as mine yet
okay now that would be cool alright
later on mofo that's dead but the cool
stuff that you wanted to show off to the
recording only you think so no because
the audience already given it now let's
say I'm grabbing a computer yet okay
yeah carry on Doc grab a beer my
chocolate nah yes yes keep our hands
occupied so what we well let's just show
the rap version first something we did
think four or five years ago is a
project which we called sinks fear where
you can create the community and you can
work yeah creator not sure that I
remember my credentials there are the
okay would be pretty embarrassing so so
I notice you're very secure password
there was a thrill of fish yes and it
had nothing to do with my name I'm going
to change it in a song twitter handle
that would be more secure so this this
website is the self-service web site and
all talks all the sorry all the requests
go to Italy cloud so this is you can
easily you can easily do this yourself
if you go to sing sphere calm and you
create your own community and this is
for example the might hacking community
let's call it let's put it just at night
hacking total sings fear dot com and we
create it and we gotta say i'm going to
i am an office so it will populate it
with some random information tech fine
my taking community java this is a demo
community for hackers honestly I I
didn't work with this since Susan that's
a okay that's one of the most famous
rajyam are artists I realized because he
looks he looks a lot better dressed than
you and he got sponsored okay yeah
that's the business is the business
behind lon yeah that's a that's the one
that even I don't know how are we gonna
invite friends no but so if you now go
to my tacking dots income you see we
have well we have a community with well
only myself but I i think i could could
have invited you as well but i'm going
to add some news item like we are life
life from brussels finally we're eyes
and we add news okay if you go to home
see with so this is the typical
community thing I can also add a forum
so it has built in forum and all the
water typical stuff that you would
expect from communities now that is
something that would it I think yeah
maybe four years ago it's fun but it's
it it's web-based and now the thing that
I didn't like too much about what was
the JavaScript the browser
incompatibilities and so good enough
there was then the language that helped
me to get rid of the issue that i had
with with web development doc don't
don't misunderstand me I've absolutely
nothing against web based projects but i
really like java as a language for a
number of reasons and one of them is
because it has a compiler and i know
that when the java compiler tells me
it's good then I know that I've a pretty
good chance that it's going to work and
that's harder with web development it's
a it's more trial and error so that yeah
well the compiler can't tell you because
it would have to run on five different
browser platforms from three different
versions and exactly yeah and that that
makes it hard out a lot so it's not just
as you do anything yes but for anything
and nothing so lots of respect for the
grid a compiler team if because they
manage to do translate jarring to
JavaScript for all these different yeah
or so for some sort of functionally yeah
exactly yeah okay so you're going to
show something something different here
right yes so I started just just just
for fun I started to do why can't we
make something in Java of X so white
label client that hooks up with the
community and this is actually just a
fun project I'm working on you can login
with your twitter credentials now look
at this this is a job of X applique
yeah but it looks like it's got all wet
fish yeah are you integrating web
content and a rich clients out there yes
I can get one of the smartest things in
javafx you have the web view and some
applications like for example Twitter
Facebook what you can connect with them
using mobile as well but then you have
to type / pincode but with the web
authorization it's different so you can
you can use the web optimization and
actually we do something funny here once
we sign in and Twitter the back end so
this is talking to two darby cloud and
Ally cloud is talking to twitter twitter
senses back to data cloud and then vally
cloud sends me back okay you are
authorized and this is your uid 0 and
the the code pig set up and i would know
the time you have us by go to social you
can see all my friends when I based the
people that did I pay to be my friends
you can go to form and you see the form
soft this is of course very very beta
but i can so see your business must be
to be doing pretty good to have all
those friends after i feel sure we'll
talk about my payment yeah you probably
have more friends than me I just tell
them when I yeah even if if you look at
lots of former Sun employees if you look
at iOS okay so these are all the members
in our community looking that the
hairstyle between people is sometimes so
this is a this is Java vex tried talking
to maybe you want to to see some code
now yeah let's see some code and it's at
some point you need to you need to get a
designer to get some CSS for you kind of
like the web version yeah now I could it
could look if you look so much nicer
with like a little tea
see bit of design that that is
absolutely absolutely to now there's one
thing that no one ever allows me to do
and that's choosing course for design
things so if it was only need these
wouldn't have been right but but crane
and this would be yellow and it is
perfect it drives people crazy
especially my wife because it's
Christmas I want to call out mice yeah
so I think the first the first rule in
design is primary colors oh no no what
would you very light about that if we
stop licking Creole colors then that's
probably not a good place to start well
you have to know your limitations and
design is way beyond my limitations but
it would be it's actually something that
i mentioned it a few times in the javafx
community I don't have any design skills
but it would be cool if if we had some
community where some people that I have
a film project but I need a designer so
when I said I have a firm project or
concept nice design but i need the
developer so um i was a slow over here
yes so we have the social networking box
that we that we add so the the Welcome
page is shown once you are logged in so
the webview that you're seeing there is
the one that's shown first and then the
Welcome pain once the visible property
is bind to when you're logged in cool so
what's I noticed I notice you're more of
a fan of the for those of you don't know
javafx has to coding styles you can use
constructors and getters and setters or
you can use video filter format where
you chain methods you chain a fluent
interface but it seems like you're a
you're a traditional guy setters and
initializers um yeah but changing yeah
this is jim has Jim been um he's
employing over to the dark side it's uh
um yeah yeah I think we have to give him
credit for
the Buddha and say hi to mark hecklers
well he's on and he she tweeted out to
us okay I told he told people they
should be watching us which um hopefully
hopefully you have something better to
be on a sunday and you watch the
recording but if you hear it's not a
live stream then we I was started yeah
yeah what do you say ethnic but if
you're on the live stream we do
appreciate it okay so actually just a
cyclone meow so we've been we've been
chatting this whole time and ignoring
folks on the live stream so let me just
quickly swap over and see what flips can
come to go okay so here's our cause
here's mark and if you have questions
for us please les de for dr. Ross
alright so i'm back to java fuck's sake
I still feel um doc is awesome medical
doctor and so were they were they do in
Belgium for titles or is your title
being um doctor yeah but oh we oh we
don't use it often oh I mean people can
just oh don't dare doctor huh whatever
they wanted to be called doctor yeah so
it's your option it's a i think it's a
it's a worthless no it's not worth the
file but it it helps you what did you
get your doctorate it why okay um
another my embarrassing you here no no
but that that's a pretty good question
because um I did my PhD in the red lines
at the University of Technology and if
you disappeared zu at lot of spare time
for doing from project yeah so it's a
and that actually and that's seriously
because of that I had time to work on my
java linux Louis Oh SAS was back in the
you're doing her PhD back in with the
Java 10 days I can I could find my start
yeah so that was about when i was at CMU
packing out ids i was on a PhD well
graduate project but i wasn't really a
graduate student I was just hanging out
and enjoying the nice perks of being on
the team I are exactly yeah I believe a
PhD you're you get at least paid a bit
too well do some research and you can
give quite some some Liberty another the
funny thing is that my PhD was about
data visualization and I tried to do
that with java.awt i think it was even
before swing and i would have loved to
do it with a treaty but it was tiny bit
too slow by then because we had
gigabytes of data across in the mining
and geophysical applications use
the hall peers and since native widgets
and so so will we end up doing four
sheets which was the idea I worked on a
guardian on was this was pre Swain and
we we basically other than forms and
dialogues all the entire you I was was
rendered in our own heroine Peyton
methods we did everything from scratch
or on rich text framework our own
component models our own collections
because the synchronized collections
were just hideously slow vector vector
anyone yeah yeah so I was amazing will
be able to get done in Java on even
early versions with the right libraries
that were custom written but you had to
use the bill off from scratch yeah so
from a conceptual point java was already
by then i think great for this but
performance wasn't there unfortunately
many people went to other languages but
now performances this is good enough
what it's I think Warren Java code
actually runs faster than a lot of other
language exactly yeah especially dynamic
languages and even programs written in c
or lower level languages unless you are
very careful about how you code into a
write your application you can actually
get worse performance just 50 standard
coding practices it's um it's easy to do
skoura performs in any language yes and
even the smallest compiler count um fix
everything it sounds it's easy to screw
up okay anyway back to back to javafx
hacker that was a nice little digression
into in tomato dr. Voss is private life
Oh
you're not really going to details there
but well actually I'm still the
combination of science and development
still attracts me and I think what what
I was doing in my PhD with job or what I
try to do there's also something that
you know there's a company called liquid
robotics they recently have a new CTO of
her well yeah it's a smart guy you
should interview a liquid linked
together we might even have some
interview footage oh that would be nice
at liquid robotics with a with a certain
creator of the Java language now if you
ever interviewed those guys you should
tell them to use javafx because they
might use a swing now for their user
interface which is ok but with Java vex
and especially the data binding in
javafx it's it's much easier to
integrate your user interface with your
data processing and that's I think one
of the big benefits of Java yeah so I
wave hi to the folks on the on the
camera we have our we have our camera
don't own take pictures right now yeah
well not quite not quite good yes he
listened to you hahaha this is this is
my life people don't really listen
okay so when you will you take
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
