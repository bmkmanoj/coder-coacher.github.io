Valley Java felt center group today
we've got John doing a Java FX 3d it's a
really cool study following one of us
both interesting sessions we've had in a
while
and before we start I just got to
mention our sponsors workflow course
provides the venue and the food a lot of
give away stuff that we get every year
for every month winnowed Jade frog
JetBrains about IntelliJ license
giveaway at the end funny buddy the
Pinterest and that be sure you stick
around
finally but actually yeah I've been
giving it a little bit it's workable
right now but yeah
and on a price or Riley and Manning get
it flips from time to time and you get a
discount by saying you're a cruise
member from their website and with that
I'll let John take away okay thank you
very much yeah you're sure yeah
everything to that people on the street
coming out right
right on just a second I think it's just
interruptus
school resolution
16-member my 900 is that good or a 4x3
1280 by 960 is that 14
okay great
yeah thanks so much for coming there can
you hear me okay wait he has a my name
is John I'm part of JavaFX team just to
give you a little bit about my
background I'm hanging it go is that
expected guys excellent yeah so give you
a little background I studied animation
if you see a film school and a Master of
Fine Arts what that Disney Animation and
premix animation as a character
technical director on chickaletta Meet
the Robinsons have betrayed Your Dragon
and shrek forever after and a couple
other movies and then yeah mall is
making that remix and then that son
asked me hey how'd you like to join this
clear 3d animation project that we're
doing and then there's kind of a
research project thing and I first
wanted to be sure that he served me on
the idea and it sounded pretty cool and
so I joined that project and then later
transition to you working on Java
effects and yes some of the ideas that
we explored there transferred over to
what we're doing now in JavaFX 3d and
it's it's very very exciting
so yeah let me just go ahead instead and
oh yeah general disclaimer yeah you know
standard Rivage okay so good as Java
effects 3d actually I asked him you know
the guys who work on the stuff to get
their opinions well in life
it's a general-purpose 3d graphics now
therefore guy effects Kevin fresh foot
says John effects adds another dimension
to jam effects general effects 3d have
no dimension and Jasper says John
effects 3d BC the ability to use 3d
geometry cameras and lights and JavaFX
so they've got some pretty good some
ways so there are some use cases say you
know visualization charting in 3d CAD
cam medical imaging marketing
architecture fancy you eyes yep training
and even maybe else on my face of all
games are set perhaps
so we've probably seen this actually
this videos in HD let's see if it is
happy here um let's see
you do
oh yeah my compare is not the fastest
computer in the universe my it's that it
actually serves a really good purpose
because it shows you that Java fix the
new you can work pretty well on a laptop
that's about five years old so it's kind
of intentional but this is really shade
that Java when in the fall it was using
our prototype version of Java FX 3d and
it's basically to show you how you can
use Java FX 3d to visualize shipping
inventory and how that shipping
inventory moves along getting picked up
by different equipment and dropped off
and trucks and stuff like that and so
yeah this was in a slightly different
API but it's pretty much the same thing
we're providing now you know so move the
cameras meshes lighting all that kind of
stuff yeah we don't have time to
material here than this trucks a comment
on Twitter
hey the V over the truck I'll move him
working on that and yeah so it's a this
application is actually written by Navis
well the 2d part that it's - the 3d was
written by Madison community and then
you had three of us on JavaFX added the
3d as a proof of concept and
test our 3d prototype at the time yeah
so you see there it's basically the same
kind of functionality that exists in
JavaFX 3d today okay so yeah those are
some of the features of Java fixed 3d
there's a of course meshes cameras come
in here now a node before the winter
node because for the type of 2d book
that we were being previously didn't
need to be made but now it is a node we
also have a sub scene which I'll
describe Nets materials 3d picking and
you know help areas for controlling W
detail so the thing you dive into the
new features let's talk about what is
already possible enjoy effects too
so basically the only 3d thing in John
effects to those transforms and but
they're actually quite powerful and so
you actually could transform 2d
primitives in 3d to get to live in
rather than 3d space and when you tell
you a little bit about some of the stuff
that we do it spreads from sudden if is
that you need to see if they're
basically the transforms and dry effects
are very your vegetable so down here you
see we try to highlight this
yeah whatever it is this book transforms
not at all so you can customize your
transforms with any number of medical
centrist ease and it's the behavior is
actually very very flexible sir like for
example I might use my I live you can
basically mimic mimic the behavior of
Maya transform transform groups and
joints pretty much exactly and I would
imagine that you could probably do that
with any other 3d package out there so
there's a certain matrix structure to a
transformer joint in Maya and you get
the exact same behavior in JavaFX this
is a simplify that transform structure
basically has transitions and then three
Euler angle rotations and in the scale
this one I decided the pivot so you know
you know the translation you're pivoting
so that the rotations and scales will
happen about the pivot and then undo the
pivot which is the inverse pivot at the
end and say why didn't I even do this
why not just use groups right then cam
but if you just use the default
functionality that groups provide it's
great for 2d like however you want to do
something like this for 3d and the
reason is because when groups were
designed for TV they have this behavior
that the default especially the rotation
scale it's designed so that the pivot
automatically recalculates so that it's
at the center of the nodes their balance
which is that you want for TV that it's
not what you want for 3d and so you
actually want to customize your own
transforms and like this where like this
so that your pin it doesn't
automatically calculate if you add your
own rotation systems which a lot anyways
because the default is only one rotation
about what axis and you'll probably want
it to be something as flexible at this
so even more flexibility this yeah but
if you use a default notation and the
default scale inside of a group and then
as that stuff moves around the pivot
will recalculate which will mean that
stuff they're moving automagically
for you which is perfect for 2d you are
but it's not what you want for 3d so
please keep this in mind if you want to
learn more about if there's actually a
video file it's meant to eat before 9:00
but yeah basically only read it here for
the quickly any change to any of its
children including physician orientation
and scale they'll cause a little group
balance of change which will move the
object so you don't want to rely on the
2d rotation and scale that's built into
a group you want to customize it so you
have full control over
and it doesn't do this to Dino the found
centering the computation thing okay so
there are a bunch of useful methods that
learn that you really want to get to
know for 3d these are some of them my
favorites are local to scene transform
and get look at the parent transform
which you know get look with your seed
transform basically we give you the
transform from the big all the way down
to the nerve that you're interested in
very very powerful stuff okay
so unless geometry we have on deliver
defined shapes you know meshes and we
have predefined shapes to make it easy
for you just put something out there
boxes servers and spheres and finishes
currently we just have a triangle mesh
which is you know pretty good and I
simply trying to unless you set the
points texture coordinates the faces and
then smooth a rib so it's smoother
groups do is if basically tells which
faces you want to look like they're part
of the same basically share the normals
so they look smooth so like in theory if
you had two different smoothly fresh
face they look very faceted but if every
face where the same spinner get they
look smooth okay and let's see so yeah
basically it's pretty simple for boxes
you just specify them three dimensions
for soldiers you specify or the radius
and height then three spheres you
specify the the radius so let's take a
look
okay then this sir let me hide that over
there and if you start this so I'll tie
it to if it is there are a few banks
still and if you bring up a to DVI and
you have 3d geometry it mess up the
that's better
so there is a I'll talk about localized
and stuff like that as we go on but yeah
this stuff is still definitely in
progress
oh yeah I'll show you that later ok so
these are the primitives that are super
easy to create in JavaFX yeah pretty
much self-explanatory I also keep them
going through actually going to show you
the deep though so we also support 3d
meshes so then we made that them let's
see which one's should I bring up your
deep Margaux so this is deep with like a
Marvel style texture and then behind the
primitives there we go yeah so this is
um this is a custom mesh
okay let's keep on going
looks like lose this one gonna piss one
ok 3d primitives deep demo
okay so cameras
sejong effects provides a perspective
camera and the important thing to know
is that because genefex is initially 2d
the y axis is pointing down now if
you're used to 3d we are probably used
to I'll talk about actually a second but
basically there are two constructors for
creating a perspective camera when them
is very useful for to the ers and more
than is for 3ds in what you want to do
is run as a second one and yeah the
argument Ian's a bit confusing this I'll
explain it it fixed our position true is
basically that you want your 3d it's if
you've done 3d before this is the kind
of behavior that you used to the fix
that position is false basically if I
make it say that the camera has its
origin in the upper left corner of the
panel
and as you with the size changes in a
automatically movie
for you so that the organ in the upper
left-hand corner so you asked why did
you want a prospective character to
tRNAs now even though Jeff x2 and
whatever 2.1 2.2 was primarily to be met
you look at the TV you are the
perspective camera so you could you know
transform planes and stuff in 3d
coordinate space but it's still as this
if it's false which is the default
that's meant for two DUI ok so please
set it to true if you are interested in
a true 3d camera behavior then the
camera is now in order to see that
before wasn't annoyed so you couldn't
put it under group moves and transform
it in space but now you can and yeah you
can set the field of view if you've done
photography or a very familiar with this
but you know if you have a fisheye lens
and you want to like see everything and
it's going to be you know really pretty
distorted then you set it up to 100
degrees or even their many lenses
probably around 40 to 60 TVs and
telephoto zoom lenses are like you know
and then degrees to 30 degrees ish yeah
sir let if it's a telephoto lens that
objects in the in the distance and
objects in the foreground will appear in
are similar in size now just you know
you can for progress it's the same deal
if you have that fisheye lens
the difference in size becomes much
greater if an object's really near I'll
be super huge and if an object's fire
I'll be like super small and yeah we can
set the near and far clipping planes
demonstrate this in a bit and here's a
tip don't sit you're near clipping plane
to be a value smaller than your need and
your people claim to be a value
then you need because it does weird
things to you than that it's not just
John effects it's CG computer graphics
theity in general if you're like you're
clipping plane as I plug zero zero zero
then it does bad things to the matter it
does bad things to the visuals
so yeah I'm gonna show you that you see
here okay so remember I said before
about if you bring up a 2d you are it's
gonna mess up mess up you're on that's
better
well the workaround is to put a texture
maybe on your you can be just a very
simple texture like just a white texture
or something but that we are not working
on that issue for now until it is fixed
and checked into the main line then yeah
if it didn't have a texture if it looked
like that then you're the deaf person
does become messed up so that is you
know an issue and actually there is a
fixed foot in the sandbox but it hasn't
been checked into mainline yet oh okay
so you turn that off I'm sure you guys
some of this stuff maybe this coming up
my cheat sheet
it's not meant for public consumption
that this is how I'm gonna control some
of this stuff tonight
so for fear the view that glitzy making
the field of view you know then you know
that you know I don't notice where some
of the other stuff I've done
you see if I have so I found it's good
to you oops and kind of see I know I
don't I'll go ahead and show primitives
C's platonic okay yeah there's a good
one to show okay so
if my field of view is like really
really small then objects in the
distance and objects in the forehand
they're about the same size I mean
they're about the same size in real life
but well life in the 3d world like they
appeared like the same size basically so
you see the as I you know move this
around they look like they're about the
same size because my field of view is
really really small and if I set my few
other view to be really really huge and
of course if they're just my camera
position okay No
pretty cool huh that's like a fisheye
lens right there you know that's what
you get with a pretty crazy fisheye lens
you know if anybody said it cuz that's
kind of I'd look at right it's kind of
fun okay maybe we set the field of view
move my camera back well I've created
one of these okay yeah so let me uh talk
about cooking planes I did really close
things I don't need so doesn't get too
confusing there we go
okay so if my reel clicking playing too
close to the geometry then you can see
it's that's clipping it so you can say
okay I'm gonna be this far back as I
possibly can but the problem is if you
move you're far cooking babe playing too
far back also and actually I set limits
on it so doesn't
far but if you said it if you set your
miracle to play ready to place and your
far clipping plane very far back then
the geometry starts then during kind of
really and I've never really go ahead
and make it so I can do that just to
show what it looks like
something that's more of a cautionary
thing because um yeah true story said
that I was working at but it keeps on
building up at that foil okay yes it's
my primitive scenes the atonic
simulation did it turn there half a cube
and up the year so this is true story
when I was at Disney
I was something called me and said hey
if it's going on here and they had their
their cooking plan to be like something
yeah so this my new cooking plane is
like super small and there's basically
some crazy member craziness happening
it's basically dividing a certain
numbers by a very very small number and
the computers getting confused so if you
see stuff like this it's because your
lipid plane is like super super small or
you're far clipping plane is like super
super far away and the computer is just
getting confused it's numerical gets
into numerical error if you know what I
mean so I just wanted to show you this
because it's it's happened to people
like you know they might not be aware of
the fact that it's bad to have a
clipping plane that's super small via
ESC stuff like this and it's not just in
gel effects it's an it's in the multi
$10,000 packages too so I just thought
you should be aware okay okay let's keep
on going
yeah okay oh this is a fun one
it's not as the under it from the heart
why down this is why up so and there
since the dawn of computer graphics you
know people have said what's up and of
course 2d packages like you know
Photoshop Illustrator and all these
other packages why increases as you go
down right which makes sense for 2d
because you know you can you start
landing on a piece of paper you start on
the upper left-hand side either if
you're in the best available this and
those make sense for 2d but a lot of 3d
coordinate systems have more increasing
as you go up which makes sense cause
usually you think of X going this way
and then Y then this way of Z coming out
and some packages have Z going up you
know but what's the right answer and the
right answer is yes yes sir this way
wait I mean debate tonight anyone's
right it's all good so you know a gel
effects by default
why is down X is to the right and Z
points into the screen and well if you
want your 3d scene to be Y up and I'll
give you at least three values
that tonight so yeah that's pretty
simply just stick everything that's
thirty into a loop mode and then you
just flip the root node in X by 180
degrees and Y is up for anything in that
in that loop through the node or this is
actually that I did is you could take
your camera stick it inside an X form
and note that I used X form which you've
seen earlier there are X runs a subclass
of group that has my own set of
transform so it's not going to encounter
that all the pivoting that was designed
for to DUI which you don't want you
don't have the other pending that's
designed for two DUI happening in your
3d scene because then things will
automatically move on for you which you
don't want right so I took my x-ray or I
added I basically parented my X camera
ex-felon in the my loop and then
currency by camera to the cataracts form
and then instead of flipping the
geometry when you do these actually turn
my camera upside down okay I know if
sets if it's confusing until you think
about it from all if it does work that's
what I'm doing right now I'm actually
looking the eye up in my um in that
stuff that you saw so why is actually up
yeah well you know I they thought about
it you know we could get a living
you could actually do something very
similar but actually add an Aussie
rotation by 180 degrees to your camera
and then turn that upside down and then
put that on your camera xforms your
chemist outside with clean values
otherwise you can transform does have
one Ozzy and in 180 so this is a little
bit cleaner keeps your camera xform and
the more pristine state so you can move
that one around okay so but notice you
want lie up and lie down at the same
time is that possible is it possible yes
it is possible
let's not checked into the it's not
how'd it go a bit yep and it's being
worked on right now subsea this is it
subsea in this way you can have lie up
and lie down at the same time why is
that basically you can have more than
one camera per scene so subsea is
especially made that separates your
scene you can vendor part of the scene
with men camera policy another camera
you can use this for Overland you are
controls my heads-up display and you can
use it to have raw yep for your 3d
elements then Y down for your 2d
elements two cameras one scene or more
than two Cowboys if you want but this is
one way you can do it say the DJ pushing
wine up they write down the answer is
yes okay say nice I like thanks a lot
so once you know you have to fill jam
tree and you know in the material that
gives you a visual result and right now
there's just two types of light sources
and be an appointment but of course we
are definitely open to adding more in
the future okay so yeah that's the class
hierarchy that's what the critics say
you create the night you said it's color
well you can pair that directly to the
wheel that can put it on your group and
move the light or the group around so
you show you actually talked about this
initially based together so materials
materials you can sit a bunch of stuff
right now
you know in a point a will have fall
which will let you set the ambient
diffuse specular color and map actually
should have put normal Bob it's
technically named enough self
illumination and you can share our
materials between different shape notes
so that's the class hierarchy
that's the kraid you basically create a
following material you can we use an
image set the diffuse map normal map and
the specular color
and then take your geometry and set its
material to that material okay so I'm
going to show you some lights and stuff
because it's always fun to see the step
and now I can play this animation I was
kind of holding it back for a while so I
think we put the animation English so
you can see how the night reacts to the
material and if you look very carefully
you know let's take a look at this guy
here it looks as if there are grooves in
this geometry and if it's even there so
like that if you take your light and
start moving it around because you know
that this indentation over here it looks
like it's it's really there but it's
actually not in the geometry that's what
the name of that does and basically
gives you the appearance of having their
surface detail then is actually in the
mesh geometry itself which is kind of
nice okay let me change the color of the
light so it's not it you need to see
perhaps I mean slow down
yeah so it has he moved ahead across the
surface but really feels that the
surface has that extra detail and that's
what the normal map gives you and issue
these surfaces are texture than normal
how to different Norma to kind of show
you that the visual effect is like so
here these are the salt first and at
this way you know it appears as if the
surface has those bumps in it but
there's these bumps on to actually in
the mesh now it's not neither the finish
its what the name of that gives you to
give the appearance and you can tell you
can break the illusion if you look at it
from the side see because if you look at
it from the side it's like aha
it's all a trick that that something
isn't really there you know it doesn't
actually displace the jump shoe that via
this place of map which yeah it's
something else but yeah this is that the
moment map gives you and yeah you know
you can create different effects with
that make for example this one's coming
with a frosted glass kind of rock the
muse yours huh bring it over here
yeah bring it
forward that's a little bit too tight so
I kind of do that frosted um my parents
move it this way and this one is you
know get another different kind of
appearance that you could create with
your the fuse and mobile apps together
easier to say you know okay so that's I
yeah if you're curious this animation is
actually pretty simulated in Maya I did
quite a bit well you have it various
parts of that different physics solvers
to to Java X and in fact Jasper just
took the physics over yesterday's but I
didn't have it at the time when I was
making this it's pretty simulated in
Maya yeah which is fun because you can
actually make time to adapt its yeah and
if you wanted to place a bet you know
where it's going to land okay maybe I
oughta money that way potentially truck
I'm just kidding oh yeah good CPU vs.
GPU question since is pre simulated at
this point it's just you know basically
cashed out and the CPU is playing it
back so there's no but the GPU is doing
the rendering of course the GP is
all the 3d elements the duties a lot of
3d visuals like that Jerry do you know
the answer to that okay there's no
direct access yeah okay so let's see
over here okay let me see what else I
could show at this point since I already
am content of these two things yeah so
I'm thinking about this because they're
going to show that anyone watching about
it what
so yeah Jasper said hey you may have
good uptake and what if we had a deep
chested and so I thought okay yeah all
bodily deep chested so this is just for
you guys you know to look at we're gonna
show this at John one vote so we could
created a deep themed chess set in
Marvel yeah and yeah he knows even
though
around I'm not making the promise today
about uh you know I'm gonna be too
surprised that something like that
happens so I'm going to show you this
with different lights leaping the light
forward that's a little bit bright let
me turn it down a bit
yeah there we go so you know like with
these lights one thing you can do is use
one light as your key by use another
light as you're feeling like it's you
know pretty similar to what you do in
photography you know that's a little bit
too obvious let me just turn it down on
a bed and then you can use one night as
your rim light you know like let me make
it yet and put it in the back of it you
know what kind of good you know put it
up here yeah turn it down a bit
yeah we're not saying that that well is
it trying to hide let's have this hooked
up to two monitors and I really hope
it's not trying to show it on the other
monitor that doesn't exist which you
it's not on my car at a time I spent
monitor because that's where yes before
then it was inconvenient okay
that happens sometimes okay let me just
close this up and start it up again
nifty doo doo doo doo doo doo this
happen bit more expensive packages here
okay so just as reminder though I'm not
gonna sign a five-year laptop and sky
cleanup it's uh okay well let's see
little bit of something else right now
let's say we have here so I know it's
the year of the snake house if you're
modeling a snake but I haven't gotten
around to it yet but I took some I took
some of our pyramids no codes code the
cave it's basically women too and I oh
here we go
yeah need to change the background color
let me get rid of this axis
look Rach I'm just make it out of it
back yeah so this is animated in Maya
and you know you can turn the scene as
they spin it around and stuff like that
but this is using the we're gonna talk
about this X films in the beginning
these are basically using the equipment
it's created an X from the equivalent to
a Maya joy so basically I've animated
this in violet Maya's joints and now I'm
brought into gel effects and it's
basically doing the exact same thing and
death effects because we mimic that same
drug structure and JavaFX and the
animation is wrong so therefore you get
this kind of stuff happening and you
know if you look close at the surface it
has have that women map to create the
illusion of having more surface details
so if I take my lights and I gonna move
my lights are on the surface you know it
does have the illusion of having you
know there's a snake scales or
a little on the on the surface so the
perk of it I just think that might be a
little bit fun to look at okay let's see
let's see what else we have here
okay so let's say interesting something
a little more serious let's see yeah let
me take a step back you talk about so
that this is for example that a cube the
look like with just a diffuse map you
maybe see them that a cube looks like
without a texture map but this is just
with the diffuse map you know and this
is really looks like with the diffuse
and an old map so it definitely enhances
the visual appeal it still feels like it
has those white things sticking out of
it you know stucco or whatever it is
let's say it's stucco yeah you know look
at this fear this is a sphere now with
just the diffuse map you know maybe
there's a place right I mean I fake
planet imaginary point it good you know
you dig up your ad that marionette you
know it adds an extra level of detail to
it turned on the night the night save it
to grant earn this time you live it as
well and I'm gonna move it around across
the surface so it is
it has those continents sticking up out
of the geometry but in fact you know the
jump was actually very very simple it's
just this year it doesn't have that the
continents sticking up out of it the
geometry is just what you saw before
it's just this that you know yeah to be
more specific yeah it's just this yeah
so you know using those extra features
it does enhance the visual quality of
what you're doing I'm gonna see this we
have their space shuttle ok so this if
you've a bit of tender lovin care it
doesn't have a texture map it's very
faceted and it also doesn't have texture
so it's showing that because I develop
my UI up you can see through the object
but it actually can look a little bit
interesting you can use the visual
artifacts to our advantage to kind of
give it a certain look but you know this
is just an example of bringing
data into gel affects everything a good
man doesn't care we could make it look a
lot more realistic okay let's see yeah
let's see what else we have here if you
if you get the Java one to you baby sad
Duke doing some animation jumping around
called the US and stuff like that there
that require something called skinny
which we had in our prototype it was
very fast if you actually that no skinny
out with another the GPU someone asks a
question that the GPA but it is it for a
certain number of vertices our prototype
and a certain number of joints
influencing each vertex so a very hard
coded to have a very specific case which
is great for domains but not good for
general purpose API so we don't have
audio skinning at this time let another
GPA but who knows you know maybe I'll
make some a you know piece of software
skinning by the time the next Java one
comes word - Ben Duke back to life let's
see here let's you've got here physics
rings okay thing is okay this is what
you saw before so to give you the
my workflow you probably saw me playing
about this before this is a package
called Mario Mario 3d studio max blender
you know like very bizarre 3d content
creation packages you know you can kind
of think of them as the 3d offering to
equivalent of web photoshop and
illustrator on TV if this lets you
create content in 3d so here I have you
know created some things in Maya and
yeah let's know that it's a John effects
so it keeps like I keep on creating
these little in windows over here so no
let's go ahead and bring that in so it's
pretty small the lighting is kind of fun
so as you can see you know I pre
simulated it in Maya because I don't
have a extension hooked up in china
effects right now when the Jasper just
picked it up yesterday but I haven't had
his code with me but it is doing do it
I've been doing in John effects so you
can see it's you know I can leave my
camera around it as it's running and my
lights are really funky cuz I was trying
to make the special in the Gulf and see
somebody just kind of sit that back to
its default ish colors so you can see
the texture of the mirror and I've
created a texture it may not to get
apart like a grungy kind of a by rappa
dated chain kind of look you know so
yeah
and this is all running on a five-year
laptop you know so this is the kind of
stuff that you put the enjoy effects and
in fact you can't hit that you know if
you say desire you can hook up physics
directly to drive effects as well you
know and of course I just showed you
before you can move around your lights
quickly to do which is always fun yeah
there sure the axes let's see let's see
you know you know I said like you like
to do something other than your
yellowish bring it a little bit more
forward more the more the two left
and the thin light no let's make it so
what kind of show they make it any color
preference big okay that's kind of
boring
well bono please okay by the way let's
see maybe green no interesting how that
pardon a she's going today no that looks
too scary
well that's anymore well kind of looks
hmm yeah maybe something like that and
then my Vinny right I'll make it a kind
of a purplish and I'll stick that in the
back yeah it's kind of showing up over
there so yeah this is John effects 3d
and let me show you some more stuff so
yeah let's see if you have your picking
house the next item in this that doesn't
it yeah picking so I'm picking demo I
hadn't played out the code yet myself
but it's pretty good stuff then you go
back to here test 3d so this was written
by pavol another another Java fix team
and he's done some really fun stuff with
it so like you can pick stuff in 3d
move it around it's a mistake let me
call it a manipulator infinity you know
so you can hear whether I just make it
first clean oh I don't think it resizes
this one I'm gonna drive individual
elements spin it around so this is the
kind of stuff that you can do if picking
in 3d so you can kind of imagine the
kind of you eyes you can play with this
it could be pretty fun and let's see
there sure another demo I haven't played
on the cassette so I don't have a good
answer I don't know anything a touch Joe
do you know anything about touch
you don't know where your cursor is but
you know when your figure is really
touchy dragged I'm not gonna do that you
know obviously for the touchscreen type
devices but I haven't used it myself so
I don't have the uninformed answer to
give you
and that's whether you click with the
mouse and then to also study vulgar
affections you never have something
there yeah so maybe the older so before
we have multi-touch as a feature in
order to interact with your hand
it would just count that as enough yeah
you know know that the I think you can
also set those Skipton ticking so if you
want you to have your node the ignore
picking
yes okay let's see what you guys do if I
threw the kicking okay so this last the
name this written by a word 1/2 and this
inspired was something that he saw else
and basically it's been drops falling on
a surface and deforming the surface you
know so it just shows that you can do
surface deformations you know for
various purposes like for example
skimming is one type of surface
deformation where you take the geometry
and you skin it to join so it reacts to
those two that joint animation no better
way when I say skinny I don't mean to
the UI skinny I'm you like 3d mesh
skinning which is different but yeah so
yeah does anybody have any more
questions
oh yeah
as it's written a while animation script
X next that's a very excellent question
thank you very much for asking that
well okay so there's we have internet
for testing purposes and stuff I mean we
do have a a very good importer
internally for testing we plan to
release an importer for at least one 3d
file format and someone else just this
week apparently has create an importer
for their powerful that's right I
believe it's a VG colada Castillo and
three lists and you can download it from
that effects there's a link to it from
effects experienced calm huh yeah
interactiveness not alowed or something
like that
you can start on the effects experience
so importers are actually very popular
you know area of work we're gonna
provide an importer for one format if we
had time they'd be great if we could do
more
in a way its own greatest common
denominator of animation you know format
the animation script not programming
animations with transform well okay yeah
that's a lot of very good questions well
yeah I mean there's so many little
questions in there so I'm gonna try to
break it down okay so came back to the
employee sessions that is they know
that's common denominator format though
that's the discussion answer that for
nutmeg lady Jays has been around for
decades and it at least inputs your mesh
and your materials your textures but it
doesn't bring you an animation I don't
believe yes okay yes so then that
affects ml should be able aid in
anything into Java FX and billion
anything that tell effects understands
if XML is the XML Java text file format
caviar yes we actually just face it
indirectly for the moment but in series
all the steps that I've heard could be
able to be switched into the head - no
no you can it's things that we have been
reserved is one of personal is and other
this yeah
completely the other being that in all
the data structures that you can say
encourage vagina pets and you know the
message from the program all that stuff
should rather than it is
yeah that's what deficit earned
understanding is
it was nearly that's the idea to design
it so that the program is really as well
just on her side absolutely about her
yeah so if you guys might have been
involved you know misleading you and
contribute to the community and be so
nice to see you guys writing more
employers and stuff of that like stuff
like that for example if anybody wants
to write an FBX or a koala importer and
make that available got to be really
really cool or yeah and there's already
some have been done that's under some
very generous licenses like if you gave
to it's in C++ what is it called we're
gonna call Jim and I said import yeah be
there I'll set input there's basically
some milk in C++ so if anyone's
interested in you know are they're
writing a Java outfit for that or you
know turn that into Java I think it's
BSD licensed yeah looks like it hasn't
been touched in about three years
yeah see there might be fun to look into
yeah if you have the time resources you
know we do you know make more available
but this is where you know if you're
excited about this stuff this is a great
way to you know look at stuff like asset
import or look at your favorite file
format and look at bringing that in I
think that could be a lot of fun
actually and yeah quite frankly I'm
personally very excited about this stuff
I think it's I think that it's a clear
new feature in gel effects 8.0 I'm
biased someone else will say something
else but anyone else are merely and
other questions
yes I did my job it is my job and that's
then I'll tell you some true stories so
Java one 2011
yes as we were up some very late nights
working on trying to get demos to work
for Java one like this there's this
you're satisfied so we're looking at
until midnight one night and it just
because I'm you have to keep on working
so you went to Jasper's house and kept
on working again till like 3:00 or 4:00
a.m. and then you know and then I got
some sleep and then I meant that at 9:00
a.m. so it is fun but it is we also it
takes effort to mixed up you know he has
a lot of great ideas and it's fun to
make it happen
yeah I mean like connecting up connect
that was his idea too deep a couple of
years ago
and yeah there but you know it'd be
pretty easy to draw
some color to a texture
there's another example and I think only
also video will support Android but yet
in general no crudely genefex 3 whether
they the early access release is
available for Windows only while we're
actively working on a Mac version I mean
this has been an Nvidia whatever
80-something em you know not even bit in
the 8000 series so it's basically 5
years old and it runs out in video 5
years ago card basically any neither
similar semi-modern Nvidia or ATI or
Intel HD you know 4000 or a free better
ones on HD 3000 so currently you can run
an you know let's say Windows 7 we're a
ATI Nvidia takes the 3000 4000 dish yeah
so anything is
madara roughly sort of modern hardware
and then yeah we're actively working on
the mac version so visit he he's max
that should be coming out in the
not-too-distant future
Oh
building building for iOS or Android VM
in very tight
yeah so the way to something happy
bundled with your application file
and that way you can you can actually
see from the outside actually we've done
that we've done that from from the macro
and you can see an application called
and tumble effect with with Jerry just
do a search for generator
well then you enjoy this grand area
sequence of images as a texture for a
surface that is being deformed by
raindrops
it might be a world basically you would
write to the canvas and then you get it
use a writable image - yeah hold again
image picture can't be a writable bit
right okay there there are there's a
block example
you'll find an example
yeah so feel free to talk about anything
is seen except for that deep chested
just within an innovator and how does
you know yeah you know yeah anyways
innovation takes work yeah so I think no
questions yeah thanks so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
