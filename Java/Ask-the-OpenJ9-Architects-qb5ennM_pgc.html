experts up here to introduce themselves
John will stick you on the spot sir my
name is John do l'chaim to Java CTO on
an IBM distinguished engineer and I'm
responsible for the IBM Java runtimes it
might be himself and one of those is
open j9 feedback generator my name is
Mark stutely I'm a senior software
developer at IBM might work for him and
him I am one of the project leads for
eclipse open j9 and I'm one of the
project leads for eclipse Omar which is
the project that opened j9 consumes I've
been a just in time compiler developer
for about 15 years I currently lead the
Testarossa compiler team at IBM
and I'm Dan hi Ginga I also work for for
John and for Steve I've been involved in
virtual machine development for 10 years
did you guys service been involved in
virtual machine development for 10 years
at IBM all that time involved with the
j9 virtual machine code base and I've
been involved with jsr 292 and 335 and
both the implementation and the expert
group and we're here today to to do a
ask me anything session on open j9 I
figured I'd start with sort of three
slides of content on open j9 a couple of
links and a little bit of an overview of
the project so I'll run through that
quickly so I know I said I wasn't gonna
I had said I wasn't gonna use the mic up
here but good thing it works out so open
j9 was created about two weeks ago early
September there's the link to the github
there there's a link to the webpage it's
licensed under the Apache EPL v2 license
and sorry the Apache v2 and the EPL v2
which and the secondary licences clause
they're a great thing about that is it
makes it compatible with GPL code so it
can be combined with open JDK
if you're interested in getting a build
our friends at the adopt openjdk project
have made nightly builds available this
is a great place to go grab a binary to
test out your application and then just
an overview of how the different
communities fit together
open j9 is not a full JDK on its own it
combines with open JDK so we've got open
JDK we take hotspot out of it we add
eclipse open j9 and eclipse om our
Eclipse omr is another project that came
out of the j9 codebase it's a series of
language agnostic runtime components so
you could take those and do any language
runtime you wanted with them and then on
the other side where I'll have IBM's
product which is a small shim of IBM
isms built around the open j9 with open
JDK all right so that's a couple of very
quick overviews hopefully everybody's
been able to catch either my session
yesterday or mark session yesterday and
now I'd like to just throw it open to
everybody for any questions you might
have
hello hello hello hello didn't it that's
when I said all the smart stuff too
didn't hear a word of it
hello hello hello hello hello
right on now the singing begins all
right so start out who wants to be the
brave one to start out with the first
question we got questions for you -
who's tried it in this room who's
downloaded it who wants to download it
it's well it's our it's depends who you
are but people been begging us to open
source our j9 virtual machine for the
last 15 years because it's been the IBM
production JVM forever and it's high
performance it's reliable stable it's
got great features for diagnostics tons
and tons thousands and hundreds of
thousands of enterprise customers are
actually using it so it's a
battle-tested JVM so two weeks new
doesn't mean it's two weeks new it means
that that's finally when we got it out
to source so it's actually a high
performance JVM when we've been
optimizing it for new cloud workloads so
the new cloud workloads have a lot more
dynamic behavior in terms of memory use
and adaptability to what's happening in
cloud environments as opposed to the old
servers which we still do l the old
servers just take a whole machine and
run really really well
cloud you have to be more
you know cognizant of the dynamic
behavior and memory adjustment and
scheduling and all that stuff so we
optimize that for things like memory use
so that's why people should look at it
because we've been focusing on a lot of
things like size size was comparable
throughput and we also have a lot of
cool features a GPU exploit we have very
high-end compilation which all that mark
talked about because he's part of the
Testarossa team and there's essentially
if you can call you can name an
optimization we do it and so we have you
know on any given day the highest
performance Java Runtime that's why you
should try it and when I say any given
day that's because the other guys also
compete and so what we see is a really
great ecosystem for us winning then they
go out nope we got to fix ours they win
we try we win and the result is you
wouldn't anybody who uses it will see
better performance over time for their
Java applications that's one of the
reasons to download it it's actually a
great virtual machine and it runs you
know Java 9 today because that's the new
release but we also have it in our
product as as a production version of
Java 8 so it's actually a real thing not
just somebody over this much project so
I would try it fuzzy
look another report I think good to note
there is that it's not just a source
code dump we didn't just take our code
and dump it into an open-source project
and you know we're not using it in fact
we are developing actively at that
project of the two projects right
eclipse will tomorrow two Clips open
tree 9 if you go and look at the Eclipse
of lomar project which we open sourced
in March 2016 there's a ton of activity
that as more than three thousand commits
over that time period so then there's
you know kind of on the order of 20 to
40 commits happening per week in the
project so there's developers actively
working in that project directly we're
doing virtually zero internal
development with that with that project
we've been pulling it in on an hourly
basis into our product it's built into
our Java 8 project the one that we just
released in September as an update to
Java 8 hours or 5 has the most recent
version of Eclipse open j9 in it so it's
still production caliber production
quality and and we're working directly
there in Omar and we're gonna work
directly there and open j9 so it there
they'll be very active projects you'll
see lots of stuff happening even even
now if you go and look there are tons of
issues open they're a ton of the pull
requests
yeah I'm question another one who wants
to become a VM developer so it's the
first thing you and this enables you can
go and see how we built our JVM you can
learn about advanced JVM techniques you
want to become a VM to offer and well
then go download the code and start
digging through it and you could learn
stuff that's and and and it's it's you
know it'll take a while and there's a
lot of code there but it's it's another
example and there's lots to learn
there's lots of garbage collectors that
are in there you could learn about
there's a lot of code generation stuff
you can learn about there's a lot of
other components to the VM and second
the big big piece of code and if you
want to learn about certain aspects of
how Java works or how even basic
runtimes work runtimes that manage
memory and coach an inch it it's a great
place to learn it and if you're
influenced that direction that's another
great way to do it and directly
influence you know a runtime that you
can consume basically that month and not
wait a year or two years until Java
comes out or something it's it's a real
life thing that you can use again one of
the great ways to learn the code is to
get involved not only to read it but
then to make small improvements you know
even if you start out with hey I found
you know some spelling or grammar
mistakes or hey I found an issue with
the code formatting or I found a you
know a small bug here and there open
pull requests get them in you know
getting used to building the code
getting used to reading it and playing
with it is a great way to get started to
learn more of what's going on in the
code base
I think to find that the code base is
actually a lot it's a quite a module
that are designed like that JIT is in
one place that it has a very modular
design that GC is one one place you can
you can it has a very well-defined
interface to the rest of the components
we've tried hard to keep it at a very
modular design level so that it's easier
for our developers to work for it but it
should also be easier for other people
to start picking up the codebase and you
know if you have questions show abut the
show but the other repo and ask
questions and we'll help you get started
yeah is
it is it is the source code for
metronome is there all of the GC
policies are there balanced for large
games metronome for very small
consistent pause times GenCon for your
standard generational collector and
liking the other one opt three button
for which is just gone yeah in general
if there's any feature that you're
familiar with being in the IBM SDK it's
seen eclipse open j9 so that includes
share classes and includes a metronome
it includes our dynamic Ã¤Ã´t technology
all of the adaptive compilation toby is
there
combining
please
so we track the question was is there
oracle going to do their release and
then sometime later we're going to do
ours and our intention is to work
directly in open JDK as much as possible
right now we have a mirror open JDK into
our own github repository just to make
it easy for us to get our patches our
modifications and into the open so you
can build open j9 most of those patches
are actually to the build system just to
be able to plug our our repos our build
process into the open JDK build process
but our intention is to work in open JDK
to be making changes there wherever
possible and to be tracking that repo
daily and hourly if possible
and then
so the open j9 codebase our code base is
intended to be a single code base that
will be shared across Java age Java 19
18.3 Java 10 or you know whatever the
next releases are we're going to have
one code base one repo that supports all
of these and then we'll have a separate
extensions repo to track the open JDK
for each of those but the core VM the
courgette the core GC all of that should
be one stream one version I think you're
asking how soon after an Oracle release
comes up with the via matching open j9
immediately we're tracking it in real
time so there's no it's essentially it's
a replacement JVM for the hotspot open
JDK stack it's just open JDK class
libraries on open j9 instead of on
hotspot so we just have a what if we
consider a better VM implementation that
we replace basically as part of the
day-to-day development process for lots
of reasons we have a lot of features
that they don't have that we need for
our customers and a lot of features that
are very unique to to JVMs in particular
so that's that's why we're doing it
pardon me
I'm not sure answer I know the question
what's the main difference between which
we named them already but we can
reiterates things like shared classes so
we take our class files and put them
into a shareable area that's read-only
that means if you run multiple instances
of Java for example in the cloud you
have a reduced footprint because
essentially you're making a shared area
for all your read-only code if the
simple way to think of it is there it's
like a dynamic dll so dll allows you to
share object code between running
processes because Java class files
aren't convertible to DLL is that easily
and statically you don't want to do it
because you have to do a lot of stuff at
the plate
we essentially created create a DLL in
memory on the fly and that's our shared
class's facility and I could ship that
can save you a significant amount of
memory now we can put other stuff in
their code and java bytecodes and native
code and even strings in some cases and
other things so that's a feature that we
have that Oracle doesn't half and it
gives us significant performance boost
in terms of footprints the footprint is
important at least in cloudspinners
because you're paying by the byte so if
you're paying 10 cents a gigabyte and
you use twice as much 20 cents instead
of 1 into the 10 cents so it's economics
that are driving this investment because
people who want to deploy lots of a
large volume of micro services lots of
VMs will want to have the minimum memory
use possible because you're paying
typically on cloud by memory use that's
it that's one of the features we also
have you know there's a real-time
garbage collector no one else has that
one that kind of technology in their in
their runtime there's a dynamic Ã¤Ã´t
which is a feature that caches JIT code
in the share classes cache so that for
future runs are very very fast because
you don't have to jet compile so think
of it like amortize the cost of JIT
compilation
over multiple runs so you save the
compilation time but it still allows
that code to be reoptimize later those
kind of features of
there's a size they're armed oh we have
we have a small footprint version that
is I believe smaller than the OpenJDK
with new Java 9
I think the verdicts out at the moment
because Java 9 is designed to be
stripped into nothingness and so we have
the technologies a lot of your strip to
nothing but the size will be
approximately the same specifically
because the libraries are the same so
the big piece of it is the same it's
just the VM itself I don't know if we
have a size some pie size
We certainly have a footprint savings at
run time but if you're asking me about
the disk size that's really about pieces
you could remove so that you don't have
to package them which is the kind of a
docker use case you want to throw away
all the stuff that isn't needed and then
have a smaller deployment there
resource manager agents mean I see so
you want our tsj support that is not in
our code base for the open j9 they'll be
put that out there is that important to
you I assume yeah okay because there is
there's other resource support and still
makes them to write and there's some her
just take that out don't tell me now you
took it out but thanks because that has
to go back in eventually because there's
but it's not gonna give you the real
time thing but it gives you isolation of
memory allocation in different contexts
so you can do prevent two tenants from
harassing each other but doesn't give
the scope memory is what you're talking
about
we don't know that we took that out
because we stopped supporting our tsj I
was no blast release was Java 7 past
relationships or was for RTS J so is it
so is it Artie has change that you're
interested in or is it memory management
the origin what is the
yeah and so that's a that's the long
debate we should talk after but the
things like RTS J is a workaround for
the fact that Java doesn't have a hard
real-time GC and this get well yeah all
the the property the thread spec doesn't
allow you to set priorities and define
the rules for priority inversion and all
the things that northeaster then gives
you right so but if the spec allowed
just three or four different things in
thread then you wouldn't need that and
in the scope memory is only there
because there's not a real hard real
time GC in that they can reforms onto
java into java like a suspect metronome
is a hard real time you see you don't
actually have to program specially to
get the real time because you can you
don't have to use scopes which is are
difficult to use you just have a hard
real time GC where you can configure for
memory time max memory max pause time
and utilization utilization percent
visitor CPU that you want used and you
can pick two or three to you two to
configure and and that's that means any
program can have real time behavior from
garbage and vector that doesn't give you
real time behavior your code that's up
to the developer you can still write
code that has not gone deterministic
clearly yeah and and then the course
that's ready external threading has to
be done right that you need a mapping
back to to the to the OS scheduler then
that gives you a predictable thing on
portably on whatever it are toss your
honor so that's part of the product that
was back in Java 7 but we didn't have a
lot of you know
when when you hear the word real-time in
industry is the enterprise don't meet
build time they just mean fast or
something like they don't mean hard
deadlines they just mean fast and
relatively responsible responsive
there's response what what kind of
latencies are you interested in what do
you care about do you care about
milliseconds do you care about
microseconds well you need to schedule
up a certified Hardware so the certified
Hardware would ensure that things like
background memory scans are done as a
scheduled thing as opposed to for for
deer and refresh and stuff as a part of
scheduled operations in the real time
voice instead of a firmware that just
interrupts you hard blocks you fro know
period of time it's all of the hardware
we have certified to do scheduled oval
DRAM refresh and other housekeeping so
that you wouldn't have any pauses so
it's a fairly sophisticated thing that
we we used to have some product but it's
very specialized if you want talk later
and be happy to hear what else you need
all right so no questions
you're asking if there's library
differences between the two JD case we
reuse the open JDK class libraries so
99% of the code is the same there's a
very small layer of classes at the VM
knows about that we replace so we
replace things like Java line class we
replace things like Java line thread
java.lang stream and some of the method
handle related codes method handle
related classes yeah but the majority of
the code is identical and so the the the
JDK we produce out of open j9 as a
product is 100% compliant and certified
as the IBM JDK so it's the same platform
implementation compatible so that's
that's there under the covers works we
use libraries we have additional
libraries that add functionality for
example our DMA support that's already
May is a high speed network
protocol and takes off loads from CPU to
the network card and that transparently
accelerates niÃ±o and niÃ±o to a
standard library but under the covers we
do something significant
care about that particular aspect of i/o
it's just done better so compatible has
to be compatible otherwise you can't
have people change their code just to
get on our platform it's it's compatible
but it just does things differently so
the JVM has always been something that
you could implement independently and
pick one there's been 50 different in
JVM is built over the course of the last
20 years for Java 50 good ones they
don't all survive of course they have
various reasons and so
you know this is our production VN and
it just makes things better in a
compatible way that's the whole point of
it
yeah there's a website yeah
start from the open j9 website you
should be able to find links yeah and
details there and if there isn't
there'll be links off to some of the IBM
documentation which we've been relying
on until we rewrite the new
documentation from open j9 yeah and then
there's things there you go look at the
performance comparisons you get the code
run it side by side against open JDK the
the over JDK hotspot version and and see
these the differences there pardon me
you have the other chart I guess it's
just go to the site if you have Wi-Fi
yeah yeah hopefully it works you are not
connected to the Internet I couldn't get
a connection in here either
yeah but if you order this feel the
website there's a set of comparisons and
performance and other things that you
can go do try the code yourself and just
spin just do it part of me
no no we implement the same
specification and then we are compliant
to that specification there's only one
spoon in one specification and we both
implement the same one that's how Java
works to implement a gavage machine
specification and you also know about
the API
you know the platform specification for
Java six or seven or eight and together
you can have a JDK well a JRE for the
runtime and in the JDK is additional
tools that come with a Java C and those
things so there it's just it's a plug
replacement for open JDK just built the
open JDK with hotspot use just a plug
replacement for it so you shouldn't see
any real differences other than better
performance and awesomeness and all the
stuff that we're bragging about up here
they get that
right so the community binary is adopt
OpenJDK where are going to be compliance
tested so this is that's a community
thing which is all open-source and GPL
classpath so that's what you can get and
then there's a then there's our use in
the products as well for our customers
but those are identical so we want to do
this so that people can just get it and
try it compare it in their world just
have it easily available to anybody and
if they decide to be serious and go into
production I think they have a you know
a real use and they can either upgrade
to a product with support if they want
or they can just just continue to use it
for free or whatever and that's pretty
much how everybody does Java support for
example Oracle does the same kind of
thing you just use their chat about all
you want but if you really need to be
able to call them and get a fix on their
code you end up buying support and in
IBM we do the same kind of thing for so
it's freely usable by anybody for any
reason and but if you have an IBM
product or IBM hardware for IBM stuff
with it you get support - so you'd call
us and shake your fist about whatever
broke and then we'll fix it in something
and I know if that answers your question
because you know
new comers
we use the same set yeah we have
additional tools for profiling and
performance monitoring and those kinds
of things in addition to the base we
have additional stuff but the same set
is there that's in OpenJDK so j-type is
for example if you want to see where
you're not supposed to be touching
covert or something like that that's all
in there so it's the same there's a
question coming back somewhere you
I don't
tractor beam
as a matter as a matter of fact if you
move to a star 5 8 s or 5 s our main
line supported version which is just a
standard service refresh you're soaking
in this and you get all the great latest
greatest updates so you get all the
leaves greatest updates - so if you
upgrade to our production version as as
Mark said it's coming in every hour and
we have to take monthly and so you'll
and all the stuff you have is still
there well what yeah so everyone does
that it's a little bit scary but
typically happens is they introduced a
new GC and we've done the same thing and
then we leave it in for two releases
before we switch it to default so it's
been tested in production so when we did
a gen con which is a generational
collector in front of the concurrent
collector so concurrent is like CMS
right but and ours is just called Colin
or concurrent and Gen is generational
scavenger such an con is the combined
work when we had that we were introduced
it to releases prior to making it a
default but all of WebSphere had
switched prior and said the command line
because it was so much better customers
were getting 25% boosts just by turning
it on because of the amount of garbage
they were making so we battle tested for
four to five years and then it becomes a
default and then so it might be yeah you
might be shocked but you if I'd be
shocked if they took out their other
collectors and just switched you that
would be kind of frightening
we just which which of the five or
defaults and we switched to the the one
that's giving the best performance
across the board
anyway to force the do you mean to pick
the garbage collection policy yeah we
have an option - x GC policy and and
then you can specify you know which of
the mouth which of the garbage collector
garbage collector policies you'd like
whether it's balanced for large heaps
GenCon for most things or metronome for
small deterministic causes so there's
command-line options to pick which GC
policy did you mean to force the DC
policy or did to be to force a GC cycle
to happen to force a GC cycle to happen
you shouldn't do that but but I mean
there is a there's an API through the
system class to do not ring you can
cause it to do a GC one
yeah yeah the from word system dodgy see
is that it used to be in the old days
when the collector was concurrent it
would say do a few more cycles hurry up
hurry up hurry up so that you wouldn't
get behind and so if you had something
where you had to kick it to do that the
problem is if you have a different GC
technology we're forcing it isn't super
super small like the concurrent when we
just do a couple more steps and you
actually have to do a full GC cycle
right then calling it all the time
drives your performance to zero because
you're just wasting your time GC you
shouldn't and so the API isn't rich
enough to pick the right kind of thing
the right kind of thing should be it's a
good time to GC and then the VM can go
no it's not and ignore you which is what
what mostly people have to do now
because if you call it too often your
performance goes to zero because if
you're in a tight loop calling it too GC
your waste in your GC time so it can't
actually respect right that's not
actually spectra it's just it's you know
it's a hint to tell the GC to do more in
garbage heavy situations but all the VMS
actually know when to GC and are very
aggressive in trying to drive a GC
including ours for cloud workloads to
try to keep your memory as low as
possible because that actually improves
your performance better cache better
co-op in der Garde and essentially
cooperate well with others because
there's other things running so you know
share your toys share your memory so so
don't call it if you have it in your
thing and you think it's doing you a
favor try to take it out and you'll see
what happens they'll be it'll be better
I think the only thing that some people
used to force is the system's you see to
get class unloading so if you have heavy
class unloading people thought that
would help you don't need to do that it
does it okay we do it right
no no you have a question I know you
have a question afterwards oh man you
don't want everyone to know your secret
questions come on Dino is sitting right
next to go force a question oh no I got
I got people in the audience you can get
it out of you if you want so who
actually uses any IBM products that are
based with either open gems SDK or
WebSphere or other things
WebSphere ok our Liberty as well
WebSphere Liberty yeah ok so this is
part of our full OpenStack we have open
j9 telling them at the metal yes yeah
and actually yes yeah it's exact same
one we just open sourced it and if your
run the latest version of Java 8 if
you're running Java 8 which I recommend
because Java 8 will be your go to VM for
the next five six years
Java 9 is interesting for developers
because they have to learn about
modularity and refactor their code and
it's not a trivial thing it may not be a
trailor thing if you're if you've been
in a purist developer it's gonna be easy
if you're using all sorts of internals
and you want to refactor into modules
it'll be a longer process but then
you'll also have to get all your
components that you're depending on also
refactored so it's it's you know we call
it the 32 64-bit transition it was the
same as in the old days when you had to
go get 64-bit dll's from your premier
and if you if you bought you know code
from a provider that used to only
provide 32 so you couldn't go until all
your components were upgraded to
modularity as well so we see that as a
developer release that developers can
really get to sink their teeth into see
what's gonna work what isn't gonna work
upgrade the open source components
potentially because a lot of the
enterprise customers use a lot of open
source believe it or not they may not
know it but they are so those have to be
upgraded before we see a broad broad
adoption of eight or nine so we upgraded
an eight and that's what you'll be
soaking in for the neck
eight years is it eight seven years 2025
so so that's that's the other thing you
know eight is stable it's the thing that
people have been doing that's why we
have the latest this VM which is a nine
VM running an eight because we know that
people aren't going to be able to get to
nine in all cases because of the
majority of their code it may not run in
the way they want to in modularity
systems yeah
there's a long list Dan's gonna tell you
but I was gonna say actually it's a
fairly short list
sorry jong-kook if to brag a little more
was intense and crazy changes most of
the VM changes are tracking the module
state to be able to know when doing
access checks does this module read that
module is it allowed to see this is it
allowed to see that package and so it's
mostly in visibility checking and in
tracking the module states there's a
little bit of work that had to go into
things like JVM Ti because there's new
API for dealing with modules there's a
little bit of workaround J&amp;amp;I for the
same reason but the module specific
piece of work that you have to do for
the JVM was smaller than expected a lot
of that resides actually in the class
libraries
we did it at the same time that it was
occurring in openjdk so it was quite a
lot of work because it it was tracking
as the specification changed so you'd
implement down one path then you
backtracked and then you didn't lament
something else and backtrack so it's
been a lot of work to get there but I
think if you sat down now and took a
look at the specification you probably
have a lot less work to do it's really
the class libraries that needed the most
munching cuz they have all the
dependencies and they had to figure out
where they were if you see the pictures
that are drawn for all the connectivity
in the in the class libraries if you
want to chop a big piece out you'd be
surprised what dependency calls that
piece and that shouldn't right so if
things were dependent low level stuff
dependent on the windowing system go
figure right like you know weird which
caused the problem because the startup
performance if you have to open your AWT
windowing system dll it adds 300
milliseconds of stupidity or something
to just open it to not use it all right
so a modular system should be faster
because you really only get what you
need this is if it's designed well
yes yeah yeah but yeah so we moved this
this VM is an update to our Java eight
supported line so Java 8 sr5 going
forward and then we will continue to do
that and the reason we do that is
because we have such a long lifetime
expected for 8 with our customers
because they will probably stick on 8
for a while for a lot of their
production workloads and then they'll
adopt new Javan EIN features for maybe
some new stuff micro services or other
things so we want a single VM for both
and so for example if your mainframe
customer anyone here a mainframe
customer like the best processor in the
planet said processor I heard he's gonna
start getting mad we've added new
instructions to that kind of designed
years ago to help garbage collection so
you have a we have a guarded stories
it's called guarded storage which helps
you do a conditional fetch of memory so
when things move we can actually
concurrently run the execution while a
garbage collection is happening so it
makes generational scavenging
significantly have significantly less
pauses as part of the the pause so just
for regular workloads so I mean that's
with you know a small amount of hardware
support busy guys will be really mad but
with actual hardware support and that
gives you since called guarded guarded
storage you can actually do a nicer
garbage collector implementation and so
currency of processor is important to us
and that's why we want you know all the
processor vendors there because then
every new feature you don't have to wait
for a major upgrade 9 10 11 to get your
favorite processor supported you get a
new engine in an existing form factor
and it just works which gives you you
know the best of both worlds one of the
reasons use Java the latest greatest
processor exploits without changing your
application because we dynamically
compile to that processor and we didn't
mention earlier what processors do we
support in the last question right now
right now we have three platforms that
we're supporting with the open source
project so we have Linux on x86 we have
Linux on PowerPC and we have Linux on Z
on our mainframes so that's the that's
the current state of things we've got
work underway right now to bring some of
the other platforms that the IBM SDK
runs on like Windows and AIX and and
z/os sorry for you we're in the u.s. I
should say cos and we've also got some
issues open at the open source project
already to talk about new platforms that
we haven't traditionally focused on like
Mac OS and an arm and some people have
actually been reaching out to to help us
with those platforms and that's you know
we're hoping that continues that's just
goodness for us
any platforms missing from that list
that people think we should be including
any once we should drop by an Intel
that's what we all love to do of course
is he's promised everyone everyone
guests for some guys work so you mean
now
WebSphere replaced micro Edition and
custom edition products those things
those oh you should mean micro addition
the you mean the Java ME well j9 is the
long history it used to it started out
at them as an embedded JVM and it was
exclusively used for embedded for the
first few years because it was small the
original the original libraries were
300k the VM would fit in 512 K and it
was a good vm for that and that's why
it's modular you could throw a legit and
replace it with a different smaller JIT
and all of those things so it has the
Heritage there is no ME version because
Emmy is going away
there's no Emmy future Emmy has been
deprecated by Oracle because they want
you to use modularity to get your
smaller runtimes
and so there is no real Emmy anymore and
even I think embeddedness is gone but I
can't speak to detail about what
Oracle's saying I just know that there's
really no Emmy going forward well
actually the Emmy that's going forward
is specifically c LD c which is the
phone one that which is super small and
a subset of the actual JVM it doesn't
support all the JVM features so CLBC for
the super small phones is not real
the connections
we have we have that code and we could
open source it we haven't haven't really
thought through sure why not
so yeah so that there was one of those
things where you point out as a subset
of SC m e wasn't it was a sub superset
so the subset plus so much extra stuff
so you can't run all your Emmie
applications on an SC runtime for some
crazy reason the crazy reason is called
what poor design okay yeah I'm unfit I'm
on film now for sure so but but it was
it was just to how it was organically
created that your people needed these
new api's and you can't just you know
create a new platform over here and and
and keep it up with some other platform
so it just didn't match so things like
the connection frameworks for example
those we have because those can be
re-implemented on standard i/o and
everything so those we should be able to
do location and others those are really
hard end up being Hardware specific
anyway in some cases though you could do
a provider that plugs in or something
but we'll look at it we I mean there's
the codes it's not tons of code but
there's no reason to to keep it
ourselves it just wasn't a priority in
this list cuz we're focused on SC and SC
9 that's right
right right so there's licenses there
there there might be licensing another
stuff like you want a bluetooth or
something right from from nope right
from Nokia or something those those
api's but yeah there's a fair number of
those yeah that's true yeah I think
that'll be an interesting thing what
happens with SE and embedded and how
what whether you'll start to see a bunch
of community modules that run on base
that just become base plus a bunch of
very small extensions for specifically
running embedded telematics headless
that kind of thing if you want soar but
we'll see there's lots of I think it'll
the modularity thing will open up new
platform opportunities for base plus
other things you don't want all of SC
for a lot of use cases you just want the
base language and then you want your
five things that enable hardware or
whatever yeah yeah you need the
standards if you're gonna create a
platform that you want other folks to
write to so if you're gonna embed a
communities formatted and you want to
have embedded which I I think I gather
you're doing you're gonna want people to
write for your platform you're not gonna
want to have proprietary api's because
they won't do it anyway it will will it
interesting yeah if there's a lot there
too and there's a lot of it that you
know that example shows the the speed
that open-source in open-source projects
can actually move when they're actually
well if you have the money to spend you
can really move stuff fast and that's
one of the reasons we open source that
we we have a lot of our own source IBM
is a not a company that doesn't have
resources but partners with IBM could go
significantly faster which is why our
micro profile within EES basis with you
know Red Hat PI R and five other groups
are our partnerships here we're looking
to have all the hardware vendors with us
but also all the hardware extenders to
and and then the cloud providers to to
configure for you know what I would say
is customized version of the runtime in
the cloud and those kinds of scenarios
that maybe weren't in reach before
anymore I don't know how much time we
have
forty-five minutes
is it anymore questions one last
question
a really hard question let's go for it
something difficult
who's gonna now try it if you haven't
tried it who's gonna go to adopt obj
game download it right away it would it
would it would you get answers quicker
by downloading it and try it and all the
questions so you should do it do it
while you're here so the download speeds
fast
all right we're being told that we've
run out of time so thank you everybody
for coming and for asking questions and
we'll be around either find us at the
booth or the IBM booth or the Eclipse
booth mark I think you're there later
today yeah 2:30 2:30 to 4:30 home be at
the Eclipse boots if you have more
questions about anything or just catch
me walking around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
