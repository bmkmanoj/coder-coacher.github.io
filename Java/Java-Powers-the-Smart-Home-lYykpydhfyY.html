technology Network we're here on the
floor of Java 1 talking to members of
the Java community
I have Volker bulk with me hey Volker
nice to meet you
so you have this really interesting
setup with Java and some sensors so tell
me what we're looking at yes ok so we
have here a gateway with an process of
our partner
Freescale in it since this gateway runs
java a embedded and we have several
appliances like a smart meter smart
sends or smart plug and the camera they
are all connected or all communicating
to each other why as the ZigBee protocol
and this is an interface which is
connected to the switches program in
java effects which means you can put it
anywhere on a device which runs java and
over this interface you can see for
example what's the smart meters showing
yes what's the sample showing so this is
a smart home we're talking about smart
oh yes yes another interesting we have
it just simulated here you can see here
I can decide that it runs only FC
energie is cheaper than 50 cent so which
is true at the moment as we are at 47
cent if I decide to run it only if it's
cheap as insurance and then it's off
no interesting Wow so you make sure to
wait forever it depends on your provider
right that's really cool so if I'm a
Java developer and I go I want to learn
about doing more of this stuff where
would I go how would I get started
actually if you may have seen these the
initial presentation the keynote on
Sunday it has been said that Java SEM
Java ME come closer together and this is
good for developers because in the past
you had a high learning curve if you may
our desktop programmer in order to come
to the embedded devices and as the fvf
sees congregants between the two
branches it will be much more convenient
and easier to learn to write even
embedded applications in the future cool
so this is great so I can take my skills
as a Java developer and start connecting
to washing machines or smart sensors all
over the home or all over the world I
can just imagine what the applications
are going to be in the future yeah thank
you this is great this is Tory wheel
with the Oracle technology Network I
know you can go to OTN and check out
java embedded to learn more
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
