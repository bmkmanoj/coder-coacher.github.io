boards we are using here raspberry pi
model b revision 2 and we have some
chains from revision 1 from to revision
2 in the GPIO so take care when you are
using any any other Raspberry Pi double
check if you have the revision 1 or 2
like this 5 volts pin doesn't exist in
the and the revision 1 and we have
different types of ports here we have
digital pins we have the support phi r
square CU arts and so we have 17 pins 7
is for general proposal you have one pwm
this is kind of new for me to know that
a Raspberry Pi held up up to Dublin I
never use it before because since I I am
always integrate with Arduino i prefer
to to delegate the pwm to arduino
instead of doing in raspberry pi and you
have two pins 4i squared c 5 for spi and
24 you are so take care the level is 3
volts the CMOS standard and not 5 volts
you feed you supply 5 volts to Raspberry
Pi but it's regulated internal 23 votes
so take care when you are integrating
like Arduino with raspberry if you sing
thats i know from Arduino Raspberry you
are going to burn the raspberry the pin
so you need to use some level converter
like Max to treat you to or use some
device that is also 3 volts like a
Arduino mini a small one or Lily page
they are ultra votes you have many h
Magus three votes also have three ways
of connecting complex
sensors some some kind of component like
a relay is a simple is digital you just
push one to the part and the relay will
turn on or the opposite depending on the
relay board so that relay board is very
simple and you push 0 and the relay
turns off but sometimes you have a gyro
or a salido meter is not about 0 and 1
so you need a kind of protocol to
transmit the information from the sensor
to the raspberry and we have three
options i square see spi and you are to
arch is the serial the old old but gold
serial communication i square C is very
old protocol from the 80s and I think
that Phillips created I square C and is
a bus the good stuff about I square sees
that you just use two pins and you can
plug many sensors I square C sensors in
the same two pins and the bus will take
care about it and but it's not so fast
and you have spi spi uses five pins and
you can have the same idea of having a
bus of components but with better speed
most of the time when you are using
ethernet the ethernet module connects to
the hardware through the spi so you have
this graphic is very nice graphic
explaining each kind of port so and what
it does and some some technical stuff
about the ports so you can download the
high quality imaging and i have this
kind of image printed in my off see so i
need all the time and I I didn't I could
memorize all the pins not yet from
raspberry I'd see a single a very simple
connection
here we have a relay board with two
channels so we have two relays we could
we could control two different things
and we have four wives one wide is 5
volts the other white is the ground
have the gpio you want to use with java
but sometimes you need to make a kind of
test before programming java and you
don't want to make a man i'm in class
with by far j-just to turn on or turn
off the release so we install it in the
this special emoji disutility whiting
pie whiting pie you can you can
manipulate the GPIO using a comment line
so this command line pseudo gpio menos g
mode 24 is the number of the port and
output so I set up this part to make
output so i can write to this part i can
change the value of this port and to
turn on the digital 24 sudo gpio minus G
right 24 1 so it's very simple and basic
to doom let me show you now I set up the
25 to output and I have a fan in this
part so the fan is all red working
because the part state is in one by
default in 0 x fo so now let's change
the port 21 so this relay board is the
opposite the one terms of the relay and
zero turns on the relay because it has a
circuit just make this inversion so you
need to avert in the software if you
want the behavior of what so very simple
and very fast to stop and raspberry pi
and chrome tab you can feed your plants
because you can plug a water pump in the
relay and you can schedule to to to feed
water to your plants automatically so is
the first users good users simple shell
script that you can read the value of
support and you can command
just in this case if it's turn it on
we'll turn it off and vice versa so it's
very simple and basic example for you
running inside this image that is wet I
hope I you can comment your gpio using a
web interface is very good too so here i
have the GPIO header and 25 here so here
I can turn on and turn off so the relay
is working here so it's very simple and
very good tillage if you want a fast way
to command using a web interface and
lightweight so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
