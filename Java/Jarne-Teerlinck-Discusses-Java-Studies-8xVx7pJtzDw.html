Network and I'm here today talking to
Europe know who is a young developer so
studying Java yes your honor tell us so
what are you studying currently so I'm
studying java it's informatics in Ghent
Belgium so mostly alpha at school we got
some networking to and and so are you
studying in the lambdas yeah like the
new yafo eight which is quite difficult
since it's my second year now and last
year we saw Java 7 and now it suddenly
became a 48 so there are some changes
and this is what we really need to use
right now in school but I'm managing so
give me an example of what you did like
what kind of exercise or do you did with
Java 8 and the lambdas well we're mostly
making some exercises on generics now
and I wish we write some methods and we
really try to use as much java 8 as
possible so we use the lambdas and
streams but it's all really new for us
so not really to experience with it but
in coming along with it so did you learn
other languages or is that the first
programming now I recently started with
c sharp but that's really basic to right
now it's I my first 38 year and she's
sharp and my second gear for the other
okay and to which one do you like better
yeah yeah cool excellent and so what you
want to do I mean
have an idea what you want to do no I
don't really know yet like the
programming I still find it really hard
sometimes but it's getting better I mean
last year was really difficult but now
the second year is like I made some kind
of click and it I really understand the
language now like the object orientated
programming was something new to me and
I didn't really understand it at first
but now it's going much better so we'll
see what I can do with it after my third
year which is my last year and why did
you pick programming well I wasn't
really sure what I was going to study at
first I had a lot of options then I got
a book from my school in Ghent and I saw
like informatics and I thought this
might be interesting so I looked up a
bit of programming on myself and I
thought this could be really something
for me but I had no background in it I
never tried it and it was really
something i just picked out instead of
something other out there to study but
worked out really well I think right so
I wish you the best of luck and thank
you for sharing your experience yeah no
problem thank you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
