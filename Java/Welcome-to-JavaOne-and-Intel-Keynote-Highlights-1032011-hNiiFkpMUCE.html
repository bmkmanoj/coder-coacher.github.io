really interesting time we've spent
about 18 months since the Sun
acquisition apply Oracle and I think
we're seeing a really strong resurgence
in Java we've had great progress this
year or Java 7 shipping JCP is working
again blessing standards again and I
think that we find ourselves now in a
place where at the the right place at
the right time the energy now with the
cloud build-out reminds me a lot of the
energy of the first web build out and
just the job of was well positioned then
for the for the web build-out I think
we're really well positioned now for the
cloud build-out i want to welcome a
longtime sponsor of java a longtime
collaborator on java and that's the
intel corporation where are we at today
if you take a look at TV devices is over
115 million TV devices currently using
java in the market even more relevant is
the handset space it's exploding and job
is on over 1 billion devices today as
that device Haven explodes Java has a
key place ensuring that deliver all the
relevant runtime environments for a
handset device and the enterprise
ninety-seven percent of enterprise
clients deploy Java I'm going to have
several groups of people come up and
talk about how they work together until
an Oracle to optimize specific aspects
of the software platform we look at
customer workloads like fusion
middleware weblogic server and other
other products as well as benchmarks
like spec jbb and we looked for
bottlenecks and we try to identify ways
that we can take better advantage of the
Intel processors to make Java run faster
hey I have something wonderful to share
with you today as a result of the joint
work with Oracle's i esteem we can
report a 50-fold performance increase in
Oracle Fusion Middleware performance
running on Intel platforms
so I'm going to talk about a new product
that we are announcing today the Oracle
no sequel database and I know this is a
java conference but just think of
database as a little java application
okay so it's a highly scalable highly
distributed highly available data
database and it's a very simple kima you
know key data model so it provides a key
value paradigm rather than a full-blown
sequel paradigm over the 15 years we
working on on Java you've seen the
results we come back here after year
breaking record after record will
continue to drive that performance
working together with Oracle that's our
job we're going to continue to drive
that to give you the best platform to
develop on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
