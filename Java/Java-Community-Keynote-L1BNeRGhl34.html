director of Oracle developer community
and film director Steven Chen
so did we hire this many extras what are
you what are you guys all doing here
like can you guys just leave we're we're
busy here
hey you can't come up onstage what are
you doing let me help you out with this

these folks out but don't tell me Steve
I think I know I think I know exactly
why we're here I think you've got a
meeting yeah I think it's to talk about
what's coming next
in Java we just finished out of a nine
so we're doing another release right
it's only six months away so we've got
to have a oh we don't need a planning
meeting for that we're just gonna ship
whenever the hell's ready in six months
right that's a new plan all right no no
that's not it that's not it all right
all right let me think let me think
ah I was just here a few days ago for
the JCP party I bet we're here for a JCP
meeting is it a Java EE executive
meaning that we're gonna have here to
talk about Java EE
oh no no Oracle's not doing that anymore
are they that is not it that is not it
but I think I know I think I know
exactly Steve what we're here to talk
about there must be a very important
meeting to talk about a very special
thing to Java one of the most important
things the toolbar are we here for the
Yahoo toolbar the astral bar whatever it
is what toolbar we have next that must
be what
nah man we're filming a movie we need
this room cleared so we can get the film
through and do a proper rehearsal
everyone everyone has to leave we can
everyone please listen acting you got to

I like you good man so yeah you're gonna
start out all right so let me just let
me just grab my my film did you say
actually know something and we're gonna
we're gonna kick off the first section
so you're enjoying Java one so far come
on
Java one enjoying it
got it
oh there was a horrible day so I'm
finally finally coding some some Java
right and yeah let's yeah let's do this
so where did I what did I leave on list
last time hello Java
oh yeah Java 9 no no it's finally out
now I can use these here and mine too so
I can use finally my my drama 9 um
futures yeah so we're not getting our
laptop feet hold on a second you see
this this is how you know it's a real
rehearsal you guys asked for it I wanted
to see it you know if you come back
tomorrow then you will see the real
movie
knocking still not gonna do this I just
did that fully yeah this is always what
do you have with conferences right
yeah try it try line three I'm asking
him to swap the line three okay
you know we're gonna
yeah wait a second oh my god we're gonna
go to one
all right you know it's nothing in a
conference that's harder than hooking up
a laptop using HDMI right all right so
all right action action where do it was
so ya know oh yeah my job a 9 Petrus
how's that going so yeah I can use my
this list alright yeah that's gonna be
the list of Java versions right Oh
eight nine what's next a timer is not
running
18.3 what's done oh yeah 18.9 and then I
don't know what's going on but anyway
okay so let's print this alright yeah
looks good
okay now let's compile this and oh the
underscore I can't use that anymore
oh man okay how about this yeah
that's gonna do it that's good good work
around I mean what else would it do
right okay let's try it again
recompile yeah worked okay then so so
what did I taught me at Java University
I compiled n't and run it using Java
Java and then without this name okay
Java nine and run it then I will have to
Java versions and one glitch in matrix
exception
what's what's going on there really I
mean I'm just using so I have I have
this here and the person's like where is
that exception come I mean from what is
happening like hello near collision
matrix exception too bad yeah thanks
it's the job a nine future or what is it
hurry up no the jvm agents are be higher
I'm reading the agents are behind you
and nobody so much happening in the Java
Q I'm reading oh really
pay attention hurry up - John yeah yeah
yeah yeah neo you have to come to the
JCP party I don't follow the whites you
follow the white dude follow the white
yeah I got it follow the whites you guy
got it
what is what is happening oh yeah are
you hey how's it going good doing me oh
I've been talking to you yeah yeah I'm
productive you know don't don't stir me
when I and I don't have time I have to
fix this there's some kind of solution
matrix exception but there's so much
going on in the javac' I mean I know I
know
yeah with me - what are you up to party
JCP party well yes that's where JCP
members come together during java one
experts Java champions Java user group
leaders we all come together to
celebrate discuss the latest things
happening in the community celebrate the
annual Award nominees listen to music
this sounds really good but you know I
have to have to have this program and
here white follow to set an all white
you follow there okay and you know what
yeah I'm gonna turn okay let's go where

anything and I'll join join in a section
who are you
not so fast mr. Anderson I would yeah I
want to go like what are you guys like
all annoying me you would be wise not to

so thanks to our first set of actors
let's bring up the second set of actors
we have forseen - who do we who do we

responding to my emails at all yeah yeah
he's around yeah I don't know when you
see him later let me know but I like
your costume - okay cool I love to be
here and with the Java community thanks
a lot man
okay cool okay did you I'm not on TV
I'm rebel call me no point reception man
did you just rip up one of our new
t-shirt yeah I don't like it I would
start to learn Ned right now all right
you're done thank you Scott wish him
from the Houston Java user group out of
the water
yes pratik Patel Atlanta jug and DEF
Nexus cool thanks man
hello I'm al I'm the jag lead off a
Jacksonville Florida I am a Java
developer at ability and I'm known as
living in the past they are nice I like
the wig
hi I'm Janine Patterson from the Chicago
Doug I'm Mary Quigley from Chicago
junkets welcome Ron Smith definitely not
an agent okay come on I'm you know I am
the Java keeper sorry let's hear it for
at Java
hello I'm Maria I'm from Germany I'm an
artist a sculpture Hey Thank You Maria
very good to see ya
involve also an artist and also from
Germany excellent
yeah great to see you well no we're good
okay use the mic first yeah
all right so Bruno action I mean juggy
action well so we are here waiting for
neo oh where is him oh that's near who
are you I knew
I'm Morpheus sit down man I need to talk
with you okay cool I thought this was a
party yeah well yeah we have a party
here don't you see anyone around you
know your eyes are closed at Neil Neil
you know what you're here no I don't
know what it was already know you've
always had the feeling that something
wasn't quite right there was a bigger
answer beyond just the back your head
wasn't just in the cloud neo no it was
much bigger I can offer you all the
answers but you can never go back yeah
yeah and so that's what I need I need to
fix this exemption yeah yes please
okay so if you decide to join us it's
your choice
the blue Java EE peels takes you back to
where you were and you forget everything
that happened yeah
the rads EE 4j pill
we'll show you just how deep the
rabbit-hole goes
what you want gonna take it yeah
whatever I take the red pill you've got
to eat it there's no rap he'll stay all
they all look the same
yeah that's the only thing we had at the
JCP party you know whatever Wow oh my oh
my god my my a WT is going away it's
starting to look beautiful
that's just Java fats it's just the
beginning expect these improvements to
continue and accelerate your development
we'll go a lot faster now
Wow you you were right about the cloud
it's it's it's a real thing it's look
look at all the tools and libraries I
have right now it's Wow it's
overwhelming how how can ever learn it
to learn it all
wait wait wait one module at a time Neil
I
yeah but I I want to learn more I want
to know I want to know everything well
Neil everything you know is wrong while
the world looks to be cross-platform
there is assume only one true cross
platform polyglot solution and that is a
JVM but the agents are spreading fear
saying the Java's dad's that the e4j is
not Java EE the greatest advocates of
the Alliance will be the Java user
groups
we recently travel across the lands to
prepare them for coming of the on and I
believe that's you Neil we've gathered
some of the Javanese group
representatives here to further explain
your mission okay oh where did you come
from
oh I'm from lazier that's missing here
that's a little pointer yeah in a
pointer okay do you have a discussion
about some solution okay just solve it
and you look for different database
right now you look for no sequel
solution however have a different API
our different ways to do it right now
have yeah that's an alkene and that's
gonna be a huge problem to you right
there why we have no sequence products
so the whole idea is make a standard API
to make everything work together that
won't be great yeah just like a right
yes something like that
so you it's an important thing to keep
to learning a of course don't let us
down you thank you neo
Java 8 was a massive improvement Java 9
was amazing with agents they've upgraded
and on the on the jug tour we learned
that Java 9 has some new benefits the
the modularity and modernization and we
need Java the advantages of Java 9 to
help save the people you need to show
them that it's good and right and and
right for everyone and that the Texas
Ranger Java user group is ready to help
you spread the message
Wow Wow thank you the improvements in
the functional support are essential for
moving forward and providing the
performance improvements we need both
for development and the execution of our
mission this is a critical technology
for moving forward you must get the
message out Neal the Atlanta jug stands
ready to help the agents have done their
best is so misinformation fear you can
overcome that with confidence and
dependability don't let us down Neal you
know none of these methods if you end up
stuck in a knot dead-end career that
makes you feel like a drain battery when
the jug too came to Jacksonville to pull
us out of the matrix and also out of the
storm we learn how important it is to
take control of your own career how no
one else cares about your career as much
as you do
you see the agents this is what they
look like in case you don't know the
agents
and these are the developers the agents
keep the developers away from the real
world they lock us into all technologies
and then they blame us for secret
injection attacks the agent scared the
developers so much that we compromised
our own integrity and we end up writing
software that tricks emission tests so
they can send more automobiles you know
I like living in the past but unless we
teach the Jacke members how to take
control of their own future there will
be no future you have to spread the word
I try to do it myself you know I I try
to use my my new cordless phone try to
call them with it didn't work I try I
try to tweet them I try to use Twitter
I try to even poke them none of this
worked you're the only one who can do it
don't let us down Neal Wow Neal we live
in a world where job is original vision
of running on every device everywhere is
being realized but the agents have been
frustrated even here you wouldn't
believe it but we have smart cameras and
doorbells running on the running
internet servers now the jug tour showed
us into the Chicago Java user group how
to use this technology
yeah the agents have gotten together and
found a way to actually hack the devices
found out the limitations and create a
denial of attack so you better new you
if they knew how to run java properly
then things could be stopping their way
so you have to get the word out to all
the members and the Chicago Chuck is
here standby to defend it so you have to
get the word out so time is short we are
all depending on you hey yeah who are
you the world has seen some amazing
changes that I'm sure you're going to
love javascript has expanded in such an
amazing way
it's practically taken over the desktop
and with so many ways to write
JavaScript it's bound to take over the
back end as well
that is you're talking about JavaScript
sorry dad
is there a difference between JavaScript
like yes
Sony oh we have a lot of rebels and Java
rebels and we have about 12 millions I
think if I'm correct so so if you really
want to communicate with them use Java
make sure in all the communications that
you have Java who are you are you also
part of this party Neal would you Neal
would you like a cookie
yeah I just had a pill that was already
amazing yeah yes yes please
I knew you liked one yeah what only one
yes Bill's cookies mom I like to thank
I'm here as you see here or the
matchless individuals yeah now I can see
them WT them was impossible and at the
same time they are all expressions of
the community you see it here so amazing
what I have to say to you a developer is
responsible for code so you have to
trust yourself
yes yourself Neal so Neal now you know
how important your mission is and the
dangers that await you we have two
options for you we can you can take an
RV
yeah it's very very good we use it for
the judge store
it's loaded with weaponry and coffee
couches the mileage isn't great but it's
very handy when you can't find a
restroom or an RV that doesn't sound
that cool well or you can have a
motorcycle you know like the JDK it can
go everywhere you can't carry as many
weapons but you get the advantage of
agility well personally I like the couch
and the TV in the back end of the RV did
I tell you that also has internet
wireless yeah but anyway yeah that's
that's an easy one so I either take the
H on motorbike yeah all right okay all
right so Neil trust yourself yeah okay
save us okay can I take these with me
too yeah really good Leanne thank you
yeah the e4j pills yo J pills okay
thank you thank you you guys
almost fell off all right so we have so
how do we do this with the motorbike
Steve yeah well we were gonna we were
gonna do a high budget production with a
bunch of cameras and a follow crew but
sorry we ran out of miles you're gonna
have to do this in front of a green
screen and improvise okay yeah whatever
so then I'm gonna Mike the HR motor I
was gonna I was gonna get you like a
nice touring bike maybe like a Honda or
Ducati potty or something nice
Multistrada I am but yeah we had to use
the Suzuki out of my garage that's all
the budget we had you know as long as
it's a Joel and can't go anywhere like
the JDK yep all right all right
Wow Oh oh my god that's amazing I like
this HIO motorbike wow you can go really
fast sorry
where'd we get the death from where is
this
can go any variant lever you jumble
around when we shot these where did we
that was in Japan I would say Japan yeah
that's pretty cool so we shut to go in
another tour next year in Japan all
right let's go this sounds good yeah
okay welcome to the matrix Wow
thank you
who do we have for our next segment come
on up
you know guys it's Akashi welcome very
good to see you thank you
so Akashi is responsible for our
craziness on the tour so thank you
welcome yeah okay I know are you doing
I'm very good excited yes thank you
yeah thanks for coming to Jay Olson
actually not next year
Nixie you came to Johnson yeah yes and
also the sweets expert yeah yeah alright
thank you thank you
can we step okay so we're ready yes he's
coming it's coming
well this matrix thing hey good to see
you again I do to see you again
nice nice costume yeah well yeah what to
do
yeah you know I came to Japan and now
I'm you know I I have to learn about
about all this this matrix and you know
and these JVM agents and I have to say
VM agent yeah and okay
I think the first you need to know the
spirits of jigsaw do you know do you
know it's it's about you know I wanted
no no I want to fight this saving em
agents right yeah I want you know about
what I got here like I want to prom with
me this this matrix is what are you
believing so you know I need to learn
more and know I can fight this yeah this
is what I'm doing here and no no no what
Neal yeah I need to fight this and you
know the glittering matrix I know what
you want to do yes
fight first okay you learn the spirit
objects Oh Jake so you know put off that
weapons okay so this is Japan yeah
peaceful come country is very peaceful
not bad strong strong yes because we
know the spirit of jigsaw
okay it means no you learned the
Japanese martial arts like karate karate
yeah you understand the spirits spirits
so you know you want to know that yes
okay yes please
yes the lunatics are NTT Japanese okay
Japanese martial arts they're also you
put off your black coat like we don't
need that okay
sure a little black coat okay so let's
test this training of character training
okay yes and this time I have strongest
your teacher you have to yes yes I need
a crow her name is Ayana nice to meet
you she's the best teacher in Japan Wow
yeah so you can teach me karate how to
fight JVM agents make him cry
that's a bad idea so I started training
okay I will tell you japanese cutta
cutta okay this is the way we act when
fighting and Kappa is yeah returing
literally start standing standing four
types okay cut that it's types your like
pipes right so I will tell you Takata
okay yeah type safety you should said
yes most area sorry
yeah yes master sure and you are not
allowed to say stop or give up okay
right yeah okay yes master yes okay I
ready let's start okay the first we have
to agree yeah the greeting like this
great thing okay and set like this and
punch three times okay that's it No
you have to do like this yes master
Jesus Christ getting better getting
better I hope so okay so let's just try
the less sense okay okay hey that I
think yeah so how was it yeah I think so
he has just begun the karate master now
really yeah that was easy anybody can do
that I didn't see the nails kick is not
so high but it'll say so the we need to
check your skill of karate
okay so we have checking machine oh she
asked for the newer move a government so
let's try it
checking machine check okay please show
please show up Richard
let's go to the checking machine sure we
have machine for the checking it should
I get inside there be rats time check
machine very time ring first okay okay
okay their first I Anna you showed a
good example
yes okay so it that's that okay
good day to sample show yes good and
could you calm down I'll give you a
countdown yep are you ready yes I am
okay we will start the machine 5 4 3 2 1
and take good
now while this machine is processing
your photos let me tell you what it's
doing for you what's going to happen is
we have these 60 raspberry PI's that are
all simultaneously taking a picture of
our karate subject in the center and
then it's stitching it together into a
video that we are going to display that
will allow you to see your technique
from all angles all right it's ready yep
nice technique okay okay good the
example so let's trip next okay all
right I think I came here to thank you
think you've got this a body position
okay okay hold on now I have to actually
type into the machine properly that's
difficult
okay here we go are you prepared yes yes
master all right five four three two one
and it took now we will give it a moment
as it prepares your video for you what
did you think of his technique yeah
great very great very good all right
we'll see what the machine thinks as it
does not lie it is presently processing
your images in the cloud there it is so
near you need a final approval for our
master final approval I come here was
awesome
we have must we have a master among the
Masters of karate masters of Korea his
name is yuuichi Sakuraba he is first
okay so before you guys continue I want
to explain some of the demo with rich ok
so you guys remember rich bear yeah
so we we put a lot of tireless nights
into creating a little demo yeah into
the 20 seconds there yeah a 20-second
demo and I wanted to let rich explain a
little bit more about like what went
into making of this demo sure so the the
I mean this being a matrix themed thing
and all what we were trying to do is to
recreate can that bullet time view you
have in the matrix where neo is dodging
the bullets as that agents are shooting
right and if you remember the the camera
moves like impossibly fast around very
slow moving neo and the way that they
actually achieved this was by having a
rig similar to this where they have
multiple cameras they were set up in
sort of a helix formation and then they
had a green screen there and they would
shoot neo doing whatever he's doing and
then they would sort of digitally go
back and scrub out all the little pin
holes that they had for their cameras so
we wanted to kind of recreate that so
what we did was we we got sixty
raspberry PI's and they're using this
standard Raspberry Pi cameras and they
were mounted to a lighting track this is
actually a commercial lighting track
that you can purchase and and then each
one of the PI's also had mounted on it a
transformer to take the power down to
five watts which is what you need for
your PI and each one of the the PI's is
mounted on a special mount the Jasper
pots and unfortunately couldn't be here
today he he would have been on the stage
with us today but he couldn't make it so
here I am trying to figure out what I'm
gonna do so anyway he 3d printed a
substrate that he was able to mount
those two so it was a tremendous amount
of work
his wife Fiona put in a bunch of hours
and order to wire it all together and
put it together and then that was the
physical hardware then on the software
side what we had to do was to calibrate
the location of each one of these
cameras because the cameras are all you
know physically they need to point at
the exact same position in order to get
that smooth effect that you get as the
the film gets stitched together so then
we had a multicast signal to get sent
out to the PI's in order to take their
picture they send the picture back up to
the server the server then stitches it
all together into a single movie and you
get that effect
alright so big round of applause for
Richard Jasper and the rest
okay go back to the movie
and again we had master of among the
Masters of karate masters okay yes his
name is yuuichi Sakuraba his first job a
champion of Asian countries okay you
need from him to a final approval
approval okay yeah please show up okay
oh she's coming in Australia I am huge
Tsukuba Masterman master of karate and
first day of Tampa Bay Asian countries
Neil yes you must a finer level you
think so I think so
I don't have any more to you so now I
think let's go to own thing together
let's go to an onsen oh yes yes that's a
great idea and talk about the future of
Java future of job yeah and I have some
good sweet and hoppy some sweets
oh and coffee oh yeah yeah that's great
I like don't wait to you yes and this
that sounds really good yeah let's do
this
Takashi can we go too you know okay I'm
go with you okay anyway you like sweet
yes yes you like a sweet no no hope
Wow okay so you have been to Japan last
year yes with us and you have good
experience of genuine Sam yes DJ did you
hear about the Johnson yeah
should I tell you yeah what we did we
have been to Japan like this year it was
the second time what you just saw and we
did a Java unconference at an onsen an
onsen is a japanese hot spring and we
spent two days on the beautiful it soup
in insula talking about java
philosophizing about the future of java
and about programming in general and yes
we had a really great time there as you
can see we also enjoyed the japanese
cuisine and enjoyed the the atmosphere
there so well there was some activity
going on besides Java as well so I think
all of us enjoyed it and anyway we will
continue to do that next year again so
if you would like to go to Japan and if
you would like to join us there I can
encourage you to well sign up for Giants
and unconference yes yes yeah let's go
to Johnson please come to Japan next
year everyone
it's master would you come to Japan you
have to say and our Java is a group
virtual job user group members need to
file up here let's go
oh familiar face hello Steve hello Steve
hey good to see you are you gonna do the
V tag again this year we are doing the
Vidocq this year we're not doing it two
days after Jabbar won this time because
that almost killed me last year so we're
doing it again in three weeks so this is
a 24 hour 24 contiguous Java sessions
going around the world
we have about 18 Java user groups
joining us a lot as well I'm looking
forward to listen thank you not too bad
thanks so in the London drug will be
hosting the session on the housing
reversion strings keep going yeah so if
you need to learn how to pass the new
Java version strings no matter what it's
going to look like come to our session
alright thank you welcome thank you I'm
doing well what do you think of the IBM
keynote best whatever yes thank you
you guys did a great job thank you hey
the B jug some happy to be here and
thank you so much D for running the show
yeah welcome hello hello I'm only from
zero turndowns virtual chuck leader with
simon nice to see all this year how's it
going excellent yeah great yeah and
you've been busy I think yeah great to
be here thanks for looking forward to
the demo Cheers internal keeper from
zero turnaround from Estonia hello buddy
oh we got somebody else who's in full
your fully in your actor mode the name
is Smith agent Shawn Smith all right and
action
line four
so so yeah neo what they actually called
it in the end was a e4j can you believe
her he 4j namings hard I want to
introduce you to the LJ see I told you
now LJ namings not that the London jug
London Java community Joe Martin please
and this is Steve from the London jug
welcome to London's new we have bricks
added which means the agents myths are
stuck at the border the Queen's that's
good we have some time the Queen has
actually gone down here herself and
given them the middle finger all right
so what are you doing there well now
that we have some time we are going to
show you the source code of the matrix
Wow yeah you cannot be told what the
matrix is neo you have to read the code
Wow only the Gosling and The Clique have
previously understood this code but
we're pretty sure you can hack it mmm
actually interestingly the matrix there
that the code base has actually recently
been open sourced by the evil agents to
the Eclipse Foundation okay I just I'll
just be clear I'm talking about the
matrix code base oh yeah well if this
gather round is left up in here look at
some of the source code let's have a
look okay so I'm seeing some
just-in-time compilation code and the
hotspot on my on my that's hard that's
hard scroll scroll to look further down
there's got to be something here we can
understand it's got to be this great
verse it's like reading poem
this is not looking good so it's got to
be something we can read here what's
this what's this oh I know that they've
tried to obfuscate the code by using
Scala that's intelligent I'm gonna give
me that you know I bet I bet they've
gone I bet they've gone full and they've
actually used SBT to build it as well
they're very simple build tool yeah I
think the only way to see what happening
is it's to hack in to hack into the
matrix that's running to see what's
going around
I used the Nebuchadnezzar to look into
and hook hook into the matrix to see
what's going on there all right go do
some hacking neo yeah yeah Steve is
there at bracket on a new line there's a
lot of glare coming off Neos screen
what's a vow to find a little man neo
you got a hurry we just can't read this
crap yeah
is it working here
oh the matrix use this EJB - oh my god
oh look yeah I can see it's easy jp-21
Guba Guba over five remote and local
interfaces ok wait hang on something's
wrong - no the matrix knows what we're
doing
I'm putting the Nebuchadnezzar at risk
by by hacking too near the matrix that's
it's not what we're doing
Oh No the matrix is so complex it
requires Peaks Ottawa oh geez oh here we
go
aha jigsaw right jigsaw is gonna be with
us any moment any moments
the matrix is this reacting it's taking
down processes it's love forgive us
confirmed
I can see the matrix is shutting down
proces our hacking process isn't as soon
as as soon as we're starting them up
it's going to microservice merge on my
gas so it's Kerala processes what are we
going to do that process is running
we're gonna have to spawn a whole bunch
more but we can't do it here in London
alone Simon what are we going to do
right now if we had something that could
faster it's like don't don't try to
reinvent the spoon that's that's
impossible
instead try to understand and use the
truth the truth yeah the truth it's
called Chi Benitez this summer I say
kubernetes it's just this just turned
into some bad sitcom what just happened
back so so so right what is kubernetes
well communities lets you run your
applications in a costume off the
machines and if your prices guys well
actually we started for you so it sounds
like a bash bash script or a glorified
bastard yeah it has a page and you know
ACP and dr. wrong it's automatic yeah
it's like a cron job as well yeah it's a
bad script on a cron job yeah like you
start your java and do we start your
application every week so that you don't
run off heat okay well that's great
timing
so come we use P phonetic to make to
make a packing more resilient yeah sure
awesome so what do we need so I think we
can actually round adding different
environments and different cloud that we
casually bring up a punch off your
program saying let's get see if you can
give some information okay you used to
Benitez fairly we had enough jug we
could use some kind of virtual one that
wasn't restricted by distance or
location a virtual junk what would we do
Oh what about the virtual jug
oh that they're children why didn't I
think about virtual job
assemblÃ© if you too lazy to join your
local church the beautiful church is the
best option how can we hope well that's
absolutely awesome so we need some more
resources we're hacking the matrix here
in London but it's just not enough that
matrix is killing our processors every
time I was pouring them up so we need to
wonder and we need to uncover the
secrets of the matrix we can't do it
just here in London can we do that
reasonably fast enough so we can hit the
next scene on time I know what we should
do we should call the network of matrix
shifts flying around in the real world
we can call them unfortunately just by
reference but we cannot do it from the
matrix we are trapped in the simulated
world we have to disconnect give me the
phone awesome ok so we have we have a
Google cloud we have an IBM cloud we
have an Oracle cloud cloud we're gonna
do this as a hybrid cloud run by
kubernetes oh my god we must be in the
matrix so is it working well let's see
oh no the whole world no that's not
that's definitely another problem that
you doing around right so let me see
here we have okay well let's go ahead
and start our application we're going to
start in the Federation so I'm going to
you used context so first it's and
Giovana Federation yeah so first before
we do that yet sir let's see if we can
let's if we can contact the Hangout to
see if were to safer actually no she
would eat let's do this first let's do
this first year I got my timing wrong
yeah all right good I know that we
agreed it's good what is the poem code
the Federation no let's not do that
let's do this first
all right let's try this again I can see
that's wrong the program we seen that
was so we actually just deployed I think
30 or 60 instances of your program into
the cloud the in kubernetes and they're
all wrong exactly the same way what are
the red bits the the red boots are I
guess it's the matrix trying to attack
us in current trying to cure your
program right now but we automatically
restarted for you all right yeah it's
like the Google one's slightly more
resilient the other two but I don't
think we happy now if I said let's go up
a little bit yes so yeah let me see here
forty thousand right because do that way
I don't think I got enough foot capacity
you haven't seen so wait what oh sorry
but I need to go back to the Federation
the matrix I see if we can get to 400 so
which is saying we need 400 since it's
coming out yeah into the different
environments ten nine eight matrix my
tank can you see that working look it's
working it's absolutely working we've
got the author of the source code now
it's some person called the architect
I hate architects
yeah okay let's let's see a video that
no one's ever seen before
let's see if the B jug team is ready to
roll and see if we can get more
information calling the B jug so okay
what's the current status all right Wow
all members if only the auto key would
keep up okay
everyone right any information you're
100% sure about that cool
we're tortured the first travel usually
looked at not available you just totally
said that what are you doing he said the
same thing just then do you think I'm
pretty sure he said the same thing I do
it said the same thing the same thing
Sentinels something oh oh boy they're
onto us do you need to go to a neo you
need to go fine did you say the
architect the architect you have to go
and speak to an architect I'm sorry I
need to go find them the 8th architect
ah
where would you find out the matrix
factory that's where everything banks
trim right guys the agents are gonna be
here any minute okay any minute hello
I'm Agent Smith oh damn it I hate it
when I'm right
shut down all connections all
connections hey I hear you had trouble
at border control yeah immigration held
me up I was trying to explain binary
trees for 30 minutes yeah yeah what
connections were you speaking at 11
connections no connections no
connections oh no we were we were just
hacking around on reddit actually
someone on the internet was wrong and we
were just you know we spent the last
three days making sure that I mean they
knew they were wrong we're gonna get him
we're just gonna go and we're just gonna
probably just go get some sunlight shirt
thank you cheers Cheers oh I'm just so
misunderstood I just want to be helpful
all right it's a big round of applause
for a virtual judge members all right
welcome Michael hi Steve thanks for
coming all the way it's a Germany all
the way from Germany yeah yeah oh it's
the matrix in Germany no yeah it's not
all right welcome and we need our our
matrix agents on as well and Sebastian
that would be nice
certainly yeah come on all right welcome
back
you're still in character indeed very
good all right ready
and pop backstage good yeah all right
action just a matrix factory well this
is real oh hi nice to meet you Neal hi I
am the creator of the matrix oh you're
not here text okay yeah you shot great
scrolls travel in the matrix and
untangling its many mysteries I'm proud
of you
however there is something I don't
really understand I mean how do Java
developers actually turn into agents
like Mitch it's like oh wait where do
you come from
oh these a time I know them I have to
wear my weapons oh yeah chicks are
chicks and Japanese wait we've come to
get you okay I step back step back step
back
I know that was easy
well I guess Yugi was right I'm really
on Kurata master that's that's easy
so as agents you mean yeah I mean these
agents are not quite sure yet why that
actually happens but as I said I mean
Java developers turn into these evil
agents and we have to find out why oh he
just woke up Java developer what I might
be a job developer what what's going on
like what oh why are you fighting these
generals I don't know why are we
there's no point we're gonna make to
expect eree and so we are oh so yeah
what's so what's going on why why why
are you turning into two evil evil
agents I don't understand sir so you say
you huh so it's all very strange
that's okay can you explain this market
like you you created the matrix you say
created the matrix yes but for
predictions I need the Oracle the Oracle
another one okay so okay who who who's
the who's the Oracle what can we can we
find it oh yeah where can we find the
Oracle whoa are you ready for marry well
yeah oh oh hi I know you you poor you
gave me the cookies so you need you the
Oracle Wow it was predicted a long time
ago how artificial intelligence run
against humanity okay yeah okay anyway
let's look at how Java developers are
created in the matrix Factory yes maybe
we can find an explanation okay yeah
let's let's see how our developers are
created can it can you show us architect
I think I think I found something
do you think this switch will do
anything so here you see how we actually
turn faces into engraving paths for CNC
cutters okay and then in a Raspberry Pi
application based on Java X and the
gluon stack you can cut out these faces
on a CNC machine Wow and this is how
Java developers are are created this is
exactly how they are created
Wow I didn't know that okay so wow
that's that's that's okay what happens
then when when these developers are
created where where are they where are
they after afterwards yeah let's have a
look here okay
okay oh no oh you know real agents okay
we're not real agents we're students for
42 4004 42 I like that number
oh you as well what about you are you
also one of these 40 42 Angela CMOS and
you that's all
so we all Java developers yes we are all
Java developers I don't know why this is
happening okay can we can we look in and
how does this how does is create it and
assemble these the created Java
developers yeah sure why it is so dark
yeah the darkness is so depressing
yeah that's that's true please oh it's
this how
now you can be in the when I plant of
this sculpture I have the impression of
flying faces like flock of birds and the
faces of the attendees are photographed
and cut out and I put it together here
in the sculpture for like a cloud we fly
all together in the light and I want to
thank you very much the attendees who
participate with us or together thank
you so much
so this is what would happen it wasn't
illuminated and with all the darkness
and that's that's what did it but to
that switch right yes I found the switch
Wow Wow and now it's oh yeah that is
what it's for
I mean you didn't document that yeah
actually I forgot to hide the
documentation when we wrote the code and
to you Scala so so we are all we are all
developers yes indeed we are we've come
here to develop we starting and see and
gradually going up into the Java into
Java so we are all Java developers
