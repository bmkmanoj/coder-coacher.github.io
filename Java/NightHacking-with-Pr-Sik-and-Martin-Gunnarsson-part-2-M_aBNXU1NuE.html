all right and we are back for night
hacking with pard Martin and we're going
to conclude and show some of the UM the
other stuff you know stuff yeah part 2
part 2 oh and I probably should have
explained how the stream works for for
new viewers hmm I should have done this
the being in the first clip but we'll
all right we'll try again so the way
this works is as I'm traveling around
well Northern Europe currently you can
join the live stream by going to night
hacking calm and watch you know but
medians various interesting people who I
interview and talk with you can interact
on the live chat so we have the chat
window up and can see comments and
things coming from the online audience
as well as you can participate in person
by signing up for one of the events
which are published in the night hacking
site and all of the events are recorded
and posted on the java youtube channel
so if you want to relive you know eating
Itza you can watch yourself and these
guys on the recorded stream and this is
your a second tour you did the big one
and yeah i was i was actually riding a
motorcycle around europe between UK and
belgium well i went all the way around
knock down the shot to it 11 and that
was that was a lot of fun I got to see
more of Europe on that one tour than I
had from three years of planes and
airports hotels we might touch on that
subject later we'll see all right so we
had we've had some pizza and you're
going to talk a bit about some serious
total days sure so if you're if you're
like me you're older than Justin Bieber
you're a geek then you've been playing
around with that mega computer just like
I did and I've been so fascinated
fascinated by the demos
from the nineteen 1988-89 I think some
of the most amazing demos were released
at that time and I think it's funny
because I don't think people these days
know what a demo is it's like oh it's
like you're free version of something
more it's like the first chapter on
something so i can show you what a demo
or we're demo is and this is youtube
nice you know what YouTube is right yeah
it's what the kids use these days to
watch kill yes I guess what we use yeah
so this is a typical demo it's an Omega
demo it's basically coding showing off
your coding skills by creating effects
end of the torch work so yes so we have
some scrolling and we have the boss
they play along the south
I will show you how to do another part
of the demo this
it is it is so cool so it was like the
most advanced
not to like
alright
so I've been so I've been spending my
nights hacking on the mega demos but
using javafx and i'm just going to show
you what the result and so this is what
I've been night hacking nice so this
this is what you want to achieve but yes
yeah so um this is not very exciting but
scrolling cool and i'm not i'm not going
to show you the code because it's just
you know a lot of images that is
scrolling forget about it so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to I'm going to
apply a sinus curb on the text so it
would go up and down and that is if you
think about it it's not that easy
because you have what image does say say
a tee and you have a and you want them
to not go like this so you want them to
rotate them and you want to bend a bit
like yeah it's been a bit so you have to
manipulate every pixel in the image to
make it go follow a sign screw all right
so um so i can show you what it looks
like and then what I will just quickly
show you the code and this is Java fix
and as you can see it's not ready not as
easy as you might think so we're
actually with changing the images for
every frame so this is a really long
attachment or is the text is a text you
know this is just a text node in javafx
so I have a text node and I do some
magic to the text node to apply a sinus
curve and I have some slides I think you
should start start the presentation
maybe
okay so see this is a displacement map
and this is the key to the sinus curve
and I'm sure that you all know what it
does so you just take it off set then
you scale it then your map it and you're
sure treasure ship and you're done or
you can just think of it like this you
have the source and for every pixel in
the source image you apply some kind of
transform and you will move the pixel
somewhere so this is an image with 9
pixels and you all right yes okay so for
every pixel on the screen you will apply
some kind of transform in this case we
we apply a sinus curve like this this
might be one of the images that we want
to scroll and we apply a sinus curve and
we will just bend it like that it sounds
tricky so if we go back and you take the
source I can show you you take the
source image and you manipulated you
change it and you get the destination
image and there is built-in support for
that in javafx so you can well it's
called a displacement map that's why I
had the title displacement map it really
oh get it well it's starting to fall
into place but with a displacement map
you can sort of have you can have like a
lens or something that moves things
around sure okay and when people are
laughing you know you explained it in a
good way it's a bit it's a bit
complicated but well I will show you so
I create a float map and it's just a
matter containing float values and every
float value describes the transformation
from one pixel position to another so we
have a float map and then you can see
that I have 24 statement and the for
statement is well I'm just iterating
every pixel on the on on the screen so I
have the I value with it which is every
pixel lung x axis and then you have a J
which is everyone in every pixel in the
Y value and then I just calculate some
signs value based on where you are and
then I add that value to the float nap
and I'm really hoping that no one
understands because you can you will
look at the code but I think again you
get the point so i will set the sample
at position i J I will move it 0 pixels
in the y direction and i will move it
why pixels v pixels in in the
y-direction right so you move every
column of pixels according to the sign
yeah which is what what we saw basically
but you could do anything you wanted to
hear so they said sure and then I just
create the displacement map and I add
the flow data to the displacement map
and and I set it as an effect to the
entire scene and that's how we get this
sign is scrolling well that's just the
beginning you can do so much more with
it and i'm going to show you soon what
you can do with it so that's the sinus
and they will need some roses were see
also the word or the color bars so I
it's very simple I have a ball class
that extends region and region is
basically just a
it's nothing it's just a region on the
screen it's kind of a good name it's a
good name so we have the region and as
you can see I don't do anything i just
set the cook you preferred width and
height but in the waves the waves is
where generate the boss and as you can
see i create the bar and then I just
style them and this is Java fix so you
can set the background color this is CSS
by the way so you can set the background
color and I use a linear gradient from
some color to another color and then I
just repeat it and then i create a
timeline which is the animation part of
the other ball so for every bar i
created a timeline and the timeline we
move the ball up and down up and down up
and down forever I wish perhaps we
should mention that this is CSS
cascading style sheets but this doesn't
have anything to do with the web view
you can style javafx apps using CSS as
well which is really powerful so you can
have like different style sheets for
different customers of yours for example
they can have your app in their
corporate colors that's how you're
supposed to do it all you have to do is
take the CSS back and add dash F X dash
yeah most of it is most of its standard
sees us and just quickly going to show
you what what it could look like that's
the boss a couple of lines of code some
CSS and the timeline for animation
that's nice it is and then I think we
have what you just add them to get milam
getting any younger not at all but
that's cool I mean it's I know you've
only just started playing around with
this but I think it's a cool way to show
off like what you had indeed educate the
young people of today what what we used
to do when we were young
this is so do you think he deserves his
sticker can we get my back a sticker
yeah okay I'll be my attacking to you
have been yell and I have another one
that's I think it's me I think you can
see this effect in some applications
today I hope so so this is a banger fire
I can assure the image this is the
original image and then I apply the
displacement map with a very strange
sinus grip and the application looks
like this and I have the slightest i
will move the displacement map or with
the screen affecting just a piece of the
screen so you do you have a displacement
map for the entire image or are you
moving a displacement map somehow I have
a displacement map for the entire image
about with values 00 for most of the
XO's until they don't move so you can
see the performance of the displacement
map yeah it's at least on here is it's
very smooth I think there was a there
was a screen saver it like this in
Windows 95 I think yeah you're good ol
days see her getting here slowly making
your way into the new millennium right
well I think it's cool it's impressive
and so 11 last demo are been playing
around with some sound as well and I
don't know if you remember the old
classic outrun we could ever get I you
could forget but the rest of us will
probably win I would remember so I've
I'm going to pay out run the mp3 and I
assure the code real quick this is the
code where this is it so i can add a
spectrum listener to the actual music so
i will get informational every time
something changes and i'm going to map
one of the java fix bar charts to the
music just play it
no it's a lot smoother on here yeah
so that's what you can be nice cool i
guess it's I mean this is also a cool
way about a cool thing about the the
charts in javafx that you can really
customize them any way you want each
individual into individual piece of the
charts it's a javafx node so you can add
effects and transforms and move them
around and so should we have a demo
contest at javaone this year which i
think some definite yes I can be the
judge all right and the bar chart you
just saw is I've styled it just a little
bit to make the bar shots a little bit
more compact the bars here the bars
otherwise its standard component and its
really good-looking and that goes for
the pie chart and everything else it's
really good looking in Java face yeah
the charts are really impressive and you
can animate them and do whatever you
want so I think that's a also nice okay
so enough about you thank you let's
continue to our final thing that we're
going to talk about the final this is
we're gonna do maybe sure so Bob I'm
going to tell the story the way it is so
a couple of weeks ago maybe two months
ago I got a text message from modern
where he said dude do you want to bike
with me from Sweden to miss this is not
outside s-curve its knees at the
Mediterranean Sea and I said sure let's
do that but what I didn't know was that
you were serious about here so I just
committed myself to doing something
really stupid so we're gonna wake it up
this isn't the first time I mean for you
know I'm not that you do and it's
something stupid but let you go on a
long long bike ride so a long distance
biking is one of my hobbies I would say
and so in September we are going to bike
from Sweden from Lind Tunis and then
we're going to swim across the military
no no
swimming this to some place close to
knees your those are going to run home
to know okay we're gonna back to this
that's it yeah let's leave it there and
that's not promised more than we can
deliver but of course we started
thinking how can we do something geeky
about this how can we how can we program
something for this trip right using Java
effects yeah that's that's what you
that's the first thing that you pop into
your mind like oh how can we program
something for this trip so this is where
we kind of we're on the same page here
we don't use some engines and stuff like
that we use pedal power but broken
engines hey so we've been we've just
started with this as well but we've
created an app where when it's done
people at home will be able to follow us
as we biked through Europe in real time
yeah you're real time and this is the
application oh there it is okay
so this is just an example of what it
can look like so we have a web view yep
this is a job FX application with a web
view showing google maps again and you
can as you as you see it works just the
way expected to and we load a GPX file
into the map which is an xml-based
format for sharing location information
like a track or a route and stuff like
that so we have a GPX track you can
usually export these from your GPS
devices like get a GPX file with a kind
of a recording of where you where you've
been where you've been right so we'll be
having a mobile app with us that
transmits our location to server and in
real time and this application will be
updating itself showing where we are it
will also show the weather for we're all
right now yeah eight degrees and rain is
well that's probably what we are
expecting n and we can also add pictures
we can take pictures or add small posts
along the way so you can click that for
example on the ferry doesn't work on the
tooltip ister nice there it is instead
of seizure yeah it is and so here's a
photo that we've added that's actually
embedded not a picture itself but the
reference to the picture is part of the
GPX file and that's actually part of the
standard as well we use a lot of the
more creative features of the GPX format
to add these events and links to the
pictures so this I mean this GPX file is
actually loaded into google maps as it
is it's not we don't do anything extra
really we add markers as specified by
the GPX file with the icons specified by
the GPX file so it's all standard and
you can load it up in google maps and it
just works which is cool and then we
hook into that using java facts and take
over the events and show the pictures in
this application and the right part is
actually also webview and so we have two
different web views here when some CSS
drop shadow on the picture and so on so
it's kind of cool yeah and we'll have
some statistics like for house forever
we traveled how many flat tires have we
gotten how many accidents have we've
we've been well have we caused and so on
so it's kind of a cool reason to code
something basically and it's it's about
seventeen hundred kilometers I think
which is if we do if we if we go the
shortest pot which we will not do so we
expect like 2,000 kilometres I guess and
there's a this is more mountain in our
way as well so yeah the Alps I think
it's cool yeah yeah yeah but I mean
someone for daddy I don't know I'm not
be some kind of tongue it's and if
there's if there isn't a tunnel i mean
it's it's as much down here that's up
its you get you get it back in the end
how hard can it be yeah so it's like an
investment you always hard on the way up
but then you can just relax for two days
and and then we're never there it's just
a couple of centimeters yeah so this is
what we will be doing before java one
this year and we're not sure if we'll
get accepted to Joe one or if we will
survive this trip but if we do we might
tell the story at javaone maybe we'll
see and yeah and you have to be there
because you're the judge for the devil
contest right we're in that's on record
okay yeah so and basically that's a bit
about what we've been doing and what we
are doing right now some work in
progress and some old work cool
so I think we have warmed up the crowd a
bit if you want to do your do your thing
yeah I think you guys have done a good
job on that thank you um okay so I'm
just gonna start and stop the recording
so we splice the video but while I'm
doing that why don't you guys find a way
to give out a t-shirt yeah sure here's a
mic you can borrow alright here's a mic
all right um do we have some nice
questions or comments or feedback yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
