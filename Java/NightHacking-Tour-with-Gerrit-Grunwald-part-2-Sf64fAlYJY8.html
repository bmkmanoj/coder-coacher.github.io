so once we use this little break up to
restart everything and now it works as
expected so now if you can maybe have a
look at this thing so if I this is the
center and I if I hold it every 10
seconds it will measure so that will be
all right just a second now it will
measure their time to see now it's going
up maybe he's here we see the same value
know and also here we get on the iPad we
get the temperature value so you can
wait for the nose the next measurement
the earlier knows working yeah so now
it's it's working and the nice thing
about XMPP is that you can create a
message and on the message you can just
add a property value pairs it's really
just like add name value and that's it
and so I just sent the temperature in
celsius in fahrenheit so if we grab it
why don't you grab it so people can see
the display up to yeah yes then go a
little next okay no there goes it's
going up with the light to the side a
little bit Andre so it's not flashing
the camera yeah that's that's better
fish yeah there goes up up up yeah and
you can also switch for example to
Fahrenheit on the device so it for the
next measurement knots and there are we
glad we're cool so you can switch it on
the desktop it still says yes of course
I also was thinking about switching the
desktop version tool but it doesn't make
sense so you know you can decide let's
what plants are you recall what do you
think waiting Steve are you gonna use
this tomorrow the temperature in your
house no oh God okay it's not very
reliable
thinking oh my god a while I show up
Steve he's quite camera by the biggest
problem is you see all that Metro stuff
is made for touch right but
unfortunately touch doesn't really work
reliable at the moment with this
touchscreen so and this is I think
because of the the image i use the
angstrom image that is on the on the
bigger board now because i have to
unplug the USB for the touch input from
the LCD plug it in again and then i have
to calibrate the the LCD and that works
and then sometimes sometimes i get touch
events in javafx and there's one other
thing it works only reliable if you
started from the consoles or not from
genome because then you have the effect
that the touch event will go to fix
application down to the genome you I
manager they won't reach the JavaFX
application so if you start it from from
the console directly no problem at all
and also the screensaver from genome
won't step in after I don't know five
minutes and there's no way to I did not
figure out how to shut it up so that
it's not kicking in because then the
screen is black and you can't you can
touch it you can move the mouse it it
won't do anything you just have to
really control C to stop the Java code
this is unfortunate so at the moment
this is just a proof of concept but it
doesn't work and actual programming time
was that was not much stuff to do but
setting up the thing this is this is the
hard part and and you have to take care
about a lot of things related to the to
the Linux not to the notes of the javafx
application itself this is quite easy to
do and now I'm thinking of creating I
have a second bigger board and I was
thinking about let them interact so one
is measuring the other is controlling
something dependent on the values so
this will be something for a conference
demo maybe
yeah I don't know very nice all right so
I'm showing your desktop again with uh
yeah as you can see now it's like
animals and grab the gauge much on the
sensor and then you would see that it's
it's rising and for example is the
desktop app is really triggering in the
chart it triggers every measurement we
have the bigger board version just
triggers every animal every five minutes
or something like that because if you
run it over an hour you just would like
to see the last hour the values anywhere
on the desktop version here I just would
like to check if it works so this was
really just a full for concept but to
come back to the to the to the gauges
because this is important if you use
something like this rich gauge that I
usually on the desktop version
unfortunately this version is up to 245
nodes in the scene graph one gauge
looking nice means a lot harder of notes
needed sometimes if I would do it again
today I would do it differently but now
it's there and it works and on the
desktop machine everything is fine but
on the bigger body this is too much so
if you were designing it from scratch
for the BeagleBoard you probably would
have designed it a little bit
differently yeah totally doesn't fit the
hardware constraint yes so that was the
reason for this simple gauges and this
is a gaygent principle in the JFX trust
project that is running on the bigger
board I just put it in for this version
I put everything in one class that it
works but it's the same code and this
can use only three notes and that's the
minimum that you can reach because one
is for the control one is for the skin
and then you have one where the actual
gauge is drawn that's javafx to the tool
in javafx eight it's different there we
have only one load per control because
they change the how it works in the
background hmm but so this is important
to keep in mind that you really if you
design software for this kind of devices
keep it simple and therefore metros is
great that networks nice you don't want
all these chinese stuff on a on a device
that is somewhere
in the darkroom and you go there once a
day or once a week so you don't need to
really shiny interface you need
something that works functional and
therefore Metro is nice but also dig
deeper into this stuff alright so we had
a question yeah this actually this is a
good time to ask garrett any questions
about the BeagleBoard hardware that
I'm here another night after I Tony see
you tomorrow oh no don't you say oh you
guys are both the jacks yeah I the Jack
stop you're coming right I think it's w
jack solution yeah and then April is
jacks
he knows the BeagleBoard can handle have
you are quite well on droid in origin
yeah I just know from from just and
Richard that day it could handle up to a
couple of hundred up to 1,000 i think is
possible and on the panda definitely but
on the bigger it's kind of slow you see
it if you work it's this animation
gage is just the line it's an arc with a
certain width and then I fill it a
second arc that's all I do and if I
animated it goes out tick tick tick tick
tick so you see it's not that powerful
that means it's able to handle that
nodes but if you animate them or move
them translate and this is the kind of
stuff that you should avoid you can do
it if we're render fine it will take a
little bit longer maybe to render it but
if it's there it's half our accelerated
a pretty good experience on the
Raspberry Pi now that should be better
and he has a better a better GPA than
the the BeagleBoard ends the panda has a
pretty good cheap use yeah yeah so you
can drive both
if you would like to do some rich stuff
then you should definitely go with the
Panda but we have to wait for the
support it will come but it's not there
yet as you know I but the bigger body I
just choose it because it was so package
all right now we got a question from
chip it shifts on the numbers which now
user group I shave hi so ships wondering
what other hardware devices can be
for the Panda board from
I saw those
