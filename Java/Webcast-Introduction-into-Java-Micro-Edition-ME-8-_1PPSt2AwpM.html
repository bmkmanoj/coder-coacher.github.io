I'm a senior technologist and product
manager at Oracle today I would like to
give you an introduction into Java ME 8
first I would like to look at the rise
of the Internet of Things and the
drivers behind Java ME 8 the Internet of
Things is the third IT revolution the
host era was about proprietary hard and
software and multiple people sharing one
machine in the PC era the shift happened
to more open heart and software and
individual devices per person today
devices are becoming cheaper smaller
smarter and more connected and we are
now seeing an explosion of such devices
driving the Internet of Things era where
there will be many more devices than
people these devices will be taking on a
variety of functions across many
industries and fields from industrial
control environmental monitoring
logistics transportation smart energy
telehealth and many more making our
world smarter and more efficient many
people call this the third IT revolution
due to the pervasive and interconnected
nature of these devices scalability can
only be achieved by hardware and
software that is based on standards and
interoperable the Internet of Things
offers many opportunities to make our
world smarter but is also creating a
number of challenges with this third IT
revolution comes a new set of challenges
the embedded industry is facing software
is becoming an ever more critical
component to make these devices smart
and useful capabilities such as remote
software download and updates platform
and application security and support for
the many types of i/o which might be
required can place great demands on the
organization developing deploying and
supporting embedded solutions some of
the questions you need to ask yourself I
need to support a number of different
devices how can I do this without having
to re-implement my solution multiple
times how do I make sure my devices are
secure
and the data is kept private my devices
are in remote locations how do I access
and control them my devices need to be
out there for 10 plus years how do I
maintain update and manage devices once
in the field cellular communication is
expensive how do I minimize data traffic
I need to integrate with existing
infrastructure and protocols are those
supported how do I develop software
efficiently across a large number of
products I cannot afford to develop a
technology stack from scratch how do i
leverage existing components and reduce
my time to market Java ME is designed to
address key challenges in the Internet
of Things first Java ME is a modern
embedded software platform it provides a
robust secure cross-platform execution
environment software modularity coupled
with remote application provisioning and
management allows you to create deploy
and update software securely and extend
product lifetime and add product value
over time while reducing cost and risk
second Java me8 features an efficient
software development and deployment
model it addresses many of the
challenges of traditional embedded
software development such as platform
dependencies native code complexities
and proprietary tooling and languages
and allows you to develop your software
solutions using the efficient Java
language and mature tooling and thus
accelerate your time to market because
of the unified development model Java
code and expertise is easily portable so
you can benefit from the economies of
scale by applying existing solutions to
other use cases and you can innovate
even faster by leveraging the expertise
of 9 million Java developers third the
Java ME eight design allows you to
address a wide range of use cases and
target devices with a single software
model by optimizing and right sizing the
platform to fit the needs of your use
case and finally Java me is an open
standard and interoperable with many
other technologies which allows you to
avoid
login and participate in a broad
ecosystem of innovation solutions and
partners let's go into some details of
Java ME eight Java ME eight has three
main themes Java v8 is a major step
towards alignment of the Java ME and se
platforms to enable a unified developer
experience an ecosystem Java ME eight is
a dedicated embedded application
platform to address the needs of the
embedded market and Java ME eight
addresses a wide range of use cases and
markets with new functionality some of
the key features and components of Java
ME eight are Cl dc-8 which provides an
updated virtual machine and alignment
with java SE m ee p8 which defines a
modern embedded application platform on
top of cl dc-8 a number of new features
and api's programming interfaces
designed to address a wide range of
requirements in use cases improved
configurability of the platform which
allows the solution to be optimized for
footprint down to target devices with as
little as 128 kilobytes of RAM and one
megabyte flash or ROM Java ME eight is a
horizontal embedded application platform
targeting small to mid-range embedded
devices covering a wide range of use
cases and market targets some examples
of such embedded devices are intelligent
edge devices communication nodes
healthcare devices smart sensors smart
meters and other IOT and
machine-to-machine
solutions
let's have a high-level look at an
example of a Java ME 8 solution stack
Java ME 8 is architected to be a
horizontal application platform which
provides the base infrastructure of
commonly required features an execution
of software in a robust and secure
manner this base can be extended and
specialized for particular use cases or
industry domains by adding layers of
functionality on top at the bottom of
the platform we see CL dc8 or the
connected limited device configuration
which is the core java vm execution
environment above CL dc-8 is mep 8 or
the Java ME embedded profile which
provides the application environment CL
dc-8 and MEP 8 are supported by
additional components the device io API
the generic connection framework or GC
f8 and the security and Trust services
API SATA we will look at CL dc-8 and MEP
8 in more detail in a minute the device
io API is a programming interface which
allows Java applications to access and
control hardware devices and peripherals
and enables to implement use case
specific hardware functionality very
easily and in a cross-platform manner
the generic connection framework
provides a set of interfaces which allow
applications to access and control a
variety of connectivity and associated
options for both wired and wireless
interfaces finally these security and
Trust services API is a collection of
security related functionality for use
by applications such as encryption and
decryption handling of credentials and
more these components form the base of
the Java ME 8 platform additional
components and api's can be layered on
top to provide a specialized platform to
meet the requirements of a range of
similar use cases or industry segments
some possible examples of extensions are
shown here in the diagram
finally the applications at the top
implement the functionality and business
logic needed for a particular embedded
solution or customer by leveraging all
the platform functionality present in
the layers below the applications can be
developed very efficiently and remained
small and focused it is important to
note that all Java ma8 applications are
built using common platform
functionality common application
concepts and common development
methodology this enables code and
expertise to translate easily increasing
reuse and scalability of your software
and allowing you to address new use
cases solutions and even new industries
with reduced time to market and cost
let's have a look at some of the key
features CLD c 8 provides c LD c 8
supports most of the java SE 8 language
features as well as a number of api is
brought over from java SE so Java SE
developers will feel right at home on CL
dc8 and code is easily portable between
Java ME Java SE and within the Java
ecosystem c LD c 8 also includes the
updated generic connection framework
api's including support for the latest
standards for secure connectivity
despite all these new features c LD c 8
remains very small and in fact enables
further reductions in size both at the
platform as well as the application
level and c LD c aid is fully backwards
compatible to ensure existing code and
libraries can easily migrate to Java ME
8 m ee p 8 provides a software platform
with a number of key features m ee p8 is
built on c LD c 8 and this means that m
ee p 8 leverages all the c LD c 8
language features api's and the
permissions model to align with java SE
8 making application development more
streamlined m ee p 8 ads API optionality
and profile sets this is a critical
feature which allows the footprint and
resource requirements of a
tickler deployment of a Java ME 8
platform to be minimized based on the
features required by the applications
that will run on it profile sets are
well defined sets of optional
functionality for different use cases
and types of target devices this design
allows Java ME 8 platforms to scale
across a wide range of target devices
and use cases all the way down to single
chip microcontroller solutions with very
limited resources
Emme EP 8 supports software provisioning
and management which is built-in
functionality for remote software
deployment management and monitoring
which enables you to update and manage
software on target devices in the field
in a robust and predictable manner Java
ME 8 enables modular software a service
enabled software model allows
partitioning of the application logic
into dedicated modules that work
together collaboratively on the target
system these components can be updated
individually as needed reducing the
overall development effort complexity
and footprint MEP 8 focuses on
connective use-cases
by providing support for advanced
connectivity to optimize wireless
communications and finally MEP 8
features an improved security model
which allows customized functionality
for authentication and authorization of
software components based on the
specific deployment policies here are
some examples of products where Java ME
8 could be used wireless modules and
gateways industrial control and
telemetry units smart meters and smart
sensors a health and telehealth medical
equipment and general Internet of Things
and machine-to-machine solutions let's
spend a minute on tools a key benefit of
the Java platform is the mature and
efficient development model and tooling
Java me8 is supported by the Java ME SDK
or software developer toolkit which
provides dedicated functionality for
rapid development of embedded Java ME
applications the Java ME SDK also
features plug-ins for popular ideas such
as NetBeans and Eclipse to provide a
full-featured
integrated development environment as a
result Java offers a unified development
experience across Java platforms both in
terms of code portability and tooling
enabling the entire ecosystem of 9
million Java developers and partners to
develop Java embedded solutions with
that short introduction let's summarize
Java ME 8 is designed to be the platform
of choice for the Internet of Things
space Java ME 8 enables rapid
development of software functionality
code reuse and leveraging of expertise
of the Java developer community it
offers a modular and manageable software
environment to deliver valuable software
functionality to your products in the
field while reducing risk cost and time
to market and as security is becoming
ever more important Java ME 8 offers an
enhanced security model with the
flexibility for specialized deployment
scenarios Java ME 8 increases the market
reach of your software and products
because it allows you to use a single
software model to scale from very small
target devices to more powerful embedded
systems by optimizing the platform for
the use case and reducing hardware cost
and finally and this is especially
critical for embedded solutions which
often have to last 5 10 or maybe even 15
years Java ME is an open future-proof
technology with a committed roadmap it
allows you to participate in the
evolution of the standard itself and
participate in the broader ecosystem of
solutions and related standards as well
as leverage the innovation and
partnerships the vibrant Java ecosystem
provides
