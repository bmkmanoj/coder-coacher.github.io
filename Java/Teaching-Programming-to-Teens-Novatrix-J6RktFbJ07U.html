I'm you don't wanna from Oracle
technology Network and my guess right
now is a Jeff's Presti the right way
open until you just breasteses yeah
that's just okay so Jeff you are into
like you're teaching young developers is
that what you are doing yes now we
created here in Brazil wok project
called oh man we know this project is
for to help young people important earn
how to code after several years in
different countries we saw that they
have that the young people have faced
the same challenge is how to learn to
code well we find very good initiatives
like co.org it's an extraordinary
website to teach however we realize that
only website dozen the serve our
problems down and you know don't let the
teas or the young people excited they
needed some mentors so that's how we
work we start with a workshop where we
teaching it for them bass cover program
aligning using Arduino so that's why I
called oh man we know is I do enough of
humans yeah and then after they compiled
the first program after they have an oh
that's a variable oh that's a case of
conditionals other stuff they realizes
it's some of them realize okay it's cool
this is for me and keeping keep learning
and others say yeah I don't think call
this for me maybe i need you i would i
want to be at signer maybe all other any
other kind of other jobs and then if for
them they like how to code then we start
to mentor them then we use tools like
co.org or
platforms here in Brazil you are using a
luda and other you know online cool
courses and weekly they have meetings
with their mentors I see so that makes
it really like there is a follow-up and
exacto they they are coached I mean all
the way through right that's right
because uh for instance i was in some
cities for live in America I've been to
some cities there and I need some cool
in some co-working spaces some young
developers come to me and lost some of
them even universities I went to some
good anniversa tease over there in some
hackathons they don't have a clue how to
start right in the fight they don't have
the overview i mean the the overview
picture of everything that is possible
right lecture yes because they reside
there's there are so many tools and so
many languages that you can can learn I
mean this is it Sandra right exactly
furnaces need some they need a major to
say hey do you want to learn to start to
learn java okay first step go to go
there and download netbeans go there
download and at least first of all start
with this stall job okay now you have a
Java you have not nice okay then you
start to talk about classes about
objects and there is so on but you need
a tool but someone that is starting they
don't know that they need a to write and
then maybe or in which to to use right
and often i think that the kids also
will I there they are very familiar with
all the tools online or and they want to
reproduce they would love for example if
you tell them all right let's let's do a
code let's do like a project something
that will do exactly what Facebook does
exact and you'll get them very excited
that's right but it is a step-by-step
right but then it's like how do you
really meant to them to get there
exactly that's work that's the fire
that's the point so for instance on them
think oh I want to create app oh that's
right doing I really enjoy that that's
right so first you need to learn java so
then the major stars if you say it step
by step so uh we are very excited and
now we are looking for we want to look
at well what more mater's to help more
students and when we do we create a way
that we it's we can take it the
workshops to other places so for
different students could could be here
and in Brazil could be and in America
could be in Europe in other countries in
Latin America so we have a have a
Facebook page so it's facebook.com slash
oh man we know human we know supporting
producers in English and everybody was
welcome to come and maybe organizing
your CD some chapter and we can travel
go there to give the is for free we
don't charge a thing our idea is to
empower those young people I so you will
just like help a group of people
somewhere anywhere in the world create
their own chapter so they can run their
workshop and yeah after students yeah
all right i did also is to help the
mentors to how to work how to deal with
the young the teenagers and we give some
advices and we believe this we start
this using good very good tools like we
have nowadays like again co.org we can
bring more and more developers great
awesome thank you so much Oh tucking in
oh thank you thank you for the
opportunity to talk about the project
yes and good luck with that project well
Oh think of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
