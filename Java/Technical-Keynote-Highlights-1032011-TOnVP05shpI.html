seven I'd like to like to dive into into
into three of the big ones this morning
project coin invoke dynamic and the fork
join framework project coin is all about
small change in particular it's about
small changes to the java programming
language designed to simplify everyday
programming tasks so the programs are
easier to write easier to read and
easier to maintain over the long term
the features of project point are not
just for application code they're also
for the code in the JDK itself we went
through an exercise where we analyzed
the JDK codebase to find opportunities
where we could use you use the project
point features and we went and indeed
change the code base to use them what
about invoke dynamic what's what's all
this I hear about a new byte code in
both dynamic is something that it's
going to help us improve Ruby
performance by optimizing all of these
lots and lots tons and tons of method
calls that we have in Ruby invoke
dynamic jsr 292 gives us two things a
new byte code called invoke dynamic
which allows user code to decide at
runtime how a dispatch is going to be
patched through to some method and the
method handle API which basically
provides function pointers and adapters
to wire up and invoke dynamic call ok
project coin invoke dynamic fork join
framework the fork join framework is
motivated by the inevitable rise of
multi-core processors the real power of
the fork joint framework is that it
takes care of all the parallelism and
synchronization for you all you have to
be able to do is specify how to take a
subtask and divide it into two pieces
how to solve a sub how to run a subtask
sequentially and how to combine the
results of sub sub tasks as they finish
and go it go up the tree java 7 is
available today you can download it you
can play with it and it is ready to
deploy in production so I'd like to talk
about two features we're thinking about
48 one is project lambda to bring
closures to the java programming
language the other is project jigsaw
which aims to define a module system not
just for application code but also for
the platform itself so why do we want to
add lambda expressions to the Java
language the inevitable rise of
multi-core processors there are lots of
different ways to program them and and
some of the key techniques can best be
done if you've got lambda expressions
motivation for project jigsaw is to
address the problem of programming and
the large with Java programming in the
small is about writing classes and
interfaces and putting them together
packages and so forth programming in the
large is about doing things at a higher
level where you have large program
components you want to be able to reuse
assemble together in different ways to
construct different kinds of
applications you can help we have a
project in OpenJDK for JDK a early bills
of JDK 8 don't use those in production
please but we do feel free to play with
them and send us bug reports
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
