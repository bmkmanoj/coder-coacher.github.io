for oh I don't know over 15 years anyway
and Dutchess is a network for female
Java developers and other women who are
interested in Java or not might not be
developers but who had some interest
it's it's just to give us a little
support network in this man's world and
we've always urge our members to also
become members of the local juggs to be
active in the community so what we're
doing is we're trying to get more women
to be visible in the community at large
yeah so at an event for example like
devoxx what what are some of the things
that you do that Fox
for instance organize above normal iam
but Estes is our 10th anniversary we
organize the lunch which was really good
fun invited several women that we that
are here attending and so about 30 right
some heard about us some just met us
here so it was very nice to meet new
people that's what we do here and we
also encourage people to become speakers
yep we tell them you can become a
speaker you can start with your local
jerk and we and then submit a talk and
we also invite speakers to join us in
our buff session to just feel what it is
like to be a speaker at a conference so
what how do you start to be as a speaker
like what kind of sessions you can you
can do and you can do anything you can
do you can start out with a
non-technical session if that feels
easier you can start with the technical
session about something that you're
really passionate about some cool
framework or tool that you've just found
you can do like wikis quickies Ricky's
like 15 minute talk or you can go for a
conference talk which is an hour if you
have a little bit more to tell
if you're adventurous you could even go
for the full deep dives three-hour
session or be even like a co speaker
right I mean yes you guys we're also
supposed speakers right yeah that's what
why we invite people to become Co
speakers and yet depends on what you
want to do there's always a big request
for how to start at certain points
because that's not only the deep dives
and the things that people really
advanced talks some people always want
to know how do I get started with this
particular framework or this particular
subject so how do you come up with
subject because I know that once you did
a topic on a spreadsheet something you
had a quick yeah like give an example
that that was framework I found because
I had a client the client wanted to have
spreadsheets and Word documents and
basically the project lead said yeah we
can give you comma separated value files
and we can give you text documents and
I'm like that's not what the client is
looking for there must be some framework
out there that can do this and I have
some time on my hands because I wasn't
working full time for that client and
didn't have another project so asserts
and I actually found the framework and I
had some time to play around with it and
I'm like this is such a cool framework
and nobody I knew in my company had
heard of it so I'm like there must be
more people who have never heard of this
so this is a very interesting subject to
quickly give an introduction to into so
people have heard of it and can start
using it because it was relatively easy
to get into anyway so I was like I can't
just do a quickie to show them what it's
like and then they can find out the rest
for themselves right so finding like a
problem at work and that's and it's
about sharing knowledge really it is one
of the subjects we did several talks
about this teaching kids how to code so
that's a joint in with the difference
for kids surfing because that's that's
what you do as well right as well if we
want to have more women in IT we have to
start young true because
that the girls at like 12 13 years old I
like not coding is for four boys and
it's not for girls why I don't know but
somehow they well in it's also that a
lot of their girlfriends actually go
into something else at the fact so then
they had to do the same as well so so
the we do that and we go to conferences
to promote it also other conferences
that deaf Hawks because people don't
know about Derrick's for kids because
it's so close to the brain so that's and
that we do that talks um and then we
rotate to speaker so one of us does to
talk and we take a co speaker that
hasn't done it talks before and then I
they end up doing a co presentation
somewhere else together so that was
really good fun cool so some of them so
what do you do otherwise if you're not
at conferences do you have a website or
is there anything we do have a website
yay - is org and the J is there for the
JAF of course and - is being a royal
title it's really hard to have a website
about so we you better DJ in front of
her name and you have also like
subgroups right how does it work so it's
a global community but it's a global
community and we encourage everybody to
start our own local chapter so we have a
big chapter in in Sweden and in France
and they are totally autonomous from us
we even don't know how many members they
have we just ask them to tell us their
information like do they have a website
you have a meetup group do they have a
Twitter handle so that people can find
them we put post them on our main
website and then people can find if
there is a local chapter for them and
what is the information about that
actually the reason that I let all the
chapters go on their own was like I
don't know what they need out there
every country is different they all have
different cultures I can't make up the
rules for everybody because then it will
be just my thing and it's not supposed
to be my thing it's supposed to be to
help all women out there
right and I know that in Europe I mean a
lot of those groups I also connected to
the Tudor jugs
I mean they have that very close
relationship with local jobs for example
they do and for instance in France they
started but hardly any women going to
the Paris jack and then they found out
founded dashes there and they decided to
go to dinner before going to their local
jerk and then now half of the group
running the Yahoo user group in Paris is
female and I ordered help organized
effort okay that Fox France and
defecates events everywhere so yeah they
just needed the little push to organize
themselves together and go and write to
be more comfortable basically attending
like a lot of the events that yeah
exactly
we had one lady from the UK who lived in
Manchester who was like I only don't
have that but we don't have a joke
either and be like hey go start the junk
then right and she did she started she
just started a meetup group said I will
be there with cookies and tea the
British of course and she was like ok I
will see who shows up and there's like
10 people showed up for the first
meeting and now it's been running for I
think four years maybe probably yeah
very nice yeah that's a question to
start yeah that's nothing okay
so anything else so the the URL what is
it URL again yeah the shoe store okay so
visit the website and find out more yes
and look for like a local job I mean a
duchess group and connect with them and
go to conferences start networking right
and take all the advantages that guys
have basically right that's it so thank
you both Thank You Linda thank you very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
