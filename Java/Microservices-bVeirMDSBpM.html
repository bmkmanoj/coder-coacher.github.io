Microsoft's is you not work for you as
you expect that okay so it's a talk dot
that invites the listener to understand
what they should do before they start to
go micro-services okay so really like
why I mean should they consider yeah
moving to a micro services
infrastructure basically that's right so
what what are some of the situation
where people would really want you to
have a micro services infrastructure
yeah my talk is about how to think about
micro services yeah and all the
consequences that you have when you
start using micro services is not about
the technical part it's all about the
people engagement right and how they
understand this approach of architecture
can help them to develop a good or a
best solution for they needs and the
first reason that I've talked there is
about the they don't know why they are
doing micro services I see so they don't
then they're not really trying to solve
a problem they're just following the
hype of yeah saying okay just I'm seeing
all of the companies around the world
doing micro services and I want to do
that in my company too why not
but this is a little crap when you think
about to develop in micro services
approach because you need to know
exactly what you expected by when you
are attaching your solution in this way
right so the first thing I think is
about the sko teams and the projects
okay it's a common issues inside all the
companies but I need to understand how
prepared my company's choo engaging
these micro surfaces hypo so basically
my my entire talk is about the dis
context how people can see all the
benefits of micro services but before
that I need to develop with some skills
inside my company to develop it dis
approach well okay so so when should
they move to micro services
infrastructure yeah I think that the
first movement is about the mentality
mindset okay mindset is important
because you are dealing with another
problems now you have a distributed
system and you are under a monolithic
mindset and you need to change your
mindset to discover the big challenges
that you have when you approach to micro
services okay first when you so what
does that mindset involve I mean a
doesn't mean you have a distributed
system so so you have different teams
working on on different part of the
project and I mean is it like more about
the collaboration so where's that
mindset and how is it different that's a
good question because you have two types
of mindset you have the individual
mindset and that the group mindset right
how I see my job inside the chain and
how the change see their job inside the
company and how to communicate between
the teams and it's a mindset how can I
extract the information that I need to
develop a new service and deserves is
really really important and for me to
develop these services eating right a
right way to do that this is a common
questions and the important quest
is not about that if I will distribute
the solution but if I need these
services as I'm thinking that these
services is but it's in the in a
specific point how you can see the
services inside the solution okay so
you're talking about integrated system
so yeah you develop an individual system
but yet it needs also to be able to talk
and to I mean to be integrated in the
solution because I need another gene to
do their job right because I need them
right - to get this complete because my
services depends on the information that
they hold and right I think like that
you need to develop this mindset to
understand how can I involve the another
genes inside this concept to strike the
information that I need and how you can
communicate over the services and there
is a specific human
concretely how do you manage that I mean
do you have project managers that do
that is that the role of an engineer - I
mean in other words that's really like
everybody can you develop a process that
use DevOps oh I don't know something
else that will help you with them for me
the first step is that you develop the
mindset of DevOps okay the DevOps
mindset yeah because mindset gives us
another way to think about the software
and how we made it right and when yeah
so usually it's like if you put the
process together to change them and it
might set otherwise you know you can I
mean people don't change
really yeah for sure if I have an
integration continuous and added a very
continuous I'm thinking in another way
right because I need that agility and I
need to deliver all the things in in a
time that
it's short right and I can bring it to
the to the lighting in production as
soon as possible
and it's a consequence of a mindset when
the way that you think about the
software delivering and the so on okay
so what were some of the other reasons
that you had for moving to do micro
services infrastructure I have we have a
price as often identity in the market
it's another kind of trap that I'm
seeing because we have a big players
micro services like Netflix Amazon and
other companies around the world but
they are them and I'm working another
company and I need to understand the
needs of my company and yes they have
open-source solutions if this solution
is good for my company I use that
because it makes sense but if it's not
human
inside the requirements that I have in
my company I should not use just because
Netflix is using that right yes yes it's
not because like a popular it's just a
crisis often I think yeah so that's that
I thought yeah that's the hype right
yeah like everybody just use the open
source Netflix solution because they saw
with all the problems that you have in
your company but I don't know yet yes I
have no sure about this right so I
needed to understand my problems and see
if I need that solution that Netflix for
example we have a lot of examples in the
market that's good for my company and
I've fulfilled that the requirements and
it's good for me and my team we can
handle that and can support that and all
of my infrastructure is align it with
the
a solution because they using they are
using Amazon for example if I don't use
Amazon I don't know if I should use that
okay
despite of expecting any other reasons
don't over think you had seven yeah we
have a lot lots of another things about
the main town model a way that we think
about the solutions and the runtime the
runtime consequences yeah when we are in
the monolith we have some issues that
it's a Iran know about from us we
understand this world but when when we
are moving to Microsoft's we are facing
other problems that we didn't face yet
yeah for example distributed
transactions it's a common problem when
you are distributing systems and many
times people asking me about how can I
do
distributed transactions it's a mental
model of mana lift we have a transaction
and we put all the data inside this
transaction they commit at the end and
everything is done but when I distribute
that I'm I'm splitting its transaction
in various transactions around the
runtimes and the most important thing
now is about to think that we don't have
a transactions distributed you just have
is the later transactions and the way I
need you to hold back this change I'm
not home baking in the same way that I'm
a whole backing in the monolith I'm home
backing I state we have a state a before
and after and when I want to hold back
I'm ho backing
the state and I needed to update things
insert things delete things and thinking
thing database for examples and I need
to make all of this now in my
application not in database it's a yeah
it's a different way of value needed to
think about the solution and we have in
here in Brazil huge companies that they
are doing distributed transactions for
years it and that they do it I am NOT
whole backing I'm adjusted on making
that it's a it's different it's kind of
perspective different to different way
of thinking about transactions yeah and
this is the way that we are dealing with
transactions there's in that stupid
system it's on another another reason
that I I i guess that micro services
will not work for for people that don't
understand is design new mental model
and that box was another that we just
talked about it now so what about DevOps
how does develop fits with micro
services I think they start point is
DevOps for micro services there's no way
to escape off that it's a in my opinion
suppressex e-procurement and if you
don't have if you don't have a DevOps
mindset inside your project line you are
under a sewer risk of failure because
you need to make your services up as
fast as possible and you need to monitor
everything that is going on there and if
my services going down I need to make it
start
as soon as possible and I need you to
manage that and when I'm concerning to
update my service I need to have a
mechanism to do that fast
my and DevOps give us this mindset to
develop a things in a certain way that
we have agility to dealing with problems
right and this is the main mindset for
me that DevOps gave us okay okay this is
good
thank you thank you for coming and
talking to us about micro services and
DevOps that's a great time and I
appreciate your efforts and see you guys
over there in the world and like I said
it here I manage hacker see you last
time so stay with us we will have more
interviews later on so as</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
