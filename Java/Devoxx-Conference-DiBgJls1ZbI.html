Network and I'm here today at devoxx
France talking to Stephan gentles define
hello Yolanda so we we call you the
father of devoxx so whoa why is that
yeah well the main reasons of course
i've started java police in 2001 before
that i already was running the belgium
java user group for about four years and
it was basically out of a necessity to
have a local java conference in europe
and i started at in 2001 we had like 750
people for the first edition and ever
since every year it grew it like thirty
percent so is right 900 to 1200
basically until we maxed out the venue
which is now at three thousand four
hundred and fifty people and some people
said like well if when you is max out so
if you can't scale vertically you have
to start scaling horizontally so that's
why we started last year devoxx France
with the Paris jerk and Antonio and his
team that was also sold out after two
weeks and then this year we decided also
with the London Java user group to start
the day fox UK edition we also started
devix forgets this year and we had about
70 children between 10 and 14 which had
multiple workshops on scratch lego
mindstorms and the novel robots now
that's also going global we have one in
france one is going to start in the
netherlands will do one in UK and in
norway i think one of the the baselines
we use for deaf boxes it's by developers
for developers and I really think that
does make a big difference is that i'm
still a developer i still compile on a
daily basis and all the people who run
the different devoxx editions there are
all developers so they really know what
but the problem is that we need to solve
what the information is we need to
provide we know what's hot what's not
what rock stars because we need to have
and another very important aspect is of
course the price it needs to be very
democratic and so by having lots of
sponsors we can actually drop the
entrance fee to like three hundred fifty
euros and
as a result we have instead the
developers instead of the managers of
the developers and I think that does
make a big difference Oracle's role in
dev ox is there the steward of Java I
mean they have to be involved if Oracle
would not be involved the credibility of
their folks actually declined so they
have to be part of that and it's so nice
to see that they really do support us
it's of course a win-win situation for
both parties we evangelize Java we do
that also flew the Oracle engineers I
mean they are at the grass roots of
what's happening within the java space
so they have to be there so what's next
I think definitely more devix for kids
initiatives need to be started whatever
we do for kids I think that's important
because that way we can get more
children and maybe even specifically
also girls involved in IT because it's
between 10 and 14 that they decide what
career they might do and then i think i
will not do another edition of devoxx in
a different city this year because i
first want to have do UK and a very
healthy and have more at in these there
but then maybe next year who knows we
might go to another continent maybe
Brazil who knows or China we'll see but
we need to find the right people
