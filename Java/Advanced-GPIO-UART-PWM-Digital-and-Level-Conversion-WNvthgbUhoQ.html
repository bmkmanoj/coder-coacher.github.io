cold weather today we are casting from
Sun Bowl and we are going to talk about
different said GPIO and my idea today is
to show you a little bit about each
topic around GPIO so I will give you
some tips and tricks about my experience
my personal problem that I found using
different types of GPIO but I would like
to to give you here like our directions
some links talk about some components
and and give you the support later if
you need to talk about some specific
point around GPIO and about your project
we can support you today after my
presentation or you can also schedule a
coaching session with me tomorrow or
Wednesday and next week we will also be
doing some coaching so this is part of
the trainings that we are doing and
webinars that we are doing for the
Oracle IOT developer challenge is
authorized by Oracle technology Network
and today we have here your land
we are from Morocco and yet a singer
also from global couch thanks everybody
for watching us and let's study though
we are going to talk about digital ports
we are going to talk about serial
communication which is very important
for a port sorry I forgot to share my
slides okay good fullscreen
let's start good and so we have our
agenda digital ports serial
communication which is very very
important for embedded space because
many times is the only way that you will
find you communicate with your board and
I'm going to talk not too much about
ice-crazy and SPI just because we have a
specific content available on YouTube we
did a webinar we did a contagious
recording about I Square C and and we
also talked it about SPI and today I'm
going to talk about PWM which is a very
nice technique for controlling position
or power of the thing and I'm going to
talk about some level converter when you
have two different types of components
working with different voltage like
three voltages three volts like
raspberry pi and 5 volts like any kind
of microcontroller like 80 mega or P I
see they used to be 5 volts and I'm
going to talk about some tips and tricks
around java around some physical some
noises that I found problems with relays
and noise and about more specific um of
raspberry pi and pi 4g because raspberry
pi used to be the most popular port
nowadays but the content here is useful
if you are looking to any kind of work
but I need to refresh this window sorry
this my
one minute 100 the easy way for you to
extend your hardware when we have the PC
architecture we used to have the PCI
accessory boards that you can buy and
plug into your PC and this is the way
that we used to extend our PC to our
personal computer with this type of
architecture using VCI boards and you
have a very large epi o and you need to
write a driver for that new device and
so on so with the the single board
computers we have a simplified GPIO
where you can extend your hardware by
plugging new sensors controllers motor
controllers light LED controllers pad
controllers and touchscreen controllers
and so the GPIO is the place that we use
to have fun when we are working with
international things and the GPIO we
don't have AI standard one or a minimal
one for each different type of board
that you use you will find a different
GPIO like if you compare the GPIO after
on the Raspberry Pi to the BeagleBone
black GPIO is totally different the
BeagleBone is huge compared to the
Raspberry Pi GPIO so it's something that
is specific from the harbor and maybe
you can you can you can make a project
for one specific Harbor that may not
work with any with other
type of hardware like sometimes you do
approve it for bingo Bonnie black and
you use it many different I square C
buses and when you try to migrate
raspberry pi you can find a problem
because you just have to raise Percy
buses and Raspberry Pi so the idea of
the people I ou can give you this issue
to your project especially for the
complex one
okay it's everything all right okay well
when we are talking about the raspberry
hpi-o you will look to 70 different pins
and you have seven general pins for
digital usage one PWM the native PWM and
you have two pins use it by I square C 5
for spi and two pins for you art
communication so if you want to know
more about the Raspberry Pi GPIO in
Martin Hill I would recommend you check
is URL we have this nice Raspberry Pi
documentation GPIO documentation and as
you can see here we have the name of pin
I like this both here it's for five
volts round I square C pins you have one
pin four o'clock here ground UART
communication the serial the PWM another
ground and digital pins available for
you and also the spi using all those
pins here so this is very nice one
because beyond the name of the pins and
the number and etc you have the feature
behind that pin so we have fixed that
pins for using I square C on raspberry
world some types of boards and and
system-on-chip computers you can say oh
use the port number 10 and 11 for our
experts
see sometimes you can make this kind of
a different set configuration in our
pins but here we have the fix that
features behind the pins so and also you
have the very nice resume about what is
that technology behind like I square see
low-speed user to communicate with
different multiple devices using two
IRAs and so on so take a look in this
URL and if you are really working hard
with Raspberry Pi I would recommend
YouTube to print these and and put in
your Chi and blue in your wall okay so
these are ports they are the basic one
and they are represented by 0 or 1
true or false high or low they are
binary ports and it means that if we
have no voltage in that port it will be
0 if we had high voltage no voltage
actually if we had low voltage like when
we worked with 5 volts we are working
with the same oh sorry TTL 5 volts and
you go about it
here 5 volts you will see that you have
a standard for being 0 or 1 right and I
remember we have like less than 2 volts
it will be 0 we have more than 3 volts
or some dot something 5 here we go
okay so the TTL logic voltage is there
and off the older one if you have 0 from
0 to 0.8 voltage votes it will be 0 if
you have more than 3 but something it
will be high and but it's from the TTL
logic that's more like Arduino works but
for Raspberry Pi we work with the SEMA
SEMA SEMA voltage level CMOS we work
from 0 to feedback 3 3.3 volts here we
go Wikipedia a nice place and you can
have more information about the voltage
level so here we have our resume on the
voltage level Oh from 0 to 0.8 volts is
0 in TTL and from 0 to 130 of the VDD it
will be low voltage in CMOS so from 2
volts to 5 volts it will be high and we
have this middle zone from zero point
point ninety to one point nine volts and
this middle zone will be the the unknown
zone it can be zero or it can be one so
it explained why why our system got
crazy when the battery is low because
you start to go into the unknown zone so
that's some information additional
information about digital parts and if
you take care with the logic level that
you are using in your board because if
you try to communicate to 5 volts board
with a 3.3 volts board you will burn the
lower on the 3.3 volt one so take care
with this information
and we can use the parts to ride to the
port and turn on and turn off something
like a relay that's proven on AC adapter
and turn on and turn off your microwave
and turn on and turn off a fan and you
can reach the state of the digital port
you know if it's turn it on or turn it
off or you can listen to the part when
you are listening to the port you may
use Hardware interruption if you have
this support so like when you have a any
kind of button of micro switch behind a
digital port and you want to know if
somebody just presses the micro switch
just press that button so what you are
going to do is if you don't have
Hardware interruption support you will
need to write a software that will be
CPU consuming and you need to read the
state each and mile seconds and so you
are going to have delay more problems to
deal with to bouncing and everything
when you do with hard interruption you
don't you don't expand a CPU because the
software is just waiting for some
asynchronous a trigger from the harder
part from the driver that that is
communicating with the GPIO so you are
really listening to the to the to that
part and you can trigger any kind off of
Java code base it on a button press set
so we talked it and we we presented a
most so if we go you go to the the
project in java.net
you have all the the code samples here
and you can download and see we have a
complete recording about using G PI for
J buttons and figuring a camera and
things like that so you have more
material available already available
well we have the serial communication
the serial communication is very old way
to communicate pcs computers actually to
communicate computers with devices the
serial communication is one-to-one
communication so for each device that
you are going to plug in your computer
you need you need us different serial
communication ports and Raspberry Pi
comes with one serial communication one
UART communication that is supported by
ur by the the SOC the system on chip
from the Raspberry Pi so it has a harbor
support for UART communication with
buffering control when everything but
you could create a serial communication
also using software it will be not not
with the quality of the hardware one but
you can have more than one communication
serial communication by using any other
tube parts and communicating the ports
in the right speed and everything so you
need to implement it by harder but if
you want to do that by yourself you can
do but is not good for professional
implementations
the serial UART communication by
software the software serial the usual
Calais software serial we have some
famous integrated circuits some ICS
khalid max 2 3 2 + FD 2 3 2 so if you
are looking to communicate we've let
give you an example I did a project last
year to control and automate a
conference room in a very nice beauty
and we they just bought a very big and
professional projector but this big and
professional projector the only way to
control an ultimate i'll optima ties
that projector was using rs-232 so i
need to mount a cable with this guy the
db9
format standard for serial communication
to do that with Raspberry Pi you must
use the max to treat you integrated
circuit so this is very nice one and
very simple to use and I will give you a
URL about from Sparkfun
with a very nice and the tailored
tutorial on how to use the Max 2 3
cheese and we also have this one the ft
2 3 true this one is very nice because
it makes the serial USB conversion this
one is the one used in many many
platforms like her do you know and many
others so they use these ft 2 3 2 to
communicate with 5 volts microcontroller
and no problem if you need to talk with
max should be
- FG ft 2 3 - you will be fine with Java
I will show you how you can do it
and the Silvia we have another very
modern guy let's say this way the
Bluetooth components when you buy a
Bluetooth component for your Raspberry
Pi and you want to talk with any other
Bluetooth device you are going to use
the serial communication so you just
cross they are XTX communication cables
with your bluetooth module just start
typing Java code with PI for J or
depending the case with Java are XTX
library so the serial communication is
very useful if you look by this point of
view because through the serial you can
talk with Bluetooth modules you can talk
with old serial devices or you can talk
with other microcontrollers that has the
FG should be 2 serial USB converter the
first usage for the serial communication
with your Raspberry Pi is if you buy
this product from Adafruit here we go is
this one this is a USB to TTL serial
cable and we have disc these guys to
plug in your Raspberry Pi and here
behind this black connector we have some
CI to translate the the USB to TTL
serial communication so now that I
explain at you the TTL serial cable
that it is a 5 volts cable disabled
communicate this guy read one the power
the power is 5 volts the black is the
ground and these guys they are going to
the UART pins from our Raspberry Pi this
one here TX and rx and but these guys
they are 3.3 volts so having mind that
you are power supplying the circuit here
with 5 volts but the communication is
actually 3.3 volts so take care with
this kind of cable because pin and what
I did is afternoon here I was it was
part of my my life their mood today here
but I need to tell you that I just
burned name of all you guys I earned my
Raspberry Pi that I bring I'm not in my
official of C so I don't have a
replacement but I will give you it was
nice because at least I burn before you
probably and my experience maybe can be
useful for you all okay well so you buy
this cable will give out your a spurt I
don't be afraid and what you are going
to do is to use this lesson from
Adafruit to start communicating they are
here is imagine that you just have a
Raspberry Pi you don't have internet
support you don't have Wi-Fi you are
just starting to play with your
Raspberry Pi and you don't have also
HDMI monitor keyboard
even malls so the only way that you have
to start talking with your Raspberry Pi
is using the serial TTL cable and you
are going to use this this tutorial here
and you are going to plug for aspirin by
let me show you is very nice Adafruit is
a very nice place to buy components
actually they have they have the auto
embedded kit that you can buy and you
can participate on the Moke the Oracle
massive online training first about Java
me and Raspberry Pi using GPS using many
different types of command you can buy
everything here so the important thing
is I never notice I always used to add
my cable and never with the power supply
and I never noticed that I could have a
problem inside this way this cable or
add in the 5 volts black in the ground
here is TX are experienced for got my
power supply and burn it my raspberry
just stopped working and I I don't know
the reason why I need to see if I just
want something easy like a voltage
regulator if by doing this I just gave
10 volts or something I don't know the
reason why but it's not working anymore
so don't do that if you are going to use
your own power supply take the red wire
out and you will be fine so once you do
it stand configure basically what you
are going to do is to install
if you are Windows or Mac OS users a
driver for this this BL 2303 this guy is
the secret behind this USB serial TTL
converter cable and you need to install
this driver if you are Linux user as
Ares or you have a have very hard job to
put a driver or you don't have to
install anything luckily this case is
the second one you don't need to install
anything in your Linux to use this cable
so you are going to find a new serial
port if you are a Windows user it will
be con con x-country con 5.6 content and
you need to use any kind of serial
terminal like party or any other one
that you like in Windows and you are
going to establish a connection and
between the serial communication and
your Raspberry Pi the same thing as as
SH but in this case we are using a very
hardwired way to communicate with our
Radford PI so this is basic not advanced
set but I don't know many people that
use to do it and if you are like a Java
EE developers or Java effects developer
is a very nice trick because most of the
birds in the market will allow you to
communicate this way so it's very nice
investment kiss cable okay so
patient here very easy to find just
google or go to Adafruit serial
communication that's raspberry pi if you
need to communicate Java with serial
ports you have three different ways
basically the first one we'll be using
the leap are XTX slash Java like if you
if you are going to communicate the
raspberry pi will be accessing another
serial device imagine that you have old
driver for step motors that someone did
using pi C and F cheap route and to
treat you and you need to communicate
your raspberry pi you are going to plug
a USB cable in your Raspberry Pi and
your Raspberry Pi will be client of the
other silly advice and so in this case
you can store in your Raspberry Pi dilip
our xt access last java this lib is very
old one we don't have too many updates
for this library and but it's very
stable for raspberry pi i used to use a
lot so if you have any kind of question
question a question we go up the
regarding liver x TX and integration
between Java and serial devices please
let me know that I maybe my knowledge
will be useful for you and here is the
place that you can download we used to
have another that it was much more
traditional website colored Key Bank
dot-org that was the place that the Ali
barracks TX used to be hosted
but for some reason these URL doesn't
exist anymore so if you need to you can
find actually this library since it's
very old in many types of repository
including mailing repositories but the
official kind of official website is not
available anymore and we also have the
PI for J support if you want to use Java
to communicate
look this is different from the first
from the Liebherr XTX the liver X the X
we are going to use to communicate
Raspberry Pi with an external device
through the through the serial
communication and USB silly okay but if
you are plugging the device Didact to
your rxg X so you can use PI for J and
the other difference is that PI for J is
just for Raspberry Pi the Libra X the X
eul so you actually have four different
types of operational system like Linux
for different types of Linux Windows Mac
OS and so on and leave our X the X part
of that is native code so is not totally
much platform oh that's it the serial
communication the last thing I have to
say you is take care with delays
sometimes it's hard to get the device
syndrome I said and sometimes when you
have a microcontroller used to be a
dedicated controller and they used to be
fast very fast to do the communication
so if you are not using the controls
from the RS from the serial
communication sometimes you need to take
with delays
and establish a type of protocol so you
can transfer the information in a safe
way
and the serial communication you can
find actually many types of issues so
it's not the one that we use we use to
the debug and basic communication but
for more complex communication or if you
need a more reliable communication you
are going to use the industry one that
is Marc more or less the same thing is
serial as the rs-232 but is the RS for
air for a five so this one is more
reliable the wires can be longer and if
you are really looking for an industry
implementation or if you are looking to
work to work with legacy industry
components and devices are as for if a
five will be in your path someday but
when you are communicating with more
complex components like a little mirror
gyros comm-pass displays touch
touchscreen devices you will need to use
a better protocols for doing that
because as I told you for each serial
device you would need two different pins
and a hardware control of the data flow
and CRC and things like things like CRC
and but if you are looking for more near
components like a BIA camera you don't
have wire cables and it will be attached
it forever I think that Syria is very
use it for something that you are going
to plug try something and so unplug but
when you are talking about more complex
components they will be part of your
so you will look to use ice Percy or SPI
10 points ice Percy's up both our buses
so it means that you can have more than
one component sending and receiving data
using the same bus which means using the
same lines the same parts the same wires
ice crises lower speed with two wires
and we have LCD display modern
controllers and some basic sensors that
very popular if I square C for SPI is
much more complex is a high speed and so
me to use five lines five wires five
parts and we have graphics display
internet that you need high speed camera
information so it's very common that you
have the camera data the image from the
camera of coming from the SPI and the
buttons and the control and zoom and
everything using I spicy so we can take
advantage of both vs. and be more
dedicated to high speed with the image
transferring process from the camera and
you don't need too much speed but you
have many different types of buttons and
components that we're going to plug in I
square C so we have both things in our
raspberry pi we have one SPI
set of virus or five pins are dedicated
for SPI and we have two buses 2x / C
buses on our Raspberry Pi the one is the
native one and the other one you need to
solder mayo pins in the back of your
Raspberry Pi board and you will just
find the bus the second bus
in the second revision of Raspberry Pi
board and we have here the PWM ports
what is PWM is a digital part that once
you transfer information or control
power or position and PWM is actually a
farm offs I know they use just to call
this kind of I square wave but if it's
wave but is it square
I see sign my surfer is funny thing to
think about the word the word square
wave wave well but is this this format
of wait so think that you have your life
voltage level here this example is zero
and five volts in our raspberry pi would
be zero and 3.3 volts and imagine that
each piece of this chart is a death
cycle that psycho is a certain amount of
time so to do the PWM you need a real a
real timer to do that to have the
precision with PWM you need to push this
that cycle in the right way
and look here that we have the bureau
state and the one state the the low and
the high so in PWM concept you can have
the amount of power that you are driving
like a model if you pose a 25% of the
dote cycle on with the pin in high state
you are going to have 25% of the power
in in your of the speed in your motor
the
same will happen if you have like an LED
or a type of light any type of light
that you are controlling the brightness
so you can you can control how much
bright you want using this concept of
pushing a digital port in a certain
period of time making it zero one zero
one zero one
so depending on the amount of zero and
the amount of one that you have inside a
cycle it will means a power I speed the
bright of your land or the voltage
behind the thing the component that you
are controlling that way and you can do
it by hardware you can can be done by
Harvard or you can do it by yourself by
software so the same thing if you have
the hardware support for PWM it means
that part of your system cheap part of
your microprocessor with hours other
secret will be dedicated to make this
cycle and both the part for you and so
you just need to use the driver to
access that feature in your kernel and
your software will be just managing the
amount of power that you have behind the
PW import and the hardware will take
care about the pulses how did the math
behind that so Raspberry Pi just come
with one pwn you have different boards
that used to come with more PWM but you
need to take care
because some microcontrollers they have
six-speed Advan but they share the same
two timers with six PWM so you can
actually control two things very pleased
with a high precision and to control six
things just using two timers for
managing the debt cycle you need to test
and see how it will perform so if you
are looking to make a PWM in a more
sophisticated way or more professional
way I would recommend you to buy any
kind of driver for PWM like this one is
a very nice one very an expensive and
located one so you can control some five
boots this information is great also
this is a five volts I square C
component but it will be the slave
device and so what will happen is that
Raspberry Pi which is 3.3 volts it will
be controlling the slave device and you
don't have problem to do that you will
be here it says it's 5 volts F folds
compliant which means you can control it
from a 3.3 microcontroller so here you
are going to use the I square zippers to
drive 60 PWM dedicated ports so 16 that
is a huge one you have 16 different
types of servos plug it and we have here
an Arduino but you can change there we
know 2 Raspberry Pi and just plug in
your eyes Percy and just using two wires
from you
Raspberry Pi you will be able to control
16 PWM channels very very nice so the
most of many cases you are going to use
PWM to control servos but PWM not the
only only only way to to make
modernization whose modularization we
also have the ppm
the ppm is post position modulation is a
different technique very very common in
RC remote control at cars or planes and
the difference is that instead of when
you have PWM you will need one channel
one wire for each server with ppm it's
another technique for position that you
can use I think that it's a seven or
eight different channel so with one wire
you can give different position to eight
different components so here you have
this blog with more information about
PWM and ppm difference conversion okay
so it's like a PWM is single channel ppm
is multi channel I think that is very
work for hobbyists RC rubbish hobbyists
but in many cases you may want to
communicate in both ways like you want
to communicate from your raspberry pi to
the 5 volts guy or and also is a
bi-directional communicate in this case
you will need to use some kind of level
converter like this one from Adafruit
and we also have the
here we go the lever converter oh this
guy as you can see in the picture on one
side we had from 1.2 to 3.6 volts and
from another side you have 1.7 to 5
point 5 volts so this one nice because
it's bi-directional logic converter you
have 8 channels so you can convert 8
different pins and you can convert from
3.3 volts to 5 volts you can also use to
convert it's not so popular but there is
mal 1 1 1 dot 2 volts to 3.3 volts or
when that you've olds to 5 volts the 3.3
is very popular in ports and when touch
you is very popular in phones and
tablets so we have some new boards
coming to the market that they are based
on tablets hardware engineering so they
they use this this even lower level than
the small one so this is the guy and if
you are looking for the conversion to
max to use the serial communication and
actually even 12 volts to 5 volts can
use the max should reach you so the
level converter is something that I used
to do my first experience with that when
I just won a service port from from
Roger brinkley thanks Roger
for introducing me the Sun SPOT it was
my first Java me and device and I was
trying to communicate with ata a micro
controller the pure hmm micro controller
and I could communicate I was trying to
transfer the information from the
meter to the sunspot and to the Arduino
to their actual age mega and so I I did
some protocol by myself using three
parts one part for the data one port for
acknowledge and one part for clock and
so I was sending the data very in very
successful way always when I have full
batteries because we've the full
batteries the the the sunny spot was
able to reach this the the TTL voltage
level and it work at but without
batteries recharge battery start failing
and so I did a very simple level
converter using transistor and so I got
the 3.3 volts I know pasture through a
transistor and sent you the 5 volts pin
so basically you are going to find a
couple transistors behind this guys and
some voltage regulators and capacitors
and things like that they used to be
very easy to do and you will find many
different are tutorials on the web with
Java embedded and GPIO so Java is I
think that is the most prepared platform
for embedded because it's running on
many different types of devices and Java
is a real platform but we are leaving a
very big momentum at new boards and
everything so for each board it can be
kind of different to control like if you
are using Raspberry Pi you are going to
use PI for jeju-do with GPIO if you are
using Java me and
that you are going to use the device
access API because the Java me was more
prepared for GPIO since it was designed
for embedded space and if you have other
words mostly you will find I slashed a
bit / something that will means the
digital port so what you can do is to
use the Java your API for simple
manipulation of digital parts like step
motors and so on but you need to you
need to check I this information I am
Telling that I am I don't have any kind
of official position or at least I don't
know even if even if it's secret I don't
know but it mean it seems to be a nature
role that Java C II will have a standard
API for that and I like that it will
take some time to do that because how
the standard API that comes before the
hardware they used to fail so it's
better to wait one year more or a little
bit more and see okay now we have 300
different types of GPR you in the market
let's try to make an abstraction a real
good abstraction and make something that
will that will live in the market for
the next years so I think it seems that
I standard API for GPIO is coming soon
more information you must take care some
some Sun boards when you are using
relays without optical isolation and you
can turn on and turn off the relay no
problem but the pain
only thing that will be behind la the
relay like fan water pump and some types
of motors you can have some noise that
can just reboot your secret sprays thing
or just lock your circuit so every time
you are going to make up Rio
implementation or something that you are
not just blinking the relay you are
going to use something that will will
drain some current from your circuits
from your power supply I would say to
use optical isolation techniques so
optical isolation you can actually you
can buy relay birds that are red cones
without consolation and so you are void
to return without consolation the the
trigger to turn on and turn off the
relay will be isolated by a kind of ir
s-- i know internally unachieved and if
you have some mice returning from the
appliance from the fan for example it
will die in this isolation so i have
many many different types of problem
with that if you are controlling the the
most the best the best board for doing
that is definitely Raspberry Pi I tried
the revision one the revision true and
it seems that we don't have any kind of
sensibility for that but I my first test
with Intel Galileo I didn't have too
many success but it's to working on that
okay so it's not I'm not making an
affirmation that it doesn't work
it seems to have some sensibility so
that's the part of the hardware the
hardware part and the hard part of
working with and bad noise noise is a
nightmare okay and the other thing about
pi 4G last one
hey guys so I let you everybody go to
sleep and the last thing about pi for J
is that you have well we need to restart
my chrome will be first starting
Accession let me find the URL again
while I'm researching here just let me
tell you my 4G project here we go you
have the support for the raw digital
ports you have support for RC spi uart
but you don't have yet support for PWM
and I saw some examples in the Robert
Sivaji each verb this this repository of
software WN but a software control it so
some reason we don't have not yet PWM
read form for a PI for G but the PI for
G is intended to have a collection of
components because once you have the the
like a temperature sensor and you wrote
some code to read that temperature
sensor using IC RC you can make a jar
file for that or you can make a
component class that implemented so this
is a very nice idea imagine that in the
future we definitely will have a maven
repository for each compose
that we buy so it's very near to to
happen i standard way to have drivers
Java drivers for different types of
components and I think that PI 4j is a
very a very nice project because it will
collaborate very much for this vision of
the future but it will not be the
universe of API since it's very lock and
tooth to Raspberry Pi but the idea of
having class components collection is
very nice so here you before starting to
create your own code to control a
temperature sensor something would
recommend you to github repository from
the paddy project look if someone
already did some kind of like a light
sensor for these guys you already have
light sensor programming if you want to
control a stepmother this is very nice
example because you just need a for
regular digital ports and for transistor
and the diodes and everything the basic
stuff to control motors and you already
have an implementation for step motors
here so take a look to this guy before
start typing your own component code
java code so that was the content for
today i'm going to open the next minutes
for Q&amp;amp;A but depending on the question
since we can have many many
possibilities I would say that I will
answer using the official support forum
and depending on the question we are
going to publish there also we
we were here but we are going to publish
there and this is the URL if you need
any kind of support from us and my
contact name is Vinicius singer my
twitter is that be single and my email
is Vinicius at global koat.com dot PR so
let me turn off my screen sharing and
see we have action
I am back here hello and Q&amp;amp;A
central did a question about URL
raspberry Pi GPIO I think that you are
talking about the mod pi the the vio
documentation and here we go it's not
allowing me to answer for some reason so
that URL on your screen okay we go just
a guy mod my I'm home - blog so that's
the image you can download the high
quality one here clicking download so
you can print users background hangout
session will be available in YouTube yes
Andrew it will be available so once we
close here the your land and auto to
Oracle technology Network will make it
available but if you need any other
information more tailored like I want to
use PWM and with Raspberry Pi
give me a direction you can or make the
question on the community website or you
can or you can schedule a coaching with
me
are you going to participate syndrome
are you going to sell me to your project
we are looking forward
you
you
you
you
you
is there anyone online that will be a
participating or are still working on
your project want to share something
with us
you
okay so let me turn on my camera again
hello Vinicius can using we have another
question from Bruno can you show us some
example of pi for J using the Raspberry
Pi GPIO Bruno actually we did different
types of classes about it and I would
say to you to go to the the Java channel
at YouTube you have the lesson number 5
in Portuguese in English which is the
raspberry pi plus GPIO and we show there
are very detailed way how to use buttons
turn on LEDs to play with relay and how
to build your own camera using Raspberry
Pi and GPIO so the lesson number number
5 is very good for you
any ideas
thanks Bruno and if you want to check
this material and if you have any any
question regarding your project or GPIO
usage just let me know we can schedule a
coaching session tomorrow or Wednesday
feel free okay so car asking if we have
n ideas if Adafruit Church we work with
JavaFX touch events and Raspberry Pi
look I have to let me check URL you send
me I have one screen here that works
very well we've touched if you have
effects seen series people are like are
your your finger will be like a mouse
but you have some soup art for
touchscreen JavaFX
and like a multi finger mucha touch more
churches but this one I don't know if
it's available for embedded space or red
but if you need more information
regarding this is uh even the single
touch will work with drug effects and
dizzy screen I don't see any problem
with that but if you are looking for
multi-touch I can talk with a very of
friend he is a specialist from other he
works a lot with touchscreens
that notebooks with double touch support
and young effects he used to give
thoughts at JavaOne but I don't see any
problem with this display and the touch
events at young effects okay let's wait
more and just women
next week is the last webinar and we are
going to talk about Java me and we have
Terrence bar from Naraku has invited
speaker invite special guest and he will
be discussing about the the Java me age
which is totally cool platform for
embedded and the advantage of the
platform some new features that you will
find on NetBeans and just to remember
you that we have this last webinar and
remember that you can schedule
coaching sessions with me so if you are
working in your project and you find any
issue that is consuming your time on
this stage and just go to the the you
are the java.net
project and here we have our reference
coaching sessions or go to the Java dot
matches last challenge coaching sessions
and schedule your session with me I will
be happy to support you but in a
personal way so even if you need to to
sharing informations about your project
your ID or everything or even if you
want to validate your idea like many
people ask me is it too basic how is the
lab when we can validate here and try to
to motivate your creativity so any more
questions my friends
okay so I would like to thank you
everybody for watching us Tuesday we
talked it about GPIO and if you need
more information just go to the
community website at oracle or go to the
to the coaching sessions the name of
Oracle technology Network I would like
to say thanks thanks to your land and
thanks to Yara for being here and
managing this hangout session okay have
a good night or good afternoon or good
morning good day here is Brazil and it's
time to sleep now okay thank you so much
see you next week
