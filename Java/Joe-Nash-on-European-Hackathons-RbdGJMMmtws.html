conference my name is Steven Chen
working for otn on the java community
manager and I'm here with Joe Nash how
you doing miss I'm great thank you
thanks having me it's wonderful to be
here and we were going to chat a little
bit about like European hackathons or
functional programming or you had some
other stuff related to the bragging
ization yeah we could talk about
organization yeah lots of cool stuff so
let's just let's just get into it like
so what's what's up with the what's up
with the hackathon scene what's new so
the reason I wants to talk about the
hackathon scene it's because in Europe
is kind of going for a bit renascence
right now so in the United States for a
long time there's been like this huge
hackathon the same right so you're
talking like events with a thousand two
thousand people hacking away for 36
hours making some really cool stuff so
it's been some really crazy projects
that come out the US some which are
going to be startups some which are just
great learning experiences for everyone
involved and over the last 18 months
that's kind of become more of a thing in
Europe so we're starting to see students
get together and do hackathons for 200
300 people and really start to expand
that scene so is it like a like a multi
like a one-day event or yes sir they're
typically two to three days so they go
the many ways yeah and you like you just
camp out like sleep on the floor
absolutely well they provide in that
sentence and stuff so the brief kind of
intro the hack phones people haven't
heard of them they're essentially a long
period of time in which you try and
build some really cool and companies
come along and provide ap ice and stuff
to support that and there's a couple of
other organizations which are involved
in kind of helping grow them is usually
like prizes involved there are prizes
there's currently a big movement against
prizes vs surprises yeah some of them
very very know they're trying to get rid
of the UM the increasing level of prizes
for hacking on things you don't care
about issues ya akhi on stuff which is
cool yeah so I mean there's kind of two
schools of thoughts on that so there's
like a lot of social good hacker fungus
which so brain church you want one
called battle hack where the aim is to
build site for local good but then
there's also a big school who are very
into this what we call the learn build
chair model so you come and build
something which can be completely
pointless but you're learning while
you're doing it yeah you actually
produce a thing which is special in
itself and then you share that of
everyone and that's very popular
especially
amongst kind of like community groups or
people were at javas own very popular
that okay that's awesome so what's your
what's your involvement European
hackathons been you but run to them or
you like I'm a bit on all sides so help
you you actually do the hacker yep
originally got involved with your return
like your hands and start yeah
definitely originally got involved for
doing a lot of hardware stuff though was
a big old we know you and hacker cuz i
love that board that board is so cool i
prefer in general I'm kind of on that
Arduino of a Raspberry Pi side I
apologize to the retro pie no no no I
mean I think there's a good fit for both
so I was showing you my retro pride
project earlier which is a nes emulator
running on the Raspberry Pi so probably
a little bit hard to get a full-featured
nes emulator Arduino may be challenging
Shaolin idea well yeah who would be able
to do it the union could do that being
can do everything but I mean the
raspberry pi is really horrible at UM
real time real time I Oh stuff like I
was trying to to get some data back from
a distance sensor for one of my line
follower robots and micro second timing
is on the Raspberry Pi just not that
good okay I haven't tried that for that
yeah I can see that being a problem yeah
yeah so originally started competing in
them and then got into doing functionary
stuff through a combination of my
university and hackathons or and then
kind of a logical step from competing
years ago I want to hold unleash myself
and then it says kind of grown from
there so now involved in two
organizations I'm developer advocate for
Braintree and we hold battle axe as
mentioned and also I support major
league hacking which is a student
organization essentially they support
support universities and holding
hackathons so Braintree a big sponsor of
hacks especially the ones for students
in Europe and then majorly cakung also
okay so you've been lots of hackathons
recently tell me with some of the best
projects okay I'm like what was your
what blew your minds so there's an
absolutely amazing project which
actually recently caught patented by
Google from battle at Chicago last year
so they built a network of smartphones
messy you danseurs up when your phone
when you go on the drive it would detect
whether you hear a pothole map the
location of that pot hole the size of
that pothole send that off to other
users of the apps when you're driving at
notified as a pothole and then it auto
notifies the government that need to
come fix up our and Range Rover built it
into their latest batch of cars and then
Google painted to it recently because of
course they did so it automatically
detects potholes like yeah it sees a big
yeah there's the distributed nature that
was really cool the fact they know that
I do love it use of the apps and helps
protect their cars which I really liked
that's really been some pretty crazy
stuff this yeah as I'm anything from
like the hackathons you've been involved
in where you thought it was particularly
so we've k students do a lot of really
insane stuff one of the ones which i
still really like was actually Braintree
hack so when you have a credit card form
of Braintree you can add custom fields
to it right and those custom fields go
into the transaction log along with the
credit card details they built they kind
of exploited this to build a database
management system on top of sandboxed
credit card forms and they just
completely abuse their API and basically
made it into an SQL horrible SQL
database which is pretty ingenious
because I we respond sir and they just
broke our API and be actually works I'll
be it slowly so that's pretty cool
interesting yeah it was very imaginative
cool ok so hackathons are interesting
maybe maybe I should do more of them on
the bear actually it did I imagine night
hacking would be was loads of hack
phones in a bay area lately actually we
we did some like IOT hackathons at
Oracle recently but from what i heard it
was all oracle employees who ended up
doing the hackathons all right i think
we can improve on that yeah so there's a
lot of pretty students get some other
folks from the community involved in
hacking and doing stuff yeah for sure
now so she would run supply a retro pine
brasserie pie yeah yeah it's a perfect
example of things that anybody can pick
up and learn and yeah I do it's great to
get like high schoolers involved in as
well really good like potential outreach
possibilities though yeah cool yeah ok
there was another topic I ratio yes as a
token ization ok so this is one of the
cool things I'm obsessed over at the
moment from like the payment space and
it's one of the things that Braintree
does thats really nifty so we talk about
tokenization you basically have this
idea that you're taking sensitive data
replacing it with something that's
desensitized right so this is used a lot
in
security for various apps so you have a
users credentials in pursuit of token
that's fairly obvious like as security
implications are very understandable you
don't have credentials lurking around in
the state of the app and etc is as much
safer but recently been playing around
with it it's got some really interesting
UX applications and both in the
experience for developers and actually
to users so when you look at developers
for example one of the things that are
braintree delta-v with our sdk g0 is the
token is perfectly generic right so if
you've got someone who comes on a pace
for credit card and their details get
turned into a token that credit card
number is a token that doesn't mean
anything to the developer it just is
it's a token that signifies a payment
method but they don't know it's a credit
card so that then has some really
powerful repercussions because if they
come along to pay for paypal is still
just a token so this enables us to allow
all sorts of developers to take all
sorts of payments will that be credit
Bitcoin Apple pay Android pay paypal
whatever and as a developer you don't
have to fuss around with what you're
being paid with it's perfectly generic
token which is very very nice to just
build into anything you want an accept
any payment method but then as a user
this gives you a possibilities because
the developer can then has because your
payment method is securely stored they
can do some really nifty things so if
you look at uber uber a perfect example
the thing I really like about uber is
that I get in a cab and at the end I
don't have to care about it I just get
out on the pavement happens I don't have
to find with cash it's just done and how
they do that is because they have your
payment method at the beginning they
tokenize it yeah and then at the end of
journey they just say oh we've got these
payment details security certain the
server we've got the token that
represents that just put for a bill yeah
so that's an improvement on UX that's
enabled by tokenization and this kind of
UX implication of tokenization is
something that's really starting to be
exploratory now a lot of e-commerce
experiences and it has some really
interesting possibilities let's go I'm
excited on that yeah night that that
sounds definitely much more innovative
than arm Amazon's one click
which is also powered by tokenization
again so that's my life example as part
of like stealing and keeping all your
credentials in the background that too
but I mean that's a large part of it so
there's a very similar project product
now from paypal which is very cool which
is cool one touch which again use the
tokenization bit in or global ways so
when you log into paypal in stores like
a device white cookie with your payment
token in it and then when you go to any
website that accepts paypal any app that
accepts paypal you already logged in so
you get the ones that you fear you won't
be aware yeah once I payment from the
secure credentials you apply on the
application exactly yeah which is taking
like the there's a couple of neat things
about that so it's what we is kind of
this 2005 issue idea of the invisible
app which never really came to fruition
like the idea that there's an app which
impacts everything you never actually
see the app itself and that's very much
that idea because you've got the paypal
app you might never actually open the
paypal app but it's influencing your
behavior across every mobile application
you have which is pretty neat yeah
that's pretty cool no cool okay well
thanks a lot for Joe to chat on the
night hacking stream you can watch all
the interviews live at night hacking com
I'm also going to post all the
recordings same day so you can you can
watch yourself wonderful this command
