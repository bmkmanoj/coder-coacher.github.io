service we have the ability as
developers to take your good idea hack
it up test it and be deployed within a
day worldwide reach high scale this is
how cloud is changing the landscape for
developers what there's two new ones on
here OpenStack which was kind of
something that happened last year ish
and cloud foundry those are new
ecosystems around the open cloud and
that's the next really big thing that's
going to happen for developers the
ability to go and have a whole OpenStack
write applications and then go by your
Island the interesting thing that's
different from the IBM perspective is
we're investing in these open things a
little bit earlier in their life cycle
okay you don't wait till they're done
and competing with you you influence
early you look for the opportunity to
make the cloud stack better earlier and
that's what IBM's doing and this is all
being brought together so that the
enterprise can engage with its customers
in a much richer way okay and the way
they're going to do it is via cloud we
recently announced the IBM WebSphere
Liberty build pack it's freely available
for developers is this is not this is a
developer led pitch I'm not going to
sell you anything because I couldn't
because it's free so you can just
download it and try it and you can push
your applications type bush and up it
goes to any cloud foundry based system
so this is our first step into trying to
make Java to pass deployment as easy as
possible you take a Liberty profile run
it under the multi-tenant na JDK and you
can see that you know two to three times
faster startup and about two times more
density means you can stack twice as
many instances on a single machine that
you may have before without loss of
performance and you certainly get some
benefits including startup time a lot of
things I talked about today you don't
have to change your job application
right you just run it and it's going to
get better I think we ought to continue
to focus on compatibility
drive innovation and keep evolving the
platform so that your stuff gets carried
forward you benefit and you can take it
and adapt to the new stuff
