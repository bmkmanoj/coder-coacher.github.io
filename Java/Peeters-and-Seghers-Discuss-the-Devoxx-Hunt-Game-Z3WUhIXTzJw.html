Network and I'm here today with Tim and
Mike to talk about the devoxx hunt so
tell us what is the game the dev account
this year basically the game consists of
many beacons being deployed and in
Antwerp as well as here in the venue at
a box and the goal of the game is that
you detect these beacons with your
smartphone so you don't need to really
see them they just they just appear on
your phone on the screen when you tap it
you on bucket and you get an achievement
and with that achievement comes a nice
image some text that Tim helped riding
and yet Im you score points and while
you score points you advance in the
leaderboard and then for each point to
score you advance and then yeah you win
the game and then get up guys hopefully
yeah so where are those beacons really
all over the city I mean we talked to
bars whether we could place beacons
there but we also tagged for example
monuments in Antwerp which we think
people should see their inside buildings
outside there on top of roofs we really
did our best to tag the entire city so
there's quite a lot of beacons to go and
find there yeah did you get permission
from the city to do that no not always
for the bars for example we quickly
explained them and they really wanted to
help us out but there's also like some
buildings where we just threw it on top
of the roof or something like that so
it's not always as clean as you would
think so how is it develop what is the
interface so mainly interface is
basically to apps and then go it up and
I was up I was responsible for the iOS
parts so i created the iOS app and yeah
we developed
a few screens to follow your
achievements to follow the leader board
and then basically to be able to hunt
and the application will also run in the
background and let you know that you are
in the vicinity of a beacon so that
you're notified that you don't have to
run around like this because it's funny
funny stogie a guy already came to us
and said well this game is dangerous
because I almost got ran over by a car
while i was looking to assume so I funny
study there already yeah we actually saw
some people walking around the city like
this and we were like looking at the
screen and indeed they were playing the
game so that's really I we found it
really nice to see that's a good feeling
yeah yeah so the I know there are
characters and tell tell us like oh I
mean what what are people looking for
well we don't want to give away too much
but one of the things that you get
directly is for instance the rookie and
okay so that's a nice little image of a
guy looking at its phone with ? so
around his head so it's very cartoonish
and we saw people laughing one day when
they unlock one so probably everyone
already had a monarch apiece so Monica
pieces the little man P that stands in
Brussels actually it's a statue in
Brussels but you unlock that on the
toilet yeah so that's the little man p
so that's one of those those I don't
know if you want to give away any more
well I give away they will probably see
this after the event so I don't think we
can do much harm there there's quite a
lot of them there you have for example
going from a hard worker an early birds
who arrives here very early we have
lunch lurkers who appear to lunch every
day around the same time we have the
achiever overachiever for people that
have a lot of badges then of course in
the city we have like the monument gazer
people that go and visit monuments we
have the beer taster which we of course
like for belgium beers they're actually
deployed in side bars so most of the
time he should really go inside to
discover those beacons like mike told
you often get like a push message it's
not really a push-button modification
it's a notification really that there's
a beacon nearby so right once you're in
the vicinity of the bar you get notified
right and then it's up to you to go and
find it so it shows as bubbles right
yeah and the figures Craig it gets and
the more it gets to do something the
closer you are yeah now the technology
of ibeacons doesn't allow you to really
pinpoint where the beacon is but it's
more like holding cold game so whenever
you are close you're hot so so the
circle gets bigger and that's the only
thing that we can give right and that's
why it's very interesting to see that
people walking around and then and and
looking for that I'm turning back we're
thinking yeah what we also really love
this bike on the leaderboard we really
see people jump constantly and that's
nice of course we're just curious what's
going to happen tomorrow when all of new
people arrive and they look up to some
players that already have a high score
so we're really looking forward to
players that are gonna pick it up then
try to beat those players so and there I
mean without this course where is the
highest around 7,000 now I take Carlos
m8 or maybe at eight year because the
achievements you get you unlock them
guard away when you take a step but
their steps in the achievement so you
get points and the more steps you take
the more points you get for that
achievement so they're really looking
around and looking for more steps as
well yeah to keep them busy well they're
also some special ones that there's
people running around in the venue not
everybody knows that so it's moving
beacons so you might run into some of
them yeah we tacked speakers yeah but
also Alma the photographer she's running
around and she's also wearing one you
win a photogenic a few oh yeah beacon
she works which is one that not a lot of
people have already so that's a nice one
I tell ya yeah it's great so thank you
so much for sharing with us thank you
new game and a half an interview yeah
okay thanks thank you
you
