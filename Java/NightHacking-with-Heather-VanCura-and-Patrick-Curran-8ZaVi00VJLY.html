more night hacking at the DevOps
conference today I have with me Heather
bankura and Patrick Kieran from the JCP
hello everybody hello thanks for having
us for those of you who haven't done
night hacking before good night hacking
calm website there's a video and also
social stream where you can interact
with our our illustrious guests we're
watching here on the TV so if you send
us any tweets or set this thing to be
the social stream will see them online
and will respond via the stream
otherwise we'll just have fun and chat
about whatever whatever we think is
interesting sounds good so tell us so
tell us a little bit more about what you
guys do and what they give us the like
the one minute elevator pitch on the JCP
ok so the juice abused the organization
that is responsible for developing the
GSR s the standards for Java itself so
rather than have this done in a
proprietary manner by companies such as
Microsoft Oracle we do it in a
collaborative manner through an
organization where
MHP and a bunch of other companies big
and small plus individual developers and
Java user groups all work together to
evolve java and Patricks the chair of
the JCP and and i manage the program up
and so my job is to get the community
involved and participate in the job or
standardization process and patrick
oversees all of that and has been doing
a lot of work on governance and JCP next
and reforms and changing the way that
works everyone knows Patrick hi so what
are you guys doing at devoxx well go
ahead well we're totally nervous we're
here to talk about what's happening in
the organization right now and
specifically with a bunch of changes
that we've been working on for the best
little over a year and that we are now
moving into the third phase of these so
we have a series of three asrs which we
use to evolve the way that the
organization is structured and functions
at the JC apx that's what we call juicy
pillow nexus cumberland st a series of
three jrs another the first one actually
went through I've this one actually
first two done first one is there
another 48 and that we did very quickly
in about six months last year and that's
the one that said everything's going to
be done out in the open so public
mailing lists and public issue trackers
and stuff like that gossip and so you
can say a little bit how that's going oh
okay oh so JCP 2.8 came out last year so
we've been at it for about 13 months now
and
we have about 75% of the active jsr s
are now operating under those rules and
so the main themes in that were
transparency participation and agility
so we're seeing a lot more work going
out in the open its required now to do
the work in the open primarily that the
two things were having a public issue
tracker and having a public archive
mailing list discussion board something
like that and requiring that everything
be addressed and commented on as well by
the speculative eat successful that
means that people from the community can
actually see what's going on get
visibility into the currently operating
jsr s and hopefully they'll encourage
more participation as well not they can
actually get more visibility into the
jsr that aren't going yes they can and
then just this month we're working to
establish a sub-project under adopt Jade
adopt a JSR program which was started by
the Linda java community and it will be
about transparency so we're going to
have for all of the active chase ours
will have some transparency forms or
audits so Libya link under adopt a JSR
where you can go and actually anybody
with community membership on java.net
can go and answer some questions about
how well these jrs and expert groups are
doing so that the community and the spec
leads and the expert group can know how
well these efforts are going for each
jsr and then we can make changes as
necessary cool so that was the first JSI
of the three over at the second which he
mentions okay the second one was pretty
simple and that was simply to merge the
two exec
of committees which is like the border
to hell was that the result of the
recent election it happened at the
election yeah well after the election
was just took place in October we've
merged we used to have a separate
executive committee for Java ME and a
separate one for SC anika mind we smush
them together into one because the way
we see Java evolving is increasing
convergence between Amy and SE so it
seemed to make no sense to have several
you know speaking of the elections I
think I might see some people UD got
voted in well they noted it I think I
think I might see some people oh yes I
don't think they're listening come on
ten per second willing you in here well
then come behind the table okay just for
two seconds yeah so elections just
happened this year lemon java community
was reelected when we're very glad to
have them back and then it was an M I'm
like okay what I was chatting about the
most recent JCP elections which merged
the two committees yes and we happen to
see some people who got reelected oh
well yeah thank you very much hello it's
amazing yes well we're very happy to be
back you know we thought we had more to
offer than community over over the next
year obviously this is just going to be
a one-year term but you know we need to
do that in order to reset and to make
sure that we have one platform going
forward we feel it's very important it's
going to be a fun year we've got a lot
to talk about in terms of IP flows and
that's really at the heart of the JCP
and and one most important things about
the process so while i'm sure it there
are going to be some some bumps in the
road I think we're gonna get through it
you know I'm really excited about the
composition of the new ec covet
relations of course 22 cloudbees who
were the other winner and you know so
it's all there can be a boy
other prizes for winning yeah I think
the point is you get so bitchy that's
defecate out this works is we have
prizes we do annual awards over here we
have a party at javaone we can also
encourage you guys had a nice little
party in Prague to the hug was good fun
good yeah very nice and it'll be the Bay
Area we're getting in January for that
for the next meeting that's right
technic alright cool sorry to pull you
over no that's cool I've got to get to
Mike my talk in a sec ok sec go to work
yes thank you yeah actually we do have
our next face-to-face meeting is in
January on the west coast in California
but next week on tuesday we have our
public ec meeting so anyone in the
community is welcome to join us on
november 20th for the public ec
teleconference so any java please enjoy
it so this might be a good time to show
people some of the links where they can
find more information about
participating in the JCP alright well
let's see well there is an executive
committee project on java.net so you can
find their links to the current members
the public meeting minutes and materials
they're from a executive committee and
for the JCP next third effort jsr 358
there's actually a separate project
which is JCP next three project and
that's here and there's links to their
public discussion forum their document
archive and their issue tracker which is
actually the most heavily youth thing on
this project right now is their issue
tracker go Patrick streaming this ever
and he's got 42
shoes in there right now so that you
take a look and see some of the things
that they're going through and
addressing and then I think one of the
main ones also to look at for
participating in the jsr s kind of
moving off of the reforms and the
general JCP process stuff there's the
adopted jsr which is also on java.net
this is the project for dr j sr it's a
basically a wiki but they've got some of
the projects there that are being worked
on like first jsr three tens they're
being worked on a few other java user
groups that have signed up but any java
user group can participate here martine
has some talks here posted that talk
about how you can get involved in how to
start a project and down here which I
mentioned earlier which was the
sub-project for transparency so these
this is a link to the transparency
principles which are on JCP dot org
transparency principles here all the
things we talked about having a public
issue tracker having a public discussion
forum available so then they'll be a
link to these words I just I just
realized that um yeah we're still at JCP
Executive Committee slide oh we didn't
move well I can send out some links all
right good so send me the link for the
second one and all I'll put through that
one quickly which second one dub 358
yeah 358 but what I send it to you dodo
some java.net um just search search
java.net jsr 358 and it should be the
first link
maybe this one oh no undoing it oh sorry
but there's a link to it there on JSP ID
argh just the same thing okay
ok so now folks can actually see what's
going on and actually we have Tony from
Munich says hi hi Tony so hi Tony thanks
for joining us for you ok so tracker
here so if you click on the issue
tracker here once you get to the jsr 358
yeah you click on the issue tracker and
theres forty-two issues the view i was
doing as if you do a search okay i think
up at the very top and I'm adjusting to
new mouse here oh ok sorry about this is
the one I use at home but now after a
week here at devoxx light sensitivity is
also insanely high not search for is she
I could tell together oh yeah deed
search for issues I gotta yeah it wasn't
that view though how I got to see all
the issues I think it might have been
there was another link on the left yeah
this one maybe I'm uh open open yeah
there you go so
30 60 points oh yes okay so this is the
third of the 3gs RS JC bid on x dot 3
this is the complicated one because we
actually are modifying the GSP a which
is the legal agreement the people sign
when they participate in the JCP and
that's the one that talks about IP flow
and licensing issues and a bunch of
legalistic stuff so touching this is
more complicated and touching our
process document which is more about
governance and our own internal
processes so we're dealing with issues
like licensing open source and select
your property all of that stuff it's
kind of complicated and legalistic but
it's important because the foundation of
everything that we do so we'll be
working on this for at least a year
probably more Becca and I notice you
already have lots of issues in there hi
yes this is this is the most complete
possible website and we have a separate
issue log for everything that is being
suggested that we deal with cool and i'm
just showing the adopter jsr page which
our other went through earlier yeah
there it is and the tux how you get
started some of the talks we did at Java
101 ways to get involved and then
overview of adopt a JSR as well as the
panel on JCP next and then down in the
intermediate level of ways you can get
involved it shows you what what were the
transparency principles that are in
place now for all the active jsr s and
then the forms for giving us feedback
are still in development but the links
are already there what the forms will
look like so those are going to change a
little bit and eventually those will all
be fed into a matrix where anyone can
view how these jo stars are doing like I
said there about 30 active ones so lots
of opportunities there for people to get
involved in give us your feedback on the
transparency and of course you can
always still comment on the jsr s in
progress give us feedback now before
their final is the time to do
it cool all right so I'm sending out a
few legs on the Twitter stream for
anyone who wants to get more information
on these anything else you want to leave
people with well I guess I would just
say we worked really hard over the last
several years to open things up to make
it possible for people to participate or
whatever level they want they can
participate very casually just by kind
of watching what's happening you can
join the mailing list become a little
more active so it's your choice how much
you participate but anybody who cares
about the future of Java can no longer
say well somebody else to take care of
it and it's it's not my responsibility
and I don't think it's great to see
really passionate people I go Ben and
Martine and other folks from the
community stepping up and then helping
out with a open community process yes
yeah it's a lot more fun to have lots of
people involved and from different parts
of the world and in different roles so
we've got a lot of good mix now working
and we just need more people to get
involved and participate all right so
I'm you guys thanks for coming on the
show you get the very last two night
packing hey thank you stickers Patrick
all right hey it was great they look
great on an apple laptops yes if I have
one of those at home
