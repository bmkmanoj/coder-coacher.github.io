and i'm joined by car Carl Henrik
Nilsson are you doing car horn wreck or
Kazekage fun yeah Keysha fine I'm doing
really well I just had my session it
went strongly well so lots of great
feedback look I know if I'm doing as
well as you are after my session this
afternoon I'm sure we will be cool so
you were what was the topic of your
presentation the topic the topic of my
presentation were reverse engineering
why hacking your home reverse
engineering wireless protocols so we we
discussed how you can use relatively
simple computer software computer
hardware to look at the transmission
protocols of the simple home products
and a reversion in EM to use them for
your own your own products and your own
stuff nice so like what were examples of
devices like you know power switches or
so so my reason for doing this my
example that I have in my talk is I have
a car and I live in Sweden so it's you
need a car heaters so we I demonstrated
how you reverse engineer a temperature
sensor like one of those metrology
station is stays outside to figure out
the temperature and then if the
temperature is below a specific amount
of degrees it will turn on a power
switch one of those you know next kind
of like remote power switches well yeah
you couldn't do that with existing
hardware back then so I kind of even
figure out the protocols and just made
my my system pretend to be the remote
control and I demonstrate so what at the
weather protocol turn out to be when you
actually hacked in your particular case
so Melissa communicating with in my
particular case it was a binary stream
which were we did inverted binary one
sincero so it's very very simple
reversion here and in my experience it's
actually very very easy to reversion
near the older 435 megahertz things
there's extremely common in our homes
because there's so is it using like a
serial
like ferna caller it was just setting
like binary data across just binary data
almost all of these use binary data just
straight-up binary data for two values
for their addressing all that stuff okay
just like a single single data wire yeah
exactly sending the information yeah
yeah so relatively primitive or probably
fairly efficient very efficient and like
you said very primitive so it suits very
well for anybody who's like oh I want to
again when I get started I want to learn
how to kind of like reverse engineer
stuff the very good place to start and
look at electronics and the things like
that so what do they transmit a specific
speed or baud rate or yeah they do and
so I use in a nostril school we're
actually I use a sound card and audacity
it in my demonstration because you have
listened yeah and figure out the the
signal speed so I wanted to demonstrate
that you do not actually need to know
that yeah I got it like normally I would
have used a logic analyzer got one
anybody that saw the talked that felt
like okay I want to try this so I I
demonstrated it using a receiver and a
sound card and audacity that you can do
it very simply we justify stuff so yeah
that probably works reasonably well up
to a certain speed oh yeah and then you
might have trouble following the binary
bits okay maybe you can't have very high
speeds than your than your stuff then
you're going to need a lot of Gamal
Nasser and stuff like that so yeah but
that's that's pretty cool and i think
this this is an interesting topic
because it fits into the larger picture
of the Internet of Things which is a
kind of a growing industry trend
absolutely I'm actually really happy to
see the one how many people are here
talking things like the analytics of
data they actually like doing things
with all the data stuff because
previously it was just us nerds talking
about all the hardware stuff yeah liya
you can do this with hardware and that's
not really interesting because what you
actually would like to have is you know
all the benefits but yeah this fits very
well in because in a lot of the times
people will not have
people would not have access to a
specific ciders on that but there will
be a sensitive you can actually look at
and talk to and see what the data is and
within the thing is all about data yeah
when you have a bunch of different
sensors all contributing constant
streams of continual data then you get
quite a lot of different sets of data to
analyze and put it to something
meaningful exactly so good use for all
the Big Data technologies and
cloud-based storage systems and all the
different things which folks are
developing for other purposes absolutely
you have so many other providers right
now I mean like you have IBM bluemix you
have the eight royalty Swedes you have
Amazon you have your Oracle house phone
right yeah we're playing as well we have
an Oracle IOT solution I mean like all
the big players i mean even the HP i
think was starting to develop me
something I in Falaise in on it's like
everybody's doing kind of like their own
cloud solution so there's so much to
choose from right now but that's kind of
like the real internal things you know
so digging a little bit deeper once you
you have all this like automated devices
of data flowing around what's the
security risk for folks especially like
in a in a home setting well in a home
setting is actually very dangerous we we
actually found out when I did this talk
I think was in Poland and one of the
security experts came up to mean he
talked to me about I always wondered how
they did this and then he told me about
a case where some burglars had been
driving around in a van and just
analyzing people's remote controls for
their different wireless devices and
just driving around afterward turning
off the lights so like if people didn't
turn the lights back on because if you
turn on the lights are gonna be like oh
it was a bug let me ask urn on the
lights yeah but if you actually turn off
the lights and nobody actually turned
them on they knew that nobody was home
Sidious had a four-runner driving and
then just a couple other course that was
just emptying out houses wow this was I
just like patrolling the neighborhood
figuring out which people are not home
yeah but it can do it in so high speed
because all they did was shut up the
light wait for somebody to turn it on
again
yeah and then we just mark down the
address and the people that came off the
woods if the light was still off well
nobody's home so are those like lighting
systems using like some sort of RF
promotes air controls or they have found
people that they actually hacked that
these people are fairly advanced they
did it with both the the RF systems but
also with the wireless systems that use
nearby as zigbee got it so they could
basically any any automated lighting
system you had inside your house they
could take advantage and probably they
could also pop your garage at the same
time yeah there's a blog post right now
but people have figured out how to solve
the rolling key problem yeah a lot of
the garage systems use rolling keys yeah
security so they've they've packed that
as well that's a good auga rhythm and
they figured out so we're probably I
hope that we and IOT system are going to
have to step up our game yeah I probably
cloud service solutions kind of like you
really need to go up there and do some
sort of token based authentication like
yes it's really my device I have the
certificate because that's probably
where we're going to go is we're going
to be able to do some real security
because right now it seems to be quite
easy to crack and hack yeah
unfortunately even a lot of the devices
which they sell they're constantly
upgrading the firmware because there's
exploits or hacks are underlying bugs in
the india in the libraries we're still
using yeah actually read the this
morning that the the top spam server for
2013 were smart bathroom scales because
somebody hacked the the updating footage
channel and was able to actually just
upload a custom curt custom firmware so
they would be also be a spam server wow
so your morning bathroom scale could be
routing spam it was actually part of a
better job network something like that
yeah about network of spam clients and
taking over the world that's that's kind
of scary that is kind of scary but it's
something that we as an IOT community
needs to start and think about um I
guess some of the smarter people really
are yeah so for folks who want to get
started with doing a little bit of their
own hacking what's the what are some
resources are a good place for them to
get started oh it's a really good
question so I like I really like
hackaday because i like the objects i
really want to do like really cool
projects oaxaca days for me lights like
where I go every morning and see all the
new what do people ride what do people
do because you can always find like
projects there that you kind of want to
do something similar and people are
really good at putting the code on
github and I use these services you can
do the same and they're also always
we're willing to share so I think
hackaday is a good place to stop us yeah
so it's a good place to get some project
ideas maybe find some small projects you
could yes in see what hardware people
are using and then kind of find some
people to ask on Twitter or stuff like
that call any other future conference
plans for you anywhere else you're going
to be speaking in the short term yeah
I'm going to be a you know
well which country Sweden I'm gonna be
in Stockholm for I'm actually remember
the conference right now just slipped my
mind I'm tired of every five days ago a
princess now it's not java conference he
said don't net actually okay so we have
to it sorry yes we have to expect up
yeah I'm gonna be there for in February
that's all I next one I guess it's gonna
be some Christmas hackathons and stuff
like that yeah yes you might have some
exciting things to share for that
conference absolutely Cole was good
chatting with you Karl Heinrich and hope
you enjoy the rest of the conference
here in Malmo Sweden blankie it's been
lovely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
