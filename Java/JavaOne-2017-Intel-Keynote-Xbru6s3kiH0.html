hi everyone wow that was an exhausting
run to get here welcome everyone to Java
one San Francisco 2017 I'm very very
glad that we're back here in Moscone
this year for the conference very
pleased to see so many familiar faces
already seen a lot of you I see a lot of
new faces too which is great and thank
you all for coming we have a lot of very
exciting topics that we're going to
cover today this is an exciting time for
Java as you're aware we've recently
released new versions of both Java SE
and Java EE and this afternoon you're
gonna get to hear a bunch of things
about those and we're also going to talk
about some of the things that are in the
future direction for Java over the past
over 20 years past 22 years or so Java
has grown it's matured and to the point
where the ecosystem and the resources
available are really unparalleled in our
industry and while Oracle plays an
important part is steward of Java Java
strength is really something that comes
about because of a lot of people in the
community getting together working
together and collaborating in order to
to make it strong our first guests today
represent a number of ways that people
can get involved in the evolution of
Java and please put your hands together
and help me welcome Jackie and Mercedes
okay welcome so our first guest today is
Jackie Haynes she represents Goldman
Sachs on the JCP Executive Committee so
Jackie why don't you tell us a little
bit about the JCP and how it helps make
java strong sure Thanks at goldman sachs
we have around 9,000 developers working
globally writing critical applications
for our business and many of those are
written in java or run on the JVM we've
been part of the executive committee for
the JCP since 2011 to me one of the key
ingredients to Java's continued success
is the technical specification and
that's really unique to Java the JCP
provides a way for us to take
contributions to that and that's really
the key here the community involvement
okay and so that happens in two ways one
we ensure the quality of that
specification so that independent
implementations can be written by other
clients other people who would like to
get involved but two developers can
propose their own features to Java get
involved in a jsr and see that come to
fruition as part of one of the new jdk
releases my favorite example of that is
the date/time API that came out in Java
right excellent thank you
our next guest Mercedes Alvarez comes to
us from the Guatemala Java users group
and also representing J Dutchess yes so
I went interesting is communities or
environments where we can share learn
and grow up together as developers and
the J Dutchess chapters are precisely
that but for the female sector it's a
way to can we grow up and increase the
female participation in the community
and in Java technologies but the most
important thing for me about the J
Dutchess chapter is the easy way to
change the future because every female
that be part of the Jade judges chapter
and has
in role model in our society so we are
an example to what can be of women in
technology so we can inspire future
generation for joint careers in
technology and science we can say to the
world things can be done in a different
way and can't be better so that is me
excellent thank you thank you both very
much
as you can see Chavez value stems from
support and investment really across the
industry and just as java is the result
of broad collaboration java one is also
something that happens through the
efforts and the investment of a number
of sponsors our next guests in this next
section will will actually have some
words from one of those key sponsors so
I'm very pleased to introduce him I
think he has probably the coolest title
I've ever heard please put your hands
together and help me welcome the vp of
optimization from Intel Corporation
Michael Greene
[Laughter]
good afternoon Java one it's great to be
back you know data is the future do you
remember when self-driving cars and
talking computers were seen as
futuristic if not perhaps you should ask
Alexa or Siri when I was younger I
thought maybe just maybe in about a
hundred years from then this would be
possible
well the world has exceeded my
expectations what I didn't understand as
a kid was that data would be the key
enabler of such a futuristic world data
is to this century what oil was to the
last a catalyst of innovation and a
revolutionary leader of change data is
at the front and center of technological
advancements innovation and business
transformation across the globe let's
take cars for example the data generated
by cameras lidar GPS and in the vehicle
itself are essential to automated
driving we're looking at each autonomous
vehicle generating a box approximately
four terabytes of data a day soon we'll
be talking about data in terms of
exabyte points for what comes after
exabytes and Zeta bytes whether
individual users are massive enterprises
at every level data generate data being
generated will be exponential from where
we are today this is a total
transformation across technology moving
from a compute centric to a data centric
world it's an exciting time we view Java
as a foundational technology to unleash
the potential of data and bringing in
this new future it's why we're so
invested and why we'll continue to be
invested for years to come we believe in
telling
Java together will deliver on three
imperatives created by this data
explosion speed skill and smarts speed
performance is everything in a world
where the difference between days and
months can mean the success or the
failure of a business or in extreme like
cases and medical treatment saving a
life scale in a world with 20 billion
devices as predicted in 20 in 2020 as
predicted by Gartner operating XK Liz
critical to managing their data and
their businesses and lastly smarts
artificial intelligence will be the tool
that harnesses and converts a flood of
data into powerful insights and smarter
decisions increasingly these insights
will be made not only by people but by
the machines themselves there's a movie
about that machines becoming self-aware
I'm sure you've seen it so let's talk
about speed speed naturally improves
throughput which often leads to a lower
total cost of ownership let's take a
look at what intel's new class of xeon
processors can do for your applications
in this video
so our newest hardware the Intel Xeon
scalable processors are designed to turn
on all this data into decisions faster
than ever with the Xeon scalable
platform Intel is delivering an
additional 65 percent performance boost
over our last generation this is the
largest generational gain in performance
in the past decade for emerging
workloads like AI it means doubling the
performance of the system we've also
worked closely with leading data Big
Data communities to optimize Hadoop and
spark for this newest Xeon platform the
result a 3x improvement in performance I
stood on this stage last year and told
you that a decade of accelerating Java
has led to a 73 X performance boost and
that we weren't slowing down I also said
that we would continue to add features
into Java that mattered to you what I'm
happy to say is that these efforts paid
off when we run financial services
algorithms on JDK 9 our latest int on
our latest Intel Hardware black-scholes
is three times faster Monte Carlo
simulation six times faster and for
Advanced Encryption up to 20 times
faster putting it all together our
newest Xeon scalable platforms and key
optimizations collectively result in
performance gains of a hundred and ten x
over the last 11 years that's impressive
Intel and Java are simply better
together I hope you're all taking full
advantage of what's possible with JDK 9
on our latest hardware clearly
delivering performance is core to our
business we must also solve the problem
of scale from large data centers to the
billions of devices and sensors on the
edge the data generated are growing at
an exponential rate creating a couple of
challenges
first of all data has to be stored in
access quickly if you want to turn
valuable business
sites valuable data into valuable
business insights and secondly massive
transaction volumes require a much more
flexible and scalable application
architecture in a world where data is
king computing requires event storage
and memory technologies the first is
Intel 3d NAND technology designed to
deliver double the capacity at a lower
cost and at nearly half the power versus
our first generation of 3d nan that's
good but we've done even better even
more exciting is our new in to obtain
technology enabled by 3d crosspoint
memory media
this is our first memory media
breakthrough since the 80s
enabling up to 10 times the density of
drm with this new technology we are
delivering a new category of SSDs called
Intel Intel obtain SSDs and these
devices really fly we refer to them as
the world's most responsive data center
SSD it's easy to understand why when you
compare it to NAND SSDs it's up to 8
times faster with 40 times lower latency
well that's great we're going even
further
third Intel persistent memory will bring
the revolutionary Intel 3d crosspoint
technology that powers in to obtain SSDs
onto the memory bus in dim form you can
now remove the overhead of the
filesystem remove the overhead of the
device driver while keeping the byte
addressability of DRAM all while keeping
the capacity and the persistence of SSD
this is the best of all worlds as
exciting as the possibilities are for
this technology programming persistent
memory can be a bit tricky in Java
number one is heavy lifting to maintain
data structure consistency in a failsafe
way and it requires access to low-level
CPU
instructions to resolve these issues
we're happy to announce the availability
of the persistent collections for Java
this provides you an optimized and
easy-to-use set of common data
structures including persistent versions
of lists Maps tables and sets it also
provides low-level functions for
powering for the power users amongst you
we have an early implementation of the
library along with sample code such as a
database example using persistent
collections and a low-level API example
please check it out try it in your
applications let us know what you think
we're always happy to get your feedback
your feedback is a gift the demands of
exponentially increasing data require
you to scale across multiple nodes and
clusters to manage it all whether you're
delivering an e-commerce site a
streaming service or fantasy sports
league the challenge remains to talk
more about these challenges I'd like to
welcome a friend on stage chief
scientist of Alibaba system software
King some chow
nice to see you again Michael gray it's
the same to you yeah what can you tell
us about Ali Baba's business and you
know how you're dealing with the
challenges of scale well that's a great
question it we dealing with the running
with lots of java applications and
running about a hundred thousand java
applications and million instances but
before i talk about that i want to talk
a little bit about Alibaba because
someone you might not be familiar with
what Alibaba is about so let me get
started they are there Alibaba has a
huge ecommerce site in China in fact we
are if you look at the economy of our
volume of sales we are about the 22nd
largest economy in the world
right behind Argentina that's impressive
yeah so what do you do to address the
the challenges at Alibaba yeah is a
great question so in order to handle
other business we have we have been
using open JDK a customized open JDK for
our own needs as we mentioned earlier we
have a huge ecommerce applications we
need to run and distribute them not only
that we also got some help from Intel
yeah so we put several important package
about JDK 9 and put them down to the
Alibaba changing a system we call a JDK
and has been running very well so far
so a JDK has been used to support lots
of Java applications in fact I mentioned
earlier that we have 100,000
applications written by 10,000 Java Java
programmers we have a huge presence in
Java and because of that we need to
customize someone is in Java so we built
our own JDK and right now we are running
about 1 million JVM instances in our
data centers well that's a lot of data
and a lot of compute so did you have to
do anything with the are
texture to handle this well it's just a
fantastic question so in order to
support a scale we are we need to deal
with we we build something we call the
disability Ava's services on top of a
JDK and this means that our applications
are modular Java services that operate
independently of each other and each
Java server is running on a single
process is handled by a layer of
communications among them and these
distributed surfaces give up these
agility and scale we need Wow so what
does that mean in practical terms for
your business yes
so let me look at one example here let's
look at one single day in China in fact
it's even called a single day some of
you might have heard about that November
11th has been redefined in China by
Alibaba as the largest online e-commerce
festival it's called a single stage
because all these singles they have been
able to do so they go online and take
advantage of sales and they buy a lot of
stuff it's very similar to Thanksgiving
in the United States so let's pull up
some numbers and compare them shall we
ok so last year the total online sales
in the United States on Thanksgiving Day
Black Friday plus cyber monday the total
of the spending there is twelve point
eight billion dollars it's a big number
so look at China people like to buy to
stop in China for some reasons so they
generate sales in China on that day
seventeen billion dollars and not only
that in fact we need to process 120,000
payment orders at the peak of the French
at the peak of the shopping spree so
what does that mean so to give you a
comparison a major critical company that
at the peak of the purchasing they only
need to process about half of what we
need wow that's
impressive you know in order to continue
managing the growth of that of your
business what would you ask of the Java
community excellent so two things why is
the straight man I think so what is the
better the hardware performance the more
creative we can be we can distribute
newer services faster services so we are
very excited about all the performance
you have mentioned today we like all of
them so processes always sounds like yes
good idea on top of that we are also
interested in learning how to use
persistent memory in our applications
secondly as we mentioned earlier that we
are doing large-scale cluster deployment
of our applications so you will be great
to have representative workloads for
distributed services that we can model
play with and then deploy in large scale
Wow King 'some thank you take a look
we're sharing with us Ali Baba's
challenges and challenging Intel and the
Java community to do even more okay
thank you nice meeting you
so as I've already mentioned when it
comes to performance of speed I feel
like we're gonna be able to take it done
on that one we'll continue to ensure
though that Intel delivers the absolute
best hardware for you and everyone else
to manage scale using distributive
micro-services while we're seeing an
increased focus on micro service based
deployments such as the one kingston
described today there's an industry gap
when it comes to tools focusing on data
movement and storage within and across
the system that's why today I'm
announcing that Intel is launching data
bench a new data centric work load the
data bench early release code is code
bases available for download and
collaboration right now on github
while the proof-of-concept framework
uses Kafka SPARC and Cassandra we've
designed it in such a way that you can
easily integrate whichever components
you're currently using into this
framework our goal is simple we want to
turn it into a workload that represents
reality of how you really use
microservices so come help make it
happen so we talked about performance
and scale and now let's talk about smart
when I think smart I think artificial
intelligence society is being
transformed on a spectacular spectacular
scale machines that sense reason and act
can accelerate solutions to large-scale
deployments let's look at one
specialized form of artificial
intelligence deep learning it's
fantastic in that it can be applied to
big datasets and operate without human
supervision for real applications such
as image recognition analysis fraud
detection customer recommendations and
so much more in other words deep
learning can be a powerful engine for
producing actionable results but there
is a gap when it came to deploying deep
learning solutions on the same smart
clusters that many of us are currently
using
to run big data and analytics
applications I'm happy to say that we
introduced Intel's big DL solution a
distributive deep learning library for
Apache spark which of course runs on
Java technology here's a video to
demonstrate what big-deal brings to deep
learning organizations everywhere are
developing deep learning applications to
derive new insights identify new
opportunities and uncover new
efficiencies
unfortunately deep learning application
development often means tapping into
multiple frameworks libraries and
clusters a complex time-consuming and
costly effort now there's a way to
greatly simplify deep learning
application development decreased
deployment costs easily scale your
applications and achieve outstanding
performance with big dl big dl is a
distributed deep learning framework
organically built for Apache spark that
means you can more easily develop deep
learning applications as standard spark
programs using Scala or Python and then
run those applications on existing spark
or Hadoop clusters without expensive
specialized hardware Apache spark
enables applications to seamlessly scale
across Intel Xeon processor based nodes
on a massive scale and big DL delivers
extraordinary performance across the
Intel Xeon processor based
infrastructure by leveraging the
optimized Intel math kernal library Plus
big dl provides support for rich deep
learning and delivers feature parity
with popular open source deep learning
frameworks such as cafe torch tensorflow
and others customers are already
benefiting from the power of big dl for
example a major financial services firm
has developed applications to strengthen
fraud detection and a leading
manufacturer is pushing the envelope on
improved defect recognition
big DL could be deployed on a variety of
big data platforms visit the link shown
here to learn more can't get tired of
the bong alright
so big DL as you saw the open source
project it's available on several cloud
service providers as you can see from
the slide in fact it's not just
theoretical companies like JD comm have
deploy big deal with remarkable
achievements big big deal has a growing
list of applications and use cases
deployed we're encouraged by the uptake
and different use cases being deployed
please go check it out we're enabling
cape other capabilities as well when it
comes to AI among them is the power of
vectorization which we've increased on
our newest xeon processors by adding the
Intel advanced vector extensions AVX
avx-512 specifically it can accelerate
tasks like modeling a simulation and at
Intel we've been building this kind of
capability into our hardware since the
90s but as we all know it hasn't been
easy to take advantage of it with java
i'm happy to say that those days are
behind us and to share more about it i'd
like to welcome on stage chief JVM
architect at oracle john rose
good to see you John
alright so John we've been working
together on several things been doing
pretty fantastic performance work
together we sure have Oracle and Intel
have been collaborating for quite a
while now on code quality persistent
memory garbage collection and of course
the libraries and as well as the vector
hardware you just mentioned I have
thoroughly enjoyed working with Intel's
brilliant engineers and with on all of
these projects we have gotten there much
faster than they would have on our own
you know on that note we Reese has been
working as a pretty exciting projects to
give Java programmers new tools and
programs for Intel hardware will you
share with everyone what we've been up
to oh I'd love to
as you know Oracle's open JDK project
Panama was started to give developers
direct access to their hardware and now
we have a new vector API in Panama that
does just that complicated vector code
that used to require j'ni and assembly
code all that programming at the
low-level can now be done directly in
java for example suppose I need to do
some image processing I need to quickly
run over my loop with millions of pixels
of course I want to use Intel's vector
hardware because it can work on multiple
pieces of data at once instead of the
usual single piece of data this makes my
code run as much - as far as 16 times
faster now I used to write my data
programming loops in classic Java the
problem was it didn't directly use the
vector unit we should do something about
that don't think oh yeah in fact we have
in fact with the vector API Java now
unleashes Intel's AVX hardware making it
the ideal platform for accelerating deep
learning algorithms machine learning
algorithms financial services
application scientific computing you
name it we know that making it easy to
add vectorization is incredibly
important it sure is
so what does it look like to a real
developer what does it look like like
you I'm a developer at heart and I asked
myself the same question I think we
should just show everyone here what
we're talking about you want to see some
real coding real DIMM
on stage all right well let's go take
let's go walk over there and I got a
laptop here see what we can do we can
hook it up to the screen and see what it
shows us all right look at that now this
was done on top of the Panama vector API
the idea is to transform the color of
each pixel of this series of images now
for comparison we'll do it the slow way
and the fast way first I'll show you the
slow way this is the loop that works one
pixel at a time as you can see everybody
reads code here
this is classic Java there's a three by
three matrix in there and it's doing a
transform okay here's the fast loop that
that works with the vector API and it
does eight pixels at once and you'll
notice that the two loops look quite
similar this is no accident makes it
easier to replace one by the other with
this code I get direct access to the
Intel vector registers and operations
look at those V mul PS instructions in
there aren't they beautiful let's see
what it does all right let's run this
baby all right I'm gonna press the
button I'm going to start up the loop
and what it's doing now is the images
are being processed one at a time each
image you see on the screen represents
thousands of individual processing tasks
the gauges on the right-hand side show
how fast it's going and see how fast
that top row went oh my gosh it's
already finished well why don't we run
it again meanwhile the vector loop that
the non-vector loop the scalar loop is
chugging along trying to catch up why
don't we run it one more time you know
these vector loops go really fast you
can get a lot more done in the same
amount of time hmm okay so which loop
would you want in your application right
and you are seeing this correctly the
gauge is there show about a six times
speed-up you know this was really only
possible because we work together and
the future is bright for the Java
ecosystem because of collaborations like
ours thank you Michael
well thanks Dan Tommy John
it is great to have an incredible
partner like John and Oracle so to make
this simple we were really excited by
what we're what was able to be done and
in fact we're so impressed that when I
saw a powerful this vector API is then I
told my team we needed to get it out to
every developer right away
even while we're still in development so
I'm announcing the availability of the
vector API developer program accessible
today go to the URL where you will find
more extensive introduction to AVX
technology written in developer friendly
language meaning you won't understand it
unless you're a developer and you can
check out John's image processing code
as well Wow
we covered a lot of ground on how Intel
bliss Java will enable the future speed
we continue to improve performance and
our latest generation processors scale
we've added new storage and memory
technologies to help address the
challenge of computing at scale smart
with the addition of vectorization that
you just saw and machine learning we've
made it easier to use Java to extract
insights from vast pools of data this
was all done by providing improvements
and code samples to help you the
developer to quickly take full advantage
of the increased platform capabilities
we have an opportunity to usher in a new
world a data-driven world I look forward
to collaborating with you in the open
JDK community we are better together
thank you and enjoy Java one
