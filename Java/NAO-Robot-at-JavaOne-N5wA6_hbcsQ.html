technology Network we're speaking to
members of the java community and I'm
speaking to Nikolas rego hello Nicholas
hello nice to meet you though nice to
meet you tell me who's your friend what
it's known you guys awesome sorry it's
been a pleasure to meet you I had a kiss
hello absolutely you can have a kiss
well that made my day it made my day too
Wow Nicholas tell me about your friend I
really like him now his name is no is a
French just a French robot and he's
fully programmable with Java so we came
last year to showcase him but there was
no java on it and this year there is
real java sdk so we wanted to let people
know that they cannot take advantage of
this robot and start working with it
with java right so we've seen him dance
and sing and do all sorts of wonderful
things yeah I can do autonomous programs
so dancing but also interactions and it
all depends on what you plan to do with
him we have a USB port on which you can
plug all the devices so the imagination
is the only limit limit at the moment of
what you can do with this little guy Wow
and I know you have a developer program
right so of developers want to get
started what do they do well the
developers just join us and they develop
applications it really depends on the
feelings they have and what they are
they feel with this robot some of them
are doing just really great stuff with
lots of em shifting and so on others are
doing just simple stuff but where you
feel like the robot is your friend is a
companion so the usages that these
people are in lansing or something we
really interested in and that's why we
want them to join and come with us
excellent so thank you very much it was
nice to meet you and meet you both and I
know you can go to Alderaan all the run
robotics yeah do we have a website if
you just check Aldebaran robotics or no
robot on google or whatever you will
surely find us and join there you can
change this community CD excellent so
use Java to change the world thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
