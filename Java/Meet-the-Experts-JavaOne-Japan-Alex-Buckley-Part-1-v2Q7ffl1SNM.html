should really be working on Java 7 and
using it and operating as fast as they
can so good job seven I told him in the
tech keynote this morning about how he
went to plan B Plan B makes it sounds it
was like a bad thing to in Java 7 in
2011 java rates in 2013 but the reality
is there so much in Java 7 but we
crowned in let's say I show you know I
showed the project coin language
features now these are not big features
but they were explicitly designed with a
lot of inputs from the over jdk
community many of the features were
proposed by members of the opportunity
community to help programmer
productivity so there are very small
language changes in a way but I'm
confident as you go back to your own
code and you just read it you'll say oh
yes if only I was running on java 7 I
would be able to use multi catch and oh
yes if only I was running in Java 7 i'd
be able to get rid of all of this code
and use drugs resources instead and i'll
actually also encourage you to look at
the mayo to api the came in at seven
because there's there's an entirely new
and standard API for accessing the file
system accessing file permissions and
metadata the works chrome platforms that
people have asked for for many years in
jail for now it's there
Rosie seven so don't forget leading the
eyes don't forget the poor join
framework which has existed stand alone
for some time and has now been
integrated it started off back in jan 5
as job you took two currents and now a
moral oral report from and framework has
come in in seven so that's something you
may rely on but allison platform of
course there were hot spot improvements
g1 garbage collector I know the groomers
do unicode I can go wrong 6.01 now in
the platform against is involved in many
improvements and bug fixes in swing in
class loading actually if anyone's
running J containers and is very strong
Rose likes to say if anyone here is
torturing class loaders there were some
improvements both of the API and in the
implementation of fast loading so it's
not just language features its library
features vm improvements obviously I
know there are talks here McDonald's
jruby running on SE seven and using the
approach and emic infrastructure we came
to jsr 292 and that's that went into
java 7 the expert group is continuing to
work behind the scenes or improving the
API and the implementation so I said
that the job has had a launch the jsr
292 is the first time that the Java
Virtual Machine has charted its own
course separate from the Java language
so there were features added to the JVM
in SE 7 that you actually cannot access
from each other language they are there
to support other languages
other language of limitations large a
truly a gentleman so I didn't talk about
that in Turkey no because it's not
visible to many people I've even if
you're running these other languages you
don't obviously see what happens but you
should know that the language implement
is are continuing to work with or at all
or on improving the invoke dynamic
infrastructure and in fact lamb who uses
in both dynamic a lot under the covers
as well so in motown only kids you don't
see it but it's so if you get which is
which are you already the questions so
you're an individual member of a jump
community process and you and I guess
colleagues associates wants to submits a
JSR you haven't done you haven't so he
did anything yet ok so the java
community process is a set of rules it's
an arrangement between members such as
health and the corporate members to
develop the standards for java
technology and one of the reasons java
has been very successful is when you
develop the standard specification we
also have to supply a reference
implementation and a test kit technology
Oh tickets it's not optimal you have to
do all three of those things the rules
around how you get started how you form
an expert group
like minded individuals or companies
those were also changed very recently
actually and my keep refer to it in the
article keynote the 10.8 version of the
java community process for the first
time requires expert cups of JS files to
be over for many years it's been up to
the choice of respecting the expert
group attack they can be over they could
be closed now they actually have to be
open so you you have to have an open
meeting so this is what you're letting
yourself involved so you have to really
publicly visible analyst you have to be
transparent in your decisions about who
is on the expert group you have to be
transparent about your choice of
licenses or spectra implementation and
test kids there are the rules to promote
openness as far as getting community
interests I will encourage you to look
for a presentation by Martin Maher Burke
of the London jumping veteran who has
started a program called a dr j sr
pocket so Google fer London junk adopt a
JSR and he has a presentation on how to
build community around either / gin ke
product key actually for a JSR and lots
of the work you have to do to build
community around jsr are similar to the
work you have to do to build a community
around any open source project you have
to work out ways of people to contribute
to get on the expert room to respond to
criticism and crazy people show up with
crazy ideas look all of that
it's it tells you how you should speak
in public and promotional jsr or
conferences like this I know there are
there's the caching Jess I had a talk
later on today so it's very much now
with the JCP about being wild and
explaining and promoting the work are
more than seven if you can do that the
exit the executive committee is likely
to be very interested in the work that's
important thank you know their company
nobody better than you or me it was a
solo job Anunnaki comes to our and also
you can go much smaller change talk

g31 stated on Christine Chavo also an
IED welcome you all type O God because i
live in chennai talk to you understand
pattaya what usually go to cassettes is
not i'm going to make i'll have to make
this quick so this question is
fundamentally should java promote
structural types rather than normal
times the feature the feature you
request I have seen people say ah well I
declare type parameters
my bow line can declare a tight
accompanied with a name that I can
declare a type that is the interception
actually it's got them it's not the
disjunction is the intersection and can
java please have interception in Section
cumulative and disjunctive clouds added
to it we don't believe that exposing
that kind of type theoretical construct
to millions of people will work end of
story that's why I'm very blunt no you
will notice in project lambda we are not
introducing first class function types
we're interview where we're reusing the
functional interfaces predicate mapper
reducer that are everywhere you look so
I understand the question I get a lot of
questions like this why condos it is a
bit unfair to you that's it adds a
expressivity to the language but it also
adds complexity and Java frankly has
enough complexity already so that's why
it was very honest no hey Jeremy so
unfortunately we've run out of time for
your session but afterward anyone
there's any particular questions we can
feel I can help it translations David or
you can just direct contact and directly
but thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
