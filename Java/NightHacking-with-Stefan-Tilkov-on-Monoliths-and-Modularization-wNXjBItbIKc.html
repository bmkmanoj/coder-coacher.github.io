our our first night hacking interview at
the javelin stage in germany and i have
with me Stefan tylko and we're going to
chat a little bit about restful
applications and monolithic services and
all the old architecture stuff which did
you talk about so first I should
probably mention your your book so
what's the what's the title and rested
or risk to make them Finley cool and
also you work for you know to your
company what do you do in acute
cool right so we start a little about
talking about principle services so
you've written a book on this you must
be the presiding expert at least a
German hijo probably not that I think
basically become a mainstream thing
right now soooo many
read about this idea
for the collection rest
when I started out doing this
six or seven years ago it was really
outsiders not everybody was to be web
services to W a star way in
and Dara was talking about these weird
stuff that nobody wanted to have
anything to do that these days it's
almost boring cannot even rent anymore
about web services the w star way
because people just agreed they don't
even fight him and I just click on the
kind of the word yeah yeah so I guess
you've been part of something which
which has become mainstream degree wedge
one of how folks are developing and what
they're doing with Java technology is
certainly very popular for hooking up
Java backend services what other
languages do you do rest with so we as
I'm going to do a lot of java based
stuff so we we most often use either
jax-rs or something like spring MVC or
the other frameworks we did quite a bit
Scott on recent I'll be nice as ledyba
Scarlett recent days a lot of it using
clay and spray with us it doesn't play
with Java as well so level muscala
original java version personally I'm
more of a closure person I love Chloe
was a language I like press a you do you
have any background and listen well I
used to be a list fan for a long long
time and I less considerate considered
it to be the best programming language
in existence never haha it was never of
any practical use and that's changed
quite a bit with total image yeah it's
interesting that a lot of languages like
you know Steven Scala's reminiscent of
ml and Haskell and the functional line
of programming languages and they're the
concepts and even the syntax is coming
back winter the JVM where you have a
stable industrial application to deploy
applications which are built using
applications which are typically
research exactly one what one of my one
of my favorite things about closure is
that the guy who invented it which EP
actually succeeded in convincing those a
lot of Java people as well a lot of
original listening as a disability and
the letter is really really hard yeah
and those people hate you too soon as
you anything that's not you know
standard standard this stuff that's the
sunny achievement just to close out the
topic unrest any pointers you would give
our java lens attendees on a best
practices or things which they should
pay attention to what they're building
around rest api so there's a look
there's a lot of stuff that has improved
but in the last year so as people these
days builds restful services largely
correctly the one thing that most people
miss is the hypermedia so if you look
for a hypermedia api's as a topic you'll
find a lot of a lot of papers lot of
articles and talk about how you get the
idea of links forms that you know from
HTML I'm engineer applications if your
application needs more if your client
needs more than a single URL your
service is not resting so most of these
services and existence are pretty dress
will even though they claim to be cool
okay so one nut to our audio text the
background music is still playing on the
live stream sorry about that so let's
chat a little bit about as we could
loosen I think the comment oh by the way
if anyone is assistant is interested in
asking questions and participating in
the live stream were from the room here
you can tweet hashtag night hacking and
Frieza pointed out that he considers the
background music annoying okay we'll try
to get that fixed free zone so your
presentation later today i believe is on
monolithic services how to break down
big services or identify when your
application is getting out of control
yeah it's gonna be about that and a few
other things but that's the topic that I
that I'm currently most most interesting
this is something I see so often that's
why I think it's a very interesting
topic so how do you know when you have a
monolithic application you probably know
because it's successful and if you have
an application that actually somebody
cares about it's probably been there for
a while and has an developed over the
course of time it has been developed by
quite a few people because if it's as if
it's if it's a successful significant
application many people truth and if
they do that then typically you find out
that your original architecture is not
sustainable over the long run right you
build something
we find out that it is suddenly has
become two million lines of code now
that's that's manageable depending on
the language that you use maybe that's
manageable but nobody wants to have
systems like that right nobody starts
out wanting to build an application with
2 million lines of code yeah well I
think when people start building
applications typically long term
maintainability is not high on there
well on their list of that's yes I think
it is somehow it is every everybody
knows that if it's successful it has to
be maintainable the long run but people
think i'm just taking simple assault
here later right like like you have a
sales dealer you have a particular
customer need and you either are
successful or you're out of money and go
back on the street exactly so if you run
into this problem of being successful
then yeah then you have the problem that
what was what started out as something
very simple and very manageable um grows
and grows and grows and becomes really
really hard to move in any particular
direction when you start out the
application it's very easy to you know
just make a choice of the coolest most
talked-about frameworks and you know
wide reason just use all the cool stuff
and you just do that and you're really
happy because what you think you're
doing is you're picking something that
is really modern and really a
future-oriented and what you actually
find out is that if you haven't built in
a mechanism to be able to change that
five years from now or even three years
from now then you'll be stuck with the
stuff that was water in a decade ago so
I know any companies who have really
successful huge applications that have
their own persistency layer built in you
know somebody thought it was an accident
idea to do that and it was 10 years ago
15 years ago it was an excellent idea
but these days everybody keeps telling
them well why don't you use hibernate
well we we'd love to use anything
outside up at ten years ago yeah it was
a good idea you know and actually trying
to change that would mean rewriting the
application which is Sierra out of the
question for anything that is successful
because rewriting it your own to the
innovators dilemma you know you're never
going to be able to finish it in time
for it to matter anymore so you have to
somehow move the existing thing towards
a new architecture which is really
really
tough so um what's your advice for folks
to go about breaking down there their
monolithic applications so the first
thing is mostly rewriting is not an
option yeah so mostly we running is not
an option so the best thing is to not
end up with a monolith in the first
place so obviously if you're starting
something new now you should at least
make sure that you build it in a fashion
in a building in a way that actually
gives you some opportunity 10 years from
now if you are so that for example might
mean that you put in some mechanisms of
isolating the parts a lot to very large
to me that's what my talk is going to be
about today about how do how to build in
boundaries between the small pieces of
your system so that you can replace them
individually instead of the whole thing
yeah and the second thing is if you have
if you have a monolith right now you
have to pick one from a number of
strategies that may or may not work
depending on your situation is never
easy it's always going to be a tough
situation but you can find ways to
gradually modernize your application by
adding new parts in new systems and
integrating the new systems with the
existing one using a variety of
strategies and also think that actually
means that you're transforming your
monolith into that system of systems
architectural approach that I think is
the only thing that'll work in the wrong
one okay so as people are doing this and
you probably worked with a lot of
companies and products where they're
doing this how do you software
methodologies help or or get in the way
of breaking down your application into
smaller parts well I'm not aware of any
really established methodology for for
the modernization part yet so we're
trying to do something that something
called a I m42 org where a bunch of my
colleagues and I try to build something
but that's not not ready for primetime
yet so I don't think there's much there
in terms of development in terms of
actually building stuff I think the idea
of having small things that are
manageable by the by the prototypical to
pizza slice team yeah is is exactly what
most of the industries is heading
towards right everybody wants to build
stuff that can be owned by small group
of people who know each other very well
and it actually can
both Devon and operations for the thing
so I think the key the key criterion is
to make stuff smaller but you have to
build smaller systems so that you can
actually manage them and evolve them
with a small team and construct the
larger things out of small parts cool so
I know something else a lot of companies
struggle with is distributed teams
mm-hmm so having people who are not
co-located or working from different
locations does breaking down an
application into smaller modules help
with that I think it does it of course
depends on what the boundaries are and
what the what the team distribution is
right in the ideal scenario you'd be
able to distribute small parts to
different locations and have yeah teams
co-located so that's but that's kind of
a kind of a cop-out answer it's like
it's easy it easy for obvious reasons it
is if you have a more complicated
scenario um I like the approach of
treating everyone as if they were remote
even if they're not so in terms of doing
things in a certain way like for example
making sure every discussion is at least
summarized in a mailing list everything
that leaves it loser leaves a trace in
some fashion yeah I think get up sagita
people coined the term if it doesn't
have a URI it doesn't exist so you
somehow have to make sure that
everything becomes tangible so that you
don't end up be answered all of our team
members aren't missing out on out of
hallway conversations these are somebody
announced a release and didn't actually
present an email right so I think it's
much harder to get a team to work that
has let's say eight people on side and
two offside that's much harder to do
than the other way around if you have a
top left side then naturally everybody
agrees on ways that work with a
distributed team if it's if it's the odd
one out it's really really hard to get
that to work in a meaningful way yeah
now that makes sense okay so we talked
about applications I mean different
programming languages earlier yeah and I
assume most of the folks here are Java
developers by trade but also dabble in
JVM languages so how do you think that
affects your application design when
you're dealing with different kvm
languages
I think what you need to be you need to
make a decision what becomes part of
your of your overall architect of your
over long-term macro architecture and
what is part of the microarchitecture
that you have doing individual
applications so for example something
that I see a lot of our customers do is
decide that they want to stick with a
JVM so that becomes set in stone this is
athis is what we do we run everything on
the JVM not all of them do but many do I
mean if they say that then they can give
people some leeway in picking a language
to run on top of the JVM so one team can
use skyline one can use JRuby and one
can use Java close your org Ruby
whatever or JavaScript or JavaScript
that supports than the JVM now right so
there's so the common ground that you
pick here is the JVM as a runtime
mechanism and I think that's a that's a
that's a reasonable choice I'm not
entirely convinced it's absolutely
necessary I think you can get by with
picking just if you know a unix-based
runtime is the common ground but
whatever you make a choice I think the
key idea here is to uh to be very very
strict about very few things and to give
people leeway with the rest so you tell
them well you can do whatever you like
but as a price you pay for that is that
whatever you do you have to stick to
these 5 rules like our example it has to
run this way it has to implement that
monitoring interface it has to write
lock files in that fashion has to be
deployable in under 10 seconds it has to
survive a kill minus 9 whatever some
rules you make us some rules that
everybody has to adhere to and then you
can if you include communication
strategies and protocols and formats
into those rules then you can make sure
that the individual individual systems
can talk to each other can integrate it
with each other and you can also make
sure that whatever whatever the best
thing is five years from now you're able
to just use it to build or replace to
build a new one or replace an existing
application just you know have it talk
to the rest of the stuff that's I think
the key ingredient that's missing these
days and on the JVM you run you still
run into a risk of picking something
that is time for example to reversion if
you pick some binary serialization so
I'll say stick with something that is
standardized across languages or pick
something like JSON over HTTP something
that's very common and where you can be
reasonably sure that it's not going to
go away which i think is the case with
HTTP and Jason for the foreseeable
future yeah ya know and they're open so
even if they went way you you guys
support you actually yes and something
else and it'll yeah whatever fancy new
language comes along five years from now
okay so um we have the Java 8 release
which was just came out last week and we
have the big launch party for today and
it introduces some new language features
and AP eyes and things one of them being
lambdas so what's your what's your
thought on Java developers who are
looking at adopting mm leading-edge java
technologies like lambdas and you know
new API is coming out in their
applications how should they get that
work that into their their modular
architecture I'm not sure whether I'm a
good person to ask for advice for java
developer it's been quite a while and
that I'm done that in earnest I think if
I look at the features now I'm really
happy with what has become what has now
become part of the language because
there are a lot of stuff that drove me
personally way from Java towards other
JV annual JVM languages that's not there
and if if libraries and two makers and
frameworks adopt that in their in their
interfaces I think it's going to make it
far more agreeable to do that so in far
more convenient to program in Java how
more tolerable for closure it's
differently enough so that it still has
as it has lost any of its Mary terms of
persistent data structure always
surprised when I when I do small cloture
applications I haven't done any like
large ones at scale like you have but um
the equivalent syntax for getting what I
want to get done is if I do it right is
so concise and yeah as I got it elegant
and then he posted to some IRC channel
and some some somebody had cuts it in in
a third like it always drives me crazy
the people orient do it in even less
yeah I'm even fewer lines than I am
still I stink I think I think it's an
accident development I think it's a good
and I mean that honestly not just
because I'm trying to you know suck up
to the Java people are anything I think
it's an honesty very cool development
that they've managed to maintain
compatibility compatibility to such a
significant degree while introducing
those new features that said that's
really an amazing feat so he's going to
be along the life for quite some time
we're gonna hopefully the the JVM
language features like invoke dynamic
yeah will also help closure and all the
other dynamic languages too yeah I gave
it more efficient yeah I think closer
moon doesn't profit as much from it as
others like groovy or-or-or JRuby will
do but I think it's an awesome awesome
thing to see that the JVM is becoming a
platform for different languages and
it's it's definitely going to be a
player I don't think anything is going
to replace Java I don't think anything
has to I don't think we need one
language to rule them all I actually
love the fact that and thats related to
the modularity aspect i love the fact
that people can pick whatever language
they they like best whatever leverage
they find is suited best for this
particular purpose and then stick with
it and and still be sure that we now
have enough standards and enough common
ground for stuff to talk to each other I
don't think language wars are our a
reasonable investment of our time yeah
yeah no that's well put ok so I'll give
you the last word on giving some advice
for folks on you know i mean java landed
on our night hacking stream on what they
might want to do to get started
modularizing their applications mm-hmm
and then also just quickly mention that
our streaming schedule for today is
every 45 minutes or at the you know our
plus 45 minutes we're going to start a
stream when the sessions get out we'll
do a stream for about 15 to 20 minutes
with somebody on stage and then you know
answer questions or do as things as
appropriate as folks are interested to
do and then this evening we're hosting
the job at a party where we're going to
have the live stream and also a panel on
stage so stay tuned for that all of it
you can find out the night hacking
website so thoughts on you get the last
word ok famous last words so I think the
most important thing is to keep an open
mind without things and not become
too much loss or or stuck in your own
echo chamber right I love breaking down
the boundaries between different
communities and just looking at what
other people do looking at what the note
jay has people for example do what
people do in terms of virtualization in
terms of DevOps and automation of
deployments the whole reactive movement
the whole RX movement there are so many
things to look at and I think it's
really a nice thing to try to pick
whatever is suited best for your
particular problem and then yeah I was
just chatting with your anchor and he he
had a full packed audience for his
reactive talk not good so it's an
awesome again I don't think it's the one
thing I don't think you should build
everything in that fashion I don't think
you should f build everything using a
sink I oh we don't have to have build
everything with Java 8 you can a kind of
some variability and that's fine it's
perfectly okay to do more than one thing
stop searching for the single perfect 10
all right thanks very much Stefan thanks
for your time and good luck with your
talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
