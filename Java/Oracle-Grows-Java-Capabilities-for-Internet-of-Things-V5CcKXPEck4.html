president of product management for Java
thank you for joining us today we're
here to talk about a new release of Java
ME embedded 3 dot 3 with me today I have
J sorry our Java embedded product
manager Jay thank you very much for
joining me you know thanks for inviting
me so Jay we're here today to talk about
Java embedded me3 dot 3 release that
we've just come out with let's roll back
a little bit firstly and just introduce
people what is Java ME embedded sure Joe
ME embedded is an embedded black forum
for developing applications on release
low power devices which are resource
constrained so it's based on the same
jme platform that has been used on
mobile phones for over 15 years now it's
highly mature it's standards-based and
there's a whole big ecosystem of
developers using this platform so we've
taken the same jme platform and optimize
that for ARM architecture based
microcontrollers and other similar
architectures so it takes advantage of
the or rather let you take advantage of
these microcontrollers and bring in
features like loop power usage and
memory management and network access on
all these resource constrained devices
you can use jao ME embedded to build
applications for devices such as
wireless modules smart meters home
appliances wearable devices in
healthcare or maybe even industrial
automation devices so it has a wide
range of uses and it really lowers the
barrier or in terms of application
development and cuts down costs for
application development for embedded
applications right so this Java ME
embedded really fits into our any device
any market any size strategy and I know
we continue to invest a lot in
portability ease of use developer
productivity so what things have we done
in those areas specific to this release
233
in 33 one of the key things we've done
is we've released optimized binaries for
reference platforms like raspberry pi
Kyle board and Qualcomm Orion so what it
does is it allows developers to download
these binaries for free evaluation from
our Oracle technology Network website
and just run them on Raspberry Pi boards
which are very easily available and for
a fairly low price so our developers can
get started with prototyping
applications right away without any
expensive set up that's needed for
embedded development so that's one of
the key things we've done and the other
big thing is we've launched mes DK 3 dot
3 which includes support for m.e
embedded development it has an emulator
that allows you to build applications on
your desktop you can test debug or using
them you SDK and then deploy onto a
board it also includes developer
features such as peripheral I 0 axis API
which allows you to connect to devices
that are connected to your to your board
so like sensors connected over
interfaces like I square C and in a me
embedded 3 dot 3 we've introduced
features which as support for UART ADC
DAC and eighty command so it makes it
really easy for an embedded application
developer to create apps that can talk
to peripherals that are connected to the
device the other thing we've done is we
introduced developer API for monitoring
so you can now monitor application
memory usage and also logging so it
sounds like the introduction of 33
actually benefits traditional embedded c
or native developers as much as it also
benefits java developers who maybe
aren't is used to developing on embedded
devices but bring their java skill set
so where does this fit in terms of m2m
or edge devices and how should we
consider this this release for those
things yeah so I me embedded is really
great for a minute
asian development because it brings the
richness of java to embed app
application development which is like i
said traditionally been very see based
or even in some cases assembly based
which includes long development life
cycles and and the other big issue being
that once you've deployed your
application once your device is out in
the field how do you update it so am ii
embedded makes your device is much more
valuable you can really after your
device is already out in the field ME
embedded allows you to remotely update
your application over the air which
increases your device lifecycle so in
m2m it's fairly typical to have really
long device life cycles like industrial
automation for example devices don't
change for almost 10 years but with a me
embedded you can deploy our device into
into the field and then keep updating
the applications then turn on top of it
to change functionality that's one big
thing and we embedded is optimized for
these environments so we've taken a lot
of effort and optimizing any embedded
for microcontroller architectures and
other arm architectures so you you're
actually getting a runtime which is
highly optimized for these platforms so
that's the other big advantage you get
with ME embedded for m2m then we have
like I'd mentioned before evaluation
binaries for the standard reference
boards which allows you to just get
started with prototyping out of the box
so you have no setup costs and you can
just download our application binary
runtime binary for free and get started
so that's a big benefit for most
developers because it cuts down on time
to market because you can quickly
rapidly prototype and then move into
production once you're ready the other
big thing being its standards-based so
which is really crucial especially if
your OEM or who's developing on multiple
different hardware platforms and you may
be working with different partners in
the ecosystem the standards-based Emmy a
platform allows you to bring in all
these developers and then any great code
much easily and finally a shower
development tools are free unlike in
most embedded development environments
which use proprietary development to
which tend to be quite expensive java
development tools are all free and so
you can just use the free Java
development tools and if it for
developing any embedded applications you
can use it with most jel ides mes DK
works with many Joe IDs and so you can
get started right out of the box again
over there very good and I know that
that this also means by providing
versioning and being able to update over
the air that it's also faster
time-to-market and provides competitive
advantage so as companies are looking to
roll out new edge device based
applications that Emmy can really give
them an advantage in the market
absolutely yes well j something I wanted
to tell you about is we're also rolling
out something called ojp I or Oracle
Java platform integrator program which
is a program which is going to enable
companies to do their own ports of m.e
embedded onto other boards that they may
have historically used or find a
specific advantage for certain devices
in certain marketplaces and we believed
that you know like Oracle does with with
oracle partnernetwork that this is
another vehicle where we're enabling
partners to really take the core work
that we've done on Emmy and port it over
to other devices and to add value on top
of what we've done a temi in order to
provide even greater value into the
market so I'm very excited about Oh JP I
and I think it's going to be a great
opportunity to build out further build
up the ecosystem around Java embedded
absolutely this sounds like a great idea
okay excellent well thank you again Jay
I appreciate you coming today sure and
thank you for joining us today we're
really excited about the work in
progress that we're making with Java ME
embedded 33 if you'd like more
information please go to oracle com /
Java please feel free to download the
product test it and develop on it thank
you again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
