night hacking interview with me I have
Verner Kyle and a natal finish Trish
yesh yesh like smash that with you and
we're going to chat a little bit about
jsr is 350 for and 363 so I my um jsr to
real-world lingo expertise is really
poor you're going to explain to me which
jsr is wish number okay you want for us
okay then stop the 354 is the one about
Molly and currency okay I knew the money
in currency ap I didn't know which one
that was at what's 363 363 is a new unit
of measurement API for both m and s ii
since the where attempts in j2me in the
past that didn't really go so well and
there was a 14 se that was stopped and
now we basically try to solve this
dilemma by doing you chase are for just
a new unified chava so there's no Emmy
and SE anymore it's just one Java very
nice so what would you guys like to
cover first we have to jsr s I don't
know oh just do it numeric so we do not
reach the low number we'll start very
busy for EPS ending okay so tell us a
bit of money into money to jsr so
basically when you look at the JDK as of
today you have of course you have that
currency clause in shower you kill
currency but if you want you start in a
more complex manner for example in a
contextual way in the enterprise context
or adding additional currencies it's not
that simple yeah and when you're looking
at monetary amounts that all there is no
abstraction for that you can use pig
decimal but you always have to take care
that the currencies is coming along with
that number so that's one thing that why
we try to tackle there when you're
looking at the decimal format you have
also some limitations if you for example
want to format indian rupees you will
have a problem because of the different
grouping sizes and the third part which
is covered in each a sword and it's the
conversion aspects when you have
different current
is how you can you calculate an amount
in the other currency based on the
original currency and finally then men
covering the monetary amount you also
should have some some great make
interfaces for calculating adding
subtracting dividing something like that
yeah yeah all the convenience api's
which you you would have to build
yourself if it wasn't part of the
exactly jsr JDK cool that sounds awesome
how far along is it is it in the
proposal stages or do you have a
reference implementation or currently
more test suite no I'm so currently we
are working on the tck reference
implementation is there it's also
downloadable and available from the
maven central repository also from the
JCP aspect hair from the process side we
have passed successfully the poverty
view currently be doing another public
review because we had some significant
changes during the first public review
and it is better for the community do
you have a complete summarized state
again before we go ahead yeah but it's
already sent to to Oracle so I assume
that it will published next days if it's
not already done awesome alright so if
you want to talk a little bit about the
new unit of measurement jsr yeah so
basically the unit of measurement avi is
sort of in a broader scale similar to
money but for different quantities so
you can use this to convert temperature
from finite to Celsius which is probably
a very popular example or feet into
meters don't as as money don't know if
you can you lead us for your arrogance
you still have it converted to the
normal standard measurements yeah so
it's me it mainly for some of those
countries are like I think there's some
Africa African country that hasn't done
it and then there's the United States Oh
yes so this chest are the where two
separate ones that didn't know about
each other in the past 10 * Pinocchio
was called sensor API but it contains a
certain way minimalistic definition of a
unit it wasn't wait type safe of course
it was chi to amys or with certain
limitations then we propose something
for java SE that at the time because if
we allowed it to be added to the
platform and there were a couple of
members of the e C at the time that
thought all java is so big already and
they thought it was too specific so for
for the desktop java SE are roughly five
years ago they've felt that there were
not enough use cases to add this to the
platform so that case are 275 was
stopped well now everybody is mad about
the Internet of Things and of course
what do most of those things do they
measure something and then they send it
over to another place where you may have
a different conversion so this is this
is perfect timing for getting involved
in some of the new embedded standards
which are going through the executive
the java community process so this 363
is the first whatever you want to call
it but it's portable it is not so the
old rift between filing HSR for m.e or s
eee no longer exists and this is the
first chase r that is officially filed
for java embedded but both emmy and SE
cook and yeah that's the future
direction we're converging the SC enemy
platform so it makes sense the things
would work on but i'll platform
universally little something to show if
there's still enough time yeah also
basically basically what is interesting
is that also the monitors although
officially filed as the AC or standalone
chaser is from the API side also capable
for running on Amy we avoided every
references to travel more trouble text
in such stuff oh we tried to keep the
profile as small as possible so it fit
in a compact we're using cisco put them
in place at the unit api calls even
further
the the chairs are for Emmy so the ME
embedded profile has a lot of packages
that are optional and it's the same for
the unit API that a very small core
package that contains only a few types
like unit and quantity that is sort of
mandatory and everything else around it
is optional so if you have a small
sensor that doesn't even care about
length but it does it only measures the
temperature then you can basically leave
aside all the optional packages and only
you implement your own type based on
unit quantity and measurement and you
can leave everything else aside for
example if you have a some sensor out
there that doesn't even have a UI also
the UI and passing in formatting is
everything is optional also alrighty
little demonstration is based on Java of
exits it's a part of a popular unit
converter for Android called F deep so
you can download that on the Android but
this is app store and this is how the FX
so that's why I have actually done it's
not it's not exactly as shiny as the
Android one but it demonstrates exactly
what what it does so if you want to
convert the length for its own I think I
think this is you know in terms of you
guys you're you're right up there with
your hard boss the very best of them for
UI design yeah so as you can see it's
also localized to the feet the food is
already fools here because we're in the
German locale so let's convert I know to
meter and yes yeah that's that's six and
a half feet approximately cool and let's
just switch over to temperature because
that's probably one of the most beloved
conversion problems so what you want
cells used to find out go the other way
around ok well the alternatives on it it
Celsius to Fahrenheit that's 40 I don't
know it what was the temperature this
morning I don't know I don't know
probably 10 degrees something like that
so 10 degrees Celsius and as you can see
this is 50 degrees Fahrenheit
awesome so for folks who initially had
trouble seeing this i'm doing a little
stream magic to make it much much much
bigger so they can actually see the the
FX up now ok do one more conversion when
they've apps actually visible because
now I've made it full screen ok well
what else can we do mouse ball Rihanna's
it's also nice example encinitas
kilogram to what is this i think is a
stone what is actually the one that's
most common in in the USU is gone he'll
be yeah that sounds okay yeah so so for
example one can awaken the baby a real
world 100 kilogram because i have a real
world example so the airline will only
let me take 70 pounds on with me and
when i show up here in in Europe they
today they weight in kilograms so I'm
completely clueless sorry I'm a kilogram
not I take 70 pounds in kilograms so
that's 41-point 31.7 so if they start e
yeah if they stopped me at 31 if they
stopped me at 32 kilograms they say oh
you're overweight then I'll say no no no
no is 70 pounds it's okay I'll get the
mother rounding error between the
conversion while we have some of that
also as soon as you have your device
with you that is running Java ME
embedded or maybe child life x then you
can show it to them directly on the
airport I thought we could put this to
robe of you get it working on my iPad
maybe later on we'll do a hack mmm
that's the ipad support column oh yeah
okay yeah then it will also work on
target yeah so we can run the FX live
via robo via on an ipad or iphone and
then i can use it to scare these
security people away from stealing my
video equipment has just been filed it's
actually the ec palette starts today but
given that we have also commercial
support by v2 com yep probably not that
that
well known over here but in Brazil they
are one of the leaders in Java embedded
and embedded technology and together
with myself and tamil edit y who was
already respected inches are 275 he now
works for Airbus and even though he he
doesn't officially represent a pass at
the moment but of course what he's doing
there is also certain stuff that Airbus
is interested so in the future probably
a pass will also tell you in your
preferred unit system what's the maximum
weight of your hand luggages very nice
alright so we've covered the money API
and the unit appear API anything else do
you guys want to highlight no I think
not for today yeah I think the only
thing that would be possibly mentionable
is that I also try to drive forward
initiative about cha ye configuration I
will have also talked to the alphabets
with Aaron Gupta and other peoples that
are interesting in in in in joining or
in just joining a discussions because if
there is no chance or they're already
there they should just contact me and
come in come in contact for that very
good very good so well I think that'll
be a very interesting discussion later
on between a ruined you guys and you can
potentially start a new jsr to solve
that hmm awesome alright thanks very
much doubt at all you wanna come burner
thanks and enjoy the rest of the javelin
