manager in action on startup the Java
Sea security manager reads the
configuration file either standard or
custom called the policy file the policy
file grants some permission to the years
to see framework and to the services
running on top of it in our demo the
year to see from electrophile is sign
with the es SC signature some special
permission are granted to the framework
like read/write and delayed on the file
system in the policy file non-science
services are granted global permission
as an example they can only read the
file system execution of some Java
methods or access to some sockets can be
granted or denied in the policy file
our demo shows the following use cases
the first servicing is a final service
it creates a directory and writes a file
in it the second service is the web
client services it connects to the
internet to get a web page the third
service is a reboot service it tries to
kill and restart the Java VM by calling
a shell script which start the VM and
the framework the script is e SC C dot
SH in our demo we will now show the Java
SE security demo we can see a little
window with a create file button in it
showing this service running on ES to
see
we open the file system
when we click create file we'll see that
a directory and a file are created on
the filesystem by the service
now we are back to the policy file we
will remove by commenting and the grants
for the system to access the file system
and we'll have to reboot the VM in order
for these changes to be taken into
account once it's done and we click
create file we can see that nothing is
happening on the file system and we have
a an exception showing that the
permission we try to access was not
granted by the security manager we now
show the second use case which is a web
client service the service is shown in
another window with a button to connect
to the internet will first get Google
web page and do another try with oracle
web page works fine we then go to the
policy file and remove the permission
for socket access as shown on the screen
and try again to activate our service so
nothing happens and as previously we
have an exception showing that
permission is not granted to access
Google web page and doing the same on
another URL
we are denied access to the Oracle
website
this is the third use case with the
reboot service
so this service will kill the VM and the
associated application so all windows
will close then the system will reboot
and we'll see again the application and
if we modify the policy file by denying
the ability to execute the shell script
and to exit the VM when we try to reboot
and hack the system we are preventing
from doing this and as shown previously
we have an exception showing that what
we wanted to do was denied by the Java
security policy manager</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
