here in Nuremberg Germany we are in the
Oracle booth and we are with Tim graves
use a global solutions architecture in
the Internet of Things team I work good
afternoon let's meet you Jackson so what
we're showing up your component is the
entire origin and the things that you
can see it best on this graphic on the
screen here what we're showing is the
Oracle story from end to end on the
solution snack so we're showing devices
which are running us the Java
technologies we're showing gateways
which are running slightly larger town
if I the Java embedded sweet dipping in
here running over the network so your
uncle back-end data center now the
Oracle slack is really designed to
provide you with a very easy solution
implementation for transferring these
events to bringing them up but also for
doing a processing on the various
devices and gateways we generate events
we control the devices using Java we
process from in the gateway transfer
mobile network and then we use for
traditional I purse bag in the back end
to handle that process as well it's very
important when you're dealing into bit
of things to understand but it is not a
one-way process we take events from the
day with device we run them through to
the data center where we make that type
of processing a decision making but we
also have to be able to take devices or
control them from the data center so for
example in the case of medical emergency
we need to provide feedback but we also
need to provide updates Briggs off maybe
11 to unlock the doors to access the
individualism or an odious intestine
though I reckon doesn't sell facing
logical product which others the entire
internet many of our technologies can be
going together to provide a solution
stack that means customers only need to
concern themselves with focusing on the
business logic elements rather than
having to create an into a solution tank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
