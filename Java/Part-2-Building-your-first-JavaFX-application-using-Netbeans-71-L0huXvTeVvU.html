building your first JavaFX application
using NetBeans 7.1 my name is Angelica
Sarah and I'm at Oracle technology
evangelist so if you fall apart one of
these exercise you notice that because
we recoveried off the window the
containing window for your application
and it actually looks better because you
can actually blend easier and nicer with
your background but then we need to get
some icons that allow you to quit the
application so in this part 2 of the
series what we're going to do is we're
going to cover two topics the first one
is actually how to how to handle events
and the second one is how to do binding
so let's get it started so the first
thing that I want to do is I want to
bring up at the close icon so we can
actually close application so whenever
you click into it we're going to close
the application select me go back to the
see application we're going to create
another image view that is going to be
the X the exit it's going to be my quit
button ok going back to going back to my
start area what I can do is I can create
my quit button again it's going to be an
image view you could remember you can
always click control space it will bring
up the options that you have again
you're going to bring a new image
control space and from that image we're
gonna bring my resources and so it's my
seat up take your class and then you get
resources as a stream and in this case
we're getting from my images directory
we go in close I conduct PNG image okay
and now some we set some properties for
the quit button so we set for example
the height let's say the height
25 we can also set the web and let's say
it's also going to be 25 and let's also
position it on the screen remember we're
doing an absolute positioning so we can
actually set the x coordinate to be 270
and we can also set the y coordinate to
be 10 so we we actually places in the
upper right corner okay so we declare we
need to add it and so one thing is um
make sure in when you add the children's
there are two options when you're adding
only one component to your tree you can
say add okay so you can use this method
if you want to add multiple component
multiple and nose to your tree you need
to use the add also you can actually get
several at this get several added two at
the same time so we need to add C and
then we add quit on top of it it's okay
we have the image and let's make sure
it's being displayed in the right
position of your image of your
application okay so pretty nice we got
it here not much happening just an extra
image we want to close the application
whenever I hit this image so let me just
again close my app and we're going to go
for the quit and we're actually going to
define some method so we're going to use
the set own Mouse events okay and the
ones that I need is when mouse is
clicking so we select on mouse click
Edit and you see that we need a
suspecting an event handler so we can
create a new event handler again
controller space can also give you um
fill out for you and so we need a mouse
event again controller spell will
actually populate with what are the
methods that you need to
implement so we add the handle method in
this case all we need to do is I'm gonna
call system and I'm just going to accept
within startups of 0 ok so pretty simple
so what we're doing is we're now handle
is the mouse click events and we do
receive a mouse event and this is going
to be the handler for these events so
whenever we receive a mouse event from
this quit we're going to execute the
handle method of this event handler and
right here which is doing
we're just quitting the application so
if we run it hopefully you can actually
click and you can actually quit the
application ok pretty good one cool
trick that we have all with NetBeans is
the possibility to refactor your code so
as we are adding some code into the
application you can notice that it's
going to be it's going to be getting
like a little bit busier and so we can
actually select for example this quick
button we're not going to we don't need
to do anything else with it
we just need to image we need to
position give it predefined size and
then we already have the event handler
for that so we can actually take it
outside the start method so it doesn't
get to be see so you can right click to
it and you can set refactor and within
refactor and there is m1a option that is
to extract that particular code and
moving into a new method so let me just
try to click it a little bit higher so
you can actually you can actually see in
the video so introduce a method is
actually still not right there so let me
try a little bit higher click refactor
introduce a method and think still not
visible so let me just introduce some
spaces here put it all the way up
right click now you can see okay so when
you do refactor one of the options that
you have is introduce a method so we can
actually introduce a method we're going
to make leave at the private by default
and we're gonna say quit button let's
call it set wait okay so what is going
to do is is going to distract my code
and put it into a separate method called
set quick and in the method the start
method it actually added the appropriate
method call for that okay okay so we
already create an extra button an image
define some you know size and position
it and then the mouse events so now I'm
moving on at let's talk about binding so
before we introduce binding let me talk
a little bit about what is going on so
what we want to do is we wanna when we
run the application you remember that
the image was actually pretty long image
and we're it's actually pretty long one
we also only see in a part of the image
through this particular clip but you
know that underneath there is a much
longer image what I want to do is I want
to bind I want to kind of connect the
mouse coordinates of the dragon event
with the coordinate of the image so I
can actually click my push mm mount do a
mouse down and drag the image alone as I
move the mouse okay there are few things
that we need to introduce we internet
introduce some variables so let me look
into one graphic that I have here to
explain a little bit so this is your
image right it's pretty long and this is
the viewing area through the click what
is going to happen is the image has a
particular position right here okay in
this case image x-coordinate okay and
we're going to make a mouse press within
this viewing area so let's say i mouse
press
in here so there there is a difference
from this point that I did the clicking
to the origin position of the image and
we're going to call that X step that
distance let's say SX okay what happened
is as I drag the mouse around so in this
case I was originally around here when I
move it when I drag it over here I need
to slice down also the image I want to
drag the image along with the mouse but
remember we need to keep that distance
that SX distance from my original
clicking position to the origin of the
image so there are a couple of things we
need to move the image around but we
need to know what is the distance
between the x-coordinate of the mouse
event compared to this position here
okay so we need to keep that
relationship is not just updating the
image with my x-coordinate of the mouse
so we're going to need two things we're
going to need the coordinate the
position for the image and I'm going to
need the distance before where I did the
click in to that origin okay so let's go
back so first we're going to define some
some things here so we're going to use
two doubles for that so we're going to
have a private double and we call it s X
okay and we're going to have it
originally defined the clear pipe
defined by zero okay another double one
okay
in this case let's call it coordinate X
real so this is the real x coordinate
and also we're gonna use zero as the
default value okay so what I want to do
now is we're going to do some binding so
what exactly is binding how do we define
binding so by
is just a mechanism for expressing
relationship between two variables so
when one of the participating value
variables in this binding change the
other one is going to be automatically
updated okay so this is actually very
convenient for example when you're doing
model-view-controller kind of paradigm
because what we want to do this we want
to maintain unsink your view with your
mana okay so you can bind the model with
your views whenever you change your
model the view is going to be
automatically updated and you can do
double binding bi-directional binding so
it will work both ways when you update
the UI is going to be updating your
model too
so let's see how we can actually do some
binding so few things that we need to do
so we we're talking about two events
that we need to listen to we need to
listen into the mousepressed so we find
out what it what is that SX distance
that we were talking that's the first
one and we need to listen to the dragon
event so I would need to listen to the
drugs as I move the mouse so we'll
update the coordinate of my image okay
so let's do that so we're going to work
with the image so we need to set own
mouse pressed okay and we need a new
given handler okay in this case is going
to be C oh I select the dick point one
okay that's why it's actually giving me
a key event set on so the mouse press
there is we have a new event hundred
okay's and now we have a mouse event
controller space and we have the hunger
okay so what do we need to do here we
need to actually find out what is that
X the distance that will actually
explain a little bit so what this SX is
going to be my x-coordinate of the event
- the real coordinate of the image
I'll did I define it it i/o coordinate
okay on to the space now you find it so
it's just whenever I click it - the real
position and of the image okay now let's
do side own Mouse drag so same thing
you'll even hundred
okay Mouse event on to the space it will
populate it for you okay and now what I
want to do is that one up once I know
that s X distance I can go ahead and
update the coordinate real coordinate of
the image as I drag the mouse so
coordinate X real it's going to be again
whenever I'm dragging to - keeping that
distance
- s X okay so now we know what is going
to be recording it the real coordinate
of the image now we need to bind this
one to the c0x position okay for binding
normally we use properties and so we
whenever we're going to be using a
binding we use these properties as the
source of those bindings so properties
we're going to find from pretty much
properties for all the primitive
datatypes in java we also are going to
find properties for also object and
strings okay so what I want to do so if
I want to observe so we need to watch
out whenever coordinate x real change
we wanted to make this object observable
so others can actually watch it as it
change okay so instead of a simple
double what we're going to do is we're
going to declare as a double property so
it's actually an observable object and
still a double is just it's just a
property that we need to use instead so
I'm going to change it for double
property okay and we are going to define
as a new one of the double properties is
the simple double property and we
initialize it with zero okay so it's
pretty much the same but instead of just
using a plain double we're going to use
a double property and this will be a
double that is actually observable okay
let me change this name we can actually
keep it so let's give it so what is
going to happen now because we are
talking about properties not double to
be able to get the value of the property
you actually need to make a method call
get Valley now to set it instead of just
saying equal you need to set the value
okay so we're going to set the value by
using this equation okay so it's pretty
much the same thing just because we're
using properties now so we need to do
method calls okay for getting the value
under setting the pound
okay so we're we're in good shape we
already define the two variables that we
needed SX to maintain that distance we
need the real coordinate of the image
and we already defined we're ready
listening to the press event and
mousetrap event all I need to do is
define the binding so the binding is
what is going to happen we want c0 to be
able to bind c0 the x coordinate of s0
okay so the X property of C serum is
going to be bind without a servable
value in this case observable value is
14:8 three okay so whenever coordinate X
real change is going to update the X
property of Z zero okay so let's run to
see if it actually works
okay so your mouse press press it and
then you can actually drop your image
alone see how there is not any jumping
or anything you can nicely go all the
way to the end to your image and drag it
so very useful when you bind different
properties in your application okay and
one more thing so now again I'm going to
do some cleaning of the code so let me
bring it all the way up so I can
actually get this binding out of this
into a method so I can actually refactor
and we can introduce again a method in
this case let's call this method set in
set draw it okay
and again always going to do is it
actually took all my code into a new
method set drag and make the appropriate
calls into the star method so it doesn't
get too crowded run it one more time
make sure everything is still working
and we're ready for part three of these
exercises okay so still working and I
can't quit
okay so let's continue with this
exercises part number three and let's
keep building more interest in staff
using java fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
