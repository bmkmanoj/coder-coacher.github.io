revolutionary java is back lambda
represents that represents it is the
single largest upgrade to the
programming model ever its larger even
than generics it's the first time since
the beginning of java that we have done
a carefully coordinated court
coevolution of the virtual machine the
language and the libraries all together
yet the result still feels like java
this is something that's going to change
the way we all program in java every day
and the reason for that is programming
well is about finding the right
abstractions we want the code that we
write to look like the problem statement
that it's trying to solve so that way
you look at it and you immediately know
it's correct now java has always given
us good tools for abstracting over data
types but where i really wanted to do
better is for abstracting over patterns
of behavior and that's where lambda
comes in right now is a great time to
download JDK 8 and take it for a spin so
this is a homemade DIY tablet based on
the Raspberry Pi that we've been working
on we have the 10 inch touchscreen and
display controller from chalkboard
electronics and then we have a USB
battery pack that's powering it all we
have a raspberry pi camera we also have
a gyro accelerometer magnetometer so we
have a compass and do tilt and that sort
of stuff we also have a USB hub for
extra peripherals you can plug a
keyboard and mouse and stuff in we even
have a GPIO port so you can plug in
robots and all kinds of fun things all
the things you can't do an iPad and best
things you build it yourself another
thing about Java is that it's bigger
than Oracle job is not just about oracle
oracle and a few other large companies
it's about companies small and large and
above all it's about developers it's
about individual developers so i think
every developer who's helped java grow
over all these years through thick and
thin i invoke though invite those who
haven't yet been involved to join us to
make the future java
e
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
