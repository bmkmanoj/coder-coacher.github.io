in the wilderkin Tanners I'm Paul
Sanders I'm a member of Java platform
team and I hack on the core libraries
java language and hotspots so let's get
into this presentation
okay the jhen for half a day is just two
things one I'm going to talk about
running jdk 9 and docker containers and
the second part is I'm going to be
reducing the size of JDK 9 in docker
images so I'm going to present some
slides and I'm going to present some
demos on these two aspects before I get
into that I just like to point out that
Java 8 docker images are available for
download you can see the links here if
you want to try those out so let's get
into the first part of a presentation
running JDK 9 in docker containers so
we've we've done a bunch of improvements
in JDK 9 to honor resource constraints
in docker when you run a docker
container it can be constrained in terms
of memory and how many CPU sirs have so
the first one we we respect now is si
group memory limits that have been set
by the container and we've added an
experimental flag here you can see use
see group memory limit for heap this is
experimental at the moment and we hope
that you'll be able to get experience
running this and then we will switch it
over to a default setting later on when
we're comfortable we got this right
another area that the JDK now respects
is some CPU constraint set for the
container for example runtime available
processors will now report their correct
number of CPUs in the container
previously used to report the CPUs of
the host itself and also we've done some
fixes to the JVM to make it more stable
when resources change for example the
jiwon garbage collector now operates on
active CPU can't discover that JVM
startup and not the active CPU count at
any time it decides it wants to query it
because G 1 needs to size stuff at JVM
start up correctly based on cpu count it
sees an ongoing proven so planned for a
future release we have a draft JEP in
the works and container aware Java and
we would plan to do a number of
enhancements here for example evaluating
further support for docker runtime
flags you see therefore cpu quotas in
this there's a lot of work we can do
here to improve how Java works but now
I'm going to switch to a little demo
here and show the resource constraints
in action so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to run a Java process in a docker
container docker image sorry containing
Java 9 build and I'm going to run J
shell as the Java process so let's just
go ahead and run that so what I'm doing
is I'm running J shell in a docker
container it's running Java 9 and we're
going to query the the CPU constraint
CPU limits and memory limits to see
what's office if first of all I'm
running doc without any constraints it's
just going to run what the defaults are
and and what the host offers up to it so
we using the runtime get available
processors we can see that we it reports
this full process is available by
default I've also added some snippets to
JCL to query the memory limits of both
the the Java Runtime and also what's
reported by the C groups and in in the
second case we see unload unloading up a
file here which contains the the the
limit in terms of memory that docker
container has here so remember I'm
running J shell in a container here so
if we run the system memory limit let's
see what let's see what it offers and it
reports it back in megabytes here's as I
said that's a huge number basically it's
saying docker containers think I don't
care I whatever the host offers me I
will try and use up as much as possible
if we look at the the job and limit here
for max memory what we have was we is
selecting a 500 megabyte default here so
that's with no limits whatsoever set so
if we switch back and we run a container
and instead what we're going to do is
going to limit the docker container to
384 megabytes and limit it so that it
spin to CPU zero so basically one CPU so
let's see what happens when we run that
again it's running J shell in a
container here
let's get the available processes now we
only have one processor available
compared to four before because we set
the restrictor the number of CPU so
that's working correctly now let's just
check the system max memory we see it's
384 because we limited it in the command
here like so now let's check for Java
memory limits here you see well we see
that Java is ignoring that constraint in
docker
and it's actually trying to grab more
memory than is available in the
container
now when Java tries to allocate ball
memory like this it I think it depends
on the policy of how you run your docker
containers whether the Java process is
killed or not as soon as it runs out of
memory and swap so how do we fix this so
we can use the options that I showed
earlier the experimental options that we
pass into hotspot now you notice they're
expressed twice here because of the way
the implementation Civics of JCL
actually runs to java processes one for
the repple and one for executing the
java snippets that we we typed in so
let's run that and see what how about
behaves
okay let's get the system memory here it
should be free it for before and let's
get the Java max memory here and we see
that it's down to 121 megabytes about a
third so it's doing the right thing here
it's trying to choose reasonable
defaults of memory uses based on the the
max memory constraints of the container
itself so you can you can use these
options you have to add an experimental
flag first before you apply the option
here to use and would be interested in
feedback of how this works for you when
running Java and containers ok back to
the second part of my presentation so
the second part of a presentation is
reducing the size of JDK 9 and docker
images so JDK 9 is modular thanks to
project jigsaw that's for the major
release driver of JDK 9 and JDK nine
introduces modules to the Java platform
so what is a module the module is a set
of packages designed for reuse and very
simple definition and modules improve
reliability of maintainability of your
programs and we've applied modules to
JDK 9 it is itself composed of 79
modules we've refactored the whole JDK
over a number of years and it now we
find it more reliable and maintainable
itself as well JDK 9 comes with j-link
and this is a very interesting tool that
you can use to create custom Java
runtimes for example a Java Runtime just
consisting of the Java based module that
is the module that all other modules
depend on so what we can do is we can
use a distribution called alpine linux
and we can use the work done by the open
JDK project Portola to provide a port of
a JDK to our pine Linux and specifically
it's to the muscle C library for alpine
Linux users now up in Linux is
interesting because it's a very small
distribution and it uses muscle C rather
than lip C to reduce the size of the
distribution there early access builds
of the jdk port to alpine linux are
available at the link there and the
slides and we can use J link to create
custom Java runtimes for our PI in Linux
and because our PI Linux is small and we
can create smaller custom
Java runtimes it adds for a smaller
docker image so I'm going to explain how
we can do that so first of all I used
when I was running the J shell before I
was using a pre-existing image I created
called JDK 9 Alpine so that was JDK 9 on
Alpine Linux a full JDK there if we if
we list images here we can see I have
two images in my docker registry locally
I have Alpine Linux which is all of
about 4 Meg and I have JDK 9 Alpine
latest which is 356 megabytes so
basically the whole JDK is about 350
megabytes in in total so how did I
create that JDK 9 image so I have a
docker file available like so and I want
to build a docker image from that docker
file so what I did was I'm building from
Alpine Linux the docker image for base
image and I'm adding an EI version of
JDK 9 for alpine Linux here that I
previously downloaded and I'm basically
copying that into the image and setting
up some environment variables and I can
actually rebuild that image just to show
how it works like so and it's a bit
faster because I've already built it in
cache didn't haven't changed anything
so as there's there's really no change
going on here so what I can do is I can
run this and show how many modules are
in the JDK called JDK 9 run time by
running doing a docker run command and
running Java and listing the modules and
we should see there's quite a lot of
modules here in the full JDK in fact if
we just do a quick count of them we
should see there is 79 modules in the
JDK Nikken if we just scroll through and
have a look we see there's Java desktop
javac over here now when you're running
an say a cloud-based application you you
probably don't need desktop and you
probably don't need CORBA and you
probably don't need jdk äôt perhaps or
the
Javadoc stuff like this so you can strip
down your your application just to use
the jdk modules that you that you
require so let's let's try and strip it
down to the smallest possible Java
Runtime and what we're going to do is
I'm going to pick the Java base module
the one that all other modules depend on
so how are we going to do that so I have
another docker file so first of all we
need to run j-link that's all I
described earlier and we need to run
j-link
in the container of JDK 9 our plain
linux and already have a script for this
so what this is going to do it's going
to run my JDK 9 alpine container and
it's going to run jailing within that
container set up my module path to the
Java modules in the JDK 9 runtime and
it's going to say I only want to build a
new Java runtime that contains the java
base module I'm going to make it smaller
by compressing it I'm going to remove
some header files I don't need and then
going to output it to this directory
here like so so let's just run this like
so while that's running I'm just going
to save some time and copy this command
here so it's now doing jailing running
within the docker container a bit like
how we run branch a shell and now it's
we should see there's a directory here
that we created here so that's that's a
custom runtime for our pine Linux that
we just created which is smaller so how
do we put that into a docker file so I
have a docker image so I have another
docker file that we can use to create
that docker image which is very similar
to the other one we just basically take
our custom runtime that we built and
copy into the right location and set up
some environment variables so let's just
build that so now it's going to do some
actual work here copy this command line
while we're waiting here so it's copying
the directory that's the Java Runtime
the custom Java Runtime images
containing Java base into the into the
container setting up the environment
variables and now is creating the the
docker image and if we look at our
images here we can see that that our
custom run time has reduced by an order
of magnitude compared to the full JDK
nine run time here and that that's in
part because Alpine Linux is so small as
well we get the benefits of a small
custom run time there and a small size
of the operating system so now we can
list our modules in there and we see we
only have Java base there so that is an
example of how you can create small
custom run time images all of the
commands and the docker files and the
scripts that I've run and used are
available at the end of this
presentation so you can you can try this
out for yourself so let's go back to the
presentation and just finally at the end
so just to review I showed how Java is
improving its execution or running
within docker containers and how you can
reduce the size of JDK 9 in docker
images and so next steps you can go to
download the JDK from the links here you
can join the open JDK mailing list and
you can follow us on Twitter I hope you
enjoyed this thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
