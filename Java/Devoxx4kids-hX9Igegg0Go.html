devoxx and I'm your employee for Oracle
technology Network and I'm here today
with Daniele De Luca Daniel hi hi you
don't how you doing good and Sasuke
Sasuke hi right so and we are going to
talk about devoxx for kids so so Daniel
you have like the international or you
running really the program
internationally yeah it's a team effort
but yes I'm trying to coordinate
everything from the top level let's say
yep so how does it work I mean if I want
to reach out to you to organize an event
i mean what what do you first first i
will will check if for which country you
want to organize the event so based on
that if the country already has a team
in that country i will redirect you to
the to the country team leads because
they know better or the lead situation
works with children's over there and i
have already set up a set of events they
can help you in bed organiz you own
event in your own region all your own
city if you are not if done they aren't
any devoxx for kids team yet in that
country but you will be the first one to
to raise that team in that country and
you will be if you are willing to do
that of course responsible for helping
other people or the team's eventually in
the future to organize other events
there and to be the point of contact
with regarding any specificities or
regarding the box for kids or
programming initiative eventually from
from the box before kids family in that
country and of course you poured the
others and yeah so do you have some
examples of countries where the box for
kids is also running well today well
Holland for example is a very active
country from the box for kids
perspectives so they have let's say for
hundreds kids reach every year more or
less in total please more MORE
whoops I think says God that more more
local groups in different regional
cities or are created every year once a
year there is a new group I think more
or less France is also very active of
course the USA is very active too thanks
to the work of Aaron Aaron Gupta and all
the others states in the US yes a lot of
European countries are very active I
cannot name them every all of them
because there are plenty of them it's
very difficult to remember them all and
we thought it's a forgetting anybody so
yeah those who want Reese yes are very
active so if there is nothing there so
you said you are the I mean the person
would be then the first contact or the
the count de boxe pockets contact for
that region what does that mean or well
how would you help them I will just give
them a little introduction on how to
let's say how to start the first things
to study with is very a small group of
children's taking pictures and I will
give them some advices which works up to
to use first with less little amount of
budget try to reduce it to the maximum
of course and then what to prepare from
the logistics point of view giving some
directions some example of workshops
where that are targeted to specific age
range for the children's event we also
make them in contact with local
representation of big companies like
Oracle or reddit for example if they
have local offices or in the region of
the countries in order eventually to see
if those companies local representation
of those companies can help in a way in
another if not yeah okay means can
happen and I will eventually provide
them some hardware materials if they
need it so nervous eventually I can I
can even travel over there you know too
workshop myself yeah taking pictures
videos so they can be used later on to
promote next event and to go to all the
local companies to promote the next
event because pictures and videos or the
best wins solution to attract other
sponsors yeah so you really helping with
the organization and I mean at all the
all the questions you're really getting
them yeah I will try to make them
confident in a success to make a success
successful event it's not complicated
it's just matter of organization that's
it okay so sasuke you've done that
you've done it like several times
already so so I mean how did you do it
yes so we've been busy in Holland for
three years now with defects for kids
and talk loud and with we've actually
centralised now for the past year around
the NL jug so there were initially two
separate groups starting this devoxx for
kids events and now we've more or less
centralized it so people in the
Netherlands if they want to get started
on it they know where to go to through
the devil stricken site but there's a
separate Dutch / Ned your loans on the
website where they can go and get our
contact information from and we can help
with the material and we also have all
the workshops on there that we've been
doing which they can download and it's
all in touch it's all translated to
touch and so what we actually want to do
is from Duchess point of view is if
companies want to start hosting it then
we can just coach them doing an event
but they actually really do the event
themselves but we can also provide gift
workshops or and then after that they
take it over and actually we've already
had a company doing that so the first
time we were there doing the workshops
with all the people from the company
being volunteers and now they've already
did two events
help so that's why we train the trainers
or so so everything we do I'm sure it's
a big deal that you can also have like a
content in the local languages right i
mean yeah yeah i mean those kids start
10 to 14 summers younger the english is
not always very good so yeah you need to
translate it yeah that's all so it
started all everything started about
meets we were looking like a Stefan's
son Stephanie ansonsten order was asking
is as the fund may teach me something
and of course at that age was not able
to yet speak orange or read English so
trying to five figure out in on google
where to find that information but most
of the information was just in English
so we decided to start to localize the
workshop that we started with in
different languages and put this on the
repository so on the github repository
so everybody can contribute in
translations or are creating new
workshops at least in English and then
in the local language so other groups in
other countries can get the version in
English and translate it into their own
country language yeah I realize now that
we did an unplugged workshop so that's a
workshop without using a computer and
I've put the the material on it in Dutch
but I have to admit I haven't translated
to English yet so yeah so it's also you
you can also tap into a pool I mean the
java community like to get some
volunteers right and trainers yeah so
that's actually that's how we got our
first volunteers it's just the people in
our network just emailing everybody who
wants to help us and actually the one
that I'm doing in The Hague the
volunteers keep coming back and they're
asking yeah see you next year yeah once
you're inside means when you have tried
once when you're sucked in you know I
get out and the committee Vince you see
that in normal itie itie what the java
committee is very helpful in this and we
can ask any time and people are always
asking me also directly or can i do that
can i join
where where should I start and how
etcetera etcetera means it's amazing
it's the community we can call them and
immediately five minutes later we get an
answer from somebody say yes I'm there
you can count on me it's it's a maze
really great it's very very and you need
that help otherwise it's you can't do it
yeah right so anything else any advice
and yeah like what motivates people to
participate all the volunteers yeah i
think it's it's just seeing those kids
on a day like that it's really rewarding
seeing them especially the ones that
because we now because we doing a couple
of years we have a lot of repeaters
coming back but when you see like the
new kids who are just absolutely fresh
and and they're having so much fun that
day I think that's the rewarding part of
it yeah India so don't is it eight if
you are skeptical about this or trying
to do something want to do something but
hesitate on doing this just do do it and
you will see that you will never regret
it right and you have all the resources
everything is already there prepared for
you you just need to have a little bit
of work but it's well that well
otherwise ask for it or ask yes if it
was better for that thank you so much to
both of you and great work with the box
for kids thank you again thank you out
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
