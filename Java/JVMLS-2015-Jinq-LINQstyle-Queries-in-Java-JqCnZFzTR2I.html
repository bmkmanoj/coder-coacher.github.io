which is a system for doing link style
queries in Java 8 so as we all know
databases are amazing so they do all
sorts of really hard things related to
persistent data to disk for us like
transactions consistency fault tolerance
et cetera et cetera but as language
designers databases are interesting too
because in a way since most databases
are accessed through your database query
languages these query languages are
essentially domain-specific languages
and they're very powerful and they're
very widespread so for example here we
have a typical sort of database query so
here we go and from a database we get
all the products from the database then
we restrict which products we want so we
only want those where the price is less
than $100 and we say we only want the
name field from those databases now
because databases are so widespread
there is various of course there's many
different ways of embedding these
database query languages inside Java so
here's a sort of typical way that a
database query language might be
embedded in Java so you'll have an
interface and you'll have a method here
and when you call that method you want
it to actually execute that query so
what happens is in the interface you
would annotate the method with this
annotation and you'd stick a string with
the actual query string that you want to
execute on the database inside the
annotation and what happens is when you
run your program your database framework
will find this interface see the
annotation and it will automatically
create an implementation for that method
that would execute that query on the
database and these sorts of techniques
work fine but they always have problem
with corner cases so there's always some
weird corner case that can't be
expressed well or where things get a
little clunky and people are always
looking for better ways of embedding
these domain-specific languages into
Java so link is a system from Microsoft
for doing database queries in c-sharp
and people generally like this system so
the corner cases the way it handles them
are much less bad it's more elegant and
it
like more corner cases better than the
other systems and basically with link
style queries you express your queries
using lambda functions so here we have
serve a typical database query and here
is how it would be expressed in c-sharp
so you can see here the this where
Clause would just become a we're method
this expression here just becomes a
lambda expression here and similar here
we're here we have a select clause with
an expression that just becomes a Select
method taking a lambda expression now
the problem with links faul queries is
while link stands for language
integrated queries so what microsoft did
is they added a bunch of extra
facilities into the c-sharp language
specifically for handling sort of these
link style queries now jink is a system
for doing link style pairs in java but
unlike link it's it doesn't require any
compiler or VM changes or other tool
chain changes so basically basically
it's just a library you include the
library in your code and afterwards when
you write you know your regular link
style queries it'll be translated into
sequel that can run on a database no you
know no weird things we have to change
it with your tool chain or anything like
that
so why should you care about a jink well
first of all databases are important
some systems sort of like glue be one of
the main reasons it's popular is because
of the rails framework which is a
database and web framework and of course
many people choose C sharp just because
they like links so much and another
reason is that Jencks herb is a good
example of how far you can push serve
this meta programming stuff on regular
Java like it's a practical and useful
system that successfully embeds
domain-specific language into Java okay
so I'm going to sort of cover three
topics the first thing I'm going to
cover is sort of the syntax and
semantics of link just to make sure you
sort of understand what jink is trying
to translate into a database query I'll
then cover the translation issues so how
jink is able to translate there was this
Java code into a database query and then
finally I'll just cover some
complications I encountered
when developing Jenga okay so as I
expressed before showed before the these
link style queries they're just written
as lambda operations over collections so
basically it's exactly like working with
large lists of data in any functional
programming language so basically here
we use wearing select because it matches
the database terminology but this could
just as easily been be written as filter
and map instead so basically you're just
just like in a scheme or Lisp where
you'd filter our map operations in a
functional language you would you can do
the exact same thing with serve these
link style queries and because of that
these queries use our familiar semantics
that programmers are familiar with one
advantage though is since all this code
is written in Java code
you automatically get Java type checking
and Java syntax checking because this is
Java code the Java compiler will
automatically do your your type checking
for you and so then the error checking
you have to do on your site is just much
less so conceptually as I said when you
sort of building up the queries using
the these link style queries it's
exactly the same as just working with
large lists of data in a functional
language so when you call DB dot
products this method is just the same as
getting all the products from the
database and just putting it in a
collection in memory when you call the
where method on the collection with this
lambda function basically you just apply
the lambda function to all the products
and you filter things so the CPU where
the price is less greater than 100 gets
filtered out and that just gets put put
in new collection then when you call the
Select method again this is just exactly
the same as a map operation on a
functional list so you just apply this
this lambda to all of the products and
and you get the the names of all the
products now conceptually this is what
happens but obviously this isn't what
actually happens because reading all the
products from the database into a
collection in memory that's going to be
really inefficient and doing all the
filtering in memory that's obviously bad
to you so what actually happens is these
actions are backed by database queries
and these database queries are evaluated
lazily so when you call DB products what
happens is you create a collection
that's backed by this database query so
basically it gets all the products from
the database when you call this where'
method on this collection what it does
is it sees this the query that's backing
the collection and it just modifies the
collection so it analyzes its lambda
function and it just sort of slams it
into the database query here so here
instead of just getting all the products
this collection will get all the
products with this restriction and then
when you do this map operation we have
select basically inside the Select
method it will analyze this lambda
function it'll see you want the name
field so instead of actually doing their
filtering in memory it'll just change
the underlying database query under
underneath the collection so then when
you actually try to get the data for get
some of the data from the collection
what will happen is it will then go to
the database run this query on the
database and the database will actually
returned the data directly so you can
see here the the key to getting linked
to work is somehow inside this where and
select method you have to analyze these
lambda functions and figure out how to
slam these things into the query and
that's what I'm going to talk about next
so that's the key like that that's the
key to the translation so what does
things do so as I said again jink
doesn't do any changes to think of Pilar
or the VM or anything so what it does is
it just uses a lot of bytecode analysis
and this actually works okay because
bite the bytecode formats fairly static
so even hopefully as the language
changes because the bytecode format is
static we won't have to change the
Jencks system a lot but it is sort of
it's a little bit tricky because
different compilers produce slightly
different output for different for the
same piece of code you can't do simple
pattern matching and basically the the
trick we use is just use some basic
bollocky executions so a simple form of
symbolic execution so I'll go through an
example a couple of times to serve show
how the translation works with the
symbolic execution so let's say we have
this query here written in Java so you
go get all the products and you serve
restrict it to the products with the
price is less than 100 so again what you
want to do is inside the where method we
get this lambda function and we have to
figure out what is this lambda function
trying to do now this lambda function
what we do is the lambda function we go
and get the byte code for it and once we
get the byte code we have to sort of
figure out what the byte code is doing
and I'm not using real byte code here
obviously this is just some sort of low
low level pseudo code but different
compilers might compile it in different
ways and we have to figure out what this
compiled code does so let's just look at
this first example here with this first
bit of compiled code so let's say we
inside the where method we get this byte
code and we want to figure out what it
does now normally just as a person if
you get a bunch of compiled code and
you're trying to figure out what it does
you just create mock up create some fake
input run it through the code and you
sort of see what happens and you try to
develop some intuition about what the
code does right so you might track all
the things all the side effects so all
the things I change in the state of the
program from running that code with this
sort of fake input so basically if you
run it here the parameter this argument
P becomes this CPU the first line equals
100 so you'll set that as something that
changes in the program is set to 100
when you run the second line B equals P
get price the price of P is 110 so you
stick that in one and B P becomes B less
than a so B is actually greater than a
so P becomes false and then you return P
so since P is false you return false so
basically if you see here when you run
this function with this sort of fake
input these are all the things I change
and if you run this function with a
bunch of different input you'll see okay
you'll get some intuition and you'll see
ok what the function does is
it checks whether the price is less than
what everything right now obviously you
can you know get a computer to run this
as an algorithm so what we do is we run
the function symbolically so we we just
use symbols as input and we run it
through the code so this lets us see
what the function does for all possible
inputs so here we take P and we set it
to a symbol like the input when we run
the first instruction here equals 100 we
set this as a side-effect as well here
we have B equals P get price and P is
this input symbol
so basically B becomes input get price
we set P to be B less than a so B is
input get price so we stick that here
less than a is 100 so we just get that
less than 100 here and then finally we
have return P so basically everything
this expression here that P is that's
what we return so basically these are
all the things that the function changes
when you run it and these first three
lines are changes to local variables and
basically when the function exits we
don't these changes are discarded so we
can ignore that so basically we only get
really left with this one change here so
from this we can see by running this
function all it does is it returns
whether the price of the input is less
than 1 to 100 so when we actually run
the code we can do that for we can serve
generate queries from it so again when
you run DB dot products as I mentioned
before it it's backed by this query here
which gets other products and then when
you call the where method we get this
lambda function and inside the where
method we analyze the lambda function
and we can see that what it does is it
checks whether the price of the input is
less than 100 and from this expression
we can then slam it into the query to
create the new query so this works fine
for sort of this this example here but
things can get a little more complicated
for example actually you know in in a
real Java compiler the compile the code
compiles looks more like this this code
here on the bottom which has some
branches in it which sort of makes
things a little bit more complicated
so I'll show how how we're able to
handle the branches there so with this
second route it has some branches in it
so all we do is we build a control flow
graph of of this code and then for this
code we look at all the paths through
this control flow graph so in this case
there's two paths through the code we
can take this left path here where this
this if-if-if instruction returns true
and we can have this other path here
where this if instruction returns false
so there's depending on which way the
branch goes we have two different paths
so then we can analyze each path
separately and then we can use the same
and once we have a path is basically
just a straight line set of instructions
so we can use that symbolic execution
that we did before so it's a little bit
different though in that not only do we
want to track the side-effects we also
want to track the preconditions so the
preconditions are the conditions that
have to hold in order for this path to
be executed so just to go through it
again so we set P to be a symbolic input
when we run the first instruction we see
that a is set to 100 the second
instruction we have B equals P get price
so P is input so B becomes input that
get price and then we have this
branching instruction and in this case
for this path the branch should be
evaluate to false so what we do is we
take this branch nothing changes but we
set it as a precondition so since in
this path we know that we want this
branch to be true we know that whatever
there is inside this if instruction has
to be true as well
so this be less than a becomes input get
price less than 100 that's a
precondition for the path and then
finally we get the return 1 so we get
the yeah we get the return 1 is a
side-effect so these are all the things
that happen when we execute the path
again as before the first these changes
to local variables we can ignore them
because these these local variables are
discarded when we exit the function so
basically from this symbolic execution
we see that the path is executed when
the price of the input is less than 100
and when it is executed
it returns true so if we go back to our
control flow graph again we had two
paths through the code and when we
analyzed the first path we found these
were the conditions under which it ran
and if we do a similar analysis of the
second path we see that what it finds is
when the price is greater or equal to
100 it returns false
so inside just going back we add our
query and inside the where method we get
this lambda function and we had this
analysis for the two paths through the
lambda function so basically inside the
where method we're interested in when
the lambda function returns true so
basically we can sort of figure that out
from the analysis with two paths and
what we get is so basically we take each
path and we just order them together
their first path returns true when true
is true and when this condition holds
when the price is less than 100 or we
can take the second path and the second
path it returns true and when the thing
it returns is true so when false is true
and when these path preconditions hold
as well of course there's a lot of
redundant things here so this is
obviously false and true ëcoz true is
obviously true so we can just cross that
out and then you can see here that we
get served the same expression we had
before so analyzing the lambda method we
can see that what the lambda function
did is it just checks whether the price
is less than 100 so as you can see here
this lambda function is compiled in
different ways by different compilers
but regardless we can still analyze it
and get out sort of the same expression
for what it did so that's basically it
there's obviously some additional
details for handling all these different
cases that can handle it show up in
database queries the main complication
though I guess is that Java lambdas are
opaque so inside the where method as I
mentioned before you get these lambda
functions you have to figure out get the
byte code for them and figure out what
they do but reflection doesn't work on
these lambda functions so you don't know
what they are so what we do what happens
though is lambdas are serializable so
it's sort of ugly so basically you since
the
serialization is documented fixed you
just serialize it and then you take a
look at what and everything in the see
realized format has all the information
we need of course writing your own D
serialization code is sort of knowing so
basically what I do is after we
serialize the lambdas the name of the
class is sort of written into the
serialization format so you can just
change the name here to serve your own
class so then when you're deserialize it
instead of deserializing into a lambda
it DC realises your own object and you
can sort of extract out the parameters
you need from there of course because of
the serialization stuff it has some
annoying limitations first of all your
methods have to sub serializable lambdas
and most of the existing API is they
just accept regular lambdas and this is
a problem because like I mentioned
before the jank API is very similar to
the existing list api's or the streams
API so it'd be cool if we could just
programmers could just use the streams
API and have it automatically generate
database queries but we can't do that
because the existing your streams API
doesn't view serializable lambdas so if
we were to reuse that API we wouldn't
get serializable lambdas so we can't
reuse that API so we have to create our
own interfaces and api's for that the
other problem is because we serialize
the lambdas all the closure variable is
external variables etc except they also
have to be serializable so this is the
sort of restricts the flexibility of
sort of what we can be expressed and the
more annoying part is that users find it
confusing because they might
accidentally use a variable that's not
serializable they give it into jink
drink tries to serialize it and
basically all we can report back to the
user is not serializable we can't give
them any extra information because in
order to give them more detailed error
information we have to serialize it to
know what the method is trying to do and
then finally there's some overhead of
serializing and deserializing lambdas
and for databases this isn't so bad
because just executing a database query
you have to serialize the query on to
the network
jerk the database has to deserialize the
query that sq actually runs some disk
accesses to read the data that's the
serialized result sets and then on your
computer you have to deserialize the
result sets so for a database access
that cost the overhead if serializing
and deserializing the lambdas it's not
so bad but if you wanted to use the same
techniques for other systems like if you
wanted to try you doing some GPU
computation or something it might not
work so yeah that's it so link style
pairs in Java it works
djenka sort of like an open source
library no compiler VM changes are
needed you just include the library and
you can go and so what's interesting
about jank is it works and because it
works using these text techniques it
might be possible use these techniques
for other systems as well so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
