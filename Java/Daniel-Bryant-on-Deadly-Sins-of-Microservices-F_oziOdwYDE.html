conference my name is Steven Chen I'm
the java community manager working for
oracle and i'm joined by Daniel Bryan
from the UK are you good man okay thanks
get it's nice that nice to be in the
u.s. it once again yes yes it's great to
see you I think every works up the UK
pretty much yeah I travel as much like I
love the UK i'm not going to life but as
much like Hannah like to travel as well
but you were you were speaking in the UK
last week at a couple conferences yes i
speaking at devoxx UK on my favorite
conferences about DevOps with my friend
Steve Wolfe my BM so that was a lot of
fun it's all great feedback actually
around the DevOps kind of thing there
and then also contain a shed conference
we co organized at open Greedo we were
talking there around and use of
containers how does it change
applications that kind of thing and
looking stuff like Cuba Nettie's may
sauce all that goodness so whole bunch
of interesting stuff was discussed those
two conferences together which is an
amazing with you what do you think about
the the attendees between the two
conferences how does it differ between
the devops attendees and the container
attendees yeah massively stephen in
fairness so dev ox is very much a Java
focused all JVM focus conference with a
bit of JavaScript and other cool stuff
chucked in the mix whereas container
shed is is very much in the DevOps space
looking at and you know doc rocket Cuba
Nettie's make sauce those kind of things
so massive generalizing here and I
probably it a shot down Twitter for this
but def extends to be and more developer
focused whereas container shared more
operator focused and again not on either
one is better than the other it just
like to two sides of the same coin
really we're just trying to deliver
valuable software but some people more
inclined to build the systems others
more to deploy and operate them got it
got it that makes sense ok we're going
to chat a little bit about these seven
deadly sins of micros oh yes so
hopefully hopefully we'll learn a little
bit about what not to do with our micro
service architecture so how did Jerry
this is actually you're a talk I think
lit this afternoon fascinate yeah for 10
if you're at kick on now for 10 I come
and join me in I think sandy for the
seven more deadly sins of microservices
say ok cool so so just to just to make
sure your we don't give away all your
secrets yeah yeah three of the seven are
you testing my memory nicely Rizzo likes
I usually have my set patter with the
sliders but with the slide I'll
certainly try oh well I can do actually
is that there's some key
take aways yeah meh fun if there is
three key takeaway okay well look at
those cialis and social i leading to
first of all yeah yes the first one is
being aware of strategy so a lot of
times i go into companies and either
there isn't a strategy say in terms of
and people tend to move from one thing
to the other that kind of thing and
having success but no real kind of
formula for success for life all know
even valid approach for testing
hypotheses which i think is really key
kind of the scientific method and in a
sense so I think strategy super
important I take a lot of my cues from
Simon wardley the guy in the UK right
some amazing blog post set bits and
pieces and a lot of cues from Simon
around strategy situational awareness
where we as a company going what's the
landscape like as in now for example
there's a whole bunch of Micra service
platform shooting up probably says and
you don't need to build your own anymore
you know there's this thing life I
finally got in there if you're building
your own you're probably doing something
wrong I agree you're gonna unless unless
you're chris richardson yeah yeah
speaking Chris earlier the week yeah I'd
lunch with chris yesterday she chris is
doing some really cool stuff with makes
it eventuate very interesting there's
lots of smart people thinking about
those things so you know no way you are
in terms of situational awareness super
important and and then sort of plan from
there look like create your tactics
knowing where the strategy is is really
cool alright that's a good one yeah
second one is principles and preparation
so principles we're seeing people sort
of copying things blindly be that the
actual kind of concept the micro
services themselves how to operate teams
and kind of squads chapters and gills
which is a very familiar really a kind
of thing from the Spotify era but you
need to understand what the principles
are for what you're doing so if you're
building microservices they should be
services built around business
functionality they should be
independently deployables and they
should be running as independent
processes which again we see a lot of
why call mini lists which are kind of
mini monoliths and these things quite
fighting in the world where people using
heavyweight frameworks heavyweight
communication that kind of thing so also
preparation once you know your
principles in terms of what's available
and what principles you're trying to
address and do some preparation so have
a look what's out there and plan in
terms of how you're going to carve your
your gun code base up things like
domain-driven does
fine awesome there in terms of bounded
context context mapping which are sort
more back and and to just be aware that
a bit of preparation does save a whole
bunch of time later when you're trying
to add to say things in I've seen people
try to add in the classics are
non-functional stuff like logging
monitoring security all these things
okay try to retrofit existing
microservice architectures for that's
pretty painful I would imagine bingo and
manga services don't make it easier in
that case and we've seen people so
retrofit security and when you've got a
monolith you just have one thing to poke
you have one thing to fix potentially
with microservices you've got one edge
but a whole bunch of stuff I've heard
some people talk about death star
security see be a really strong edge
here then a week inside so it seems like
Luke Skywalker gets hidden you're kind
of screwed so you need to be very
unconscious of security inside as well
as outside there it's a great talkie
actually yesterday by and Christina from
Bishop Fox I think they're the company
was called they're really rammed home
this point combination of social
engineering and some mild hacking skills
and she was doing a lot of damage
obviously all white hat hacking that she
was doing but it really made me think
wow yeah this micro service stuff like
retrofitting security not easy yep yep
okay yeah that's that's another good one
so preparation yep the third one I'm
running water everyone is now um oh its
responsibilities yes sponsibilities i'm
not good at that one i already know i'm
gonna fail this one so the interesting
thing responsibilities we're finding
some people at DevOps is almost like a
carte blanche for I do everything the
poem is when people are responsible for
everything they're actually responsible
for nothing that makes sense so I love
DevOps are genuinely doing and you see
me talking about that other conferences
and but it's not an excuse much like
agile isn't an excuse to be sloppy you
know some people say well we're agile
and don't really have any methodology
DevOps is not this you know is not
misused to have no responsibilities so
I'm big big advocate even simple things
like RACI matrix Azure raske matrixes
depending on what you want to call them
that basically call out who's
responsible who's accountable who need
to consult what you need to inform when
you're changing things simple things
like that just remove a whole bunch of
like questions as in should I inform
Jane I'm changing the logging is Bob
okay with the new deployment style like
a lot of companies I work for they
simply do not know who to inform of
changes on who to
opinions from so real basic stuff
knowing your responsibilities again
DevOps is awesome but there's things
like sre site reliability engineering
popping up now and full stack developers
all bunch of different terms and often
they mean many things to many people so
actually defining responsibilities yeah
Boris is no not just doing everything
yeah or not just again I think one of
the most abused labels in software story
architect I call myself an architect
sometimes yeah but what does an
architect really do every company is
different yeah so same with dev ops now
when I go in to develop some like
finding what the roles are and who's the
contact point for different things going
to production and that's fine go yeah
simplistic science it's really fun to
pencil so okay now that's really good so
and then I bet the when you start with
the sins it's even more interesting yes
indeed you can show all the anti
patterns of you get to this like why you
actually need those articles basically
my patter for today will be go through
the seven sins and then it will lead
into this conclusion and you'll see
common themes throughout them all in
terms of those three things I mentioned
there yeah that's pretty cool so how did
you how did you come up with a sense of
takeaways was it from like actual
projects you worked on or gonna be
careful what I say here okay so many
more clients in washing back in the UK
or new years but yeah pretty much so I'm
very lucky the job I do not only do I
get to work hands-on quite a lot with
the whole bunch of clients from startups
to big organization my colleagues in
open credo like we've constantly share
stories and so I get to learn lots and
stuff like that and I've been writing
for info queue for a while now and I've
come to a lot of the coupons so I get to
hear kind of the good things cuz q con
and any conference actually coupons a
bit different but a lot of conferences I
go to the stories tend to be biased
towards the good things that have
happened yeah like a survivor bias you
only talk about the good things q cons
actually a bit more open in this respect
of her people talk about bad things as
well which is great but by going to
conferences I get to learn all the good
stuff what's worked for Spotify what's
worked for yodel these kind of things
and my day job I get to see some of the
more challenging part should we say they
wished you know ultimately we help the
clients fix and I learn a bunch of stuff
yeah I think you learn more from the bad
side than you do good and it's more
entertaining Simon it talking about the
bad stuff of the my blog post semi- that
a blog post seven deadly sins get much
more traffic than the positive
you know the seven virtues for example
people like to hear by the war stories
yeah exactly that makes sense so what's
up next for you were you you traveling
back to the UK yes i'm heading back to i
should go to doc Urkel actually gave a
popular Seattle for a bit and so we're
doing stuff over intercom and looking
forward to that a whole bunch of
interesting announcement scheduled and
then heading back to the UK and then I
think daresay I'm taking a break from
travels for for a few months provisional
is so javaone its own hope be on the
agenda as looking to looking to get that
one again there's a couple of other
conferences towards the tail end of the
year as well but I've been very lucky
this year I've gone to a lot of
conferences already so already nice they
get my hands back on fixing stuff for
this is actually I go into javaone
hibernation d soon because of all the
preparation needed to get that
conference off the Crocs only imagine
steve is in like I know what goes on
some planet seems AQ Khan it's
incredible but job what is even bigger
again I guess yeah MZ yeah the pier
scale of the tall also don't work but it
all comes together somehow I always I've
been going now for five years always
enjoy it as I love San Francisco it's a
real Mecca isn't it forever wanna go
like yourself who's into Java so always
me up with Martine with Ben with Trish
very well-known names in the conference
scene I'm just a great excuse to chat
share the latest kind of develops in
tournaments in Java and the kind of
surrounding stuff so I haven't noticed
over the last few years there's been a
branch out into the dev ops II kind of
stuff as well yeah I said we're not
thinking that's the conference more edge
or more DevOps which i think is nice
because that's kind of where we're at
now and it regardless of what language
you code in some of these things are
really valuable yeah even if you're not
directly using the methodologies are
using DevOps in your company probably
it's impacting the way you're doing
development like we own a kind of every
charity is wrong your job opportunities
so true some of the job like this things
I see these days they do ask for a heck
of a lot of stuff just being aware of
these things makes it easier well never
had dilip school all right well thanks
very much for the inert q con New York
Daniel good a pleasure um for folks
watching the live stream hold on tight
because Peter will be up shortly reckon
for an interview and you can watch the
livestream at night hacking calm and
also see all the recordings and a
special thanks to our audio
here at UM q con Huson enjoying a very
good life excited great food here
alright so thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
