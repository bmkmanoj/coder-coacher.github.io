thanks for thanks for hanging in there
we have my peasants and little softer
issues but we're actually we're getting
we're getting through this whole podcast
showing cool hardware and doing
everything ok so we were taking some
good questions from folks online so
we've questions from Tony questions from
Shiv from the chai user group so well
we're back on air will finish answering
those questions mm-hm and then we have
some extra jf extras coolness I show as
well all right so ships question let's
see where the middle of answering was
about other hardware device yet and what
we're mentioning is you can run it on
some large embedded platforms so
currently the beagleboard does the one
you want to get we've released for that
future support for raspberry panda
disclaimer that I don't actually know
what's going on so don't have your
company's future direction based on
things I say and we also have small
embedded so with Terence yesterday we
showed the Kyle board or keel kyl kind
of yeah something like that Kyle ok eil
running a smaller armed ship and I get
only had was 128 megabytes of RAM but
you could do quite a lot of stuff with
Java on that using the the mobile
edition and there's a whole like breadth
of different platforms you can support
from very very small embedded too large
and vetted yeah so yeah although the
recommendation for folks if you want to
try out all the stuff Garrett showed is
pick up a pick up of evil board me but
yeah and if you have questions just drop
me a mail or go to my blog and write a
comment or something like that i will
blog about this app i just waited for
two presented here first and then we'll
put a blog post out next
cool all right so whether we're sort of
stuff do you have to yeah just because
so many people ask me how I do the
control stuff for for Jeff extras extras
for example I just would like to show it
shortly how I do this and decided to
create this javafx logo control which
has no makes no sense at all but it's
okay so this is a adobe fireworks that i
use at the moment and should also work
with the adobe illustrator that's
because i use this FXstreet format as
and as you can see this is all these
shapes are polygons even the text
because i don't have the deformed I just
draw it by myself the whole logo I just
big there's no high resolution javafx
logo available somewhere official
official transfer yeah so I just took an
image and then recreated it manually and
I put it into two layers so the cup I
put into a layer named canvas and canvas
you might say have an idea why because
now all polygons will be drawn in one
canvas node and if I have the logo for
example will be separate notes on the
scene graph each of these and okay then
I have a third layer which is named
properties yeah it doesn't really make
sense in the drawing program but for me
coding starts when I draw it I put a
letter in their properties and then i
define the types in this case for
example color underscore color one on
let's go and add a default color and
what I do now is I say file export and I
export it as an FX g javafx logo okay
and then I go to my tool which is this
one this is at the moment it's swing
based I will do it in javafx when I have
the time and then I can drag drop the f
x g5 directly to the controller and
we'll show it in a swing handle this is
now swing nice and then I see here the
properties and the different layers so
properties cup canvas and logo and I see
the size and then I can decide which
kind of
for what I would like to see f xml for
example which is based on the work that
just budget but I extended the the xslt
file in a little bit because fireworks
does something's different than
illustrator and so this works now for
fireworks and then what i do is i just
press convert Roger can defined and
package but in this case just convert
and ready so what it does it's created
on my desktop a couple of files and this
is the CSS file it's the control class
it's the behavior class the skin class
in the Builder and also a demo so I just
take this stuff put it in and follow
where I prepared something Chuck there
we go and you see it's a demo and macos
at CSS control behavior of your skin now
I go to IntelliJ and here we go there
and if everything works then I can just
press run and wow here we go it's a
dragoness control transparency yeah it's
this is now a complete control and you
can use for example if because I created
also the the properties and this is the
interesting thing you see here is the
object property color color one color to
with a getter setter all that stuff is
there and I have a full-blown builder
with all properties available so this is
so good here I see the logo below with
the color one color two properties and
if I would like to change it now the
only thing I have to do is I have to
hook up the properties to the shapes
because now it really just takes the
colors that are in the drawing because I
can't define this shape should have
color one and that should color too so
you have to do it manually but that's
that's the way how i create controls in
a culture so so Tom and she loved this
spot working together I want to know
where you can get it oh it's a valuable
on my block it's a January file it's a
web starter but you need to have the
best would be adobe fireworks because I
use this and unfortunately the ethics
deformer that will be exported by
fireworks is different than the one from
illustrator and that's because fireworks
was built originally by another company
and that was bought by Adobe and so they
have two different teams and creating
this FX g format based on the same spec
but the spec is not as sharp so you can
use either this one or that one and
that's the reason why it's different and
because i only have fireworks available
so I this stuff is based mostly on the
fireworks things yeah yeah that's cool
so really you could possibly visit open
source yeah it's a salsa so someone else
if they had a different drawing program
yeah so I modify I separated that so
there is also plugin for netbeans where
you can get jaan i showed it last year
on java one yeah and created this plugin
and there you can just put the FX g file
in your folder and then you can create
from netbeans you can right mouse button
convert and it will create a swing
control right or directly in your
project this is possible in that means
and I separated the conversion code
completely from the UI so the UI is
nowhere on the web and that's because
the coat is so ugly that I don't want to
share it but the conversion stuff is
available in on github as FX g tools is
the name and it can also convert to
android or sorry we have someone phone
or a car here I mean the linux-based
operating system you know what I mean so
it can convert also to andorra this
linux stuff and it can html5 output it
can groovy FX's in there but it's not I
don't put it out right at the moment and
scared or else swing and trowel effects
but it will only export complete
controls it's not only the drawing code
it is the complete control you can if
you just would like to see the drawing
code then there is a something like
export file or preview code if you use
preview code it will only show you the
drawing room yes so I put up I put up
your blog for folks
so fit on the social yeah okay staying
over to find this it's on the right side
of the block there should be something
like ethics G converted energies I think
you can run a web start and then ok and
also the plugin yeah and then you can go
at it all right yeah so very easy for
people yeah it should work it the
problem is that you there is no really
documentation and because I build it for
myself and then open source it because
somebody might be interested in yeah so
if you have any questions just let me
know because you have to this property
stuff you have to use a specific syntax
you only can use underscores in the in
the shape names nothing else is about an
ethics tree and if you look at Adobe I
use the same format to create adobe flex
controls and they use exactly the same
thing if they name it they name variable
name underscore default value underscore
so it's the same problem there so we
both invented the same work around cool
anything else you want to show for joy
of extras I think it doesn't make sense
to show the all this stuff because we
already sits in the ensemble and if
someone has questions oh maybe that's
one thing i would like to mention for
everyone who's using GFX trust we will
change to java 7 in the near future
right we made the decision yet and
everybody as far as I saw the manliness
everybody agrees so we will be on Java 7
in the future right now it's at on java
6 but it will be a char on Java 7 I
don't know when but in the near future
yes it makes simplifies the developers
live so we can take you by the way did
you gave Tom the yeah that's awesome tom
is now supermen on the belt server
that's great building Tom okay yeah
that's I I decided not to show code
because uh yeah you know I'll contrite
quickly leaves on which also hardware
happy yeah yeah exactly so and the way
we do bitch'll py hacking exactly sonic
you and if you are at w Jack Saudi box i
will have the box with me and it would
be my pleasure to show it to you so
anybody is interested and seeing this
since you guys figure what stuff just
hit me at d-box oo w Jack's next week
alright cool so we're going to take a 10
minute break to switch over to Andre it
looks like all the stream issues are
fixed as well a quick um hope so maybe
not be good but crash detectives a
reboot of my computer cell phone issues
so thanks a lot thanks for having me for
being on the show you do a great job
kudos for this guy he's crazy yeah so so
don't know how crazy I am when you post
the the motorcycle yea i meant a video
you are driving up here together from
where is it returns and Pablo flybridge
a southern part of Germany and we got
some we got some video footage along the
way I will put it on my next blog post
so you can see Steven riding on a bike
he really writes on the bike not by
train as somebody mentioned he took the
bike on the trade no well I really did
take it on the train but that was to get
from one yeah that was only yeah I think
that's fun a tunnel right yeah if it
doesn't spin really nice so alright so
