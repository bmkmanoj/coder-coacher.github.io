set up and I was actually coming into it
from the very small hobby this level
just to play with it and explore it and
try to see what could be done with it
and we just kept meeting in the Middle's
roof in Spain and this are a tooth set
trusted sick traffic lights working in
any and in a mine in Spain with solar
panels and the electronic here it's
inside this behind this at this world
there is an arduino also we have a big
antenna here we can tend to send a
signal to the other say traffic light so
this have been working for several years
in Spain let's it was a pretty nice
experience working with our dunya but
now we have moved to just a more to
hobby and playing with toys like
raspberry pi and we have another
configuration here more suitable for
sewing and the moving so this will we
are going to talk about tomorrow and it
should be working already so let me take
and to give you a little bit of an idea
Jose is a configuration here on his roof
is five kilowatts the configuration is
on my slide is about 200 watts so it's a
much smaller scale but what's really
neat about this type of the system is it
scales extremely well from very very
small to even utility level it's just a
matter of the size and making a few to
adaptations is you get larger or smaller
so the concepts are really very fluid up
and down the entire spectrum to give you
a little bit of an idea what our
configuration on the Raspberry Pi and we
were running this with the soft float
build of Linux the weezy raspbian queasy
we've actually converted that now to a
hard float build and taken the the java
embedded sweet 7.0 and we're running
that on hard flow we've seen slight
performance gains by doing that it's
nothing to write home about but but on
the very small amount of data that we've
collected and run benchmarks even that
does show some improvement so when you
start talking some rather large datasets
I'm sure it'll be even greater these are
informal benchmarks I mean we're not
advocating they be published or anything
but they've been kind of promising we
think so oh okay quick overview of the
system architecture
here we have the remote because a lot of
times renewable energy especially wind
power but even the solar panel
photovoltaic panels you don't put those
in the middle of a crowded area you can
but you know for the wind that you need
or for the massive sizes of you know
pretty good-sized solar array you're
going to need to be out a little bit so
you have a more remote setup which lends
itself more to less hands-on maintenance
here we have our land client tied to our
router and our embedded server which in
this case is a Raspberry Pi more details
just a little bit drill down into it a
little bit more we also if you come in
tomorrow we have a another pie set up
with a web camera that transmits shots
as we go to so we're giving you kind of
the scaled-down version now please come
tomorrow and check it out motion sensors
right for that as well okay here was
what we started looking at bringing you
know again trying to shrink this down to
make it portable 50 watt wind turbine
and and all of this by the way all of
this is also very easy to start getting
involved with and for in terms of a cost
structure because you can get started
with very little money so it you can
spend a few bucks and start playing and
then you can spend a few more bucks and
add in another piece and you know I
guess eventually it does add up but even
for a pretty comprehensive system we
didn't wind up spending that much money
to put something together that that will
do something meaningful so 50 watt wind
turbine 25 watt photovoltaic panel and a
small 12 amp hour battery you won't
power much for very long with that but
again it's portable it wasn't quite
portable enough so we took it down a
little further the wind turbine collapse
as well I went with a small photovoltaic
panel you can get to charge your auto or
motorcycle battery and keep it topped
off it works just the same it just
doesn't produce as much output and a
small 5 amp hour battery that still
didn't pass muster with the airlines so
I shipped it out ahead of time but very
small and again very inexpensive you can
find a lot of this on eBay Amazon as
well as many many
the retailer's here's kind of an
overview of our sensor bundle components
again very inexpensive stuff you got
some arduinos a little monochrome
display which isn't absolutely necessary
it's just kind of nice to peek at the
INA 219 is for monitoring voltage and
current which is kind of handy we also
have a couple different ways two
different devices for measuring
temperature and humidity a motion sensor
breadboard to tie it together some
jumper wires and for the communications
on the one side we have the xB stack if
you will and on the other side of the
the little Nordic semi radios and those
probably well they definitely can be
integrated directly with raspberry pi
hover it's just so easy to plug them
into an Arduino the libraries are all in
place and plug the Arduino into the pie
so that's what I did on my side of
things and Jose did the full stack
implementation of the XPS so it's kind
of nice to compare notes on that a
little more information this is the
server and end the the pie that actually
has the the camera and the motion sensor
SD cards we also have a little bit of
performance notes at the end I don't
know that we'll get to them today but we
will be talking about performance on
embedded tomorrow because you can get a
lot of stuff you can even get the full
java ee stacked around on our Raspberry
Pi but you're not going to get very good
results out of it so there are a lot of
things you can do to optimize for
performance and make it good and
meaningful and very useful even though
again you know you've seen the numbers
you've seen the graphs it's really
pitiful in terms of the numbers but it's
very capable in terms of what I can do
if you if you optimized for it so total
bill of materials we were we spent under
seven hundred dollars and you know at
times we actually repurpose some parts
so we probably spent a few bucks less
than that but it's certainly nothing
this prohibitive to really go crazy with
and have a really nice system to work
through the details on all the way start
to finish and again with extras and with
two different ways of doing things
factored in we're still under seven
hundred dollars
oh just to give you a bit of background
on the back end we have the Java
embedded sweet that is undergoing a
change in architecture we don't have all
the details we just know that 7 dot one
will be significantly different than 70
it's based more on an osgi model so some
of the things we're going to be talking
about will apply some won't however the
the general mindset with embedded is
that you're constantly learning new
lessons anyway and application is a
little different on each platform
that'll probably normalize over time but
for now the concepts still hold we have
on the couple of different front ends we
have well here I'll let you take it off
yes you got it okay for not for now this
is a client and made in javafx okay
these are very nice custom controls that
you can use to display whatever measure
you have on your sensors have to say
this should work also in the Raspberry
Pi you could just a take it opened your
very pie you should you need a monitor
because a you cannot a at this headless
you need a monitor to see but it will
run nicely on the Raspberry Pi it's a
delight
I have a small an atrix lapdock that
I've connected to it and built it as a
laptop and I I almost brought that with
me as well but frankly I just had some
axed out my to check bags at Southwest
would let me fly and iMac there
everything Carrie so I left that at home
but you can use the Raspberry Pi for
that I think a couple of you mentioned
XBMC you can use it as a Java
full-fledged Java server you can use it
pretty much any way you want to it's
just a matter of figuring out what you
want and the more you start playing with
it the more you implement the more you
wind up probably you know buying another
one and trying to do something else with
it I don't talk to a whole lot of people
who stay with just one for long because
they're they're kind of mildly addictive
you can do so much with them I haven't
beaglebone black waiting for me at home
when I get back and I heard you
mentioned that as well because that
supposedly has about twice the
performance in many cases as the
Raspberry Pi for ten bucks more it also
has a massive amount of gpio so you can
do a lot of things that they are doing
with the Arduino or with the black work
beaglebone black that you can with the
Arduino that the Raspberry Pi doesn't
have as many options to do I think I
mentioned before but just in case I
didn't I want to hit because with the
embedded space there are a lot of
different options and a lot of times
people say ye are you still using an
Arduino with some of these things one
because they have a ton of shields and
shields are the little add-on boards
that you can get there's also a huge
amount of software written out their
libraries to support those shields and
it's very you know it's open source
hardware it's open source software I
also threw out the earlier that it
absorbs pretty much in any energy band
you can throw it in terms of voltage 6
220 volts I think it's rated for 7 to 15
but six to twenty so if you stick a 9
volt on there and it goes almost dead
you're at or your Arduino is still
running it just handles it it also has a
built-in logic leveler so you can run 5
volt and 3.3 volt add-ons off of it and
it sips power I think it's 42 milliamps
milliamp hours very very minimal the
Raspberry Pi Phi
right is about 57 times that which isn't
significant but if you're looking at
something to to leave remote and power
off of a wind turbine you know just
drain a slight amount off of that for
your other energy production or off of a
solar array it's negligible what it
absorbs so there are a lot of good
reasons to mix and match and kind of
pick the best best breed solution Tony
this is my blog you can find it online
and you can find a pity stuff I have
been dying over the last last year and
playing with many tools like the one I'm
going to show you right now which is a
little motion controller this is Java
effects 3d this is a model of the Hubble
telescope for but what I can do here is
rotate this model this 3 3d model so I'm
applying free rotation at a time because
they leap motion controller 6 your hand
and it's see it sees a deep it's the
jail the roll so it gives you all these
rotations at the time so you have to
perform some calculus with that get the
rotation you have to apply and you are
good to go it also detects for that I
need Mabel fans it takes some gestures
for instance if I make a circle here
started ripping then it stops ok
