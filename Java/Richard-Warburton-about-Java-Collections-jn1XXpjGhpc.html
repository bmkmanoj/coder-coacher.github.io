welcome my name is your employee for
more coal technology network and I have
Richard Richard Warburton they say that
way yes yet you doing with that you're
doing a great job name names are really
hard to pronounce if they're not your
your first language that's always
something that that's an interesting
experience whenever you're traveling
around or yes meeting people from
different countries absolutely so you
had so you you're really an expert in
what Java 8 and also lambdas collections
you had a session yesterday I've got a
session tomorrow oh yeah on collections
with more with my trowel and yeah we're
talking about some interesting stuff
there so Java developers are fairly
familiar with collections they've been
using them for a while but there's lots
of kind of new ideas and things on the
horizon so for a start you know the Java
rate language feature change is also
kicked off a load of API changes that
let people right kind of collections
code in a less error-prone way but
there's also kind of big picture ideas
like you know a lot of things coming
from functional programming around
persistent immutable collections and
things like that and it's one of these
things where now people are over kind of
getting over the hump of java rate of
learning the basics one of the more
interesting topics on that space that
they can bring in and you know as we say
mutable persistent collections are one
of the things that there's a real
benefit so we're looking at some of the
different implementation characteristics
because a lot of the reason why people
don't use those kind of things
historically is they think that they're
really slow but actually bit there's
been loads and loads of really
interesting both research work and also
things that you can bring in from other
protein languages communities some of
them on the JVM like scholar enclosure
and things about really efficient
implementations of immutable collections
which make them a lot more practical for
you so you get both the kind of safety
benefits from the immutability and also
the performance benefit also some
performance that's not not as bad as it
used to be I should say
good so so the collections as you said
ago with go along with the programming
parallel programming changes right yeah
I mean definitely the ability to have
handout references to immutable data in
a safe way between threads is a
motivating feature for people to use
those kind of collections so does it
affect and do you talk about in other
sessions about reactive programming or
I'm not talking about that at devoxx but
we definitely do to some interesting
stuff on kind of reactive programming in
asynchronous i/o my colleague growl and
I we run training courses as well
through a company called iterative
learning and one of the ones we've been
talking about recently is a reactive and
asynchronous programming course which is
big topic whoa a big it is it's the
thing that's really interesting is you
know a lot of people are beginning to
kind of move to more kinda microservice
II architectures or just plain kind of
service-oriented architecture and when
they do that kind of move there in a
position where they make lots of network
communication calls to other services
that are independent and if you are
doing that and you use kind of a
synchronous blocking IO model and you
get some other external service that's
slow it can start to slow down that
dependent service it can start to eat up
the threads in your thread pool where
you can take out whole downstream
services when you get some upstream
services having a problem so as a result
asynchronous i/o is really a much neater
program model for these kind of problems
but at the same time people really hate
the programming style they get with
asynchronous i/o so there's some really
good features in Java rate like complete
able to manage the state going between
these things but there's also a load of
other kind of program models there like
actors reactive streams and things like
that which are things which you can do
relatively elegantly or kind of
relatively okay in Java as of gr8 which
again help you solve this problem of not
eating you to kind of thread pool up not
being a bit more resilient to failure
and things like that and so you're
really talking about streams so reactive
we've stream yes
that's a whole other area yeah yeah it's
it's exciting topic and there's all
sorts of interesting things around you
know I think kind of developed
communities are beginning to learn and
being to build about a body of knowledge
about you know the gr8 streams are great
for the bulk collection processing type
problems but there are other AP is that
people are beginning to spin up outside
of Oracle that build on that work and
better for solving other different areas
like things like RX java very
interesting so if somebody wanted to
learn more about the whole subject I
mean do you have maybe resources that or
where they can find it more information
know how would you go about it like I
mean it just assume somebody is um is
still like dealing with Java 7 and they
all truly know I mean they've heard all
all those terms but they're not too sure
so I mean this so for it goes just on
java 7 I think I'd focus on learning the
basics of core job right first before
jumping into any of the reactor streams
or completed will feature stuff I'm you
know definitely obliged to point out I
wrote a book on Java races the topic
absolutely so that's a that's a great
place for people to start obviously I'm
there were plenty of other books which
are written on that scene on that same
java version a lot of them are very good
so i don't want to bad-mouth and else's
book or anything I hear good things
about lots of these things and yeah I
also run through iterative learning calm
some training courses on that topic as
well but you you do recommend a course
like that yeah it's I think everything
it does help wait but it's not like I
can't really come in and claim just go
on a trading course at all solve all
your problems you really need to play
around and experiment and learn in your
own time as well to to really get the
hang of things I feel is right of course
so you also involved with different open
source projects right yes well I I do
I'm more myself and a couple of things
so I when I get time which is not
recently I try and
a little an open-source profiling
project as well which is on github
called honest profiler which is used by
quite a few people as being t mean I
think it's even used in production by
some people at Netflix and things like
that so it does get used by some people
here and there and quite a few
organizations and it's it's called
honest profiler this is designed to be
your profile that's more accurate so
most existing profilers like say jvzoo
OPM has got a very nice UI easy to
connect to Easter very easy to use but
has certain biases and the way it
collects that sampling information when
you're using it as a sampling profiler
so it's trying to be a little bit more
accurate in in that way and also salope
and source as well cool so any any notes
anything you want to other that you want
to share about Java 9 any thoughts about
gemini now any thoughts watch F and how
it's gonna be well are you excited about
gentleman with the modules oh I mean
chicks am mmm I'm excited I'm not I'm
not I'm not jumping out of my seat I
must admit but now I know I know well
it's still early as well sure there's
definitely some people for whom that
whole bear in that whole set of features
is going to be really really useful I
can totally see there's a lot of people
who would value the module system and
have a lot of use for it for what I do a
Java personally I'm probably not the
exact target audience now for it but but
it's definitely good to see there's a
lot of even aside from the module system
there are a lot of other really good
improvements coming on in 9 just even
things like kind of rough corner cases
from Java API is being expanded and
improved in streams collectors optional
if any of this thing actually we've got
a bunch of articles on iterative
learning calm talking about some of the
upcoming Java 9 features around the
optional streams collectors collection
factory methods just put publish a blog
post today on that topic actually and
then there's also things like Jay shell
as well so there's still even if you're
not that excited about chicks or which
I'll admit it's not really
thing that I personally I but I know
another rather there are other people
who do different things to me that's
fine there's still loads of other
goodies in there that it will definitely
be an improvement okay thank you so much
for talking and to us about Java 8 and
the collection so my question thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
