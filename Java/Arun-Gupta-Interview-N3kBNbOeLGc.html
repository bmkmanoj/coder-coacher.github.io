Network we are reporting live reporting
we're hanging out live from the floor
Java one with the Java hub and we're
talking to members of the java community
and i have a distinct honor of talking
to my old friend Rita how are you how
are you doing I'm doing wrong so tell me
what you're doing in state what for red
hat make this week's about a year ago I
the director for developer advocacy at
that hat for anything that is to do with
jboss program ok to very actively
contribute to the java ee community so
enjoy doing or of kids education as part
of their box look it's great so let's
let's kick off and talk about kids for a
minute so you had a day kids say
whatever Java could stay right so this
was their works well kids grow up to be
a Java 120 days back there were about
150 kids that showed up right we have
several curds from the underprivileged
communities so for example there were
pretty girls from black girls code and
these girls the inspectors were telling
me these girls were the ones who are
asking the most interesting questions so
which is very inspiring right exactly so
you had three rooms you're teaching
different technologies what's going on
there yes we have three rooms about
hundred fifty carrots 15 each of those
we had workshops on minecraft nodding
raspberry pi already know python scratch
Wow now yeah about 12 sessions overall
nice was really good yeah and the fun
part is we picked seven of those kids to
highlight the strategy kino to Java one
right that was very cool as well or not
the kids behaved as if they've been
doing all their life right leg you know
if you talk to either one of us will be
scared like wow haven't even that big an
audience change these kids were smooth
well they're born to be presented right
right and I get the fam to go yeah
pretty much yeah but that was one of the
projects that they built the turbine ah
get the turbine to rotate because that's
what the
boot in the class so that was good yeah
that's very cool so two bucks for kids
is all around the world wait wait yeah
but the locks for kids were started in
Belgium I founded the nonprofit
organization in the u.s. to item the
beauty of chapter as well but there are
also chapters in France Netherlands UK
India Indonesia all over excellent and
so if i want to find more information
about it it's def box de bo XX the
number four but i'm good little kids sad
or ok so there are chapters all over the
world there are developers that really
believe in helping train the next gen
yeah Riley think about this the little
bit of Java is cleared the future you
want me a present these kids are the
future right right if we don't trip in
there yeah no reason I think we gonna
keep working forever yeah yeah I'd okay
yeah I don't want to put my laptop on my
Walker that's no great yeah and a lot of
enthusiasm and I'm seeing a lot of girls
for geriatrics right to easily we
definitely focus a lot slower as part of
gender equality see how we can bring in
more girls and even actually pay special
attention to them that their needs are
being fulfilled the focus is not so much
an education instead of funny if they
have fun you don't come back yeah
they're motivated that's right right and
this all kind of started with your son
in Minecraft right yeah yeah lost last
year he asked me Dad my jar is broken
when you draw how do you know what a jar
is oh my club is a it has john cage with
any java java evangelist to our advocate
my lights go on let's take care of it so
i explained in the concert ran the very
first workshop in my living room and
then now here we are this year as part
of the day box for kids USA we have done
about thousand kids in about twenty plus
workshops all over the Bay Area lots of
girls not suppose
it's like a crazy it's like a wildfire
rock right oh yeah so not a wild thing
let's talk about let's make the change
gears so tell me what's going on in the
travel eating space for your right so uh
Joey I think this very well thriving
javelin 7 was really last year june i'm
feeling in general very good community
reactions all the websocket staff all
the json batch processing that we are
very excited about it at the moment
there are three compliant application
server to glass place while fly and
juice there's a good fraction between
all of those observers to class ? life
will be heavily used right now java is a
recently completed filing about seven or
eight jsr so it's not that the java ee
community is sitting idle but we're
already looking at Mesa Community Survey
what needs to be done next to all the
jss have been filed if the MVC jsr which
allow it which will allow you to drink
three model-view-controller right not
just like jsf but more like
action-oriented MVC because i had
support for HTTP to which they are brand
new to the ball that's going to be
sunrise soon hopefully so we also
looking at jay's unbinding loss of these
different stocks which have been filed
by an article then had a spy tgit and
because of the partnership that we have
had with oracle for so long that is
going to be participating in all of
those expert groups because is truly a
community f X so java community process
so JC PTFE so we really emphasize to see
part of it so if i'm an individual
developer and i've heard about the JCP
and i don't wanna get involved but i
don't know where to get started what
would you recommend they frankly the JCP
got all the website is really daunting
okay so then yeah so there's the
official line and then what you really
really so what I do to people people
participate in one of the hacker gardens
no Andre will bring give hand of God and
all around the world if you are at a
local jug not participating there
because the importance to look there you
know you don't want to jump into JCP
right away that one hand a little bit
read about what does it mean what I
guess our what is it gives you peace now
if you care about your persistence then
doing ja'la rotten egg wikiproject a jpa
their spectra java at night subscribe to
the user aliens so you don't have to be
a member number of JCP in order to join
do to be you could be a just an observer
fuji city so you can watch the
discussion about this back as it's going
guys ready so start at that level be an
observer think you like it and see if
you enjoy it and then go at that level
and start talking what about it and if
you like eating on sky's the limit you
know you can go from contributing to
this bag filing gina doing
implementation eaters back right like
you know the dude update time i was done
by media contributor so things like that
that's entirely possible and i've heard
the engineers in oracle say they love it
when somebody just goes and fathers to
read the spec because they have a
completely different respect when you're
inside and you're making the sausage you
kind of lose perspective so it's really
nice to have a person that's actually
going to be using the technology to give
people thanks letting because we are
sometimes so close to the technology we
use that real-world perspective
sometimes if people who are actually
using it is really worried i want to
steer them up i wanna hear them out
what's missing in my spec I wanna hear
them out what the use case is not being
considered what is being considered is
good that's being done put trust in
French me yeah challenge me know I'm an
athlete wow all they're going to
challenge my body right challenge my
brain ouch
i SPECT gotten much better I liked well
so thank you very much for dropping by
it's always good to see you and where
are you out in the world where is a good
close right on Twitter I haven't widows
or so you can beat me at our Gupta well
I would look at gmail or we'll get that
red hat okay oh you all right come down
to the Java hub or Java I'm malayalam
you doing some presentations I i did my
first tutorial this morning on java ee 7
soup to nuts okay so i was skeptical in
or 830 how many people gonna show up but
there were 200 room capacity and 213
audience in standing room only well time
our goals and i'm actually already
started with my book signings who okay
what sugar this is the mcgraw-hill book
java ee 7 html5 and enterprise web
application development that starting
soon yeah then there are book signing
that O'Reilly boo then there is few more
sessions that i'm doing where are my god
