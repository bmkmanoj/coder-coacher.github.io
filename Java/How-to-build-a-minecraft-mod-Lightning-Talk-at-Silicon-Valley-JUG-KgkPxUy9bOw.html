enjoying my summer vacation between
fifth and sixth grade and I loved up in
Minecraft and this is my presentation on
how to make a minecraft mod how many
people here play Minecraft few people
that means where we will see you won't
know so what is minecraft minecraft is a
game where you can place and break
blocks you can mind to find raw
materials and crop them into usable
items such as tools weapons and armor
which can be very useful in the gameplay
because let's say you want to divide
something you have to have a pickaxe or
if you want to dig large amounts of dirt
need a shovel and then there's mobs and
monsters pretty much anything with an
artificial intelligence and then the
monsters are other guys have the
articles of telling us about their the
bad guys trying to kill you and then
there's red stone which is a logical
on/off system that can be used to create
very elaborate structures also very
simple ones so what is a mod well the
mod they add remove or change features
of the game and they can be very small
like making mob slower to very giant
like a whole new dimension of 50 new
blocks items and bobs and there's two
types of mods there's a client-side and
server-side now client-side is only for
single player and a dome on your
personal minecraft but a server-side mod
is for a server it won't mod your
Minecraft but it'll not the entire
server and everybody who plays on it so
here are some examples of mods that
people have made there is single player
commands which adds new commands of the
slash explode and / spawn which it
wouldn't be there in the regular game so
let's say you have a bunch of stone and
you want to blow it all up you can use /
explode but if you're in the normal game
you didn't have that you have to break
it block by block and that's boring and
then there's mcedit which makes editing
terrain much easier and that's what I'm
going to demonstrate and it is mo
creatures which adds a whole lot of new
mobs and like these turtles on
screen that I like to order also pretty
useful so let me demonstrate this line
so this is my mcedit world where i'm
going to build a giant wall of something
so if i was in regular minecraft that i
have to build it block by block and like
i said before doing that is really
boring so here i can just basically say
it to how long i want let's say I want
to make it 200 bucks this way and then
two hundred blocks that way that's 400
then I could make it higher and then
fill it with I'll just fill it with some
welcome cold and I save it and for past
experiences i know it to save it again
just in case and then i'll close this
wall onto minecraft and here i have the
world I belt sometimes it takes a while
to load and here I have this giant wall
of gold and nobody likes to build some
block by block so and even if i tried to
build this one block that time i would
take me he'll be an entire day to do it
so that's not what go back to the
presentation
what do you need to make them on first
of all you're going to need maven to
create the mod template or all the files
you're going to use for the BOD then you
will need NetBeans or any other ID to
edit your code and the files you created
then you will need dog bites are on
minecraft bukkit to run the servers and
get the API for the mods and finally
minecraft the test the mods so here are
the steps to make a mod since you all
know a lot more about java than i do
you're going to have all these programs
installed i bet so like the first step
is to download the programs which is
like maven java the ID and everything
else step two is to create a sample
plugin just see you get the hang of it
step three is to download and start the
server and step four is to start botting
it with the bucket API now here's the
structure of a plugin I made and I think
it'd be better if I just showed it to
you the actual thing
I think it's starting to open it out
nothing to show it in the presentation
or not I guess so
so here's a plug and i made called money
plugin which adds like money and chops
the normal game and those aren't there
in the normal game so the first file i'm
going to talk about let me miss b's
first so the first time i've talked
about is money plugin Java which is the
first file that gets involved when you
enable or disable the plugin and tell us
exactly what happened when either of
those two actions is what happens then
there's money listen or Java which is
really where the action happens so if I
want it to make it so that if I left
click on a sign will give me five
dollars I have to add in here so
everything that goes on in Game happens
in here next is plugin gamma which is
basically the configuration file and it
has all the basics which is the author's
name the plugins name and a few others
then there's palm XML which is it shows
the version of all the things are using
with just maven and Java and bucket so
that's the that's the structure of the
plugin now you're going to all know this
by it was good to me something else to
go over it the java files i make go
through the compiler income classes and
that with the yamo configuration file
become the jar which is the actual
plugin so here's the moss I have made
there is money plugin which adds mind to
the game and also has shops and you can
buy and sell items and i'm going to show
you an example of shop don't have any
information so i want to show it here
so this shop here it's basically the
sign is the actual shop of this is
selling what it's selling or buying so
the template for the shop is the first
line says if it's if you're buying or
selling so here's by the next line says
the quantity of items so here's is by
one of some random item then the left
the third line says the item ID number
and this case it's 122 or a dragon egg
so say to buy one of a dragon egg and
the last line says the price so here is
basically saying if I left with on the
side little i can buy one of a dragon
egg four hundred thousand dollars and a
few other things that I did at the money
blogging is that if you break a block or
place a block you also get one cent and
create something out of a furnace you
can get to me another mod that I made is
called random plugin because it really
is me of them and what it does is it
gives you TT exp when you kill them all
and bows will shoot gas fire balls which
you'd normally think that those two
arrows but and gas fire walls are
basically like explosion projectiles
really so here's a sample of code they
wrote but they could be better to show
you what that means
so here i have this method called double
exp and this annotation here shows that
it's an event handler and you can handle
a certain event the event that's going
to handle as shown here called egg TV
des event or it as a mom here it's
setting this variable exp with star set
at zero and setting it to the drop to
exp from the mob and then it's basically
doubling it here and setting the drop
exp to that variable successfully
doubling the EXP drop this next method
here it's all tournament handler called
evil balls which happens when you shoot
above entity shoot moment and you have
making a variable called player of type
player and then setting it to the person
who shot the arrow and then it's sending
a message in green saying ribbit because
I like frogs and then lastly it's
getting the player guide the world
they're in and spawning a gas fire ball
at their head and with the default
settings it will point the to the
direction that player is pointing
here are some references for further
information this first URL here is about
the Minecraft workshop me and my dad did
for basically what we did is we invited
a few of my friends to come over and
they had no programming experience at
all and we taught them the basics of
java on how to make a minecraft mod and
then this neck and link is a more
generic link about not just minecraft
body but other kinds of programming too
does anybody have any questions send
them to you I guess anybody else have
any questions nobody well it wasn't like
that hard but still dick take I don't a
lot of time yeah
and the other questions no okay then i
got thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
