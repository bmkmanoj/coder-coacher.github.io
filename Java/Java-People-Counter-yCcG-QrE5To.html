technology Network we're here on the
floor of javelin talking to members of
the Java community I've got Olek kvass
key with me did I totally ruined your
name tell me how to pronounce your name
all I could to Kolski thank you so he's
our architect that does all sorts of
cool things with java embedded and you
have a rockin demo here so will you
explain it to me yeah absolutely we're
very proud of demos it's a lot of work
went into it so what we build is a live
demo counting people going in and out of
number of different locations was an
Oracle OpenWorld in Java one we have our
biggest venue at this event for the Holy
Week at Moscone where all the keynotes
taking place both Java and Oracle
OpenWorld all wired up counting people
going in and out let me quickly show you
a couple of devices that were using this
is a device built by our partner company
called your attack this is people
counter device it is essentially a
stereoscopic camera that allows to track
people as a saves the blobs no there's
no facial recognition there is no there
is no detection of race gender we are
only tracking shapes and we're tracking
a direction of movement so it because
it's stereoscopic it takes picture in 3d
so we can detect vector movement
so that it results in our ability to
detect how many people going in and out
and what directions are going so this
device is connected to the gateway this
is where all the smarts are this is our
runs embedded Java in the trance a
software that connects pulls the data
from the game forms a people counter
devices consolidates it and push it up
in the cloud so up in the cloud we are
running a java-based application
environment that analyzes data
it's a based on Oracle event processing
and based on the Oracle business
intelligence software so we're a capable
to process the data and extract
intelligence a lot me give you example
the type of intelligence of we're
extracting we're capable to take a
specific period of time the end of time
and detect in what direction are people
going what's a trend are more people
coming in or facility are living and we
can map it over time we can track I we
can compare occupancy level of different
locations with a configure capacity how
many seats are in the room but we also
can compare to maximum allowed capacity
is something the fire marshal regulation
dictates of something number which
cannot be exceeded a specific location
and generate alarms if numbers
approaches a predefined limit we can for
instance in there we we monitoring
registration room down there in the
Hilton ground level where people are
registering for Java Vaughn and it has
two doors exit and entrance and I say
flow of people design in such a way is
it that they supposed to enter so wander
and exits or another and we capable of
monitoring it what direction are people
flowing and if it is not what organizers
intended to do they can detect this and
take action put signage deploy
additional resources to to optimize
people flow so it's all extracting out
of out of the people count information
and here on a screen we have it
or that gives visualization of all this
information so our water I have right
now and it's all coming are you time so
what we have all right now is a main
dashboard that shows the real time
information it's a right now there's a
key note going on in whole G and we have
a close to 5,000 people about 50%
capacity and we can see that right now
there is a cloud keynote ongoing markers
on Oracle partners in the enterprise
cloud so we can look at the real time
information we can go and look at the
historical data we can see trends we can
see over over time we can pick one of
the days of the event did specific
location and you see how arguments of
this location change so we see there was
event in the morning that peaked out at
about 2 to 2500 people and hold in
Moscone then it went down to a couple of
hundred and as in keno started around 1
o'clock this afternoon we see spike and
it's still ongoing and we are as I
mentioned that there are five and a half
thousand people right now so this is all
data collected live from the devices
installed at the doors entrances to
different venues what I just mentioned a
minute ago we can we're monitoring
Giavanna registration evolve and we see
all the spikes how attendance how how
many people are registered over time and
we can see right here in the table on
their own they arrive we can see a
directional pattern so exit and
entrances and see how they complying
with intent of people so all right now
we see that it's actually all working
out well more people are coming in so
the entrance and exiting sirs exit but
being a Java one and you know knowing
all the geeks around they ends a is a a
inherited inability to comply with the
rules with we see there's always a
couple of outliers who are for the
bucking the trend and actually exiting
standards and entering Sousa exit but
that's okay so it's actually proof said
that our model working and we really
getting live data wow that's really cool
Oleg and so this is an Indian the
application from the sensors up to the
cloud to the wonderful UI is all Java so
Java across the board from a small very
small device inspectors and all the way
to the enterprise so it's a our proof of
concept of the real-life m2m application
life running here at the doing that Wow
thank you very much it's so cool to see
this time to spend time with you there's
a story wheel with the Oracle technology
