the Java hub and we're doing streaming
of live interviews all this week at
javaone with me I have Nicholas turning
welcome Nicolas thank you and this guy
is the evil genius behind Robo BM which
lets you run Java on iOS devices so a
lot of people probably don't even know
it's possible to run Java and I us
wanted to why don't you explain a little
bit of the magic behind robe of um yeah
sure so with rubble vm we make it
possible to develop iOS apps using java
but also other JDM languages so
basically what we do is to take your
java bytecode your door closed files and
we convert those into machine code that
can run on the iOS device CPU or in the
iOS simulator yeah that's pretty much
what how it works internally Oh
so what sort of applications have you
seen people using rub a vm to develop so
far it's been mostly games actually
because we yeah we helped the lib edicts
people the community lyrics make their
framework work really well on iOS so I
were to back in for robo vm for Libby
legs so i would say that so far it's
probably like ninety nine percent of the
apps or games so yeah I mean for mobile
devices that also describes the number
of apps in the App Store which are games
which is yeah okay yeah that's true
that's really close your idea of your
say but what we're doing right now is to
bind all those api's that Apple has for
building iOS apps so you can actually
use everything that you could have done
using object you see or Swift and apples
tools you can now do with robo vm so at
our session like earlier today we showed
how you can build just any kind of app
using the native UI controls and yeah
services it's really cool so for a lot
of folks who are getting started with
robo vm what's the workflow like how
would they how would they get started to
know so you get started you first of all
you have to go to apple and download
xcode that's actually the the apple
licensing card in developer program and
all that stuff I think it's harder put
in using robo vm like getting a proper
apple developer
and software keys and all that stuff
unfortunately you have to go to apple to
get the xcode and get your provisioning
profiles and certificates and stuff into
order there's no way around that but you
need that our normal i asked alvin yeah
yeah that's nice but once you got the
exporting stool right now we have
support for eclipse so you were going
into the Eclipse marketplace just search
for a movie m install the app the
plug-in and then it's yeah it's very
straightforward just create a robo vma's
project Cody or I've used the artist
plug-in for netbeans and that works
really well ok as well so you just same
thing NetBeans choose the JavaFX in iOS
plugin yeah and you're off building
application yeah really quickly yeah
cool yeah so I think it's pretty I mean
from the start we've always had user
experience and user I mean accessibility
of political yeah you sir yeah we try to
make it easy and get started and develop
and as a Java developer barrier venturi
yeah no yeah definitely so the idea is
that as a Java developer you shouldn't
have to relearn all of those things I
mean we take the language out of the
equation we take the tools out another
cookie equation to a large large extent
if you want to go the native API route
you have to learn ate the ice but a
portal back you can just use your Java
yeah see you have the option of going to
native API is now have you guys
abstracted out a lot of the common
things like accessing sensors
things on devices are you going data for
a lot of stuff so far you will have to
use the native stuff but I mean would it
would be nice if we have some kind of
abstraction layer for some other things
you could actually use it use the same
code on Android and on iOS so yeah there
there are some things that we need to do
to be able to make iOS and Android app
development easier well so you know
probably one of the first questions I
think people have when they hear about
Java running on iOS is they probably
remember when flash got pulled out of
the app store and they're like oh no no
no applesauce except i have location
like you know i'm going to issues with
getting stuff except in the store so is
that is that true or is that just beer
in doubt it's only fair don't it's it's
a known issue actually applehead that's
in their guidelines for I think four or
five months in 2010 yeah yeah so they
basically they said that any iOS app has
to be built using Xcode and C C++
objective c or java script that was the
yeah what they said in the guidelines
but i removed that off to five months i
think well i think they inadvertently
disqualified most of their gaming apps
yeah so and they're also although built
using third-party frameworks anyway
there's a fun a number of other cross
platform tools now like accelerator some
rain some rain were around at that time
as well they were called mono touch i
think at that time and I mean yeah I
think they by trying to kill flash they
kill a lot of other things so I had to
take it away from the guidelines ok so I
think the second biggest question people
have is about performance
so how does how does robo vm fair in
terms of performance if you compare to
what you would get if you stop acta see
it's very competitive so what we do is
that we take as i said before we take
quite code which was formatted machine
code that runs directly on the cpu
there's no interpreter there's no jit
compiler over here do anything ok and we
reduced the same things that you use
when you develop an object you see you
would use the seal and compiler in Xcode
we're actually basing this on the same
llvm project that they're using a CLA so
it's very performant to machine code
that we produce and also if you use a
week to see there are actually quite a
lot of overhead for instance when you
call a method in OBT see method dispatch
is dynamic so you would have it's
similar to a dictionary lookup and then
yeah okay so so you're actually job on
my awesome static lookups which are more
efficient and the web live get this java
virtual virtual method dispatch is a lot
more efficient nice maybe i should make
that the default language for ourselves
yeah i think they should a good idea
okay so so last annoying question about
people's concerns and just pretend I'm
not working this so I think one of the
big concerns people have is about
licensing a job on embedded devices yeah
so how do you guys approach that Yeah
right now we're using Android yeah
across library we are looking at obj
decade because that's where all the
innovation happens yeah android us into
java 8 we just added lambdas to robo vm
actually so we do that now natively and
the fourth methods but it's not I don't
see that happening anytime soon in
Android and they are not going to
implement all those Joe 8 APR anytime
soon so we would like to migrate to open
ddk at least making that an option and
yeah I think that would make Oracle more
happier buttocks ya know and I think I
think there's you know not speaking for
any product Direction future releases
etc I think that that is something
Oracle's interested in yeah yeah so
that's something that we would
definitely want to do it's not something
you do in a week or so it's a lot of
work but that's where the few trees I
believe cool all right so I noticed we
have a few people hang out in the
audience and one of them works on
android port yeah for doing javafx stuff
so what are your what are your plans for
Android do you guys like you know you
have cross compilation technology you
you've extracted a stuff out how much of
this applies to other mobile platforms
yeah that's a good question we actually
would like to pour this over to Android
right now there is no real competitive
advantage in doing so I mean we can't
really compete with dalvik or a RT from
google because we do pretty much the
same and there will be a would be an
overhead overhead if you wanted to use
the Android API ice but if we do open a
decay we get all those nice go VAP ice
we could pull it over to Android okay
and then you would have a competitive
area language wise and you would have a
cross-platform story as well definitely
okay cool so thanks very much for your
time Nicholas thank you for having me
thanks and to find out more about romo
vm you can check out their website or
you know hit them up on twitter at 4am
yeah definitely okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
