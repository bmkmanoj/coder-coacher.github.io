technology Network and I'm she at TDC
with Louie any corner playin you hi hi
how are you good solo yeni tell us what
you do for a living I'm actually a
product manager at Citibank and I'm also
author of free ebooks all them about xjs
so you are the track owner of Java's
does JavaScript track at TDC yes I'm
coordinator of two tracks one it's html5
and JavaScript and the second one is
user experience and front-end so tell us
a little bit about JavaScript and and
how it integrates with Java this is very
interesting because right in the past
developers used a lot JSP only so the
whole project will be in only with Java
and right now this scenario is changing
a lot especially in Brazil we can see a
lot of projects that using both
technologies javascript HTML 5 lot of
CSS and also job on the backend and
especially now with servlets 3 it's a
lot of easier to integrate with any and
JavaScript framework you choose xjs or
jQuery or kendo UI any any other
preference and also Java provides a lot
of technologies that makes it really
easy to integrate such as jax-rs so you
can develop rest applications and even
if you want to to go with other
frameworks because job it's a very big
world so if you can even use with the
struts even the divert the first version
we can still see a lot of banking
account systems here in Brazil use and
struts one and also was I spring in jsf
and a lot of frameworks so what do you
think about the java ee 7
release I was very happy because I'm a
really big fan of Java in I'm really a
big fan of JavaScript and html5 and now
that G Hawaii is supporting html5 so I
was yay so do you think you will get a
chance to work with people who use java
java ee yes we even had some some
sessions in our tracks from some oracle
speakers talking about the features of
java ee with html5 WebSockets and also
the features of NetBeans how he makes
really easy for so you can develop
systems with html5 and the back so it's
really great ok thank you so much for
talking to us today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
