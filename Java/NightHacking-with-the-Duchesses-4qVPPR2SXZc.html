hacking and i'm joined together here
with regina Linda you are Java Duchess's
and we're gonna this is actually the
last day of dev ox which is a huge
conference in antwerp yes and we're
going to chat about some of the things
which you guys did at devoxx deadlox for
kids it's maybe some upcoming
conferences and anything else switches
which is of interest so how this house
the device conference with deaf dogs was
great lots of interesting topics discuss
lots of friends we met again and any
touches friends um yeah we had some and
some new Duchess's know excellent so
maybe just to help people could you
describe what the Duchess organization
yes um so basically it's a network for
women interested in Java and we hold
social events technical events coding
events all kinds of fun stuff and
there's chapters all over the world and
we're trying to get more and more
countries involved and there's an active
chapter in France and Sweden I think
Indonesia Africa what was it I think the
Duchess's were founded in in the
Netherlands okis that's where we're from
and that's where it started but right
now well we've been trying to get active
again but we're not that active yet kind
of hard because we had lost half our
board oh that's that's so we're trying
to get going again well I like the I
like the logo on the t-shirt yes it's a
great thing that they open source the
Duke yes and they did it right before we
try to launch Duchess oh and then at one
point the timing was perfect
and at one point we had forgotten to
take the TM out of the picture of Duke
we taken and put the bowl on never liked
you can't trade market we didn't sorry
we made a mistake very nice so how about
DevOps for kids so def works for kids is
a great initiative that started with
deaf Fox and Stefan and Tasha Carl and
they now are franchising is everybody
can use it it's free no trademarks or
anything and we're planning stuff on
actually he yes he kind of had a call
for action to us for user groups to yes
I creator he did several calls he did
one at the keynote when he day announced
a fox for kids with a great video they
did at the first one they did in French
British and Belgium and then he did a
second call at the job leaders buff
which was last night and was I think he
was a bit overwhelmed with the response
of how many people said yes we want to
go and start the defects for kids we
planning one at least one and i think
they say even to because there was a
company that said oh that's something we
want to do for our employees and their
kids and Stefan introduced us to them
and the french girls are also doing a
deaf works for kids in France in Paris
but we still have to find out all the
laws that because that differs per
country and stem was saying we should
make it a relay and instead of pass the
torch maybe start pasta now or something
then now is actually a robot so so so
that the now is actually in the logo for
that box I think that's what the robot
is right yeah the in the logo for deaf
Oxford for kids yeah there's a robot of
that there's a robot in their small
robot it's and now that's not of liked
the UH
it would be too much for kids without a
it's it's a toy for big kids but it
inspires kids if they see that little
robot because it's really maybe 50 cent
no it's not even that yeah it's about
that big and it's it's inspires kids
when it's sitting there on the table
when they come in and it really looks
like a small child and then it all of a
sudden starts moving it even worked it
def Fox with the five dancing robots at
the keynote good although I miss them
you shouldn't drive inside with your
motorbike 10 yeah yeah we were surprised
that people would allow you to drive
indoors yeah I'm not sure how easy that
getting us to get permission but
apparently over in Europe is not that
hard because I heard you did it at j fo
as well yeah so um yeah we're planning
to do the Deaf excrete it's a def fox
but then for smaller kids because this
is the def Fox for big kids and cool
they will work oh that's fun then so we
will do a session with the Mars rover so
kids can program them it's mindstorm
robots Tasha put the initial version yes
it's an open source program it's called
Sagan project and ended that ask how
that worked out well yeah they did that
as Conda was really great and we're
going we showed it off at j fo
unfortunately there were no kids there
but maybe it wouldn't have fit anyway
but when we showed up our Martian
landscape and so there's a mars
landscape and you program your mind
storm mini rover to do missions on Mars
and there's all kinds of things then
they have to go somewhere that looks
like a lake and it has a whole story so
that's for kids it makes it more fun
yeah and they get some accomplished
and it's fast feedback because the
second project has a simulator it so
they see on the screen moving the little
robots around and if that works and they
can put it on the mindstorm and then it
can put it on the lens in the Mars scape
and it shows it cool so that's one of
the things and one of the other things
will be a scratch workshop okay yeah and
because that's yeah because most likely
will be kids 10 till 12 and their bit
too young to use to be in food maybe
yeah and because English is not their
first language it also makes
indifference and maybe something else
online store my oh yeah it's on the
video they have the little robot trying
to like yeah that was that yeah that was
the mindstorm him and they're in bed the
Belgium one infant they had different
age groups goes one of the schools they
were doing it they asked for all their
kids so yeah there were some older kids
they're also on the movie yes so what
other sort of events are you are you
guys doing upcoming um actually at the
end of the month um this is not really a
part of dutches per se but in the
netherlands we have an organization for
women in technology and they set up a
mentoring project and a role model
project so I'm going to a primary school
to tell that what it's like to be a
programmer to show customers kids yeah
to talk to them about what it is what it
really is instead of what they see on TV
so that'll be nice Imran well also to
show them that being a geek is okay yeah
yeah and well we'll see how that works
and probably do it again and maybe also
do like the
you I bet if you brought the number of
it they think you would be awesome
fortunately it's really expensive so I
don't have one yet we're working on that
but that's a little too short notice to
get it done but i'll probably do it
again unless they really kill me but i
don't think so oh and we're also working
on a new website oh we're we're really
going to get going again in the
beginning of next year and build a
really cool website with all the stuff
we need for a duchess java yes we're
gonna do it in a life rate is side okay
yeah actually i use fly pray for Lahti
open source projects i do you like Jeff
extras and the purge I effects book a
bunch of other stuff well basically they
had a lot of the components we want it
is pre-installed if we could just use
and so we thought well if we don't like
them exactly we'll just figure out if we
can tweak them and build the extra stuff
we need just get ready to get a nice big
server go to rehab yeah cloudbees were
gracious enough to sponsor us for that
very good very much so um anything any
other events you're welcome change oh um
for next year we're looking at some new
conferences to go to and it's doing some
more speaking oh so they're going to be
two more calls for paper for conference
that will be early next year there will
be two more dead Fox spin-offs the Deaf
Fox France and the deficit was a big
announcement that might not have then we
might have missed it yet so far and so
december first they will open the call
for papers so i think like given the
number of people in the waiting list for
DevOps if just all the people in waiting
list signed up for DevOps UK it would
already be over full i think they hit
run four thousand people i think bronze
had 1200 yeah and i think the targets to
run a thousand for DevOps UK definitely
canyon he mentioned the waiting list was
204 I thought
oh I'm not sure yeah people every year
it gets a lot of new friends stefaniak
gets so here every every time he's
complaining and then they said okay
we're going to do deaf Fox France and
they did so maybe then there won't be
any French or at least less French
people here again we're less fresh
French people this year but still not
many like 20 less yeah there they were
great and but they do a lot of talks and
they really active in the community so
yeah and for them it's like an hour by
train aside calico story guys we've done
a great job downstairs too I was right I
can I those guys yeah so we're going to
send him some papers for those those two
and let's see what all happens maybe be
some reviewer for some other conferences
like Oscar trying to do it for Jeff one
I have to talk to her this gentleman now
are here so you wanna talk to somebody
who's maybe a content Jennifer for
general yeah but yeah maybe do something
for Jay focus I'm not sure yet I have to
talk to my tias for that we're thinking
of doing everything thinking about what
we are doing here for the kids and if it
still fits there but ya know but i think
it's it's a lot of it has to do with how
the content how the conference is
willing to adjust to accommodate like at
austin for the green light for girls
yeah they brought them to lunch and
included them in part of the conference
and then gave them a nice space in the
pavilion where they could interact with
other folks yeah but there was space for
that like a joyful there was no buta
like that space they gave green light
for girls could have been given to a leg
of paying sponsor so you have to yeah
you have to really yeah yeah that's
always it's always different no but I
mean if the conference's is willing to
make those
priorities that's easier yeah but
sometimes it's just giving a talk about
right yeah could be valuable to be dead
as well so and then yeah we're going to
do some technical more technical
sessions in the Netherlands again not
only working on the website because that
will be your small group and some social
sessions as well and just maybe teach
some of the ladies and women in our
group how to teach kids how to program
so then more people can go to schools
and ya know one of the things I thought
like RiRi girls and Trish's session yes
okay which one of the three seed it
actually we were on all three server
like one of the things I thought was
good as a call for action was being a
role model for forum for kids and for
fun we were learning technology and the
more the more active woman we have
showing that this is a great career path
it encourages kids to look at that
especially yep this in the Netherlands
we already have this organization afford
a role model so if I can find the time I
want to look in if this X organizations
exist abroad so we can push more people
into participating there and if they
don't exist well maybe find somebody to
do it to start it yeah yeah because in
the Netherlands it's a government funded
organization so they really have all the
proper connections 27 the entire thing
up yes you have enough credibility
existing organizations yes resource
under resource pools always a good thing
to do yes yeah use use existing
organization because they have to
network we both don't have kids so yeah
getting into schools is always a problem
if you don't know the connections yep
and it's easier if you already have kids
soon and that you take to technical
things and you get collections
yeah but sometimes it differs also for
her country what you can do and what you
need and all kinds of insurance and
stuff yeah and I i actually used well
place be part of a co-op where it was
all Peregrin and like they had all these
weird like background checks and special
vaccinations and like there's a whole
list of things you have to do to be part
of the coop because you are helping to
run the school so you are a child what
our child care giver yeah that's
different country and if you're just
running a small event like that box for
kids you need you know qualified you you
need most likely a background check and
and even not heard from in France you
need a special permit to do it so and it
did french girls found out it's easy to
talk to the Ministry of Education to get
that permit then to go to their local
governments so they're now working
together with the Department for
Education so yeah it saves them that if
in Paris anyway so cool so what's what's
up what's up next before before you
leave enter um see no first wisdom the
medieval dinner not tonight this couple
of people yeah everyone I almost forgot
about yet upon yours but we might really
reminded me reminded him of it so he
said we're taking in video so it and and
then yet sleep and then tomorrow back to
the nano spectra yeah cool and then back
back to work yeah yeah that that thing
where you're supposed to apply all your
technical knowledge all the all the cool
things you saw here oh sorry plus mostly
robots yeah we don't know what
would be fun so yeah cool all right so
anything else like you wanna mention or
leave with people or yeah be visible
make sure and try to be an officer but
try to be a speaker start small join
your local joke yeah yeah I mean it's
sometimes it's a it's a hard hurdle to
get over but actually the way I'm like I
started speaking intentionally when I'm
my first book got published but the way
I started was speaking at the local user
groups that's what we encourage as well
yeah start small talks about or at your
company but it might be scary because
you have to see those people every day
yeah I think like like speaking in front
of people you know better is actually
harder yep yeah differs per person but I
think you're right for most people yet
but like user groups are good because
everybody's scared everybody like like
the folks the rest of the people in the
audience understand that you're what
you're going through and that you're
nervous and sure start by short
lightning talks like five minutes yeah
that can be good but sometimes some
formats are trickier than others like
ignite talks are very difficult yeah but
ignite turned off by that yeah but
ignite is really something totally
different under side making sure talks
but not all short talks no I mean
lightning talks where lightning
lightning talks are or the quickie such
they were cold here yeah just find
something that you're passionate about
officer good bus also this those are
totally informal yeah just make sure
that sometimes the speaker's get a free
pass but not every buff speaker gets a
free pass so if you're going to speak
because you get a free pass that's not
always the case
which I i like to do with folks it's all
a lot kisses I'll go speak with people
yeah that's what we try to do as well
like for instance in elementary people
for instance the the buff we did do
every time and we did at javaone I
always invite a cow speaker yeah it's
even because a lot of people don't go to
conferences because they think oh it's
nothing for me or it's too expensive and
or they don't even know about it and
then yeah I find invite them as a co
speaker and they can come and see how it
is and yes some people like it yeah
that's a bit how we push trisha into
being a speaker as well and see where he
got in a year and I should know she was
a sort of forced to speak last year at
javaone because they wanted to extort
mentioning it we did win it this year so
yeah we were really surprised when we
heard it but graduation yeah was really
cool so yep we didn't even know we were
nominated in the first place would even
more of a surprise yeah some talks from
some people were all of a sudden
clicking when we found out that we won
so yeah alright cool so um yeah let me
just the time to close which may be
shitty there yeah we go do dinner so um
for folks who are watching the stream if
you want to watch more videos check out
night hacking calm all of the videos are
listed and I'm soon gonna list all of
our night hackers come on the site and
