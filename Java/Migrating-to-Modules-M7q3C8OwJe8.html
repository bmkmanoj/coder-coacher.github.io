modules the sequel two modules in one
lesson I guess I lied it wasn't really
one lesson well it was it was an
introductory lesson but there it is so
how many so many people that saw that
session this morning okay good that'll
help a bit but I'll try to make this
relatively independent so this is
another live coding session I will make
mistakes please shout them out if you
think you can help questions of
clarification are welcome during the
main part but deeper questions let's try
and hold those for the end please so
what we're gonna do here is look at a
little application a slightly bigger
application then we look at this morning
I've got JDK 9 here build 180 181 the GA
version or take this little application
that we're gonna do - we're gonna do two
things first we're gonna modularize it
from the top down now this application
uses some popular but as yet unmonitored
libraries and will show how you can
modular eyes a little app even before
it's dependencies have been modularized
by their maintainer
then we'll do the opposite thing we'll
go back to just having a regular
classpath application and we'll modular
eyes its dependencies we'll pretend that
we're the maintainer z' of these
libraries we'll modularize those and
we'll show how that works with the class
battle application then finally at the
end we'll wind up with an actual fully
modular eyes application so first things
first right rather rather than doing a
boring boring old hello world I thought
I'd do something a little bit a little
bit richer here so I've got a file here
of tweets in JSON format you know the
XML of a 21st century it's well maybe a
little more readable than XML I'm not
sure
so let's write write a little app to
display these in a more readable format
now we don't have to write it because
I've already got it or tweet some is the
name of the app it's got a main Clyde
it's got two classes unlike this
morning's app it's got two I've got two
classes let's take a look I've got a
main class it uses the Jackson XML sorry
the Jackson JSON data binding library
you know this is very simple I create
that creates an object mapper makes a
list of tweets reading from system input
and then displays those tweets on
standard output in it and it uses this
tweet class nearby little poder up
represents a tweet it's using a single
timestamp to represent the time using
more Jackson's stuff we've got to
annotate annotated properties a
timestamp property and the text property
which is just the text
all right so that's pretty simple let's
compile it and and just show that it
works before we attempt to change
anything in my Lib directory I've got
Jackson the 3:3 Jackson jar files that I
need these are these are slightly old
version but for these purposes it
doesn't really matter let's compile
these so what do we do the Java C - D
classes class let's see if they're live
Jackson and it start with core data bind
live Jackson annotations and I'll just
find everything I can and compile it a
lot right now let's make a jar file
and this is all very mundane that is one
of the loudest fun buzzers I've ever
heard
okay and just to show that everything
works we can we can run it at that long
awful classpath add my my tweet some guy
and what do we get
there we go tweets the tweets in a more
readable format okay
woohoo that's our that that's our
starting point so let's start by
modularizing tweets um here's the
structure again just to remind you what
we're going to do is we're going to put
a module declaration in the org dot
tweets um directory
module or tweets um and now in a module
I need to declare what my module exports
and what it requires so this this is a
little application module it doesn't
export any API so there aren't gonna be
any exports in it right
but code in this module uses the JAXA
those three Jackson libraries but but
what do i do how do i what I do here
what I'd like to write is Jackson core
or you know calm down faster XML
something or but I don't actually have a
Jackson core module all I've got is is a
Jackson core jar file and the same for
the other Jackson libraries that are
sitting there so I mean the the things
in plain old RAR files they aren't
modules right there's no there's no
module info in those now I could go and
edit those jar files and sort of force
module infos in modules and fatah class
files into them but that's probably not
a good a good idea it's generally never
a good idea in this with jar files
provided by someone else so the answer
here is a feature in jigsaw called
automatic modules so an automatic module
is way of taking a relatively sane jar
file or set a relatively sane jar files
and just treating them as modules even
though they don't have module infant
class files in them this is for for
top-down migration it requires a couple
of things above all those jar files for
example they can't have conflicting
packages so there have conflicting
packages you have to leave them on a
class path but Jackson is a well
engineered system and there there aren't
conflicting packages so that's not a
problem with automatic modules the name
of the module is taken from the name of
the jar file which is probably not the
actual name of the actual name that the
that module will be given by its
maintainer when its maintainer gets
around to it so this is why in top-down
migration we recommend that if you're if
you're using things as automatic modules
don't
publish your own module because you'll
be declaring dependencies on something
that might have a different name when
its maintainer actually want module
arises it anyway for two but for
top-down migration this is pretty good
heuristic if you're just doing models on
your own for now until your dependencies
have caught up so at this point I can
write it requires Jackson Core requires
Jackson data deveined requires Jackson
notation set annotation or annotations
annotations and that should work right
that is a really loud phone buzzer it's
gonna be on the recording so there's a
there's another way to figure out what
what things your existing code might
need and that's with the Jade EPS tool
that I mentioned at the keynote
yesterday so Jade EPS is kind of a Swiss
Army knife of static analysis for for
code that runs on top of the JDK just as
a side note very important one is the
JDK internals option you can you run
with this option that will look at an
existing jar file or seven jar files and
see if there any uses of JDK and
journals and happily there are no uses
of JDK internal api's in our little
application okay so that's good you can
also you can also use this - s option
we'll show you some more that not found
is because I need to tell it where to
find the rest of the dependencies here
so let me copy
that so J tips we'll look at all of this
stuff now we see that Jade EPS is saying
that there's code and Ord tweet some jar
that is gonna want stew use things in
these Jackson jar files and that'll
probably work as if you treat them as
automatic moms it's also telling us it
noticed what we forgot that or tweet
some jar is using using that timestamp
class in the Java sequel module so we
forgot that and we need to add that here
requires Java not sequel otherwise it
won't compile and certainly won't run
all right so we've got our our
modularized application here let's
remove that and compile it we're gonna
compile first two mods directory the
modular form of classes directory module
path Lib we tell the compiler modules
source path
source Java C is a Java C has a deep
understanding of the structure of a
source tree so you can structure a
source tree as with with with per module
directories and just tell it go compile
the tweets and module and and it'll just
grab the whole thing you don't have to
list individual Java source files by
yourself whoops model that you gotta
type it right mark there we go now in
our mods directory we've got out as an
exploded exploded module we can job a
pea
there's our compiled module info as it
has exactly what we expect in it ok
let's create a jar file for that here
we're gonna take it
from there and we're gonna put it in the
Lib directory and along the way let's
add it let's add a main class when you
package up a modular jar or even a non
modular jar for that matter you can
specify the main class the entry point
for it and we're just gonna say as a
convenience that the the main class is
in is org tweets in tweets um main yep
that should work there we go the
marginal modular tweets um jar file and
now we can run it we're gonna run it
with
the module path is live so remember in
live we now have we have our jackson
annotation jar files an unchanged
they have just downloaded from maven
central and the tweet some jar file that
we just built will say java module path
lib and ask it to run tweet some
application and we get an exception oh
no what happened
what happened was we missed something
when we modular eyes so let's take a
look at the exception java.lang reflect
inaccessible object exception unable to
make org tweet some tweet accessible
module word tweet some does not open org
to tweet some to module jackson dot data
bind so basically what's going on here
the Jackson data binding library like
most data binding libraries is using
reflection to dig in to the POJO class
that it's trying to support and that's
not working that's not working because
the module declaration for the tweet
some module doesn't make it available
it's you know it's an internal package
but in this case it's not quite totally
internal because well as the author of
the tweets and module ID I know I'm
using Jackson data binding it's okay for
Jackson data binding to access the guts
of my of my internal class I actually
want it to do that now what I could do
is exports like a I mean I could try
exports or tweet zone I've tried it a
try to export that package that might
work but I'm sorry actually that won't
work I misspoke so let's see what
happens I'm gonna use a little little
command a clicked up called Jada @jj to
save some time so let's let's recompile
and repackage
our module and try to run it again so I
mean
sorry
thank you
live coding is always a bit of a
high-wire act all right let's try this
again and what's gonna happen the same
thing happens and the reason the same
thing happens is that when you export a
package that does not make all of its
all of its non-public members available
for deep reflection it makes them
available available as an API so so
other code can can use the exported API
of that package what we need really need
to do is what that error message
originally suggested which is something
other than export there's this other way
to expose a package and that's called
opens so opens is designed exactly for
this kind of use case you have a package
it's got some classes in it you don't
intend that package to be an API you
don't want other code other codes and
other modules or elsewhere to compile
against it but you do want to allow
something like a data binding binding
library to use deep reflection on it so
basically you can think of it at a high
level it's it's it's exporting out at
compile time only at runtime and at
runtime allow reflection on non public
members of the types of Av of even non
public types did you a quick question
indeed I can if I if I want to be a
little bit paranoid I can say open zorg
tweets m2 jackson data bind this is
called a qualify and qualified open that
you can also do qualified exports if you
want to export something just to one
other module or set of modules to have
you know an even higher level of
integrity in your system
okay so let's JJ that guy up again and
now it works okay so now we've got the
modular application it's using the
Jackson libraries as automatic modules
and we're done with the first step okay
tip it take to get make a click you get
a little bit of a closer look let's make
a little JRE so we can we can see what's
going on I'm just gonna run j-link real
quick here so I list the modules in this
in this Jerry it's got just the modules
that this application needs
we're gonna can run it don't need don't
need all those modules in the JDK all
70-odd of them there there's some some
into some good options in the Java
launcher now for diagnosing the module
system you can do show module resolution
and it will display information as the
resolver works to figure out what
modules you need so it starts with the
the root module in this case for the
resolution process is the tweet some
module it sees tweet some requires
sequel requires Jackson data bind it
shows you the URLs at which it finds
those in the case of the sequel module
that's in the the jrt URL that's or the
internal nya virtual file system in
which you can find all the classes
inside the JDK finds annotations finds
core down here figures out that's sequel
oh yeah that means logging and sequel
requires xml binds up some services and
then goes so that's that's what's going
on there that is a really allowed phone
those are I I'm just sorry sorry that's
a door okay
so automatic modules are they're good
for modular izing applications as I said
top-down but they're but they're not
recommended for use in published
libraries now there there is yet another
kind of intermediate step here Monta
lysing existing libraries can can can
sometimes they take a fair bit of work
in order to enable the maintainer x' of
existing libraries to kind of set a
stake in the ground you know declared
this part of the frontier as the module
name they intend to use when they get
around to doing proper modular ization
we've we provided an interim step you
can use a new entry in the jar file
manifest called automatic module name if
that entry is there and your jar file is
not an actual module then the module
system will read that manifest attribute
and use that as the name of the
automatic module that will be created
for your jar file so today it's a kind
of an intermediate weight way point
along the way to modular is
and I've been pleased to see a number of
popular libraries where their maintainer
is already declared automatic module
names in advance of doing the work to
actually figure out what should be in
their module declarations and publishing
them as as actual modules so so that's
great
okay let's rewind here I'm gonna clean
up everything let me leave that for the
moment and through the wonders of
mercurial I'm going to now enter an
alternate universe in which I pretend to
be one of the maintainer z' of the
Jackson libraries so let's recompile the
tweet some application as a regular old
whoops
classpath application
that should do the trick okay
there we go I non-modular jar file so
that's that's how we're gonna operate
without actually if we go let's do
now just true music okay that'll make
things a little easier later on okay so
we imagine we are the main dangers of
the Jackson libraries we've got these
source trees here for Jackson itself you
know calm down pastor mxml Jackson core
blah blah blah all these all these
wonderful classifier Java source files
then it's licensed and so forth so this
could be a biggish project what you know
there's that there's a lot of stuff here
how do we go about it so the directory
structure actually tells us a fair
amount you can kind of guess well you
know annotations is probably you know
each one of these does each one of these
jar files does is you know it kind of
looks like a model a bit of a module
already but how do we figure out what
you know what they export what they
require what they what they what they
need and again we have J Depp's comes to
the rescue
so we run J Depp's on those Jackson jar
files we have still in the Lib directory
and Jade ups this does that same static
analysis that I showed before and shows
what the relationships are so all of any
of these jar files need you know the
base module well everybody needs the
base module data bind uses sequel an XML
and also uses the other two Jackson jar
files
so Jay Depp's has yet another option
remember I did say Swiss Army knife
jaidev's can generate module info draft
module info Java files for you so I'll
do generate module info into a directory
called evil into my source directory
this is a little bit scary I'm using a
tool and it's gonna write into my source
tree okay that's that's alright it'll be
okay
let's do Lib Jackson core first okay so
we have a module info it's always a good
idea to look at what it did here and
we've got jackson core exports a bunch
of packages okay and oh what's this hmm
this says provides what what is all
about so it turns out the module system
knows about services so services are a
fundamental tool in the model system
they're especially useful for breaking
cyclic dependencies when you might think
that to mod to modules each need to
depend depend on the other or through
some more complicated kind of cyclic
relationship the answer more often than
not will be refactor one of them as a
service that the other one looks up and
that will help you break that cycle we
use we've sort of used services
throughout the JDK itself to break many
cycles along the way here
okay so I can actually generate module
infos for all of these at once it does
all three so that Corwin looks pretty
good I probably ought to change the
module name to you know calm Doster XML
dot whatever but I'll just leave that
here for now for simplicity let's look
at the annotations module info check
that out okay it's just going to export
one package that looks all right data
bind module info so a couple of things
here one is we see there's it put
requires in here and in particular it
put in these requires transitive
declarations so when one module requires
another that just means that the for the
first module we'll be able to access the
exported or or open packages of that
other module if yeah you know some third
module requires the first one it's not
gonna see sorry the second one sorry if
this is getting get to become it if if
if module if module a requires B and B&amp;amp;B
exports and packages then module a can
use the exported packages in B if some
third module X requires a it will see
the exported packages of a but it won't
necessarily won't see the exported
packages of B unless X also requires B
but if a uses X in its own api's then as
a convenience to users like like module
X it should do it requires transitive
and it provides the convenience
basically means any module that requires
Jackson data bind will implicitly also
require Jackson annotations and Jackson
core and Java sequel and java xml and j
depth data has a heuristic for figuring
this out by analyzing the type
signatures of public public classes and
interfaces okay so those are the
requires that have generated
and it also generated a bunch of exports
based on the X the package that exists
now Jade EPS has no way of figuring out
what might be internal and why not there
are various conventions people have used
over the years for marking things
internal but in this case we can pretty
easily see there are some imple packages
so we're just gonna comment those out or
heck let's just delete them because
chances are pretty good that that's not
meant to be part of the Jackson API so
we don't need them and there's another
service here than J tips figured that
out by looking at the at the services
directory in meta F okay so we've done
all that let's compile and we're going
to make a new directory mm Lib
we're gonna put the module modular
source modular modular versions of the
Jackson Jackson libraries
Jackson guttacore uses or overrides
abductor deprecated API no that's a
problem for another day the annotations
and data bind bigger module takes a
little longer to compile ooh more
deprecated API okay so now in M Lib
we've got these modular jar files we can
take a look data vine for example ask
the jar tool to describe it and there's
the content of the module declaration in
binary form exports the stuff we
expected requires the things we expected
we're good to go okay so we've got
modularized Jackson we've got our
unmodeled
tweet some application and let's now try
and run them together so Java module
path M Lib where we put the Jackson
modules class path
well let me just use the
tweet some drawer file tweet star Jason
oh yeah there we go
okay something went wrong what went
wrong well what went wrong was I'm
running when you run a class path
application which is what tweets on the
tweets um is the model system doesn't
know what non JDK modules it needs so if
it needs models outside of the JDK you
need to add them manually so what we'll
do is we'll add jackson dot core jackson
data mind
and Jackson annotations and that works
so it's a little awkward but at least
you know this is possible you can have
code on the classpath you can have some
other code in modules on the module path
and they work peacefully together but
you do have to tell the module system
its startup what modules to put in there
so so the the module path is where you
put artifacts that define modules the ad
what we call sorry the module path is
where you put your modular drive files
then we have more module jar files that
you want to use rather rather than the
clip n on the class path the module
system will look on the module path for
modules that it can tell it needs to
find but when you're just running code
on the class path it has no way of
detecting oh this unmod rice code on the
class path needs some module on the
module path so add modules tells the
resolver ok to start before you start
this code on the class path load these
additional additional modules - plus
whatever modules they depend upon that's
why you need to both use use the module
path option to say where they are and
then the add modules option to say which
ones you know are necessary for the code
on the class path - if you if you're if
you're in a rush or you just want to be
lazy there there are there are some
shortcuts here for example you can say
all - module path and it will just go
find everything that's on the module
path that's probably not what you want
but it can be a useful step if you want
to just debug something ok so the way
that this has been bottom-up migration
now let's do is kind of the obvious last
step and modularize everything will go
back to the tweet some module info which
I happily left around here will just
write it back out and recompile tweet
some this time it'll wind up as a
modular jar file whoops
all right when I compile it now I need
to say tell the compiler module path M
Lib where my actual modules are and
actually going to put tweets um begin to
end live as well so we are here I have
an in M Lib all my nice modules and I
can run
ah where to go now let me just make that
again
fully modular greet some applications
now everything is a module we believe we
created a to take them put the top down
and bottom up everything's a module life
is sweet and here we can show a module
resolution and see everything being
resolved through the route the route is
the tweets and module as we saw with
top-down migration it loads all of these
other proper modules now they're not
they're not automatic modules anymore
and it finishes up by print against
output so that's that's it you know as
far as far as demonstrating this
migrating to modules does take some work
if you have a large existing system it
frankly it might not be worth the effort
so think carefully before you you start
off a project and modularize a lot of
existing code if you have a large system
that's like you know a whole bunch of
maven projects and it works well and
your and and it's kind of in maintenance
mode
there's a good chance that's not worth
going to the trouble of modularizing it
on the other hand if it's actively
maintained and evolving and you plan to
take it forward then it could be worth
the effort but the good news is jigsaw
provides ways to do both top-down and
bottom-up in my migration when the
concept of migration is is it's maybe
not one of Java's key core values but it
definitely ranks up there at something
we've we've taken seriously over the
years it's you know it affected for
example the design of generics and java
5 we took some pains to make sure that
code that adapted to generic types could
work well with code that had not yet
been adapted to generic types now by now
yeah most code does use generic types
but there's still some that doesn't and
and they all work fine together so we've
taken a similar approach in jigsaw where
a code that's in modules and code that's
not in modules can coexist and relate to
each other and interoperate
so that that is the the concept of
migration compatibility okay we've got a
few minutes left for questions if there
are any yeah okay plate please wait for
the microphone we're the this is being
recorded if you don't wait for the
microphone then it won't be on the
record Hey
at the beginning you had the Jackson
jaws and then you opened up the module
and did requires Jackson look before
where did that name come from was that
the water magic fun was that an
automatic named Ord it was that the
package name so so when you take it when
you take a jar file that's that's not
modular and and and put it on the module
path then its module name is synthesized
from the file name in a way it's a gross
hack but what else can we do so the name
of the the name of Jack the name of the
module the automatic model defined by
Jackson Jackson - cord - 2 dot 6.6 jar
is Jackson core and that that's all
that's all it is it's nothing fancy now
if if the maintainer of that of that
library puts in an automatic module name
entry in the jar files manifest then the
name of the automatic module will be
taken from that manifest entry but you
know in the long-term we hope that that
any of the libraries like Jackson will
actually be full modules I heard
recently the the Jackson maintainers
actually did put in the automatic module
names so they've taken the kind of thing
of the first step down the path to
modularizing something
not any of the I'd say at least free
most common I des that support many of
the commands and tools that you show
here so so so I had a you Jean Petrenko
from from IntelliJ in the keynote
yesterday demonstrated IntelliJ IDEA it
can show module graphs and it has a deep
understanding of how module declarations
work how they relate to each other if
you forgot to say require somewhere it
will suggest insert this one if and and
and so forth so that so that's pretty
slick eclipse has some support but I'm
not sure how deep it is right now I do
know that they're actively working on it
and I and I believe the same is true and
that means on that Ben C that means I
believe the same guy I know net net
NetBeans contributors are working on
them but I don't know the status they
haven't released a nine a nine version
yet haven't released anything in at a
party right now yeah there's a NetBeans
there's a nine preview at the moment
yeah there is if there's a nine preview
but there but it's not it's not final I
think the clips version the supports
module two weeks time or well yeah with
it with eclipse there there's a well
known a well known page on on the
eclipse website that tells you how to
howdy how to use it with nine and their
formal release will be in a in a few
weeks
any other questions gentleman in the
back there
him hi every current application written
in Java 8 will run on a Java 9 virtual
machine alright so the quickest answer
is is referred to free free to the video
the keynote for mr. day the more of a
slightly more verbose answer is if you
have an existing code that only uses
Java SE 8 ap is and does not depend on
jdk and journal api's or other internal
aspects of the jdk people probably work
on jdk 9 without change thank you I need
to show you this slide I work at Oracle
hi what's the impact on build tools such
as maven and Gradle
well Robert Schulte is sitting right
here because he could certainly speak he
knows a way I know the answer to but
there there is impact I'm happy to
report that we've worked closely with
Robert and and maven has has decent
support for modules already yes so what
we did is we tested with maven freedo
and that just works fine probably even
earlier versions of Mayville all right
also run fine on java 9 but we just
started with three or so if there are
issues they're often related to the
plugins for instance there was this
change to the version scheme where it
was one dot and a new version and it has
changed 2.29 and what all these tools
were doing they were making array
they're splitting it on a dot and taking
the second element when it's just nine
they're getting an array out of mountain
index exception so these are already
fixed and I think most of the plugins
right now are Java now ready so right
but but maven also we also will will
build modular jar files too now so it's
you know it's not just that it that it
works the way it always did online
it actually has it actually understands
what modules are and you can have a
module info and do all that stuff
just one thing to add you don't have to
change your folder structure I think
most of the examples you see that you
add the module name in a source you
don't need that for for major projects
just keep the source manger up with your
motivation for there and it will work
right and that that's because pretty
much ever and you know a a module is
modules and maven projects are the same
thing there are no that we when we're
showing things on the command line if we
need to talk about multiple modules than
we need to show the module the each
module habits have its own directory in
the source path or the moth or the
exploded modules but that's just an
artifact really thing is you show Jade
EPS
in a couple of the slides and Robert has
a plug-in that maven projects can run as
well right good point
I just wanted to add that we have a
maven buff tonight so if and when it's
interesting with details we can talk
more until they're excellent any more
questions any other questions just a few
minutes
over there
is there any mechanism to versioning
modules no that's frequently asked most
frequently asked question either number
one or number two it competes with why
didn't you just fuse osg I know so in
this design we took it we took an
approach it wasn't it was not not our
original approach we arrived at this
after after a long time an approach
where modules and the artifacts that
define them are separate concepts so a
module is is is kind of a higher level
abstraction they're embedded in the
language they're known to the virtual
machine
they don't have version numbers in that
environment you know things thing the
module is you know is as fundamental as
a class or an interface we don't put
versions on those but we do put versions
on the things that contain them so it
makes perfect sense to have versions on
a modular jar file and but we basically
leave it to build tools like maven and
Gradle an ant whatever to worry about
version conflicts the module system will
detect conflicts if you have two modular
jar files in the same directory on the
module path that define models of the
same name the module system will just
stop and say I it doesn't know how to
make this choice so you have to remove
one of them or fix the problem modules
do have this art we compiled modules
can't have module information in them if
I if I list modules you see this this at
9 you know that 9 is inserted by you
know by the build system into the module
info dot class files but it's just there
as documentation so that that version
string is is not really interpreted it's
just carried through for diagnosis so if
you're trying to diagnose something
wrong in a large system you can see
which versions of modules were resolved
but the resolver doesn't actually pay
attention to those version strings
you know as I said it is a little bit of
a counterintuitive approach which is why
people naturally ask about it a lot but
that's the answer and you know sorry so
far this seems to be working fairly well
further
well alright time for maybe one more
okay well thank you very much
go forth and modular eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
