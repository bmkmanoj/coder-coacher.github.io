excellent you're talking to us about
agile so can I start with an easy
question why do jeans need agile and I
thinking as IO is a methodology with we
work with a lot of people and this
process work is one hundred percent
about behavior you need to connect
people to integrate and to development
and abilities behaviors to to construct
rod to devote yes it is really hard
right because developers in general are
not very good with people right so so so
you really need you to get people in and
mindset of together it's totally mindset
snow and the-the-the jayakody is a
person to help these people in this
methodology so you are you an agile
coach you said no jive code helps people
with this methodology so what do you do
me is it's like being a scrum master
kind of thing or a different thing what
exactly does the job coach do and my
opinion the difference box camasta and
agile coach is escrow Massey is a person
work only the scrum methodology right
and the as I code is a person and have a
good arm high knowledge about the agile
game bank i Zane experience and and this
person working a lot with many things
about the Ohio and the development
person right okay yes because you need
you need to develop the developer as a
team to work together to actually in an
agile right way from us can be agile
Cody but say is the person needed to
development abilities to go quoting to
talk to development other person okay
that's nice so how long have you been
not doing agile coaching a long time
time ago right so so so are you work
with small teams large teams you know
what kind of what kind of project you
work on I like yawns multi me because i
have many damn little problems not to
all the big problem to his own but the
the biggity me it's good because they
you see many different abilities and
dysfunctions to work right and if you if
you see the little see me you and you
get to grow up I work with you a jive
but if you you have a big team you need
to to to observer more people to work
with this right and is no you're you're
doing agile coach here in Brazil are
many types of companies in Brazil doing
agile or just like one sector didn't
know know that they're all companies in
Brazil to practice the agile coach agile
methodology because everybody now needs
to to resolve the problems and
constructs new products and Nathan right
okay in the market yet man to put new
prior so so a lot of companies you put
projects projects in the market so your
honor meant to know the government to
yeah that's cool now and and do you see
uh you know I'm from the Java side right
you see a lot of Java projects doing
agile or not and don't tell him she did
their job or bite or Java scripts he is
a problem because of the the fray me
walking and work with many many kinds of
free language right he has main
technology yeah it's not it's not a
problem and we fry methodology okay so
and and and you know so the whole
objective of agile is actually deliver
softer faster or is something else I
think
I think it the methodology has a
offensive and the way festa tool to
develop but in my opinion the workflow
is focused a development personally and
the Queen when you develop a person you
you get a new enology new abilities new
actions it's more important to them to
dissolve developments and softer all
right so yeah so improving the team
itself is better day now one of the
things that that we see a lot is that
when you know some companies invest in
their in their developers and then you
know sometimes the developer leaves the
company because now he can he can earn
more money somewhere else everything is
that a problem when you kind of create
the agile you develop develop the team
you develop the people so they can they
can go look for better jobs or or
actually it's a way to retain the talent
because you're you get a more a nicer
project a more interesting project and
if people stay longer in the company
what do you think some companies and see
a new way to ward's you construct your
development product and invest in G's a
way to disable developing people but the
majority companies is thinking I am I'm
a Nazi poor my my money and development
people right yes dude did you just want
the code writing on the choo choo you
tutor yeah that's the couch right that's
not that's a big problem that we have
yeah yeah and and how and how do you do
try so deep do you go after it specific
types of customers or you know like the
curse wait wait ok so when a customer
comes to you you evaluate the curse and
say no no you you're gonna have a true
complex culture I'm not gonna be able to
change that or you actually work with
any with all those cuts which improve
whatever they have I like it to know
that the products offered the company
and when how to extrude a structure they
organization and they are
what guided the culture of Jesus
organization after to pick the they work
right yes first first let's see they're
really really to do it right yeah
because because a lot of times you know
people want to develop the software in
and I work more of the development side
and people want to develop the software
and and they put a lot of effort in this
but when you talk about now we can
improve the meta college you can improve
people like I'm not sure right yeah yeah
so it must be a tough job yeah yes I
like my job because I I know there are
many people I work in many metalist
difference method right now and I know a
new organization it's a new way to
develop product a and the people and I
like it just merged right we are people
and suffer and the framework this is
like a lot and when you're talking about
agile do you get involved with the end
customer also yeah because we getting
involved the project everything yeah
because the cleanse is the principal
actor right in this methodology yeah so
now is this reality here in Brazil mean
are there companies are actually
involved your end customers into the
processor or not know some companies is
not involved client because their ID so
be easy and I am a professional about
the business not softer but the majority
of people like this okay to involve it
to know about to do the methodology
right so so if I developers so we heard
the TDC lots of people watching us
online if you if you are if you're
telling a developer that's interested in
Nigel you know how can he start I mean
he can can he start by himself or he has
to get the whole team and say no we
always you have to do it together mmm
I'm I like I I speak about my life right
yeah I I know with the car and I study
about today
and later I go to certificate about to
Hamas there and the product town right
and later one one year later I am i
beginning that they work with the
product sandstorm ass right it's the
beginning is not where we get to to work
with this because it's very different
and difficult the companies and give it
Jesus space right and my my opening
working and listen study about these and
go to to this area right so so you
italia Bercy you yes you're running here
you're already here Jo Jo track yeah yes
so can you tell us a little bit about
what topics were discussed in a ja ja ja
tracking yeah as I attract IAM
shouldered many practices is about agile
methodology and the principle the
principle talks is um is agile coach IAM
hamas a producer on their water kynzie
of team work better with a dial
dysfunctions you have me in a team is
topical okay excellent so that's
anneliese grip here dragon from TDC
coordinator of the agile track and i
know i really think you should start
learning a july because it's pretty cool
if your company not doing our job right
now you know you should start thinking
about it because the whole objects is
you know we got oh then I'll have one
more question so one thing that we've
been talking a lot about is you know you
got your teams and they never deliver
software right because you know they
more meetings more discussions things
are not wearing running so they never
deliver software so how does agile help
you lose the fear of delivery because
people can have fear I know it's not
ready it's not good enough you know in
the delay delay delay there how does a
jar help with that
I figure you need to do to work with the
goats ago this is a principle a topic
and them some mark off the process right
you need to have a goals and and deliver
software development people and when you
have a goal to tune it easy reach to
reach to reach yes you you get right
because you have a ghost because you
have to go okay that's pretty cool
alright so it's time for you to lose the
fear of delivery you know you gotta
focus on delivering software and I
chives the way to go and you know thanks
a lot and ELISA it's really good good to
have you here of us thanks for taking
some time off your busy schedule to
visit us here to boot thanks a lot thank
you move my friends yeah thanks okay
