prepare you have in your home directory
is large home slash by slash Java is the
central java director you can find our
Java embedded sweet JDK 18 and also the
Java me if you want to hack with Java me
so your option we are making available
some sample apps like the the gateway
the great way I'm running here is the
things Gately is a restful application
very simple restful application we have
an application colored pi feet by Fitz's
a java fax application that reads a
heart monitor sensor and plots a very
nice chart with the the heartbeat so
they did this application during the
last hackathon in Brazil and they send
us the code to be an example for you so
you can start with these and improve
this projects your hack this project so
and I bring here also the tweet for pie
to eat for pie is a very funny
application that we did that you can
command the GPIO using Twitter so you
send message to your raspberry pi gpio
and you can do it using Twitter and we
also have the automation effects which
is pace for home automation that bruno
bart is from Naraku did and make the
code the code available for us and with
automation effects you can monitor then
bedded panel see the sensors turn on
turn off relays and everything sensors
that we have we bring the demantoid that
we bring is then that'd panel the idea
of the embedded panel is avoid a lot of
sensor one for each table so here we
have a kind of shared sensors sherrod a
central with shared sensors that you can
consume using a rest
this embedded panel we have two
raspberry PI's and to Arduino base at
board we refactor we are factoring our
own Arduino in Brazil is a bigger
Arduino with many components inside
third we know is another is the opposite
way is not a shoot is a larger Arduino
with transistors a temperature sensor
light sensor motor controller for robots
and many connectors and we have in this
embedded panel eight relays we bring a
water pump and you'll and bring a plant
so you can think about hacking a plant
with a water pan or something like this
monitor the temperature and you know and
we bring a fan this is small fan and we
have this popcorn machine also you can
do a hack with the popcorn machine and
the camera like turn on the popcorn
machine with the camera and analyze the
image to see to pop to pop so it's all
yours we have le g stripe so you can
change the color of the panel we have
alcohol sensor this alcohol sensor is
very funny censored because you can
measure how much someone drink so you
have distance temperature humidity right
sensors and a heart monitor which is a
spark fun board that works with polar so
the most famous heart monitor and we
bring a polar here so you can use it
that's the architecture so we have
raspberry pi javon batted sweet the
gateway which is the application that we
is available for you to communicate with
arduino i'm using things api is an API
that i did by myself that make it easy d
rxtx so you don't need to know anything
about the RX TX
and I solve many synchronization problem
inside this API so is very easy to plug
an Arduino and communicate with Arduino
using things API or if you are a serial
expert like our X DX expect you don't
need my API but if you never use it
before I would recommend because you are
going to spend a lot of time with
synchronization problems that I had in
the last four years you know who so we
have Arduino with different sensors
especially the anal log sensors they are
out plug it on Arduinos like the alcohol
the light sensor the internal
temperature is an lm35 so is analog and
you can have pwm and the arduino also
drive d l eg RGB stripe so you can set
up the color based on the amount that
you sent you green blue and red and you
can another way you can use PI for jay
to access the raspberry pi gpio and plug
sensors make pwn and use complex sensors
with different types of protocol so the
panel is here and the address i'm going
to say very fastest information but we
have the eyepiece of this panel you can
get inside this network to access the
panel is a wireless network we have the
wireless modules for raspberry and then
11 is this one the first one the second
is the right side the one is the left
side the raspberry pi number three is
this home automation box so I also bring
this home automation box is everything
inside the relays the sensors the same
thing as the embedded panel but
sometimes you say oh I need to make a
stress test and I don't want to stress
testing
panel so we have a small version of this
the embedded panel that you can use in
your table and and and use a like an
exclusive mode and the number the last
one is the robot the robot has the same
architecture sensors and everything for
you to hack so it's available you can
make it like how you can see how much
alcohol you drink so the components that
we have in the pie number one two relays
temperature is Colonel temperature the
board temperature humidity and distance
sensor the Raspberry Pi number two we
have two relays also to chew Asia
sockets the alcohol censor board's
temperature we have the serval to move
the camera we have the red green and
blue you just call this URL passing a
member from 0 to 255 indicating how much
of that color you want so you can
combine the colors and in in the port
8081 you have the camera so you can also
capture the camera from the image and
transfer using network and makeup javafx
interface makes all yours and the home
automation box we have the popcorn
machine is I just plug in the home
automation box because the popcorn
machine is kind of a it exceed detected
10 amps that might relate supports so
that relay is for 20 amps and so the
first time I try to you to manipulate
the popcorn machine in the home the
Indian bedded panel not good so that is
working here so the home automation box
had the same thing for the colors also
and the robot you have the actuators
sorry robot is in
two keys the API the rest interface is
in Portuguese I didn't translate but
okay is easy french is forward forward
is frenchy backward hey left scare the
right data rotate Jadhav so you can
learn a little Portuguese with that and
the robot you have light sensor the
temperature sensor but you have the two
distance sensor those those sensors are
pinned from parallax and dig a tree that
is inside a spring salad also in your
image to restart the Goethe you just
need to type things gay tree and it will
turn on the GlassFish and you can access
your board using our gateway so I will
talk more about this architecture
tomorrow but that's the way that the
Gateway relates to Arduino here i have
the arduino code using the things api
for arduino i declare the components
that i had inside arduino in a very easy
way of writing code and all those
components will be available if i write
read here it will be available through
the java and edit suite using jeez well
so the name you put here is the name
that you are going to access using the
the gate wait the restful gateway so the
source code i will show more details
tomorrow of this source code and it's
all available in my github so you can
clone the things api so the things api
is a basic project you know we don't
have many people using but i am looking
forward for your collaboration you know
how to eat for pi that is inside the
other raspberry already have to eat for
pine stolid and is a basic application
that they did in brazil also during the
the hackathon and we bring here so is a
starting point for you but the is in
Portuguese the the code is kind of in
Portuguese but very simple to understand
and you can command the Raspberry Pi
turning on fan gpio at 23 1 and you are
going to turn on you need to run these
serves the tweet for pi serves in your
Raspberry Pi and it will grab the
message from Twitter for each 20 seconds
and see if you have some message with
gpio word inside your message and you
need to if you are going to use you need
to put your consumer key you need to go
to the Deaf twitter com and you need to
create a access token for your
application is very simple you can we
are going to give the support if you
want to hack Raspberry Pi with Twitter
so now i'm going to start the game 3
Raspberry Pi number one
and I will do the same thing in the
Raspberry Pi number to all the Gator is
running in other raspberry PI's and
three raspberry pi sin in a few minutes
I'm going to turn on the gay tween
inside the robot also but what I'm going
to show is I could command using a rest
calls so let's check for the temperature
the first call take a little bit more
time because it's establishing the
communication between raspberry and
Arduino so 23 Celsius makes it so I'm
going to ask in Portuguese and the
answer will be in English so quality
return the age temperature is 22</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
