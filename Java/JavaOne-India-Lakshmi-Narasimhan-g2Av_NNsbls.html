technology Network we're here at javaone
India talking to members of the java
community so I've got Lex me with me hi
Laxmi so tell me what your role is in
the java community all right okay so I'm
from my opinion you project that I work
for is called Java technologies so Java
technologies is the Java Runtime
Development Center and I beam you all
everybody knows iBM has its own JV
mental presentations right I will go so
technically I manage the class of every
component of the IBM JK started all the
way in 2001 okay from Java won four to
five six seven now we are working on
Java 8 Wow excellent and you were
telling me that you work with the people
at Oracle right in terms of getting
information and is that how it works
with the advent of openjdk there's
nothing that we can do in clothes stores
so IBM and Oracle have a very close
relationship when it comes to deciding
some of the strategies of how java
ebooks and progress and we are working
more processor with the senior leaders
in North alone sir and in the openjdk
community i'm an open gdp contributor so
we are the controller fix broken plans
and pack IV response as a bunch of chips
yes yes excellent that's going to be one
of the one that i will be talking here
in general yeah so tell me about your
sessions ok there are three sessions
that we are that I'm five sessions will
be delivering from the Java technologies
project three of them are going to be
delivered between me and my colleague
the first one is on Java and big data so
that's going to focus predominantly on
the relevance of a big data and why Java
is is probably the best platform that's
available today to Crandall and process
the amount of data that's coming
the next session is going to be on Java
and real-world compatibility to where we
dwell a little bit more deeper in terms
of the efforts that go behind the scenes
to maintain the backward compatibility
with Java promises that's how the do's
and don'ts and what we can expect in
future in terms of projects or something
but the last session is going to be on
the openjdk Penrose project the openjdk
Penrose project is an i-beam sponsored
project which is working on bringing
interoperability between the osgi
modularity framework and the gixxer
framework that's gonna come in Java nine
since majority of enterprise customers
already used some sort of frameworks
like OST I was putting the rep Endres
project is a very important project
because it has to be able to go job of
modules as native audience on right
right so I'm going to be giving a talk
on where the project is one of mine
stones what's next instead of so if I'm
interested in Primrose where would I get
more information open till you keeping
Bruce project is a project exclusive now
Gary game so if they will open jeddak
a.net and scroll through the left hand
side you will find the project pinned
resistor down there xrd that I've
meaningless are the bestest come and it
doesn't point doctor yeah come if you
happen to be here right now come listen
to this talk otherwise for people who
are watching tell me like one of the
gotchas in terms of thinking about
backward compatibility for a project
that seemed really interesting right so
the Java language from day one has
always been very clear in terms of what
packages people should use in should not
use developers being developers are very
smart and very lazy so we tend to find
back door entries into a non-standard
packages like Khamsin packages or comms
or packages if not standardized you are
in for a nasty surprise when jigsaw
kixin oh really yeah I'll be able to see
them at all so better pack up your move
clean up your system now to make sure
that you call in just e standard package
now that's a really good yeah so if
you're going to use jigsaw you better
start cleaning up your code now right
Thanks really good well thank you for
coming by and good luck with your
sessions I appreciate it thank someone
this is Tori wilt with the Oracle
