play minecraft this is my second video
in the tutorial series in which we will
find out how to play in a default world
so this is the world we made yesterday
and we're going to start with that so
here we are in our new world the first
thing I want to explain is health and
hunger so let me pause the game so I can
move the mouse around these red hearts
you see our health I have ten hearts if
they go all the way down did I die and I
respawn back in the same place these
little chicken legs our hunger if they
go down some bad stuff will happen to
you which I'll explain later this bar
here is your XP double bar and it tells
you how much XP you have which will also
be explained later and lastly these
squares here are your hotbar which is
where you can pick the item you want to
use or pressing one two three and so on
for the respective spots in the hotbar
the first thing you want to do in
Minecraft is you want to get wood
because wood is essential for living
because you will need it to make a
crafting table to craft tools and
everything else you need to live so I'm
going to do this by punching a tree and
I mean that literally so I'm going to
hold left click the punch this tree here
and break them all the wood and that
pink thing in front of me is a pig and
if I kill that I could get some pork
chops from me which I'm going to do soon
me is a type of food that you can use to
regenerate your hunger so I'm almost
done punch the tree now here we go
so I'm opening in my inventory by
pressing E and picking up this oak wood
by pressing left click my inventory is
where I can see everything I have so I'm
gonna pick up this oak called red person
left click and then deposit here
deposited here my crafting table person
left again and then I hold shift and
press left click on this output to get
all the oak wood planks that it gave me
then I'm going to right click here twice
and then I get sticks and I'm going to
right-click four times to get a crafting
table
then I'm going to take this table place
it down I'm going to make a sword and
then we put some pigs
hello mr. piggy you're dead get back to
you
scaredy-cat and I got some meat from him
and I feel this pig to me is very
important and so is food because if you
don't upload you could die of starvation
so now I'm going to go pick up my
crafting table again because I'm
probably gonna need to use it later you
can craft many other things with a
crafting table boy don't need to now so
um I just picked up a SAP English can be
used to plant more trees and they'll
grow so I think I'll plant another one
right here now pressing right quick I
just wanted to pick it up
so now I'm gonna go and pick up that
sapling and then go and get some more
wood I've seem to be lagging right now
which is what happens when you're going
really slowly and now I'm not like there
are some weird places you guess you can
call them lag spots or you start lagging
a lot so now we need to go find some
more pics and kill them looks like it's
a whole family of them there so I'm
gonna name this little guy here Steven
and kill him die die die
so pigs and a lot of animals and mobs
they'll drop they'll drop random members
of items they won't drop like two pork
chops every time or two flowers every
time so that's enough food for now and
see you can see I'm losing some hunger
because half half of a chicken egg is
black so I'm gonna eat some food by
pressing right click and then I'm going
to go walk over to that hill over those
specific pests in mind right now I'm
sprinting which you can do by double
tapping and W and then holding it I'm
gonna sprint over to there and press
space to jump a bunch of times and then
I'm gonna start mining first thing I
need is a kick-ass place my crafting
table and make a pickaxe
pick this up again
I think I probably Colet chicken over
there me man Bob died in that little
okay so now let's go back to mining then
when you're mining in a new role the
magic number of stone you need is 11 and
you'll see why soon so I'm breaking
through into the side of this hill and
you'll soon see the stone this gray
stuff here is stone which I need a
pickaxe to mine and it's gonna be very
useful if somebody went further so you
can't see coming into my hotbar that
sketch is not in a space in there so I
can open my translator with a again and
see there's six cobblestone it's getting
really dark because I don't have any
torches or anything that produces light
with me but now I have eleven stone so
I'm going to go back out of here and
then go back to that pillar with a
pendant like here
and then we're going to start building a
shelter which is also an essential part
of playing Minecraft because you don't
want to get ambushed my mom's in the
middle of the night so you can see my XP
bar is filled up a bit and that's
because I was killing a lot of mobs and
also my hungers gone down a bit so I'm
going to eat a pork chop if your hunger
goes down more than one and a half
chicken bar chicken legs then you will
stop regenerating naturally and if it
goes down more than seven then you will
stop sprinting and if it goes down all
the way zero
you'll start slowly dying of starvation
so right now I'm chopping up this tree
to quickly get some wood because it's
almost nighttime we might have to build
our shelter partly out of dirt because
well we gotta do it quickly it's almost
nighttime and if we don't if we don't do
it quick enough we could get ambushed by
mobs and we don't want the fabric so I'm
basically building this at first making
the wall and then using planks for the
rest of it because I don't have enough
dirt
you're not going using a cobblestone
because I'm gonna be using that for
other things so it's something a very
simple shelter with not much in it and
I'm gonna make the roof I'm holding
shift and that's why I'm going slowly I
felt a whole shift you won't fall off
the edge of a block so I'm gonna get
into my shelter and now you want my
crafting table down
and make a door a door is important
because then mobs unwanted mobs don't
get in take this door and place it there
and now I'm going to show you why you
should just don't just know this we can
place it there now I'm going to show you
I 11 stone is the magic number so first
I'm gonna get some sticks and I need
this money I double clicked on that
wooden plank so ektu all the wooden
planks on my inventory into that one
spot so now I'm going to make the stone
pickaxe heroes don't pick axe and then
I'm going to make a furnace you're not a
very important thing and that is why I
have instant magic remember I'm gonna
put this furnace down here it's really
hard to see if it's really dark oh it's
here and then I'm going to I can't smell
anything right now
she managed to cook my meat somebody can
cook your meat quickly and cooked me it
will give you a lot more hunger than raw
meat will and if I could find some sheep
I could make a bed but I don't have any
sheep and also a more important thing is
you're going to want torches later on
for a sustainable source of light so
let's summarize what we learned today we
learned how to start how to play in a
default world and how to get food wood
crafting table and stone and then how to
make a furnace and a pickaxe and then
how to cook meat and also what we
learned about health hunger and XP
thanks for listening and happy
