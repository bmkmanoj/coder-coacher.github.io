Network and I'm here at devoxx UK and
interviewing Arun Arun hi hello there so
I wouldn't tell us what what do you do
at Oracle my name is Arvind Gupta I am a
technology advocate working for Oracle
I'm responsible for Java EE vandalism so
I literally go around the world talk
about Java EE and different Java
technologies at Oracle and that's what I
do so you have a new release coming out
right boys Java EE 7 tell us about it so
that is great yeah so we do have a new
release of Java EE 7 coming out and that
is scheduled in the q2 of 2013 there are
a few big themes as part of the release
first of them is boosting your
productivity the second theme is about
embracing html5 so in terms of boosting
productivity what we are doing is we're
giving developers a chance where they
can improve their productivity many
Falls several ways you know we are
providing you opportunities to write
less boilerplate code with using
dependency injection pretty heavily
we're giving lot more defaults out of
the box we are also giving lot more
richer functionality as part of the
platform itself then in terms of html5
the big themes are what they really are
providing an API to build a WebSocket
driven application you can also create a
you know when you're building your
application in that application you
don't need to bundle any JSON jars all
that functionality now it's part of the
platform which allows you to make your
applications much leaner and portable
that way and we're also introducing
html5 friendly markup so a lot of work
happening in the Java EE 7 platform and
a lot of specifications have been revved
and new specifications being added to
make all of this happen and the
community has been also very active can
you tell us a little bit about it sure
so one of the big aspects of Java EE 7
is really about transparency and
community participation well in
transparency we're all following the GCP
2.9 rule
which requires us you know your active
public website open JIRA active open
expert group discussion aliases anybody
can watch it and participate all of that
and then in terms of community we have
several activities going on
so adopter jsr effort has been
particularly very very successful for us
I mean we are at devoxx UK London Java
community has been very instrumental in
organizing some hack days for us then
well ginger you know Chennai chuk chuk
from all around the world so Java all of
these drugs together have introduced or
organized hack days where they have
taken a particular technology or a bunch
of technologies and organized hack days
downloading the specs reviewing the Java
Docs building applications providing
feedback on them filing bugs so that has
been tremendously successful the other
community effort that we started was
fish cat now fish coming from GlassFish
which is the logo that you see here and
cat standing for community acceptance
testing so this is again a community
driven effort where there we are we are
encouraging folks to participate in this
effort
download the promoted bills because
GlassFish being the reference
implementation also has some features
above and beyond Java EE 7 so we are
asking the folks to test those features
and again a good build a well tested
build helps everybody so this is where
you know we are seeing a lot of
participation from the community and
then they're filing bugs and that as
well so what are some of the
applications that were built during
those community events right so one of
the applications that was built during
the adopter jsr effort specifically was
around jsr 356 now jsr 356 is about Java
API for WebSocket so the belgian guide
specifically they built an application
call as tic-tac-toe it's a very common
knots and crosses game as part of the
game there was this l is we're gonna
build a WebSocket end point using the
jsr deployed on GlassFish and then they
built our html5 client for this they
built the iOS client for this android
client for this
and a traditional web client for this
and all these clients were able to talk
to the backend running on GlassFish
using GSR 356 api's similarly you know
in January jog they're building the
urban travelers application application
is just one part of you know what was
coming out of this adopted GSR effort
the other part of this whole effort was
really these drugs nordic 20 drugs that
are participating in the adopter jsr
effort they're becoming sort of our
extended evangelism team for example
morocco jug you know we we were being
invited by Egypt Egyptian Java user
group to talk about a particular
technology we could not go so these guys
went for us and delivered this
presentation for us so it's beautiful
actually working out you know truly
thinking locally acting globally well
anything else you would like to share
with us sure a few more things that I
want to talk about the Java EE 7
platform itself so there are four brand
new jsr that are coming as part of the
platform so there is jsr 356 in Java API
for WebSocket 352 which is batch
applications 353 which is JSON
processing and 236 which is concurrency
utilities JMS which is 343 is being
revised pretty heavily to just catch up
with the platform jax-rs 2.0 tons of new
features coming in there lots of other
specs getting revised so Java EE 7 is
getting a major major facelift and is
getting ready to be released pretty soon
GlassFish is the implementation for it
all the features are baked in today you
know we have tons of material available
for you to get started we would love to
get your feedback you know give us your
feedback we would love to hear it and
make it successful not just for us but
for you most importantly so do you have
a link for people to go to absolutely so
I think the keep links that you want to
remember if you want to look at the
implementation part of it
GlassFish dot org is your primary link
you go there you can download the
GlassFish promoted bills from there or
if you want to look at the
specifications
Java EE - spec dot java.net and all our
projects are completely transparent you
can see the interim spec drafts you can
check out the expert group discussions
all of that from that page itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
