Tokyo it's been 20 years of Java and
it's really been quite a rocket ride
it's kind of hard to believe but you
know if you guys can remember how spunky
you are you were when you were 20 Java
seems to be at about that stage you know
it's it's it's really amazing to look at
all the statistics of the the Java
developer community and it's its size
and vibrancy is just just amazing you
know and particularly in in Japan Japan
has been a really wonderful place I was
doing doing tours of Japan talking to
people about about Java in like starting
at about 92 and we had some really
really good partners there java had a
number of fantastic firsts in japan i
think probably the most the most
spectacular was java on cell phones
there was that was that was started back
in there in the very early 2000s and
it's been all been a lovely ride for all
those folks and and i think that the
thing that really excites me about it is
the diversity of all of this I mean
everybody you know sees all the the work
that's being done in data centers but it
gets connected out to just about
everything you know all the all the Java
work that people are able to do in cell
phones you know whether they're things
like Android phones or Java ME people
people being able to provide data and
feeding data out to iOS phones and then
just the crazy world of the Internet of
Things I mean I'm I'm working in the
Internet of Things myself and you know
being able to do the whole these whole
end-to-end architectures where are you
doing streaming data where you're doing
analytics where you're doing desktop
visualization where you're doing the the
actual code embedded in the device and
it's all one skill set right and you can
take libraries and move them back and
forth it's really been an exciting time
and given how in
credibly rugged all of these pieces have
turned out turned out to be the the the
development of these systems in in these
absolutely astonishing mission critical
systems ends up meaning that that the
platform that you guys have to work on
is just so solid and it's being used by
by everyone the the you know the the job
listing statistics on Java are are crazy
you know it's it's one of the best best
skill sets to have if you're hunting for
a job and and when you when you look at
the breadth of industries where where
people are using it you know you can you
can you can apply sort of other skills
in other interesting ways I mean I'm I'm
I'm personally floored that I have a job
we're going snorkeling in the ocean is a
required job skill for debugging
software I'm probably kind of unique I
don't know how many people are doing
robots in the ocean but it's kind of an
example of just how far out on the edge
these things get you know people doing
everything in every industry at every
level and it's been a really really
exciting time and I've really been happy
with it the the amount of energy in the
Japanese community I don't know how many
times I've been to Japan for everything
from from customer visits to I've judged
a few contests in Japan I've been to I
don't know how many like Java developer
days and that and they've all been just
wonderful the the Java game community
I've judged a couple of contests with
them and and they're just crazy crazy
beyond imagining you really really
really have to have a have a strong
liver to to handle one of their one of
their contests but it's it's it's been a
lot of fun I'd like to congratulate you
on all the really great work that you've
done and I'm really looking forward to
what they what the next 20 years is and
good luck take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
