okay all right good
alright so welcome to the night hockey
my first bell and
father
just slow mo
don't know that what I mean I like that
you maybe make money for me be like
Oh
recording a little tighter
oh oh and for you
or
local cops before
the cases versus the dust would mean sir
longer the better exception
policy
not a threat though
if you survey studies anymore that's all
right minutes for anyone does anyone
know what's going roars the boy who play
so that's upset battles in the sweetness
you know I've added somebody yes okay so
I think using that as an author of the
happens
how did the gentle wrap around in one
thing so you picked up some pull the
trouble with white river find out who I
day right
and that's what we're going to college
yeah well actually I think I you know I
mean tube so there's a couple different
things that we could do this evening
either we can take a look at finishing
off the memory visualizer which is you
know from working on the Java effects
scene yeah I came out to Silicon Valley
java java fixies a group or visitas paul
paul-jean wallet was that was pretty
cool yeah you actually have a java facts
app to share with the javafx user group
wait you know who would think that was
that was possible planets it's crazy so
we can do that and I would actually end
up that'd be cool because what we can do
is is you know then maybe have some
people listening some people who are
watching later can come and come and say
okay we have a problem for a suite of
thing which is which is blood n hojjat
nice so yeah so here's our official i am
a knight hacker stickers okay so so i
think we need to get one of these
animals on a lot of that no yeah that
needs to be fixed before we go any
further all right there's a limited
quantity of these that exist this is
what i'm bagging this one now you in the
world yeah
there you go thank you amen it's even
semi-transparent so it won't cover over
all the other really cool stickers I
know that's the problem i mean basically
i run out of real estate so i think what
i'm actually going to do yes can I kind
of yeah you know it's not gonna
completely take up my github my us const
occur so i think i'm going to kind of go
with kind of there and then also you get
the double semi-transparent set with
early and the object out though i'm
doing that's the I've got that you have
to hold it up so folks can see what I've
got oh yeah okay now we're both my
daughters sure so yeah so we could we
could do some cuz III guess I'm like a
lot of other hackers and I don't I'm not
the world's best finisher I'm great
starting things I'm great at providing
energy and getting things going but I'm
kind of bad finishing things that's what
that's what gave hopes for you put stuff
out there and you say hey for kit
venture for it yeah yeah well you know I
don't know if you have your food with
the painter JMW Turner No okay so he was
one of the great british impressionist
and post-impressionist paintings and he
basically said that he that works a lot
I never finished merely abandoned and
that pretty much describes every
software project I've ever been involved
good so we're obviously not selling our
consulting services yeah okay so so I
was actually gonna say what about if we
actually spend forgotten evening on
actually on actually finishing something
yeah we should we should finish
something but we might need some help
because I'm not a good finisher either
ok so I'm going to I'm going to show
your desktop on the stream and won't get
this really nasty box in box and box
effect soon if you don't show something
other than our own video but ok so i lo
all right we'll get more of your screen
in the mobile my hacking logo in the
corner ok so here we have we have 10
beans all rights how the fonts for folks
on the stream are you able to to see
Ben's fonts given the resolution where
we're broadcasting at i'm going to make
no attempt to change resolutions because
that will just be a nightmare ok so i
had this weird thing well I've just
upgraded netbeans and that beans is
planing about script engines javis java
x script engine for javascript so open
open the file if you something i bet we
can fix that right so how about I just
call it all this out let's try that see
this is what I get one for running with
beta software kids I've got a pearl
picture-in-picture hold on a sec there
picture-in-picture now we're up so oh
we've even got drinks down here and food
mmm do we bring fit enough food for
everybody yeah if we can somehow inject
pizza into the stream I think I hit that
pitch for everybody pizza oh and wedges
yeah just okay chips you see you already
adopted bushing by tonight if you go my
god i will be back Rosa put you at your
website yeah yeah your tips and cats but
you would be careful because I heal you
making more time Verburg night really
gonna yes you're gonna he said he's
going to try and affect a little kind of
crazy kiwi isms if you catch yourself
playing saying things like flat tack
flat attack ok so it's Q expression it
means to be working like really hard in
British English would say flat out but
the Kiwis say flat flat time you go to
what you go watch that but that don't
get flat out
but I don't get the flat tactic that's I
bet that's one of those things like
kitty list yeah people masuri like i
done thing anyone's ever actually
managed to figure out where my where my
user name comes from and what itmore de
javascript yeah I've just added yet I've
just connected this thing out because
yeah okay yeah where does it do after
that when you comin up it gives me this
morning can't find Ron lip gloss falls
to copy yeah okay so just don't copy on
come on this as well yeah yeah it's good
job the known as technology stuffy nose
now good goes off like your anything
right absolutely nope still does not one
still combines about JavaScript engines
you have more JavaScript yeah this is
what happens when you use betas so all
right try to try this for me create a
new Java effects project from scratch
and do absolutely nothing with it just
um try running it Joe a face application
yeah
fine bummed a compliment
ok so that's a good sign that no matter
what you do yeah it's not what work if
you can't create a new project and then
do your javafx thing do another version
netbeans on there that I think I think I
think it's time to download another
version that means nothing special
nothing I have a version that means
which works but you have lucky would
give the damn jail why because i have so
i have a USB stick like what Allah well
I have this thing called the computer
which we can come to this illogical
stage that's great it's a yeah so say
it's it's it's you know that beans oh
well actually would suppose as well
let's put in and it works and we can run
applications in it okay well I think
what so much videos I'm going down with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
