everyone so we are here directly from
Java one in San Francisco and here it's
a very very cool event and we are here
doing tonight hacking to tea and and
you're letting you know why we called it
a night hacking yes because we always
indoors and see it's always thought it's
always dark right exactly so so that's
always it's all night it's night all day
long here exactly ok perfect alright so
I think your microphone is low or or
because I we can know they can hear you
uh yes no but you yes can you hear
alright okay alright can you hear her
yes okay good all right thank you yes
alright perfect ok so you're here
tonight hacking interviews and
discussions and because we're gonna hack
things right and and so I'm here with
your lawn boy year good enough yeah
alright and Ilan is is at java on
Twitter so it's the most important
twitter feed for java developers right
and so we're going to hear we talking
direct news from a java and i'm also
here with at SD jug right PO ever from
the San Diego job easy group good me
here thank you hey Paul so you know if
you're looking if you've seen on screen
you can see at least Paul Webber's a
twitter account feed right there so we
have been talking about career
development and how developers can
improve their careers and so Paul you
are a job as group leader and you do
help developers to improve their careers
right so you know you know you bring
speakers from outside you incentive
eight people chew chew chew be speakers
in your own local area why do you think
it's important for developers to join a
user group which parks bid on user group
in a way to improve their careers well
one at you you can see that you're not
alone right so you may be interested in
Java but you may feel like it's not time
to do that job change yet but you can
come over to users group meet people
like mind it learn something new from
the speaker even just an inner interact
with the speakers and have some
interesting pet project that you might
want to work on and you know kind of
bootstrap your career or a portion of
your career into the java java
programming world that's pretty cool so
you'll on you you have been giving this
talk worldwide I talking specifically
about participate in your community and
you know ways for each apartment
community ways to get involved why do
you think get involved is important for
a career of developer well it's for one
thing it's getting getting out there so
you name out there and making sure that
people know you right okay so one of the
things that we talk about is so how to
put out can you boost your presence on
Twitter how can you start being a
speaker for example at a conference like
travel one so you can start by something
simple doing it like a bar or a big
night session and then before you know
it i think it's also a lot of it is just
of a routine right right you start you
see that it's possible and then before
you do it then you become a speaker
excellent right and you're gonna rock
star right thank God and then you come
to the concert right right you play for
the norther pointers yes okay so Paul
Paul you do you coach people should
become speakers here is your group or
its natural and people just go there and
immediately become speakers a little bit
of both yeah yeah yes yes as a
userscript leader sometimes you're not
very choosy on your speakers anybody can
talk sometimes you help them out
sometimes they they're good for
themselves uh-huh so but yeah there's a
little interaction for them speakers uh
because you know San Diego's a small
community and if you get any
professional people coming in from out
of town life you Bruno no coaching
necessary oh man I had a lot of coaching
right you know I i start i took a long
time to become a good speakers not you
know it's not it's it was not natural
for me right you know so if you think
that because the people are here in our
speakers because they were born that way
that's not true right it took me a
couple of years I was really really shy
I Stu I'm really shy but once i'm in the
stage you know I learned to flag and
just kind of protects me it's your
superhero yeah you know just my secret
identity right you know you bring up a
good point it's practice I mean you do
the more often you do it you may still
get all the stage fright the stage
jitters but you get up there you get
into your rhythm you talk about what is
interesting to you you
on that and then you you just get better
at it yeah I know one thing people tell
me is that oh I don't I get nervous when
I'm gonna give a speech or you know
that's I'm probably not a good speaker
because I get nervous and I'm gonna tell
you watch I got nerve rose every time
I'm gonna give a speech right it's you
know before I got him on the stage I
keep thinking oh man you know people are
gonna like what I'm gonna say and I do
get nervous and I think if you don't get
nervous is because you are in your
comfort zone and you're not doing your
best I think you've got to do more that
that your comfort work with and you know
just kind of challenge yourself all the
time so you know being nervous actually
good thing keeps the energy going gift
the energy going alright so umm al on
you you know you have contact with
thousands of developers on the word
either on Twitter or in person you
travel a lot do you have any any
interesting stories of developers that
succeeded or or or you know someone
that's that's you know was just starting
and did something cool that you like to
share with us so I think that so to
start I mean it's a I see the book the
one that our the most successful mm-hmm
and I'm not going to give names okay I
think they started with good ventures
good mentors right nice so whether they
were they were women or not I think they
started with like a cool speaking for
example I'll just go ahead i'm just
gonna okay sorry at KU speaking
the edge over 140 and then and those
people I've seen them like really
becoming like superheroes over time all
right so met beam having a mentor is a
good thing right yes all right so
actually actually in a minute I'm going
to show you guys the Korea checklist
things you can do here javaone or
whatever you are to improve your career
and one of the ideas is four is fine a
mentor so now how do you find a mentor
that's good so I was thinking user
groups okay the perfect place because
you know it's a because you need to find
also a local mentor so you can go back
and forth more easily you can do that in
person so I think that would be the
perfect place I think yeah I mean you
get a wide variety of people coming to
the users group those that are there to
learn from the speaker and those who
come to actually interact with the
speaker so i find you know the most
successful meetings are when there's
lots of noise during our half hour
networking event before we actually
start the meeting and that's where
people are just engaging in each other i
know it's sometimes it's good sometimes
it's very quiet and yeah I've got a you
know internet entertain right from the
people to start engaging in that
conversation just break down the shyness
barriers during the the meeting itself
when the speaker is engaging and the
topic is interesting of the people you
know they're there
for the topic then they engage more with
that speak or anything sometimes after
the meaning there are relationships that
are made and sometimes mentorships can
come out of it okay really cool so
before we run complete out of time let
me just kind of jump here really quick
so we yeah I want to get you guys some
perspective and some ideas on improving
your career so we do have a career
checklist so we call the power checklist
so if you want to download this it's the
URLs on the screen is jav om n is less
career checklist and on here I there's
lots of easy things that you can do to
improve your career so one of the things
that that I think it's um it's really
important is you know if you feel you're
stuck in your career right if nothing
happen for you in the last month or last
couple of months if you didn't learn
anything new if you didn't meet
interesting people if you're not
satisfied for project you're probably
stuck in your career right and and this
is really bad because the more time you
get stuck the more you accept this
situation that this is the more you
think you can't change things and so you
you cannot let yourself be in that
situation right so what do you do any of
your career stuck so I stopped
everything and I find like a credit
project okay that's what I did that's
pretty cool how about you Paul reboot
reboot so I usually boots well do what
you did when you weren't in that
position is usually what happens is your
you've gotten me I won't cut it could be
lazy you've gotten a custom you're in a
routine uh-huh gotta break that routine
so yeah
when your computer locks up or it's just
slow down you rebooted it comes back to
life again right taking on like
participating here at the job a long
conference helping out at your local
Java users grill uh-huh picking up a
little raspberry pi and just poking
around see what it can do hey there's a
lot of technology that you can get into
and you may say well I just don't have
the time I'm watching that TV show that
I really lie yeah yeah well you can do
both maybe I'd give up the TV show right
yeah you know a lot of people talk about
time right oh I don't have time but you
know time something that you have to
make right you have to manage it you had
to manage right yeah you have to start
looking at everything that you're doing
and the value that it brings for a
company that she working uh-huh for you
and where is I mean because sometimes we
just get busy right right and so we get
into this routine then we just like do
the same thing is there really a lot
about you okay all right so I think you
guys have chance right now to download
the Korea checklist right and all of the
things you say you guys said hear about
reading to reboot your career or doing
something fun a lot of those things are
ejected let's take let's take a look a
few things here there you can do to get
your career movie first of all I first
of all the Korea check list is is a
something you can download you can print
it it turns into a little booklet so you
put your pocket right and then you can
just do just do everything is in there
it's it you can do everything in a very
fast actually I was talking I was a
friend of mine from red hats and he he
really loved it the Korea checklist and
on two days of Java want he did all the
steps of the Korea checklist right so I
know it's totally possible you can do
this right now now first thing i would
like to think about is to you have
to focus your career right in one
important thing is we always think tend
to think about ourselves right Oh what i
want what i want to do but if you want
participate if you want to get involved
if you really want to make your curry
important he has to be important to
someone think about who this someone is
right and try to fill out this first
phrase that you've seen the screen right
I help dot dots right a person to do or
to conk don't concur Dada because
everyone wants to do something everyone
wants to conquer something so he or she
has something right so no so i would say
for example that I you know my folks on
the career is to help java developers
right to improve their careers so they
can work on better projects all right so
that's my objective right so if you you
know I'm gonna put you in a spot so so
if you would fill out this form here
both of you who is ready you ready so go
ahead both thinking feel great think
about your career Paul that's a phrase
right there okay okay so I help java
developers to promote themselves and and
whatever they do right so they get
better and also better living ok
excellent so you know so when when you
focus your career on helping others
right you become important to other
people and when you become important to
other people people we want to come to
you because you're important for them so
how about you Paul come on right there
is hard is that it takes some time to
think about it but I want everyone just
watching us to think about that
absolutely but I mean as a Java users
group leader I help java developers I at
how Android developers I help people
come to the meaning to learn about
something new and sometimes a little bit
of career counseling goes on the
when they asked Oh what about this I
help java developers connect with other
companies that may have a position
because my leadership role they they
know who to come to so I know about jobs
in san diego and elsewhere and i know
some developers who may be looking and
they may not be advertising just because
they don't want to ok I help kids learn
to program java mainly because that's
what i like robots a lot of fun so let's
program some robots together so get them
interested in the technology right hand
their parents like that too ok cool
alright so you see Paul had several
different people that he helps with now
once you have that idea or who are the
people you want to help with help doing
what now then you can start thinking
about the next fast step right how you
how you can make your web presence right
because now you know exactly where the
people you're gonna help with you know
exactly how are you gonna help them with
because you just you just fell out right
so now you can start think about what
your blog we're gonna do your blog
should talk about not generic things but
about the things that you just throw
right there right you know your blood
should talk about the things that those
people need to do exactly what you said
they need it right so you said you want
to give if people visibility so your
blog should talk about visibility right
he can get visibility now because a lot
of developers they have blogs they're
like generic blocks all right they look
like more things that they want to do
and there's no audience right if you
don't if you don't target an audience
people not gonna come read your broad
right so you have to have an idea and
that's the same for your Twitter for
your facebook for any social media that
you have because you know why would
people follow you on twitter if you're
just talking about random things or if
you just talk about um you know the last
food that you ate or you're taking
picture for whatever you mean you have
to have an idea of what you're gonna
helping people with so they would come
to your blog they'll come to your social
media they'll come to your Twitter you
wanna be focused mmm you want a hope you
want to be focused exactly you're gonna
folk
them something that's important to
someone else right so all of these
things are Hardy Korea checklist right
and he also talked about some some to
that you can think but there's some
other cool things here there's there's
for practice that we talk here in the
career checklist on how to improve your
career and the first one is meet a
mentor right a mentor can make a huge
difference in your life have you haven't
had a mentor so I looked for mentor for
years okay never found one I decided
that I would just like see as which
strikes around me uh-huh and consider
them as a mentors without them knowing
without having like a formal
relationship as mentors but that's
exactly a good idea to have a mentor
because a lot of people think that I
mentor someone that that we have to talk
with that but a mentor is someone that
you are willing to follow their device
right even if they don't know you write
a lot of times you can find a mentor
that's you know if oh I'm gonna follow
at javas advice on how to improve my
career so if you're gonna follow what
your lon says should you know even if
you don't talk to her but if you read
her blog and if you follow the things
that's it's a jazz if you go off the
technology that ship she points to you
you're using you on as a mentor right so
that's an excellent idea line thanks a
lot right so so you should search for
your mentor right how about you pull
have you mentioned lots of people
probably yes right ok so now the other
thing is that you gotta meet people
right you got you got to go out there
meet developers talk with developers a
lot of people just think that oh I have
my friends here on my company and you
don't talk to father other develop you
don't see all the problems you don't
don't experience what other people are
going through and you do have to meet
people I think that's one of the reason
why you come to events right yeah
absolutely
so why do you make events ball that's
what I guess that's what we do right to
come to these events is to meet new
people to make an event so that you can
bring those people together right and
that's just I guess that's why ya when I
became the president of the Sangha San
Diego Java users group back in 2001 it
was because I saw it as me contributing
back I've gone to the geezers grip
before was a member now they needed
somebody to take over I did and been
doing it ever since yeah my wife calls
it it's my baby my baby is like 16 years
old now that's pretty cool that's pretty
cool so now one it's my favorite here is
that you gotta submit a contribution an
open source project you know by not only
using open source project every one can
use an open source project but if you're
a developer you gotta get involved you
gotta submit a contribution and and the
reason why you got to submit a
contribution is that you have to first
of all you have to learn how to do it
right and second you have you have to
see that's not as hard as it looked so
you got to make a fine therefore there
to find out to find an open source
project you can contribute to and do a
small contribution even if you're just a
fix on the documentation if it's just a
small fix on a comment on a code or
whatever you know you gotta go do the
whole process of all contributed
contributed open source projects
probably one of the best career moves
they can ever do in your life so that's
a question for him that's a question for
me that's a great you know that is
something that is something 98 you guys
do the next one I was not so all right
so yeah contributing then help giving
back to the community in some fashion
others so I've not been on an open
source project all right have I
contributed to code but I did make a
contribution to Wikipedia as far as
in an area that I was interested in
finding an error correcting it getting
it approved by the guy who owned that
page but let me let me ask one thing
have you ever promoted an open source
project in your user group I mean have
you ever brought the speaker from an
important open source project for Matt
beans or or for Apache project or from
eclipse I've ever promoted that you're
easier yeah of course that's healthy
don't open source project okay right
okay so yeah okay having the guys come
and trying to convince somebody or maybe
somebody in the audience did contribute
so a part of the users group action i
think the the java community process now
which is hoping it out more towards
individuals to help out even the users
group can now sign up and start
contributing making it easier to go back
into the java.lang i'm like you said
just contributing reading the
documentation or doing a test case yes I
think there is also like even for jess's
you can't even write a blog or just like
remote the jets are so it doesn't have
to be like very complex or no no it's a
you know but yes but when you help an
open source project when you promote an
open source project when you get
involved in any way right it's really
important right but uh you know if you
really if you if as a developer writing
code is our is our day to day life right
so find a way to help an open source
project it's a great way for you to know
people meet on the developers and get
your whole career move in the right
direction all right so the other thing
that I would like to think about is
apply additional marketing technique
right this this might sound weird but
you know a lot of thing a lot of times
when you talk about career is we got
people say oh you gotta go out there you
gotta get you know you got to get
involved you got to do things and you
gotta you gotta be visible right that's
that's part of you you know you have to
market yourself you have to March
yourself your market your project so
when you talk about digital marketing
technique there's a lot of little things
you can do that to understand a little
bit of marketing that will help you
market yourself mark your blog you know
you're not going to have a blog or even
a social media account if you don't find
ways to market so by learning a little
bit of my or digital marketing that will
go a long way now you want to say
something about that yes because that's
that's nice week actually my more of a
focus that I've taken off back in the
last six months mhm so since I'm
promoting a lot of content on the
Internet so whether it's social media
blogs its articles and so I've and then
we migrated also to different websites
so I to come to learn I mean basics
about like search engine optimization
there is a lot of information on goes
hiking for example they have tons of
tools I mean if you interested in the
field I mean they they have an account
on Twitter that I'm following they have
tons of tips and it actually doesn't
take that long to to just use your
skills and know enough so you don't make
mistakes okay and even like little
things like for example so my
presentation is is a lot of that on
Twitter and it's surprising to me to see
that how many people don't have a
picture they don't have they don't use
like the big banner that you have on top
of the on Twitter they don't they don't
use their their profile description like
properly like just tell me what you do
right I don't really care if you have a
dog or not yes it's social media you
need to be like friendly and so forth
but you know that give useful
information because when I looking for
content I want to
see who you are so I can retweet you or
i can see if you have a book or just
know something about you you know I
don't have time to read your entire bio
but that I can you know so I need a
quick fast way of understanding who the
persons are in the community so yes so
there's plenty of things there's plenty
of little things you can do judge that
goes a long way right but all always
starts and comes out of the focus that
you're gonna give your career right so
you know we're completely running out of
time here but I'd like to offer you the
power checklist for you to download
improve your career this is a checklist
you can do you know next event you go
you can do right now of wherever you are
but if you're here javaone that's
something you can do during the event
and I'm sure you're going to find all
the thing all these steps here at the
Korea checklist ok so like to thank you
your lon thank you Paul for joining here
and this is the night hacking directly
from javaone San Francisco thanks a lot
guys thank you thank you alright press
