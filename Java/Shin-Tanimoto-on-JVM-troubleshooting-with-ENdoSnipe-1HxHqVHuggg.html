the english presentation was my first
experience that was too much had you

number of international speakers yeah I
mean to give talks so I think you're not
alone a lot of people come to speak from
Russia from Israel mmm from china yeah
from Japan and as English speakers
sometimes it's a little bit difficult to
understand but I think the technical
information is very good yeah so it
makes it worthwhile mmhmm yeah it's
awesome for me I don't understand
English well but I I mean I I can
understand the people to go to travels

cover coverage frictions that with our
time over to the numbers go there is no
fruit juices in my system for one hour

hours I really heavy still there is no
4g fees but the minus the sum of minus
disease close yep please 55 minutes 500
milliseconds or up to 11 second

application performance yes then i have
the i have a function that is called the
Bahamas doctor it may be just it works
still yeah it that you know diagnose tap
application not only motoring but Sir so

too much heavy cord that this system
shows and that is too much x equals ok

database calls in your application yeah
too much database course yeah very good
or it's too much too long less much time
or it might call may be occurring the
memory leaks yeah it can detect the
defects not only monitoring but also the
detectors are defects cool yeah so we
