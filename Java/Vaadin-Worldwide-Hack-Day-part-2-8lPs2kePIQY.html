excellent so let's get back where we we
were so basically I was kind of
explaining the truck sure of how CDI and
navigators work together so basically we
have muster details view over here
implemented with Vardon CDI when I'm
choosing our apprentice and it modifies
this uri fragment over here so it just
adds the number of the whole idea of the
presentation as a parameter over here
and code from code point of view this is
implemented like that so I'll show first
the rating you I so the rating you I
here enables loading this UI class to
the root of the application with CDI
automatically so it means that we are
showing this this UI on the screen and
the you are itself it uses this CD
review provider that is basically kind
of implementing changing the views
within this you I like the views like
view proba views like presentation view
or login view or whatever view we might
have now we only have a one view called
translation view and this is the
navigation working working in such way
that we add a new navigator over here
and we connect this navigator with the
view provider and after that everything
else is automated so we actually don't
do anything else over here and the
navigation itself now kind of depends on
on this views so each view will be
annotated with CDI view annotation like
like that and this view annotation might
contain a parameter that would say the
name of the view so if we would say that
this is presentations view then that
presentations will be included in the in
the URL
but let's use just the default so this
is the default view that is shown if
there is no name at all inside this view
we we are having a two different
components so we are having this
presentation details components so
that's basically the right side of the
of the screen and presentation list
component on the on the left side of the
screen and these are wired up together
in a such way that when we enter this
trend is in view we call enter method
enter method basically gets this URL
fragment or the parameters to the UI
fragment as a parameter so this last one
over here and it delegates that whatever
other parts of the UI here in this case
the details component so that's
basically it for the navigation the
important part of everything over here
is that this was just kind of dividing
up but now we can get all the feeds or
from from CDI so we actually can instead
of explicitly imitating anything we can
inject or the all that parts over here
so we are injecting all the UI
components when we inject the UI
component they can use things like like
post contract basically say that this
method should be called after the it has
been injected to the application
moreover we can also inject service
layer over here so we are actually
injecting this rating service and this
binds our cells directly to the to the
backend so that's the you ipod the back
end part i think this is kind of
irrelevant in in in the presentation but
i just kind of give a quick peek over
there so this is a simple singlet on
class implementing the rating service
this is just quite a hack
I'm not the backend guy by him I any
many mean so I just used the persistency
context to do some storing of math to my
data storing the data back to the data
layer using jpa that's what a timorous
is over here so there are comments
presentations and ratings in the data
model but it's pretty simple if you have
been using jpa before so I don't go into
details over there so the next
assignment for you would be basically
starting or modifying your to-do list to
use CDI so instead of know you to do
list it uses explicit mod in servlet
that you are defined in the UI let's
change it in a such a way that you are
actually using CDI to load up your UI
and you can I don't know what kind of
to-do list you have but you can add
navigator there as well well if you want
to have different views in in your to do
list like maybe like read some kind of
list view and kind of atom in view very
good I don't know how do to-do lists
have multiple views I think the most
important part is to try to get it up
and up and running okay so we got joke
but and say back yeah another way to do
this would actually be to just check out
this step one CDI and browse through the
code and try to change things here and
there I that would be the easier way to
kind of try to break stuff instead of
build stuff it's always more fun except
when people are breaking my code like in
this case cool yeah
so let's see if you have any questions
just shootin on the IRC says the as the
hacking going over there for use of n so
I heard I heard the game's over now
we're bound both big screens that's good
so well good good for the Germans cuz
they won 10 okay who they were playing
with us the u.s. okay but apparently
they're they're quite happy over there
are you guys are you guys happy about
the outcome of the match sosua yeah you
feel throwing a big extreme small screen
alright that's good yeah so we've taken
over both screens or are you guys you
guys feel satisfied about kicking in
when we're feeding the you s up I hope
the other networks catch up this as well
so after the world cup is ndd flavor
they can broadcast this what we're
studying again the the time lag audio
and amused me you should you should be
getting audio from hangouts now I see
you in the Hangout you hear you from the
hang also yeah we hear you from the
Hangout see but hacking is fine yes ed
yeah so did you go is fine but we got no
video on the Hangout and the azan Kronus
audio from the ustream video and the
audio from the hang out with a delay
alack oh yeah that's really bad yeah now
you should be using the audio from the
oh is it frozen oh yeah okay your video
your video on the Hangout appears to be
frozen let me let me see if I can fix
that now let's test finger to the guys
are pretty static hands are not moving
okay now they're moving ND another movie
but you actually are I'm pushing our
stream to them but oh it crashed okay
finally google hangout realized it was
unhappy in it it went belly-up I'll
restart it that explains why they
weren't getting good google hangout
to do
it's thinking about joining the Hangout
yeah please wait actually while we are
waiting maybe it would make sense for me
to introduce the rest of the JPA later
as well yeah okay so it will be good to
finish all the content in time so that
people have some here I'm happy looking
like on hacking for the remainder next
questions okay go for it yeah so
basically there we are so that's the
step one CDI the next step after that
would be actually start accessing data
from the from the jpa layer directly so
we have a component called JP a
container for it let me take that one up
so get check out step one so now we
should have both both access to the data
layer as well as has full cydia
implementation over here we didn't
change much in in the project so we had
a couple of things let me show you we
added container for for gluing data to
from from your JP layer to UI component
actually if you haven't been using what
in data sources I have a quite good
reference for that so the reference
being book of boring so on the slides
and then all the slides are by the way
in the github repo as well so on the
slides just click the link to book a
boring and it should open up directly in
this model JP a container so that's has
a really comprehensive documentation and
what you can do with which AP a
container we are just using the very
very basics of that but as a kind of
simplification you can have any table in
the database and
and that put that under your UI with the
line or two so let me show those lines
so let's take for example presentation
container role here and zoom it a bit so
what we have over here is let's see
class extending JP a container and the
key over here is to say as a generic
parameter that which means you having in
your container we have a presentation
being business listed in this container
and then we just inject entitymanager
over there and set the provider to be
whatever we have added over there so
that's it so it basically JP a conjurer
does all the magic for you and you don't
actually have to even if you want to
kind of make it quick you don't have to
even create this class you can just say
new JP a container and you need to
initialize that we tend to the manager
as a parameter but after that we can
start using it so we can go to
presentation list component so that
would be where we have our example
running over there so let me reload this
and see if it works so now we have on
the left side of screen we have a real
data from database and this speaker list
over there is just one word in table and
this one in table is now built into my
presentation list just a layout that
includes this table over here and the
only thing that we basically doing in it
is where we have it we have
presentations
and we say set condign relate the sauce
so basically with this one line we can
start reading presentation from the jpa
layer and put these on the screen and
after that all things like lazy loading
and and all that that kind of
complicated stuff is handled
automatically for you the rest of the
stuff in this class or just bit of
formatting that we want to have it like
in the layout take all the space in the
layout than we want to be able to allow
you to select rows from this table and
we say that what happens when you are
selecting a row this is actually pretty
handy notation from Java 8 so you could
say that past as a value which is less
than or to anybody glass that hate when
an accident happens I want to call this
method from this instance and in this
instance I basically just get the value
a chase event and what I do is I
navigate to another view so that's
basically it for gluing that to JP a
layer of course we have full access for
the table errors as well so let me show
this example again over there over there
so if I choose one presentation I
actually have the details view this is
still super ugly but we will be working
on that later on so I can actually
change the data so i can say i'll give a
rating of 5 for this view for for this
presentation and let me fire up another
web browser showing the same rotation so
that you actually can't believe that
this is storing the database if i put
the rating of 1 over here it's actually
not working it's it's calculating the
average from it should be calculating it
right oh yeah like oh it's not actually
broken the thing is that we haven't
implemented log in yet so sorry it
actually thinks that these are the same
same guys so it overrides his Walt okay
how these are glued to the JP layer it's
actually pretty simple i can show that
as well so there we are just using jpa
directly without any anything bought in
specific so let's see what could be a
good example like the print station
rating so that component is the is the
middle part over here a couple of fields
gluing back to the database so as always
what we do we just inject the server or
service over here and start using it the
UI is just take two text fields so these
two text fields over there we put this
on the on the screen like this do some
configuration like we don't want two
people to modify the average trading
directly so obviously that hey this is
read-only on so these are pretty basic
stuff the interesting thing over there
is that we want to say that whenever you
change my rating you want to call rate
method from this class so that's kind of
the power of being on the server side
you can really easily wire up all the UI
illogic on the server side classes that
can call to the backend directly so in
in that class or that that method I'm
just part of checking if the value is
correct and if it's correct it if it's a
number if it's between one and five so
let's see how give rating of ten for
this it says that I can only be between
one and five so that kind of basic UI
logic and the key is that I just call
service layer directly and this service
layer is injected over here
automatically so I say set rating and
this actually saves that back to the
database cool so that it should be
really really simple to gonna call from
you I to database and back with such few
lines of code and CDI does automatic for
doing this together with a application
example of this size I mean like a
couple of classes CDI probably
introduces more complexity that it
removes but if it's a big couple of gays
and you can deep couple all the
components pretty well with this so I
guess that's basically it for for
actually CD and JP a funny thing should
be go through other topics right now or
should we give a bit of time for people
to hack with these first I would just
run through ok let's do it so so it did
note that you can choose which part of
the exercise you want to hack with so
the next step is logging this is let's
go through this real quick because this
is a test application specific hack so I
wanted to have some kind of looking for
rating system because clearly if you you
cannot use the writing system if there
is no login and how we did it over here
is that let me check out the step 2 and
can you actually even update this life
and see how it works no it isn't that
restart the application so the idea is
for the login that I don't want to have
yet another password to remember so it
instead you log in with your email and
you you get to link to your inbox for
logging in so let's see if it open up
the application is still starting the
server it seems oh no I had a wrong URL
rating so it asks your email so if I
tell me honest at vodacom login what
happens is that it says link sent to
your nose actually I didn't want to
conserve our mail sending parameters you
can do that as well but it it
they're all the code is in in the rating
service layer so you can enable that
code if you want you for now it just
puts that on the log that it would send
an email with this link to myself so
let's see I go to this link and open it
up what happens is that it says that
user logged in and this is you're not
boring so it just kind of uses this link
to identify me and after that I can
start doing things as you're honest so
actually now I probably should be able
to login twice with different browsers
so let's login us let's say I'd minute
volcom and let's use this link so the
right one is is admin and it acts no it
is not the direct current one
maybe i just have the same browser i
open up completely different browser huh
oh yeah it was admin that thing is that
i don't still have any any you want to
modify those predators but if I let's
say we take the first train days and
give it a rating of one maybe there are
already so many votes for this study
doesn't affect this give five yeah it
kind of rubs it up to three and if I go
with another user for the same I already
saw see that it's now three not you and
I can give my reading of 12 that and it
it kind of goes down to two so it
actually all the parts work and our
store to the database so that was
basically login code why's it
implemented us as adding a login view
over there now the login view doesn't
have any any any parameters in the CDI
view annotation so it means that this is
the default view while last presentation
you do have an parameter saying that
it's a presentations view over there so
by default you go to login view login
view shows you look in you I basically
what's your email box and button and
interview you you can just listen for
changes and do whatever base and logic
you you have ordered for the login I
don't go through the loop easy logic
because this is not interesting it's
just really simple stuff off of putting
your ID on a hashmap and checking who
you are and then navigating to the
correct view in this case how we
actually stored the user we simply have
a session bean called user and we store
the email out of the
in the session be that is injected so
it's Celia takes care of all the all the
contexts and where to store your
identity but let's go forward so that
was there step 2 then next step will be
forms and and how to modify data so
while for that the best kind of overview
is in a book of war in a chapter called
data model let's see again my link is
wrong d
binding components to data so it
basically gives you a quick overview of
what kind of data there is and in this
case we are using this mostly this
container model where we have rows and 4
rows we have like values in in there so
that's basic like tabular data so the
data model is such that we can take any
one of these rows we call them items so
we have this item and we can say this
this item that's let's bind this to a
form and after that the form takes care
of all the all the commits and these
cards and buffering and all the
validation little details related to
forms so let me show that how it works
to you so step 3 and let's go here in
idea so what happened is that we got one
more class called presentation details
and this is how forms are made in
nursery print this inform so this is how
forms are made in morning seven there
are just normal UI components for
external disk Omer it's just a vertical
layout so we don't have a form component
anymore as we had in the past what do
you do is you just put bunch of UI
components in the form like I probably
can run this as well no we would have to
restart the ID and the server once
so we boot bunch of UI components on the
forum and that's that's it how we
actually bind this to data we do that
through a object called field group so
it defines that this this is a set of a
group of fields and these should be
bound to an item on the data layer and
this is actually quite simple how we do
it so we first create a new field group
and then we put an item for the field
group so it basically says that this
field group the data source for this
field group is an ball in item now we
are using just plain javabeans so we've
wrapped this been in a bin item class so
it can glue any java bean directly to
voting data layer so we have this
presentation being with topic and
speaker and that kind of properties and
we by buying this directly field group
and then we said the field group that I
please bind this to user interface
component given over here and this using
the phase component happens to be this
layout it doesn't matter which ever user
interface communities but there should
be some properties that can be bound you
and these properties are over here so we
have topic speaker and start time and so
forth so these are just feels on that
layout and rest is automated it actually
uses the names of the properties 24 for
binding that the data layer if this is
unconvinced for you you can also
annotate that I please use that ugly
name in the database and that I don't
want to have in my class over here and
after that they forget synchronized
between the data layer and what you have
on the screen so let see if it works out
so let's look looking again now we have
the login as admin so that we can edit
stuff so we have that edit link over
here so now we see an editor for one
presentation over here and we can modify
stuff and save and we can also do stuff
like edit and say reset this reset
actually calls a field group discard so
that kind of transonic transaction
allottees is built into in the field
groups directly and I guess that's
basically it for field groups they have
a nice kind of fine-grained details like
let's say your beam has been using jaser
303 annotations for four constraints so
what happens is that it actually sees
that there are those annotations create
user interface level validators
automatically for you that this cannot
be new or that string must be shorter
than five character and that kind of
stuff yeah so it's good to validations
on both sides yeah and it's fully
decorative so if you're JP layer has
that already you don't have to do
anything it's you I gets created for you
automatically so then the next and step
over here would be Adams so in involving
let's open up a browser we have a huge
directory of add-ons so let me go there
so you just call the warden com click
download and add-ons and you can browse
through 440 add-ons let's take a simple
example like what was a good example
let's take any one of these easy uploads
you typically have like download counts
ratings version history dr. normal
normal stuff that you would find in any
app store but basically almost all of
that
of free so it is not an app store in
that sense you also have screenshots
normally showing that how the add-on
component looks like so you don't have
to even download it you have some code
examples how to use it and if you want
to use it you have two options you
either click download button you
basically get the jar file that you can
drop into your project almost everyone
clicks the Maven button and what they
get over there is maven definition an IV
definition that they can cut and paste
and put it into your projects so I can't
just cut and paste this is my poem and
add an upload feel to my easy uploads
component to this project so let's see
this from the code side let's check out
step 4 so what happens here is that my
pom.xml now contains some new add-on
dependency go rating stars so this is
how we can rate these presentations that
is basically would be it but there is
one extra step that must be done because
notice rating stars it also contains
client-side functionality implemented a
google web toolkit so we have the
compile this java based client site
functionality to javascript and this is
only actually done one sort of the after
kind of adding your add on to the
project you compile once and and it's
done i tend to use maven for this so we
have this body maven plugin in the
project where you can first update the
widget set but it does is actually scans
through your project and figures out if
you have any addons in in use it
automatically updates google web toolkit
has this good xml file that defines
where the code are so it's basically
auto auto creates those for you after
adding this ad on over here and the next
step will be boring compile so it takes
the built-in compiler and
compiles the client-side implementation
of our application integrates this
rating start functionally over there are
knowing stuff is that this takes a bit
of time so it takes maybe half a minute
or so on a fast machine a bit more than
100 slow one and while it compiles so
what it basically creates it creates an
javascript file that has the
implementation fine-tuned for all the
different browsers and basically pat
seeing different box in different
browsers so now we got it compiled and
we can I think I think Tommy always want
to go that we restart the server after
we have changed our dependencies in the
project so let's restart it once more to
get this adder integrated well restoring
I can show how attacks actually is used
so the rating did you have a over here
already no presentation ratings so in
the previous version we had these
ratings done with text boxes so instead
of been using text box if we just have
replaced these text fields with rating
stars component over here otherwise the
code is basically exactly the same it
uses the same data sources it's actually
a bit more simple because it does all
those you don't have the parse from
strings and and see if there are numbers
or not this is tat using numbers
directly so let's restart this one I'll
run this one so we are you wanna set for
income
and we get the login link now we can
open up any interpretation and we see
these ratings with with the current
rating unlimited writing Star widget
over here some of these presentations in
to have so many ratings that it doesn't
matter if i write them somewhere on some
foreign force on with average actual
exchanges so that's Adams and I think it
it is actually quite fun exercise to go
in the director and such browse through
and see what kind of cool stuff is is
there and try to integrate something so
we'll continue with the final step right
away that would be theming so for
teaming again the best place to start
learning about it is the book I hope I
have a correct link this time loading
loading loading no I'm i think that i
cut and pasted all the links wrong over
there hey del it looks that this is
correct this text but keynote color
different link under the underneath
anyways you just take the theming
section from the book and you're good to
go and it explains things like the
structure of the themes as well as as
pawns you out to the sauce how the kind
of sauce combination works sauce is a
not a notation that is gone obstructing
away from CSS so that you can build your
theme is in a bit more convenient manner
so let's see how this works in practice
so finally we can check out the master
branch
oh we have introduced something over
there so now we're in master and the new
stuff in our project this time is put
under web app folder so there there is
the this new volume folder and themes
folder so all the themes go to this
themes folder how you select the theme
is basically in your UI class you just
add theme annotation over there so it
now you say that hey what we want to use
pestle team instead of default one and
the special theme is called rating so it
actually goes to this themes folder and
choose its rating theme rating theme
contains basically creating a CSS file
so this is just defining how the theme
should look like as well as that's
that's basically that the rest are our
kind of normal generated from the out
from the archetype so you have to
actually build this by yourself in that
theme itself you defined everything
within let's see introduced over here
everything within one CSS class rating
so that if you have different parts of
the webpage your theming doesn't kind of
flow out to the rest of the web page and
that's it for it let's first see how it
looks like and then this got a bit more
how you can build it so now there is a
one complication because I wanted to use
a valo theme that is not released yet
and the swallow theme is actually quite
huge effort involving we have built a
a kind of java based sauce compiler that
compiles the theme the thing is that we
are using such advanced features from
shorts that are a component of a
compiler or own theme yet so it's a bit
embarrassing situation that we are
fixing this month I hope or by the mid
July so we are actually using now
external compiler and for that I have a
maven project somewhere so we have
included already this or should have
been included this sauce compiler where
is it hmm why isn't it over here should
I somehow reference this oh yeah now
after i refresh the idea notice that we
have sauce compilation target as well
over here so what i can do is i can say
sauce update style seeds and it
basically compiled from those s CSS
files to regular CSS files so that way
we can use all the kind of high-level
abstractions on top of CSS you can
actually call directly in CSS as well
but it's a bit more it becomes more
complicated when you have a lot of CSS i
can actually demo you actually have a
lot of CSS in this case after the
compilation the CSS Styles a deploy it's
quite long so you don't want to modify
that kind of CSS by hunter so let's see
where is our application ooh maybe I
have to again restart the server
looks like it's getting late over there
and and your Lake Constance Germany hmm
those guys are yawning hey you guys
should have more beer over there mm-hmm
yes it's definitely better beer timing
although so this is the same application
but with a different theme and there is
also a quick link to kind of just pass
through the it big this that's very
professional now yeah it looks a bit
outdated hitter the reindeer default
theme is from 2009 and it shows and with
valo theme we actually had an
interesting problem with with theming we
were building this one in touch get
product and and over there we are kind
of simulating iOS look and feel really
closely and then we were almost
releasing this until Apple released iOS
7 then look at how it looks completely
different so we had this product that
looks like iOS 6 pixel by pixel and it
looks pretty outdated and at the same
time guys building for Android that you
kind of complaint that I cannot run this
even though it works in my other phone
but it looks iOS 6 its total stupid so
we desire that the theme that we are
gonna be doing would be such that you
can actually change high level
parameters how the theme should look
like so with some some simple parameter
you could change from looking like flat
windows like the local looking like iOS
to looking like Facebook so it sets a
handful of parameters and that those are
kind of built on top of sauce and it
kind of enables you to change all the
different parts of the theme at once
cool so one other thing over there is
that it is responsive so when the
compiler get resize reside it it
actually can change things like font
sizes and lay
out a bit and normally all this
responsiveness is done with the media
queries in CSS media queries are just
fine if you're willing web web sites the
thing is that media query actually says
only that the organic bound CSS changes
to media queries according to the widow
of the page so if I'm going to result
resizing the component with not the page
media coverage wouldn't give you an
overview so we basically kind of copied
media query notation in a such way that
you can also wire up those changes on a
component level oh so this is done let's
see where we have over here
done not like this so you got to give
with ranges so these selectors are
included only when the component with
these are within this range so this is
something that you can at the moment
only doing in inviting it requires a bit
of extra layer of management that is not
built in the browsers but I guess that
that kind of we have gone through all
the different topics in in the workshop
okay so yes when just mentioned that he
actually has stepped for working okay
over there I'm putting you back on the
big stream big screens man okay the
question I have for you they have
created my java script component here
okay it's when it is it to run because I
yeah that's working but because I am
initializing the JavaScript here in the
in the old way so what I have all my UI
is i instantiate a component and i have
yelled this method is a method for but
let me show you that in it part of the
component again all right so you had
something like I don't have anything
because yeah but you have this
initialized yeah this is mine yeah but
are you calling that yes I am yeah I am
I am calling that but this is not the
thing because i want i want to remove it
you should put that in the JS file yeah
i can show you know but what I want with
this component is to load this all right
I want to use these components about
this yeah so yeah and you have already
put the component on the screen or no so
I visited it is a just a normal bar in
several compounds you had to put it on
the screen
sorry show haha that was easy one this
time I thought the dwarfs had is the
eyes kind of absurd to do to instance it
a component which doesn't do anything
yeah but these are visual component so
it's all right yeah yeah so yeah sorry
how we went down your troubleshooting
your real okay so how are things going
over there spin you want to say hi on
camera
so how did things go for you guys as a
group today done to me cough please Oh
D'Amico yeah that's always the classic
mr. gwenny alaga watterson week I hope
the mic is working well so yeah we can
hear it it yep some chopped maiden
running anything i integrate I think it
working switching branches but I think
everybody goes I need some examples
running Oh what one guys don't you get
this book working hope it helped out I
get in yet price Trotsky's behind and um
yeah but a lot of fun very your
interesting framework a little bit but
never really tried it so I'm pretty sure
we'll get more people oh yeah i think
that the work the workshop was done in
such way that they're all like different
levels of depth so we call from like
hello world to actually integrating
latest bleeding edge changes from the
front from the next version of warden so
it's not expected everybody would
actually start from this iterative
leading it changes but you can
experiment on whatever level is the most
convenient for you or what whichever
step is the best yeah and it seems like
you guys made pretty good progress there
weren't a lot of issues or problems you
guys hit other than just network maven
issues yeah yeah this we try out the
sara is cool and how did the new setup
work today with the the alternate other
than a little crash in the middle with
the new google hangout setup
yeah let's lay works thank you yeah i
think it was definitely easier to reach
you guys because we don't have the
stream leg to worry about for forgetting
responses from you yeah we're getting
you food all right cool I also tweeted
to pick about that to do you've created
show oh yeah yeah there it is step 4 I
will retweet it so when you're tweeting
stuff then make sure you put hashtag
night hacking because that's what shows
up on the website oh yeah that's how I
didn't cheat that one ah it's it's cool
to mention the twitter ID but then it
doesn't show up on the website because
that's not part of the web site query
but i'll get it up there by retweeting
it with the hashtag there we go all
right all right next one all right so
we'll we'll hang out a bit to help you
guys out with the lab I'll leave the
google hangout open but i think we're
going to conclude the live stream yeah I
think that's it done and we over here
and if you are not in reachable by hang
out go about in forum she's a really
good place to ask any questions related
to any of the topics that we have had
all right so I think yonas very much for

awesome well prepared layout thank you

expertise we we can show that if you
want you or you can tweet any right yeah
