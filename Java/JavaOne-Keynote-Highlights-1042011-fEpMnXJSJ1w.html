7 you know being able to do that this
summer jdk 7 is out there e 7 work is
ongoing a lot of community involvement
in that so we are making progress there
is one other announcement I want to make
today which is that we are today
announcing the preview for jdk 7 on mac
OS you know first off i want to go out
there and announce that IBM delivered
java 7 on its IBM platforms last week
and this is available in all the I'm
from platform e6 i think is probably the
best enterprise platform for java that
we've seen since j to you came on the
scene because the wider community has
managed to give us use cases and help to
shape the technical direction i think in
the next couple of years what we want to
do is to continue driving optimizations
into the hardware continue driving
optimizations into the software and
hopefully in the next year or so we'll
be back here and talk about at least
double that maybe 30 x performance
improvements I think it's safe to say
overall the Javas number one development
platform in software probably in the
history of software so here's our
roadmap everyone knows we just ship java
7 today hassan just announced we're
doing it for mac so that's looking great
netbeans has been with us holes every
step of the way we had day one support
from NetBeans for java 7 I expect the
same thing from NetBeans on Java 8 today
we're announcing that we're actually
open joining the OpenJDK as well as the
JCP right
and so everyone knows yesterday we
announced the ga Bev X on Windows the
beta of it on Mac same time we did betas
of the scene builder that the interface
builder and the NetBeans support so
coming over the next year we expect to
have a ga of the mac and also later in
the year ga on linux of FX support you
know everything we do in the jdk is open
source i want to announce that Oh javafx
will be no exception we plan to open
source first the components and then the
rest of the framework I wanted to share
a little bit about the Emmy roadmap
coming soon we'll have a new update from
from Oracle that includes many of these
api's in prototype form we have some
great distribution things in the works
they should be on a lot of phones very
soon so if you look at if you look at
what's going into java ee 7 it's pretty
exciting we have all the clouds stuff we
also have a number of upgrades coming
for other standards in java ee we have a
upgrade coming a major upgrade coming
for the java messaging service and
finally we have a caching api going into
java ee 7 thanks everybody for coming
and have a great show take care
