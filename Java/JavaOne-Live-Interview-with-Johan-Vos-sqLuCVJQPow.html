calm and i'm doing javaone interviews
with different speakers who are going to
be out for the conference javaone san
francisco is from September 22nd through
26th and today I'm joined by dr. Johan
boss how you doing how you doing you
home now fast you think how you so what
what is your plan for java one what sort
of exciting surprises content well i'll
be giving a two presentations in my
favorite areas one is a completely on
javafx and the other one is on the java
enterprise and more specifically social
software on top of the java ee 7
standards go and give any interesting
applications or stuff you're going to be
showing those presentations well for the
I javafx presentation we will be showing
the new release of data FX which is a
framework that Jonathan guards Hendrik
everton myself created for binding data
in javafx controls to remote data
sources we will release in version 2 of
data of axiom probably few days before a
presentation it's a sales conference
driven development as always it's a it's
it starts with Java one and it ends at
the job one at devoxx in between yep so
with data FX we will we will show the
current state we show some enhancements
on the previous version and we have what
we had a few requests from people that
wanted for example to have right back
support when the data changes locally
and that's what we we edit we gonna show
it you might also show some more
real-time applications using gate
effects using web sockets oh nice are
you using the the new e7 WebSocket
support absolutely so the
back-end example is a running glassfish
for with the server component of the web
socket API and in the client we are
using the client API of the Java API for
web sockets so they'll actually I think
to reduce our boilerplate code by ninety
five percent or something so that took a
very precise number there you you
probably did a research study and
measure that right it's I have to admit
it between 95 and ninety five to seven
but ok so let's show your desktop and
you can show some of the stuff you've
been working on ok there is my desktop
so well maybe the data FX talk we have
data facts is a project which we
recently moved over to bitbucket so you
can have a look at it there we release
dude three of a date of x2 copper of
data CO and we have a number of projects
in there with data vexcorp parent web
chocolate and the samples so what I can
show now is a sample where we have a
java at x table view which you can see
here with three records so this is this
really looks like a database and
actually it is a view on the database
now the interesting thing here is that I
can't change person's first name but I
can't change their last name and if I do
so so for example Jonathan his last name
so they're always discussions about how
to pronounce his last name so yeah I
trouble with that what is that kills
yeah well tiaras jarrah will become from
now it's jonathan smith ah okay that
helps now i can pronounce it jonathan
smith hey so if you look at the output
Jonathan Jonathan Jai also be so happy
we
but you're this name on my lips true how
late is it in New Zealand Oh puppy yeah
it's already wait but probably another
blaming us so what happened is we see
some system output where this statement
is now executed in the database update
first and set last name is Smith where
first name is Jonathan so because in the
first version of data FX did the one way
binding so this data comes from a
database and in this in the new version
we also have to weigh binding no change
oh hi Jonathan if we change a record
here it's written back into the database
now this is the database but we also
have examples using rest services web
services where changes made by the unit
or propagated back to the original a
left or so um I noticed there's there's
a guy Johan Fox and the list do you know
who that is actually that was my um
that's a test driven development so
before i entered the this a stream i I
wanted to make sure that it worked and i
forgot to restore the application so
just just to get revenge on you i
offered up in the live stream they can
they can pick the name that we should um
we should call you so we'll get back to
it but if they can come up with a
creative name that we're gonna we'll put
something interesting there for you i'll
buy something like I know that I that
would probably not be the first choice
but it's my first choice so what other
what are their stuff do you have in
store for java one okay so this is this
is the java vexa a talk where where we
focus on how to get enterprise data into
javafx applications it already combines
my two favorite areas which is
enterprise and uh and javafx your talk
is actually the opposite its enterprise
dream but it also has a
javafx component so the second talk is
about dolly core which is a framework on
top of Java Enterprise seven where we
add the the concepts of users content
and social networks on top of the Java
enter to doing social social integration
on top of Java EE yes and we leverage
the java ee 7 specification so what
we've seen in many projects is that
there's lots of boilerplate code goes
today's projects many people need too
many developers need to write an
integration with with Facebook or
Twitter and they should extend the user
information that they receive from
facebook with some local user
information that's stored in a database
so the a long time ago facebook and and
the other social networks were just for
fun and what we see today is that the
business aspect of having facebook
applications and facebook integrations
in general is increasing and today
there's no stammers in java yet for how
to deal with there was a year was a
standardization effort there's a
proposed jsr around social but i think
it didn't actually get ratified that was
days or 357 and actually i was reading
the comments it's fine IDC asked i was
reading the comments on wife was with
round earlier today and um yeah honestly
um the main reason why it wasn't
accepted was that the scope of support
and i agree with that and also um it's
you have to be careful not to over
standard iso example the domain model is
something that you cannot standardized i
think the other where maybe some songs
the jitter 357 was over-ambitious yeah
but apart from that I think it would
make sense to to have at least a
framework that works on top of java ee 7
and that
who tried to do with Dottie core okay so
let's show them something that but first
we actually got a name from the audience
so we need to change your name to the
proper pronunciation loose be 0000 0000
se that um it would rather be this fast
yeah actually that's much better than
how that I think that's I never said is
that closer to the that's what all the
english-speaking people tell me it's a
it's a witch mccall what's what's the
what's the language for the the the
local language there you mean Dutch yeah
yeah it's vasa Dutch name yes it is and
actually Voss is Dutch for Fox ah ok so
we're getting educated in language now
all right so educate us in dali core
yeah well one of the there are a number
of things about a dalek or that we will
show a job on but one of the things that
are most interesting to to developers is
how can you have this easy integration
with facebook twitter google+ linkedin
authentication so you want people to log
in on your project which is in this case
a website but i can also show a Java vex
application and you don't want well you
don't want people to create a new
account for every single project well
maybe you want but your entries just
don't want I don't find a lot of people
who say I don't sign up for any service
where they want me to register so people
want the opportunity to use their social
network accounts so in this
proof-of-concept you can choose I want
to create an account or I want to plug
in using my social network credentials
so this is what I'm accidentally already
logged in via Twitter so I can
immediately I'll try this application
and all my application sees that i'm
logged in as a johan falls internally
Dalek or couples the user that we have
entry from external networks with a
Dalek or user so you can also combine it
with more online accounts and this part
of the API is gonna is going to retrieve
information from social networks I can
actually show another example but then
this time which f of X application I
mean the mixed of layout or change so it
might not look completely that might be
an improvement of your your usual on
giving styling skills actually the
biggest improvement in my newest styles
is that um someone else is doing to you
I now give outsiders yes so it's a and
recovers who is a changing the layout I
don't know why because I think this is
perfect for the favor not everyone
agrees so this is a like Java becks
application where why I should have
shown first I can hear read some content
and I can both open it but then I said
no you need to be logged in before you
can vote on the content so that's what I
do I can log in and look this is a child
of X application but with Dahle core on
the backend and what we see here is
redirect to the Twitter authorization
and the same principles as i showed in
the web application or used here so the
what are you going to use the web
framework or java vex it's a it connects
to the same back end and you can use the
same API so connected to social networks
it's nice and i was using a java effects
web you to bring up the page exactly yes
and you can see the pictures or
taken from a yeah those are those are a
bunch of ugly mugs don't know who those
people are most of them are s alright so
earlier or in a dolly Corbett this is
the login part so how to connect because
that's often most visible to people what
we will also discuss that is ok now you
can combine users you can you don't have
to create your own user base it's
important to keep the relevant
information in your own application so
you want to combine users and content
from your own application with the and
still leverage the social networks so
that's what what I will talk about in
that second talk cool so um anything
else you want to leave we leave
folks with about what you're going to be
doing at javaone or things they should
check out while they're in San Francisco
um well actually i'm i'm i'm really
looking for surprises at a java one so
you do something that you think that
will surprise me now that we never we
never planned surprises for for java one
we leave all the cool stuff for dev ox
ok that makes that make sense as many
surprises already so it's no matter no
i'm really looking for um I think the
embedded attract has some cool stuff DD
the enterprise strike with a seven it's
going to be very um a decay it's going
to be a high educational trike many new
things and it's going to be interesting
to see how e7 is now being used also
looking forward on the java SE eight but
actually form s in line with jigsaw
implementation and then I'm willing to
your day over a CA that's that was so
last year you are d journey opening
early access openjdk builds yeah sure
yes I mean whatever I'm think it's
running a se8 yeah it doesn't mention it
here but uh um se8 is um yeah it's it's
almost getting boring because it doesn't
contain my pizza so um i ah ah I like
mark mylow that you're you're waiting
for modularity yeah every access se9
would be appreciated very much cool
alright so thanks very much for your
time for the interview and look forward
to seeing you at javaone San Francisco
looking for myself too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
