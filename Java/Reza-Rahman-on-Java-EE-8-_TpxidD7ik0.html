welcome to night hacking at the for dev
conference my name's steven chen and i'm
joined by reza raman how you doing man
no I'm all right good as usual so you
have you recovered from Java one last
week yeah I went to Java two days which
is a just a fantastic conference I
recommend it to anyone on my opinion one
of the most underrated conferences in
the world ever but it was good yeah so
you ready to go from Java one you've
already done one other events yes before
coming here wow so you're much you're
much better man than I in some ways so
um tell me tell me what's up coming with
java ee 8 so what are the major specs
that are going to be included or planned
to be included or what's the recent
developments on java ee 8 the recent
developments are of course as you know
Steve you know in Java Java one we
released a whole bunch of early draft
reviews pretty much all of the specs are
now in early draft review few of them
are still remaining and those will be
coming along you know maybe next month
or so there's a whole bunch of things
that are going on in Java 8 on the web
tier we have the HTTP to support coming
in in servlet for we have a new MVC
framework that everyone's very excited
about it's sort of an actual oriented
framework in addition to jsf and I see
one point to a lot of community
reduction behind that some work in the
JSON area just to keep us up to date
with the stuff that's going on in the
JSON specs in the in the w3c interesting
stuff in the middle tier as well CDI to
moving along very nicely looks looking
pretty sharp there's a very good
security GSR there's a JMS jsr and of
course we want to make sure we're
aligned with the java SE so we will be
pulling in a whole bunch of a job I see
it features stuff like repeatable
annotations and lambdas and the daytime
API yes Precure more of the Java II
it or Java SE a features in Java EE yes
um so besides you know folks working for
Oracle who else who else is behind are
involved in the Java eh specs from a
community or industry perspective you
know this is an interesting question and
actually from Austin sively quite a few
folks so red hat or it has always been a
great contributor you know they've got
been the bean volution API was a solid
contribution in e6 and e7 maybe there
will be a minor revision of bean
validation the CDI work is coming along
very nicely and CDI one point where was
very good really I will I personally was
waiting for a major revision of CDI and
it was finally coming along with CDI two
point O IBM did a great contribution in
e seven with the with the bat suspect
they're revving that up they're going to
do a point release of that whole bunch
of folks in the community but all of
that aside you know frankly you know a
java ee in my mind that the biggest
hurdle we need to we need to do better
on is better community participation so
by all means you know folks that are
thinking about participating you know
this is the time to do it we really need
that sort of contribution very active
contribution from the community as well
as maybe more vendors yeah so it's fine
for people to contribute as individuals
possibly more companies being
represented besides you know kind of the
large ones which you mentioned which
have some dedicated resources what's the
best way to get involved with spec
development it really depends on where
you are if you know i'll be honest with
you i mean i i've contributed it isn't
as it as an individual for almost ten
years now yeah i personally don't see
any problem with it i I really believe
it's the it's the most effective way to
participate in the JCP just as an
individual negative they've also made it
much easier to to get involved with the
JCP as an individual the amount of kind
of legal paperwork involved has been
decreased significantly yes but I mean
honestly it's never been a large hurdle
Franklin for
so that's actually interested in in
contributing so I the first job as real
as the first up I always recommend that
first yeah the other way to contribute
is as a Java user group in fact the
conference that I'm coming from Java two
days actually share I actually invited
on stage some of the folks on the
Bulgaria jug because they're actively
participating as a jug as a group of
people through the adopted ESL program
that we launched a little bit ago and
you know that's been really a good
success in yet again the whole point is
another avenue for people to participate
if they don't want to participate as
individuals or whatever the reason you
know they can always participate as a
joke as part of the Java user group it's
fairly easy for them to sign up and then
you can participate right through your
local jug yeah absolutely cool ok so I
think that's a good overview of some of
the java ee 8 stuff just as all aside
tell us a little bit more about the
conference you're just at java two days
java two days it's a brilliant
conference it started about five years
ago i was one of the one of their first
speakers it's the only large conference
in in the Balkan region so a large
geography think about that so that's a
you know obviously Bulgaria Serbia
Romania Turkey to some degree you know
Greece it's sort of a very nice
community field conference they've got
about 1,500 people already there not a
tiny conference it's really well well
done and is there really it really has a
real community feel to it I mean one of
the best conferences to go to to network
with both attendees as well as other
speakers call now it sounds like an
exciting event maybe more people will
watch this and show up next year for
java two days I hope so I'm so it is
definitely deserves it ok thanks very
much for the short interview resident I
hope you enjoy the rest of your stay
here in almost Sweden oh I always do
it's a very beautiful city yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
