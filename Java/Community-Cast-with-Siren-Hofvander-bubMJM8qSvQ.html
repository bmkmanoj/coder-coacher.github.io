at our dev on the stage where the
community cast and I have another or a
dev speaker here with me this morning
I'd like to introduce you to so we have
siren here thanks for joining us siren
why you tell us a little bit about
yourself well my name is siren I am the
chief security officer for digital
medical company called mean doctor which
is based here in Malmo Sweden where we
do contact between patients and doctors
via a mobile all right that sounds
really interesting i've enjoyed kind of
hearing about some of the different
industries that are here in malmo it's
nice to have a local speaker here so you
have to talks at aura dev this week
Internet of Things and in and out of
things in security and security yes yes
so you're a security expert so you got
to these sessions one on Internet of
Things and security want to tell us a
little bit about that what are some of
the things that you're gonna cover in
that talk work in it we're away I not
the royal we are going to be talking
about what are the security implications
of the Internet of Things everybody kind
of knows about the mirai the distributed
denial of service attack that hit out
krebs krebs on security and ironically a
little town in finland yesterday was
also kind of crushed by a denial a
distributed denial of service attack so
i'm going to be talking about the
security implications of those items and
kind of how we can work with the
Internet of Things and keep security in
mind ok so if you're building systems
things to keep in mind exactly exactly
right ok and then your other session is
is building security into the service
development lifecycle yes I always get
the words back rolling security into the
development lifecycle yes ok how I work
with developers and testers to keep
security within the development life
cycle rather than just hiring a pen
tester at the end of the sprint and just
kind of hoping for the best ok so so
what are some of the things that you
recommend there for people
to do yeah to look at security as as a
whole rather than just as a penetration
test at the end so looking at bringing
security into the requirements and also
looking at safe coding practices and
actually having testers that do security
testing all of the time rather than just
at the end because security is above all
things a team sport so I would say the
largest security weakness that most
organizations have is that assuming that
one person generally myself or someone
else with my particular skill set can do
everything and that's just simply not
true okay so rather than bring security
in as an afterthought it's really
thought of as a vital part of building
the product and final team member exact
all the way throughout the lifecycle
exactly well that sounds like a great
methodology to employ and I know I'm
hearing every day some kind of a
security breach and yeah about privacy
here this week so it's pretty it's a
really important topic so hopefully
folks can check out your sessions and so
being a local maybe I thought I asked
you as well what are some of your
favorite things about or divine oh you
speak at many conferences around Europe
so what what are some of the highlights
of order for you what makes or ative
special um I think because it is a local
conference so you know a lot of the
people that show up which i think is
really interesting I've spoken here
before so I have a lot of people that
come up and remember my previous talks
and have actually like started to do
some of the things I've recommended so
actually being able to see people grow
because sometimes you go to a talk and
you don't know anybody so you kind of
walk away feeling like did I
actually make a difference whereas you
come here and you can actually speak to
people you realize that you that
speaking actually does make a difference
and I really appreciate that cool so I
know I really enjoyed it this is my
first time here so it's nice to meet
some new people like yourself thanks for
taking the time to talk with me and
share a little bit about your experience
and your talks and what makes or ative
so special thank you very much okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
