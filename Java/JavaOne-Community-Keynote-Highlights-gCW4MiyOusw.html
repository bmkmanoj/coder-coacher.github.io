thoughts about the future of home
robotics the definition of the robot is
something that senses something that
thinks in something that acts or actuate
now sensors can be scattered thinking
can happen in the cloud or distributed
little nodes and actuation doesn't
always need to be three axes of
manipulation things can open and close
things can heat up and cool down things
can rotate things can roll away and that
means that we might not be looking at
our household robot we might be living
inside the robot there are hundreds of
billions of man hours spent per year
playing video games so we figure we can
tackle that problem by creating this
robot that can free you up from the
doldrums of playing video games on daily
basis oh I'm sorry I'm playing a Java
Vegas game on my android device I JavaFX
game on your android device what are you
playing I'm saying playing the same game
on my iPad more and more when we you
know looked at consumer electronics they
had a little processor inside now back
in nineteen ninety the the processors
inside were incredibly primitive and and
we thought that there was something
interesting there and we kind of thought
that the computer industry was sort of
missing the boat here's this this world
made up of like electrical and
mechanical engineers who had nothing to
do with the world of computer science
most of them had never taken the
computer science course in their lives
and they were sort of reinventing what
the computer industry had been been
inventing so my part of that project was
to go and solve the software development
tool thing and that's the only part of
that project that survived right was
that with the software development tools
right that's the thing that we now you
know is that at that time called oak
it's now called Java but it really grew
out of the Internet of Things from 1990
