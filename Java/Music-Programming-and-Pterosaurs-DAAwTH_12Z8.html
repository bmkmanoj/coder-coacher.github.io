dasha elder has been a friend for many
years and so we've been we've worked it
together different projects we've been
doing John reason groups together and
elder is like one of the regional Java
developers in Brazil you know 1995 when
Java was too I'll find better version
elder already had a fool Java trainee
created by himself on to teach other
people Java so you know thanks a lot
elders for me here and then coming here
talk a little bit of us and so either
you are a Java developer but um you do
much more than the job right you like it
like a you know we're going to talk
about other things later but no you your
java developer but you know you like
dive in all kinds of different
technologies you know i know i know you
did all kinds of HTML CSS but he also
did a development of all different
languages so do you think it's important
for a developer to kind of dislike broad
overview of technology and occupations
kind of things or i can just kind of
stay together like one language that's
enough well i think life is too short
for you just to be a Java developer also
there's so many interesting things in
the world so if I don't know if anything
it you might have a hobby it may become
very interesting you want to know more
about that I think curiosity for our
human culture is like hunger for one
person you need it nope um society goes
because of our curiosity it continues to
exist science and art all that is more
important than anything like in a
thousand years if you think back a
thousand years you won't remember any
Java programmer or any lawyer or any
doctor even if you know even though
their importance today in a short term
but in the long term you can remember
Leonardo da Vinci Dante Alighieri ducati
so those that's in our long-term culture
what's really interesting and that's our
cue
of course you need all those people in
the back to JoVE exists because of them
right so programming is great you can
control machines you can create the
world today yo it's like I'm exact
Newton used to say where we build it on
top we we discover new things on we're
on top of the shoulders of the giants
that were came before us yes so in the
world is there the world's so
interesting there's so many interesting
things to do there's arts their science
there's um you look at the sky is the
stars you may be curious about that it
may be your hobby but then um you love
the hobby so much you start discovering
more and more and more today you have
the internet so you start sharing that
with other people I think many of the
arts that I did as hobbies they became
some of them became like a job sometimes
because of the internet like when I
started teaching HTML I was learning
italian and i was reading The Divine
Comedy and I decided to make a small
summary of each contour and i ended up
translating it nobody would ever know
about that i'll be just a hobby if I
didn't if I hadn't put it on the web
right and the web was very new at the
time so not many people were accessing
that and suddenly lots of people had
seen my translation of Dante and I had
to make a better one because Oh
everybody's video so I started
researching more and more and more I
read several translations and then I
have today our translation which you can
see there you can use a website which is
uh yeah I mean put here so people that
watch this can actually see this yeah
it's it's um it was made in in two
thousand in 1999 and as a translation of
Dante's Divine Comedy in Portuguese I
translated it from Italian and also
learned it I the time it took me two
years it has the whole story you can
read it here online you could even mark
the page it's kind of ugly now because
this was never updated like here you
have a bookmark so you can go back and
then click on the bookmark and continue
so I use my knowledge of JavaScript of
web technology which I was teaching but
I also put my translation online right
so basically you started you know you're
you're mixing the work you're doing with
your hobbies that you're doing and
actually transforming your hobbies in
orch yeah but then the web made it
famous it kind of after this I was
contact but contacted by a movie maker
which was writing a movie which was
inspired in don t and he paid me and I
was a consultant in done T for a two
days it was also used by a group in Rio
Janeiro which stage the play based on my
translation nice and two years ago I
went to Santiago de Compostela for an
exhibit because I made some drawings at
the time some illustrations and I also
post them here for example I drew some I
made a map of hell I drew that I didn't
really ok a little drawing but then this
p raiders saw my drawings and they
thought hey we like them we would like
to exhibit them here in santiago is that
ok so it was there in a museum Santiago
Compostela for four months and I think
much of that is because of the internet
because the Internet gives you all that
visibility right so a lot of a lot of
developers you know they they kind of
work on their own the code did they work
on and you know they're like afraid of
giving talks or writing blogs or
presenting what they're doing worldwide
let me know an open source project for
example a lot of people kind of have is
afraid of doing this where you're
showing that simply the fact that you
put a line I mean you're doing so good
stuff but the fact that you're doing it
online it kind of broadcast the whole
world and that actually has results like
many many years after yeah my own action
all my work in technology started like
that right i started working with HTML
Javascript and then Java in the
beginning I was working for this company
and I published a book in 1995 on HTML
and I was going to publish a second book
on JavaScript but then I had a
discussion with the publisher and I
didn't publish it at the
I put it online after put it online many
people downloaded it and they also
downloaded my java stuff and then
suddenly i discovered was much better to
give away everything then to even try to
I didn't I did I never published a book
in Java but I I rewrote it several times
many people download it many people
hired me for training I made a lot of
friends so I think the Internet's very
of course that's free advertising today
advertise not free anymore like in the
beginning the beginning people find me
in Google I didn't pay anything but then
Google discovered oh d part are getting
free advertising so let's make a little
bit harder so I was benefited of course
of the big with the beginning of the
internet but that she also shows that
it's great to share I share I I
participate in Stack Overflow I answer
questions I share my code in github and
I've already I already paid to do small
things and some bigger ones simply
because people saw my code and hey this
is nice uh it was good to share could
you do this for me or that or this and
so there's so many possibilities I don't
have to stay if you hide everything
nobody will discover you right and and
and I think you have it is very very
interesting story actually the image
that we are showing here right now the
imaginary Peter sore uh this also
started with like you know you some
curiosity on yours on your side but I
also started because you put things
online yeah it's um I've also explained
she was a little bit what this is and
then we can yeah this is a blog where I
publish all the stuff everything I do
related to palaeontological research I'm
not a paleontologist i discovered i
started working with paleontology in
2012 and before that i knew very little
about it but I I am an artist I since
I'm since I was a kid I used to make
small maquettes of airplanes I used to
draw so I'm not really a stranger with
arts right but then what happened is you
can't you can't say the strangest uart
right now no you have done plays you
have done sculptures you have done all
kind of art you know you just shown your
drawing so you keep your
you definitely not strange at you hard
yeah so um so this was actually
something I woke up one day and I just I
actually a friend of mine she wanted to
make a bat for her kid that a bad time
for it i was up being after those things
are you you feel of candy you break it
right yeah yeah so um I had three days
free mm-hmm and I made one for her with
my paper mache right the next and I give
it away inched they disliked it
destroyed it of course oh well I made a
very detailed back it was not a simple
1i I research the internet I check
anatomy of bats I did everything I also
checked the material because it had to
be paper couldn't be met or anything
with the kids could get injured she was
a kid scared by the pi divided by the
battle oh the kids she wanted about how
her mother's a heavy metal band player
Oh her kid wanted a bad thing out she
did her mother didn't know what to do
right but then um I said I can do it
yeah I couldn't find a bad pinata in
check on the store right yeah 3 days so
I made a UH using paper mache using foam
I also know I know some electronics LEDs
in the eyes we got I spooky well um and
I called it the ephemeral bat because I
was gonna make it was gonna be destroyed
right and when her mother saw the
batches she was said oh no we're not
gonna destroy this oh yeah oh yes you
are it's called the ephemeral bad it was
born to be destroyed if it dries it
doesn't die it's gonna be very
frustrated right yes and the kiddos
crazy to destroy a battle so they all
destroyed the bat right in the next day
I was home with no bats right I was kind
of missing it and ok tomorrow morning
I'm gonna wake up and I make one for me
I woke up in the morning I open the
newspaper do with this um Terrell sorta
had been discovered in China uh-huh and
I thought oh why not do something
different a pterosaur but then since
already had done it because we learn a
lot by trying right and everything I do
um I usually don't have them have any
idea of how to do it I started
programming like that I didn't have okay
I'm gonna program oh how do I start I've
no idea but I've always um tried it
uh-huh usually if you're a except for
some jobs like being a
pilot or something you can try and get
it wrong and survive and continue some
jobs you might not survive that's
exactly i'm a pirate would not not
possible but then um so I had no idea on
how to make a pterosaur I knew nothing
about pterosaurs and I I I got what I
had a home like I had in all those foam
boxes from that you use their several
like like those big mac box is it made
of that kind of phone yeah yeah you know
like like when you buy a TV comes yeah
but not that thing tough tough times
does a more dense one right like it used
to do for food okay um food packages so
I had some my home I thought Kanban use
this because it was light right and I
didn't know how to go I glued it i
sanded it I started messing up with it I
discovered I could press it I could fold
it so I started discovering a technique
in sculpture and after uh the second day
I had a head in after the head I had I
started oh I'm gonna cover paper machine
I make the pterosaur like I did the bat
but no I started thinking I started
researching the internets and I wanted
to make it exactly the same as this one
so I started improving it and making it
um better mm-hmm actually the best way
to speak about this is showing it here
because they have have pictures of it
yes i have a presentation which is
better and you oh yes you can see here
is okay this is a this is a presentation
i made at a palaeontological conference
alright so you went you went from not
know anything about yours to go give er
eventually give a talk at s yes I've
been to several of them already and this
is the first 1i made okay um how I made
it I I found this in the internet uh-huh
this is a sideways two-dimensional
drawing of skeleton that was found in
China and I thought how
how do I make this no idea i cut out
some pieces or the phone uh-huh and then
i started gluing it together and sing
was gonna happen i didn't know i glued
it okay I had no idea where I was gonna
get I cut out this piece here and routed
together and I started molding it and
sanding it and suddenly was looking like
this it still looks doesn't look at all
like the pterosaur it looked more like
the hella key right here yeah it's more
like a pelican still very bad but then I
started checking the internet I looked
at I found bones I wanted to make the
rest so this is an actual fossil then my
challenge every day was to wake up and
make several copies of random not random
I'm of bones from real pterosaurs so I
started making copies this is a phone
copy I made this is the real one
sometimes only have one side so i had to
guess but I so I used to work with what
I had same ways in paleontology you work
with what you have a person discovers a
piece of a bone then that's what I have
if I discover another part later I'll
fix it but while I don't I imagine it so
that's why I called it the imaginary
pterosaur because you have to imagine
everything and I and I went deep into
this because I had the freedom to
imagine I'm not appellant ologist like I
could get it wrong I don't care if
people say I'm wrong because i'm not in
the Academy I don't have a PhD in this
so i don't care i just not try so I hide
it and I started going very far i
started discovering techniques i
discovered how to make teeth these teams
are from a plastic hanger i put a candle
under it made this hangar then I started
making the individual pieces one by one
I used to draw them and try them out and
after some six so I didn't know how to
make it this in 3d this I call this a 3d
sketch I have the front the top view
here the side view in it and an
intermediate you I don't have no idea
what it looks like from here or here no
I guess so i get the two views and put
them together and then start filling in
the gaps until I had this so it's like
sketching and drawing but in 3d right
and anything you do every day you start
getting better at it right after a while
even if you don't know what it is
because there was no science about this
this specific technique
um but then something very interesting
happen when i started doing all this I
did everything in the internet all the
photos are in Creative Commons
everything using WordPress uh-huh and so
creative comments someone this pterosaur
wasn't a newspaper because had recently
been discovered right so a little bit
later some other scientists wrote a
Wikipedia article about it and they
wanted to illustrate it and they found
my replica I thought it was great so
they used it and that suddenly made
pushed me into the academic area of
paleontology because then everybody know
my replica people started contacting me
III exhibited this in a oh I was I was
to also work a theater and I was giving
a theatre workshop in joão pessoa and I
took so I was always traveling with it
because I was like my spare time I just
make a bone I took two months making
this right but I used to fix it I have I
was in a hotel so the hotel sounded a
bit did not go for my workshop come back
so I was teaching and these were my
students the theatre students and they
helped me assemble it as I did I tells
making the individual individual bones
right so it was like a really big
project yeah but it was a hobby oh yeah
it wasn't really I didn't really want to
make anything sophisticated but then it
also appeared on this um I with this art
festival I took it and I put it there on
the wall in this band called mustachios
Apaches it's a band um here from Sao
Paulo huh they recorded a clip using the
pterosaur guys on another guy called
betta brent is a movie maker he made a
movie with us in the same scenery and
the pterosaur was there as well so it
became a superstar right so all these
things happen to it and then I wish this
um art our art exhibition a
paleontologist site he asked me hey um
don't you want to make some other ones
that he got me a bunch of
paleontological material I never seen
before a bunch of articles and text and
I was obsessed oh why not improve it so
I improved it but it that was my
starting one so then I made this one
using a scientific article uh-huh he
gave it to me I made us very quickly in
five days I was getting better at it
right so i made the teeth everything and
this is the process I was at my mother's
house this is looks a lot like the real
one and then I made another one and this
is how I make it and the fourth one and
a fifth one in this point this fifth one
is the one I just I discuss here in this
in this event incision and after this I
want a prize i want i won a
paleontological sculpture first prize I
even got some money else okay so
suddenly I'm and I knew her in this in
this event it was the Brazilian it was
the first Brazilian Congress on terror
source very specific right so I know I
got to know all the most famous
scientists that work of pterosaurs oh no
my the ones that write the books so they
all know my arts and I had contact with
that I made some good contacts so later
I was hired and I made a pterosaur for
museum in Brazil which is another
presentation here this one here so this
one here was a it's a description of the
project this is the final report and is
full of them technical terms already has
already got use of the technical terms I
had to also educate myself after I had
to read a lot of books on vertebrate
paleontology I could understand the
terms about biology geology because I
had to speak of these people i think it
was this different language I didn't
understand anything right of course it
took me a while but it was something I
used to have fun doing yeah and of
course I wasn't making any money with
this so I had to do it my spare time
because i had to program and other
things as well so this was all happening
but it was going so uh this is the this
is the material use so it was this is
the description of the sources i used
these are the actual fossils this is how
i do the scaling i use pro i had to make
some calculations change the scales i
use different sources like to put them
in the same sizes i use the computer for
this right this is how i could instruct
the bones this my technique is already
much better now
this was a year later so these are the
parts of the of the skeleton I made for
this museum uh-huh and I have it here
it's a whole lot of bones how many bones
there isn't one in 200 and something two
hundred and it's pretty cool and there's
my right these are this is a smaller one
so it's a very small I discover how to
make them all whole this whole skeleton
it's like two meters wide and it only
weighs 300 grams the other one I made is
it has 4 meters and a half of a wingspan
we expend a form eight and a half and
all it only weighs 900 grams ok so i
discovered also that was the lightest
replicas in the world in the American
Natural History Museum there's one the
same species as the one I made the same
size um it weighs 20 times more than
mine ok so i could also try to sell it
as using that as an advantage because
you can hang it on your museum with
fishing lines without any metal anything
and if it falls on somebody it won't
kill that person probably the bones will
fly in the wind so you can pay less
insurance as well it's gonna cost less
right i tried it i tried to use that
argument with the natural history museum
in london by what sex successful year
very there was kind of skeptical about
my technique all right there baby after
some time so um then i finally built
this one i can show you the final result
here in fine results here upside down
and here it's in the final at a museum
so very cool this was these are several
when I several of them I made and then I
have one in Portugal no ahead and
there's some other project so I I still
plan to make some other ones it's kind
of um it's a very it's not really it's
not like Java like a market everybody
wants to territory like you want one
this year maybe in two years they want
another one alright a bit slower which
one that's pretty cool alright so
basically you know you you got all this
attention it's really nice that you can
see that you get from from not knowing
anything about the subject to get
all these attentions even have something
published in the museum because you're
doing things and because you're
publishing everything you did from the
start right because if you hadn't
published the photos to begin with you
wouldn't show up a Wikipedia and nothing
of this would have and the blog also has
something else because sometimes when
you do something even if you publish it
um first you think um I didn't know
anything about pterosaurs but I thought
it was this much I had to know but the
moment I started studying more and
people read hey I'm gonna understand a
word you're saying hey this is wrong so
you start having criticism yeah like
when I the moment my blog became when I
when I I was just published my hobby
nobody cared about it but then suddenly
good the miter saw was there in
Wikipedia and I was doing some serious
stuff and then people oh um you're his
replicas aren't very precise that would
hurt me a lot I have to study more then
I wanted to improve it so it's something
it's good when you're in the community
because the community can help you
improve your art align that's the thing
for codes if your calls and github
somebody can use it and say oh this is
the school's kind of bad but it's you
feel terrible about that right right
you're gonna fix it up maybe somebody
else knows better can help you like I
had some project with some people many
paleontologists they helped me they
criticize my stuff my art oh this is not
this is not the way it is you should do
it this way Oh use this book I cook I
can show you this theory sometimes I had
to deal with some uh it was great when I
got to the level that a parent are just
a paleontologist would say hey this is
the way you should do it and then the
other one hey don't don't listen that
guy this is not correct his this is the
way to do it and then I had to decide
right I was already at their level
because I could say hey I'm gonna decide
this and I had could I could explain why
i chose the theory a huh from the theory
because it's a theory everything is
scientifically reading with people don't
have the whole skeleton right okay
that's pretty cool so we're we are
totally out of time here but you know
one of the one thing I would I want to
touch it real quick is that we said
we're gonna talk a little bit about
music and really what we see is that
when your developer a lot of developers
think that's that you know they're not
doing a creative work in actually in
fact stop development in general
is a creative work because you have to
take all this kind of little decisions
every day when everything you have to do
and you or the one to take the decision
like you're doing right so it's it's a
very creative work now a lot of times
you know developers have this either as
a hobby or second work or something
things like you know some kind of arts
especially music right I a batch cool
hunt for the JCP he says that for
example you know when he he became his
career he would hire developers there's
not many developers when he started so
he would hire musicians and teach them
softer development because it was easier
to teach self development for musicians
then you know so and you are also a
musician that right you know you play
you played all kinds of different
instruments yeah actually I was trained
as when I was nine I studied piano in
the conservatory right so I learned
piano but I used um I love it's the same
thing like for me it's the same like
yeah I went to Russia and I bought this
instrument here yes it's a by n yeah can
you and um it might if we moved is a
little bit so people can actually see oh
nice and all the manuals Nationals is
here yes you close it again it's not
close is and the manual was in Russian
and I couldn't really understand much of
it at the time today I can study but I
can understand Russian a bit more so I
had to discover how do I play this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
