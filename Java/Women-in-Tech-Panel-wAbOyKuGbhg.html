developer adco advocate I can't even say
that word for jetbrains we're here at
devoxx belgium the original and best
devoxx for a night hacking and we are
not going to talk about women in
technology anyway introduce yourself my
name is Amelia from Tommy over
operations in finance love the vets
Belgium love the staff and interest in
it all the bells on Team amazing their
backs rocks oh hello my name is
Catherine Beaumont I work boxed and I
talked last week about why we need to
talk about women in tech which I guess
we'll get on to hi my name is accelrys I
work for canoe so I'm based in
Switzerland chocolate and cheese so
would you like to talk about why we need
to talk about women in tech I think we
should start with why we don't want to
talk about women in tech and then I can
progress into why maybe we need to all
right oh my god i am the bad cop no no
no no we understand where are you coming
from so that's important ok so 20 years
ago i used to write code most people do
not know this however
oh yeah okay so a line of coke a line of
code does not know if you're a female or
male I believe it's like you know when
you read something and it's written by a
woman I'm in the words go beyond sex
right so is the code is if it's a good
code with documentation it doesn't
really matter who wrote it male or
female if it's amazing it is standing on
its own so we're always talking about
women pushing women in code guess what
let's allow the community and those
women or Mel to go through to stand on
their own feet without being female or
male I just dislike they're all push
women and no no we don't need the push
we can do it ourselves and there is no
differentiation so I don't disagree with
you because I sleep and don't really
enjoy talking about women in check funny
enough yes I am but my gender apparently
qualifies me so one of the reasons why I
feel uncomfortable talking about women
in tech is the same reason as you so one
of my all-time idols is my older brother
Ben and we grow up together and he
pretty much brought me up and he's a
Python program and now for the Met
Office and when we were growing up I
never felt like there was anything that
I couldn't do that he did apart from
astrophysics which is beyond me but he
never made me feel like that and no one
made me feel like that he was important
in my life it was only in my first tech
job where I felt was made to feel
different and the reason was it was an
awful job like it was there are many
reasons why it was bad and I think it
was probably a more unusual experience
and one of the reasons it was bad is
because we had a guy running the company
who thought he was God's gift to
programming and like to call women girls
and called an all-female code a meeting
but we were girl coders and open the
meeting by saying that he was somehow
by so many women he felt hormonal so
that was the kinda so that was the kind
yeah that was a serious WTF what kind of
company am i working for moment and it
is a kind of an extreme and another
example from that company is my friend
Tyler who's doing a PhD in physics and
chemistry I don't know the specifics
when I'm sure she tried to explain it to
me and I didn't grasp it and on one work
trip he pulled her aside and said you
know don't worry if you feel like you're
not as technical as the boys and you can
work on your soft skills that's what
so-and-so did so I don't like talking
about women in tech but when you have
those obvious examples of
differentiation then you do need to push
back and say why are we girl coders why
are we having girl code in meetings why
aren't we having koda meetings why are
we talking about this why do you feel
it's acceptable to say that and then
there are other examples from my career
and stories I've heard from other people
have much more subtle issues so maybe
not getting a promotion when you have a
conversation and all of the conversation
is okay what's the criteria do I need to
be technical for this story to be more
technical than someone no it's
managerial okay do I need management
extrudes well not necessarily okay well
I have management experience and in one
of those situations where there's you've
kind of got the end of a logical
conversation and reach the point where
there's actually no reason why you
wouldn't be doing something and there's
still always a reason like oh actually I
think maybe you've seen a tiny bit more
experience and this why you can't get
there or not being opinion it's not
being listened to and someone else
giving the same opinion and that being
taken up their kind of the Obama women
problem where the women who work for the
Obama administration kept repeating
things in a meeting until everybody paid
attention to them so there are kind of
obvious and then subtle reasons why I
think it's
to think why are we still being
differentiated and I've got it I've got
so many things to say that but I'm gonna
try stick to just one I wanted to talk a
bit I'm totally on board with you like
this whole talk about women in
technology I hate it and especially
because I have succeeded as a woman in
technology so I clearly don't encounter
some of the same barriers that other
people encounter so in order to asking
me why women don't succeed in technology
is kind of stupid because because I
don't appear to have had the same
problem but i wanted to talk a bit about
how you said the code doesn't care if
you're a man or a woman and it's totally
true but there was a study done on
github on the code that goes into github
and it showed that generally speaking
the code submitted by women um was of
better quality by measured by measured
by various standards and was all was
usually accepted when it was put in with
a non-gender specific name and when the
code was identified as being written by
a woman received more pushback than the
same code from a man so the code doesn't
care the computer doesn't care but the
community does the people in the
community do and whether they do it on
purpose or not we do get pushback we do
get these subtle like I didn't get
promoted because like I'm sure and I'm
it's very difficult it's very difficult
to know because it's not always oh it's
because you're a woman but i am sure i
haven't remained team lead because i
wasn't technical enough when someone
more junior did and i'm sure that was
because I was a woman but they wouldn't
have thought that they would have
thought well it's so you know she hasn't
led this or there was no big
architecture thingy but neither did that
person there there's this real subtle
thing and it's difficult to it's
difficult to put your finger on it there
are obvious examples where it's just
clearly
clearly terrible like I went for an
interview at a London based financial
software firm and the man said to me
this is right early in my career the man
said to me how will you feel working in
an all-male environment and I'm like I
studied computer science I want to Ford
Motor Company you know where they make
cars and I've just come out of like two
years working for another technical firm
and I went to boys school for God's sake
how will I feel working in an
environment where are there are women
there's a stupid question it's a stupid
question to ask in the first place is an
illegal question to ask and also like
look at my background I've clearly
worked in all male environments anyway
and I decided there and then not to take
the job because this is the CEO of the
company and this is what he sees this is
a woman not this is a coder and when
they he offered me more money than they
wanted and offer me to get me to take
the job I turned it down and he didn't
understand why and I didn't say to him
it's because you're a misogynistic well
you going well in my keys it's a little
bit of different I used to think about
that we gender shouldn't be an issue and
technology because i was doing my job
and I have a developer and I at that
time I did it I didn't even want to be
in the spotlight because it thats that
was me but then I went to Africa the box
Morocco and then I was surprised because
forty percent of the attendees are women
so that's amazing so I sit down with
girls over there and i like to call them
girls I'm not not in the bad way and I
said well why they trust out that they
have different cultural details that we
can discuss about but the most important
thing that they said to me is we have
role models there's a lot of women
technology and sciences as researchers
and also political leaders so I said
okay you have role models and I mean an
industry that we don't have that much
role models and we really need them so
for me what's an eye opener and has said
you know what you love what you do
you're quite well at head why don't you
show and help the community that you are
always trying to improve we touch so
that's today when I decided to start
talking about gender in technology
because I used to avoid the topic like
like kill I didn't want to talk about it
and I also had some experiences like my
idea is not good until a male boys
voices and I totally hated and I always
know well that was even in the past I'd
raised my hand and says and say do you
need my husband to tell you this to make
more sense I mean is that because I can
ask him no problem at all and then they
noticed and I think as a woman I also
talked before because people were trying
like pushing me go talk to go be a
speaker and I was like all we really
have so much pressure because i already
have to face people that you know what
you should i don't know be a manager
a project chronic project manager and it
was like no I like to code you know I
like to beat her yeah um yeah I was
definitely gonna say something I don't
remember what it was I think it's about
the role models and and the pressure
that's right the pressure of having to
do so much like the pressure of and I
don't know if it's true or not because I
haven't been me with a male body I don't
know if my ideas are not accepted
because I'm female or if my ideas are
not accepted because I didn't put them
forward correctly or if they were just
crap right I dunno as well there are
plenty of white straight males who also
don't feel listened to who also don't
have their ideas like backed up because
they're too junior or they don't say the
right words and I do know that women and
minorities need sponsorship to get
managerial positions not mentoring they
need a male in position of power to say
this is tricia she does know what she's
talking about we should consider her for
for promotion and that happens for men
and it doesn't happen for women women
get mentored and mentoring is where you
teach a woman something but sponsoring
is where you put her forward and say she
already knows her stuff like she is good
enough to be promoted and this is what
we're missing and this is actually where
it's important to get the men involved
because we need senior men to sponsor
women because we're so busy we're trying
to be role models for other women we're
doing our day job we might be possibly
working hard at our day job than our
peers because we are never listened to
or whatever because we can't tell
whether that's true or not but we're
working very very hard when we can't
just keep trying to learn more and be
better and mentor these people without
sponsors and champions on our sides
saying she's doing a good job she needs
to be perfect not pushed she needs to be
promoted now she needs to be talking at
this conference you know we need to be
reading her blog and that's something
that men can do for us which is why
these conversations are useless if we
give them two women again and again we
need to be having these conversations
two men men are always asking me what
can I do I know
most of the men in the community that I
know are really odd about this subject
because they feel like they do want to
do something they don't want to be
excluded they want to do something to
help us they don't know if they're doing
something wrong or what they can be
doing and if we keep talking to like
women's groups about women's problems
it's not going to help us and it's not
going to include these people who really
can help us we need to get these men on
board like they want to do something for
us and it actually seems that when NS in
a conference you have a panel or a
session this says women in tech or push
that gets the Terrans from attorneys
because it's not the message gets lost
and the complaining is not that we
complain but it's not focused on the
issue right it just gets miss you say
attendees might think oh yeah they're
going to complain about not being
listened to or you know and all the
speakers are going to be women it needs
to be much more inclusive avoid a word
remain intact just needs to be stronger
just like when we were talking to the
day and you asked me why is it not a
java champion seriously what are we
talking these a java one let's do this
is that what we're gonna end on we
should all be chova Campion's yes excuse
me give me about 15 years I'm not there
no but that's that's that's precisely
the difference between not always just
men and women but like people who have
to fight hard for recognition be there
from some minority or some under
privileged background and the privileged
is that the underprivileged always feel
like I'm not ready the privileged go I
will do it until someone tells me I'm
not right I'm not ready like no one's
going to tell you that you're ready no
one's going and if someone pushes back
in Texas to you you're not ready then
you can stop but no one's going to tell
you you should do it now
yeah that's the time ok I'll be a
champion to okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
