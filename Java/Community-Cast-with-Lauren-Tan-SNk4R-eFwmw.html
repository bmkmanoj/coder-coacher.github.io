back at aura dev lunchtime here just
about lunchtime a few people have gotten
their lunch early welcome back so we're
hearing from some amazing or ative
speakers today and right now I have
Lauren tan with me and she's speaking
here about JavaScript yep amber yeah
right so hi Lauren why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself introduce
yourself and tell us about what you do
yeah so thanks for having me here I'm in
engineer at Netflix I work on the studio
applications team so we produce apps
that help creative people create Netflix
originals so everything from stranger
things to orange is the new black and
I'm working on an application right now
to handle programming programming
calendar so like you know like
scheduling when a show is gonna be
released and I'm here today at or ative
to give a talk on ember it's a
JavaScript framework and I'm going to
talk about declared as templating which
is kind of like a best practices
approach to the framework okay so your
talk will give us a few best practices
if you're using amber yeah so there's
there's actually a lot of like large
enterprise companies that use ember and
there's been a lot of interest in
getting more like idiomatic practices
into ember because amber is pretty much
a convention over configuration
framework so you know like very large
teams work on an Amber application and
there is a need for like best practices
so that you know everyone's doing the
right thing and you know not stamping on
each other's toes mm-hmm cool so I think
we were chatting earlier you said this
was your first conference here in Europe
how have you found it compared to some
of the other conferences that you've
attended in the United States I
definitely enjoy or dev a lot this is
actually my first time in Sweden and I
spent a week in Copenhagen as well the
past week and overall I would say it's
been really it's been a really great
experience
it's kind of cold but I do like it a lot
and or div is like a really well-run
conference I I've been to a number of
conferences in the States and I would
say that not all of them are this
polished so yeah it's I think that the
committee has done a really great job
and making sure everything runs smoothly
the venue is cool and it's also a little
bit different for me and I think you
were says different for you as well that
it's not specific to just one certain
technology but covering lots of
different technologies along the
spectrum yeah that makes it a bit unique
yeah I mean it's definitely great that
it's kind of a generalist technology
conference I think because there's a lot
of like cross-disciplinary ideas that
get shared and that normally don't you
know you know like a you know a specific
technology conference where it's kind of
like an echo chamber a little bit but
yeah or deaf I think it's been a it's
been great and we've been your favorite
highlights of the trip favorite really
what's your favorite session or some of
the best sessions you've been to so in
terms of the speaker activities I think
probably the most fun activity I've had
the chance to go to was going to the
sauna and I didn't remember the name but
it's pretty close to the hotel and we
had to recited this like really warm
sauna and then we jumped into the Baltic
Sea which was very cold so that was
quite a shock but very fun and in terms
of the talk I think yesterday's keynote
the afternoon keynote about Isis was
really something that resonated a lot
with me like given the current like
political climate in America so there
probably wanted tops I enjoy it a lot
and then the other technical talk I kind
of I enjoyed was the one on our X so our
X in Java well so that was a great talk
alright well thanks for sharing a little
bit about what you're doing here this
week at ooredoo I enjoyed meeting you
thanks for sharing everything with us
I'll see you a little bit later today
yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
