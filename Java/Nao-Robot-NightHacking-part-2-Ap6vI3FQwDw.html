still working yeah like it is
the RH is 65 so that's the one Tory's
hooked up to you to wait for her to
disconnect it's it's because of the
network there on if they're on your
network or there they won't show up
he's already saving up Wow ok oh yeah
okay now can use the Move tool box yeah
could you do the camera on the robot
okay what's fun okay maybe show the ball
one do have one of the balls with you oh
isn't that black case there see the
black now case open it up and grab out a
ball one of the ones you want to use and
we have a pull request from Sven testify
all
because it's yeah all right i emerged in
your changes spend and we'll give it a
try on the robot in just a sec
where's the connection info for the
robot on your on your test where's the
connection info for the robot it's on
the screen over there yes but get
session somewhere in the main cast the
domain now mittens there's the main
method Cindy sure yeah now watching send
email should be thinking about you
magnify that bomb used to be get session
so just go there and Becca ok we have
settings but yet so give me buddy so go
to settings settings this one's 35 no
there's a separate
okay let's try to go
the way from it's the great guy okay
let's try it again so people can see
what we're doing cuz it was kind of fast
and we didn't what you say thank you
take a photo with him because you can
cuz he's a rub it and you can walk
around and take photos can your camera
walk around so there's there's mutters
show to the camera oh yeah sure to the
camera yeah so let's try one more time
alright so we're running let's let's
describe quickly we're doing so we're
we're running this take picture
application so hard to code on a TV
across the room okay and what is the
what does it take picture do is your mic
on do you have them like
back on business can I can i yeah well
you can sit down if you want the coach
is all the way across the screen idea so
we have a some another example which is
basically taking a picture I won't go
through on details but this is the most
interesting part of the the program we
got a bunch of proxies on everything we
need so text to speech that's robot with
talk video device to get take a picture
because we need the camera motion
because we need to stiffen the neck and
all that and audio player I think we're
supposed to press down on know if it's
working or not anyway so first thing is
we are making in wake up if it's not
stiffen then we say smile so this is why
I showed you before which takes to
speech we just say I'm going to take a
photo and then we take a picture with
this code so we just send a bunch of
parameters that we're going to that will
be used by the video device modules take
the picture and then the picture will be
sent so we display on the screen and
send by email so we can write in one
more time if you want so let's go oh we
may want to put the microphone close to
the robots
and go oh my poor be
not this is defined
I'll probably still running the previous
one maybe maybe because if this guy's
still open yeah oh yeah right
I'm going to take a photo one two three
smile sending you the picture by mail
hey pop it's okay so we got we got some
bread coming in marriage this is
ridiculous some virtual bread okay so
here's the image frame that's the bread
and then it also sends the same photo to
Yammer on so i should have nice long
email with that which we saw the earlier
email so we dressed but that's working
okay now so then just sent me a project
he want us to test so we're gonna okay
so i will get it i'm running on the
robots yeah we answered we also need
asking just to be more precise because
it's not easy to understand exactly what
is asking us can you please disconnect
from the robots yes thanks yeah so see
if you can run that file from github and
choreograph thanks
alright so now i have the side by side
with um Laurens computer and then the
robots and we're going to run your your
project on the orange robots when if
you're watching the stream it's now 10
on now 11 it should be 165 ok so it's 10
all right
it looks kind of sad is it pointed see
we are very sorry for that in turn
expedition
I guys at the end of the burger yes okay
run it one more time so i can get audio
sometimes I'm impressed that they got it
so he doesn't fall over because the bus
is our Savior potency we are very sorry
for the bad internet connection all
right very cool so you wanna you want to
show some of the stuff you did with the
robot Cassandra while we have it hooked
up there yeah okay so when it why don't
you describe the projects which you like
now is going to be like interacting with
the person she chooses with this ball
and that's kind of it okay and this is
this is the first half of the knell mark
lab which Daniel was showing so she was
following along with the instructions
it's flickering that's fine don't worry
about that okay go go go talk to her oh
wait wait now you lost your connection
we're working with orange guy no it's
okay okay try again rent run your
program so who's going to do it you are
hello there would you like to be my
volunteer yes yes please hand me a bowl
miserable in my hand now yes yes thank
you you are so generous all right so you
can see we fix the up the animation for
um for having him successfully hold the
ball Daniel oh okay and you want to run
the second version where you say no all
right good go go run it one more time
hello I need a volunteer to help me
hello there would you like to be my
volunteer yes yes hand me a bowl in my
hand now no no you're mean so I think
your robot just made fun of you do you
let your robot talk back to you all
right good job that deserves some bread
and cheese oh alright maybe some BBQ
soon alright so we have a little bit of
time left in the in the stream if anyone
else has projects they wants to run the
robots here like um like spin just
upload them to github and send a pull
request and i'll include them and run
them on one of the robots but otherwise
I think we're about done with all the
content we had did you everything else
you want to show Laura yeah you want
shown any dances on the robots like some
apps and show stuff on the robots
okay bro S&amp;amp;R the play was over once we'd
have to get the sports you can do it so
is that the sport where he falls all
right here use this mic for the robot
sports game press my front ID sensor to
skip instructions guess which one it is
so did you guess what sport it is for
example bodybuilding soccer or tennis
tennis tennis good answer Tori was right
again yes try to get this force
we'll give me your answer no don't
answer can be for example go bowling hmm
nice try but it wasn't bowling the good
answer was golf show me one time no very
nice you gave one good answer out of you
do you want something daiichi dance
alright so we got we got another
wonderful choreograph creation from spin
so let's how can you let's say a camera
yeah on the red on the red robot this
will be the right guy red one be careful
this is a work area it's dangerous you
need a hard hat yes I won't obstruct him
all right well that that was a what
tough workout he protected himself ok I
am I stopped the program ok so you want
to i'll try it one more time I think
it's the the floor is not even enough
here and slippery but I mean he'll
probably do the second time I think I'll
be okay
yeah oh so it's the probably the stand
up in here no it's the push up so he
does the situps and then he does
push-ups and he's having trouble with
the push-ups
that was my fault oh poor robot all
right so this this shows you a little
bit about that's pretty that's pretty
good for doing without a robot in front
of you yeah yeah yeah yes I saw they did
a pretty complicated timeline for the
push-ups so I think they probably had
trouble getting him in the position they
wanted yeah yeah but he wants the crash
protection won't let him fall it's just
a job running the behavior right from
the computers on each other their whole
year is monitoring this right right now
that's why it's not but it doesn't have
on board crash protection he yeah yeah
the computer the simulator won't do
crash protection but when it's a real
Road but he can't just fall he'll
immediately yes is not at the right
place you should protect his head yeah
and you're not on mic so nobody heard
what you said but why what I was saying
is just that the robot usually protect
his brother well since when the center
of mass of the robot isn't why should it
should be and then usually protects his
head because it's something that is
falling down but I don't know why it did
not happen there maybe just because the
for manager is disabled which is
possible to
alright
hey Daniel I'm putting you back on
screen he looks like he's trying to now
looks like he's trying to do something
looks like a pretty painful position
though oh well there are no Ron screen
so looks like a pretty painful position
you have them in we can't hear what
you're saying though I think you're
muted right now
so unmute your mic and put yourself on
the Hangout rather than the stream for a
sec now you guys I'm just extending here
basically the other facilities with
knows and what we can do as a
developer's extending also the whole the
kids are using nows in order to have
some fun learning programming yeah oh
you saw Cassandra is some attempt to do
the lab right picking up the ball yeah
good thinking it fall off the table none
yeah where did you do that oh sorry for
this year just a connected orbit and we
see that on this position it will stand
up normal yeah the stand up behavior is
really good like from any position I can
just figure it out and do the right
movements to roll back around to stand
up anything personal do we take angry
global summit on but I see a bassinet
with running
djibouti superior performance in
Missouri on his face down as the hardest
so he I think you he rolls over when
he's face down right I know in the back
he puts his handsome police in in a
while I haven't seen him I haven't seen
him do ya guys movie Babylonian cities
amaze me keep it in the hell is pretty
cool do any other questions on Twitter
stream Tori
all right I think I think I'm gonna call
it a day sound good hey Daniel you find
