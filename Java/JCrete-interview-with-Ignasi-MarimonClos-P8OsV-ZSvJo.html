well yeah I'd say at sadies yeah
unconference rather so we this morning
we were at the beach as well yeah
absolutely it wasn't us a 7am we we
drove in a very bumpy road yeah it was a
difficult but were the only ones that
this very secluded beach all the later
on the torus arrived yeah definitely no
1 i'm the right mind would wake up these
early under holidays yes exactly and
what did you have any good technical
discussions at the beach i heard lots of
geek talk yeah well this this guy who
couldn't make it this year he kept on
popping up Paso's when we were at the
beach last year so he he could then make
it but he keeps on sending tweets yes
well thank you very much mm-hmm
especially if we get special to very
presence okay so yes technical
discussions actually we're doing some
mind going trying to solve a puzzle that
he did it earlier this morning nice so
it was it was fun hmm ok and what you
see good interesting sessions earlier
the sessions which just came out which
one were you in I was on the a Seductor
into that Shawn review of what can be
done yeah so if folks haven't picked up
an ASCII dr. that's that's the new way
of writing documentation for your code
yeah I've been hurt hearing some stuff
on on Twitter mostly and so I wanted to
to see a little more with Andres
presenting and you know it would be
anything away from that session yeah
some sorry and you could take aways and
me learn uh well turns out you can
extend it any way you like he just
presented some extension that came out a
couple of days ago so it was it was
pretty interesting so you can customize
it yeah yeah no no more
magix once you get back ah might give it
a try absolutely nice anything you're
personally interested in your matching
you doing last caller you have been
using I've been working with Scala for
this last year oh ok but then when I'm
in Jake Reed I try to go to as many
talks about garbage collecting or very
low level stuff like I don't know last
year with mechanical sympathy with
Martine Thompson or maybe this year
something on on that line with object
layout and so on so I try to get as much
as again from from JK twig especially
the exposure of different topics yes I
saw stuff uh-huh did you propose any
sessions I wasn't paying attention ah
yeah actually I there's this Livesey
stuff about programming without
generation without generating garbage
nice which i'm interested in which is a
quite quite nice and i know there's a
few people around here that's here yeah
i feel the tension so so i'd like i'd
like a chat about that yeah that could
be nice I'm not sure if it's on the on
the matrix yet i'll i'll have a look if
there's no interest and it doesn't
doesn't make any sense to a deeply I
know what so uncomfortable you vote with
your feet that's right nice nice
anything else you're looking forward two
versions I hear we're going back to
chania in a couple of nights it's a B
C's that that's done every year and I
really love it very good places to have
something to eat there oh yeah it's
great yeah i think her Kirk has already
signed me up for a restaurant that I'm
