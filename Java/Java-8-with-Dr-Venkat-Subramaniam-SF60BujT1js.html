technology Network we're here on the
floor of devoxx UK live you can hear the
excitement in the exhibition hall and
I've got venkat subterranean I blew your
name tell me how to pronounce your last
name Lincoln subramanyam you thank you
very much you are a java champion at you
have a rockstar a programmer a
consultant how do you have time to sleep
well sleep is optional ok cool so you
just did a session on lambdas right how
was that it was very well received well
I've been giving a toxin lambda
expressions for a while in different
conferences and and almost any City I go
to its standing room only people are
definitely very excited about lambda
expressions are curious to know what's
coming up in Java what is in Java 8 now
and and definitely this was no exception
in that definitely people here in London
are as excited as people anywhere else
is to learn about the next big thing in
Java and people are saying lambdas is a
big deal do you really think it is was
it good bad i don't know absolutely i
mean i'll be honest about this I kind of
got into it with luke warm feeling and
then I have this one one statement I'd
like to make if I can I say that lambda
expression is the gateway drug but
streams are the real addiction and and
so that's what happened to me I kind of
started exploring lambdas and I was like
yeah you know what almost every other
language has it why should I care and
then once I got a little deeper into it
streams just drew me in and and the fact
that invoke dynamic plays a really good
role in terms of giving good performance
overall it's just amazing I'm gonna say
that this is the next big thing that's
happened to java and and i'm excited but
more important a lot of other people are
excited and people are eager to make use
of it great so tell me about adoption i
know you're a consultant so you're out
there in the real world is it was well
so in my in my views I've started doing
courses on Java 8 for companies not just
in conferences people call me and say
hey we want you to do java 8 course and
when i go to them i asked them what are
you using why are you excited for java 8
and my observation has been that company
that are using lightweight frameworks
and libraries are jumping on it and and
i'm looking at clients who are either
already adopted it are almost ready to
adopt it in the next few months the
companies that are already in Java 7
absolutely are eager to move into it and
there are quite a few of them and the
companies that are still for various
reasons mostly held by heavyweight
frameworks and libraries are still back
in other versions of Java and they are
also eager to learn about Java 8 because
they want to be prepared to it and one
of the questions I hear from them is ok
we cannot move into Java 8 yet but what
can we do so that when we do move into
Java 8 we can make the transition really
fast and so overall there are companies
moving into it already and those that
cannot for environmental reasons are
learning about how to be there and be
ready for it so overall I've only seen
positive response to this excellent i'm
so glad and i'm just going to put a
little pitch in here java magazine has
bunches of stuff on Java 8 lots of great
articles so you can check that out Thank
You Venkat for dropping by really
appreciate it it's always a pleasure to
see you look here thanks for having me
