and let me just start this here so we
have more or less an idea right it just
it doesn't matter but you know just so
we have one idea more or less okay so
welcome to night hacking so we are here
directly from def Fox in Belgium and we
are doing interviews and discussions
about the Java technology with amazing
people from the java community so I'm
Bruno Souza also known as the Brazilian
Java man and i'm here with an amazing
guy Venkat some onion I think that you
are one of the top speakers on the java
community because you have this unique
style right when you start talking you
you know you get out of your comfort
zone I'm sure because you do live coding
in a mazing way and we take everyone
else in the same phone take that we take
us out of our seats right because
everything you're showing is so
incredible so how do you do that more
coffee more coffee so I think one of one
of the things says you know I had a
really hard time learning programming in
the beginning oh ok and as I remember
very clearly trying to learn languages
are just one language c programming and
i had incredibly difficult time to learn
and I failed at it and then I went back
and said why was it so hard to learn and
I realized what I was doing wrong I was
trying to learn programming by reading a
book yes and I quickly realized that's
not the way to learn programming the way
you learn programming is by actually
programming and so one of the reasons
one of things i learned from that point
of view is the only way to learn
programming is to actually write quite a
significant amount of code and over time
I realized that we only have to take
time to learn the semantics and the
idioms but you never actually learn
syntax explicitly it's more an implicit
learning it kind of comes to you when
you really code and then I realized when
when you see didn't talk
you know there are some really good
speakers I've been inspired by speakers
over time I've learned from good
speakers over time but also when when
you listen to a talk when somebody puts
a slight in front of you the immediate
reaction for our audience is to read the
slide right right that's what yeah
that's what we're going to do as human
beings and I realized over time when
people are learning a concept imagine
you are on on the first floor and you
want to get to the second floor you
there you have to take the stairs to get
there are you have to take the elevator
right humans don't have the capability
to jump from one floor to another we're
not Coriolis well learning is exactly
the same thing you are trying to take
people from what they know to this and
there are two steps involved in it the
first is you really connect with the
audience from where they know right
where they are right now right there
right now because a minute you latch
they are in sync with you uh-huh then
you have to literally walk them one step
at a time and I don't think there's a
better way for a programmer to walk with
you by writing code right because
they're writing code all day long right
so rather than showing them code if you
write the code there is no way they're
gonna get ahead of you are behind you
right and and so that's one of the
reasons i started writing code I know it
looks like you're where you know you're
you're typing everyone's kind of looking
over your shoulders see what you're
doing here doing and there's another big
benefit you cannot be as a human can
never be perfect so I fail I make
mistakes yes code doesn't work but
here's the beauty the audience
immediately jump in and they rescue out
and when they rescue you out they feel
like they're part of your presentation
because they are influencing what what's
happening there and and so when I make
mistakes I don't try to pretend that I
cannot make mistakes uh-huh I ask for
help so what am i doing wrong here and
people say I do this do this was like
okay I can't hear everybody why don't
you tell me what I should do Oh online
number seven you should fix this oh of
course yes and and then they are into it
and it's a lot more fun because that's
really a light presentation where they
are with you and your with them and and
also it doesn't feel so forth to give a
talk after all because they're involved
with
as well right and it's amazing because
that's really live Cody not not only the
sense that you are doing it live but in
the same that you making the code come
alive yes that's true and and also one
of the other things is of course you
know here the the audience is really
large but a lot of times when I have a
smaller group of people they would often
say but but what would happen if you do
this how does this work well why don't
we try and now we are so no two of my
presentations are actually the same yes
and and so we end up producing different
code along the way and that's a lot of
fun as well excellent now one of the
things that we're taught we're trying as
you said here that you know you have to
connect with people and then make them
go to the next level right and what is
that we need to do as developers you get
always you know one step ahead in our
careers because i think you know as
developers we have to keep always
improving our careers we can't just
stand still and sitting down waiting for
things to happen right so what do we
need to do every day to actually get
ahead in our careers well i think the
very first thing as a developer you know
we need to do is never be embarrassed
about learning you know we would
sometimes tend to do this we feel like
oh I'm experienced that means I'm good
that means I shouldn't be critiqued well
I think we should really let go of that
yes and say a lot of times people that
are there you know their experience they
think that oh I can't make mistakes or I
can't I can't ask questions right
because I'm I know Ilan right right
absolutely I think the first thing is to
say you know it's okay to learn
constantly and and you know there are
things I know but there are things I can
actually know as a developer I need to
have that mentality I think and the
second thing I think is almost every
single day I would actually ask
developers to go out and do something
completely unrelated to work and and
look at my own career you completely
relationship work like do some sports or
computer and release reward but I like
doing some coding a different way well
actually Gordon Wyatt sporting is
actually even better
well well I think extracurricular
activities is important I mean I do a
lot of mountain hiking and I have to be
honest about this a lot of computer
problems I actually saw when I'm
actually away from my computer okay I
recently in a couple of weeks or months
ago I was spending several hours in the
evening I couldn't figure out how to
solve a problem uh-huh next morning I
went on a hike with my wife and right in
the middle of the hike unlike I know the
answer for this and the rest of the hike
was really horrible yeah yeah like I
wanted to get back to ya we get back
into Isis like so so that's not a bad
idea to get out of the you know the
office are the other computer but but
the thing is when you learned something
completely I'll give you an example huh
I've been coding in C++ Java C sharp
languages that are C++ like language
right then I went on to learn about Ruby
and which was very different and there
were features in Ruby that were not in
any of these languages ease and then
when it came back to programming in Java
I was actually able to apply some of the
concepts from Ruby into Java and then
the fellow programmers would look at me
and say that's very different course
than we ever right how'd you get this
idea from well over there from Ruby
right and and so a lot of things I do
today these things I actually learned in
other languages so so you know when I
often hear people complain saying I
don't like language x that's like saying
I don't like hammer or I don't like
screwdriver right right we are
programmers our job is to program and
and the more different programming
languages we know we actually end up
programming in the language we are using
in a much better way number one right
second if another language is a better
language we are ready to go after it and
I think that's one of the reasons why we
should really get out of the comfort
zone and do something completely
different than what we do it could be it
could be a tool could be a language it
could be a library that we are using
what we want to use different oh I'm
really using concurrency library from
jdk but I should maybe really try actors
or software transaction memory right
right and and doing that for a few
minutes a day really gives the courage
the motivation
confidence that we actually can do
something else yes I know the phrase
that you said in your talk that I just
love it is that you said that we have to
be a few minutes every day completely
uncomfortable yes right what do you mean
by completely uncomfortable so I just
can't see the bad in a way it is so if
you really look at a very young student
right whether it's a high school student
or a graduate student order undergrad
student you throw things at them dare
you do it right and then we get our
employment and then we are like odds as
comfortable have a chair and a desk to
work on right now and then after a few
years you can recline a little bit yeah
there's a sofa bed where you can lay
down right and 10 years of experience is
is where you know what I can't code in
my head and when I type it it works and
I want to be left alone don't tell me to
change it that's a comfort zone yes when
the comfort zone becomes bigger and
bigger and bigger and when you're asked
to do something different from what you
do it becomes really uncomfortable but
what if I put myself out of my comfort
zone every day oh you know what I've
been programming in Java for a long time
I'm gonna go coding groovy I'm not
coding in Rui oh my god I don't
understand how this dynamic typing works
I'm really uncomfortable yeah could if
you're not uncomfortable you are not
learning you're not moving I think being
uncomfortable is very important and and
being in front of people is
uncomfortable giving a talk is
uncomfortable going and speaking to some
buddies and comfortable explaining
things to somebody's uncomfortable well
if we never make ours us uncomfortable
life becomes very uncomfortable to take
yes if you're uncomfortable every day
what if being uncomfortable is the new
comfort then it becomes very different
way of doing what if we change what we
do every day then we don't fear changing
things so the change becomes normal
rather than being really hard and I
think we should really do that more
often I think we should be very
uncomfortable every day yes well you
know that's for a lot of people this is
a very very uncomfortable just by
getting out of this comfort zone it's
it's something scary right it is it is
very scary
but the thing is if we don't die in a
way i would say you don't think about
this for a minute you you imagine the
very first day you wrote a code you
what's the first thing that happened the
compiler spit at you yes he did what did
you do you fight it are you say damn it
I'm gonna try this right right so I'm
gonna beat you so we are shameless yes
and extended beyond the computer
extensively on the compiler be shameless
and render people what's the worst thing
that can happen you know what I'm gonna
suck but you know what we suck every day
yeah so we'll get better we fall but
it's not the end of the state we get up
and we move forward and we have learned
to deal with compilers we have lead deal
learn to deal with computers it just
extended further and and never be
ashamed of failing and I think it's not
a failure actually it is just that
you're going to get better by doing what
you do and and I think people who really
have the most difficulty are the people
who feel ashamed of you know doing
things and saying oh my gosh I should
really not do this right you know I'm a
I'm a little the old guy relatively
speaking and if I want to pretend that
I'm really perfect i should never fail i
don't think i would be have the courage
to even get up and walk and and you're
in front of people you know do my demos
fail yes they do they go mr. really
wrong but you know what people say and
what it happens to us do yes you're
right now it happens to me it happens to
you what's a big deal and we learn from
each turn move on and when I'm gonna
client I think that's a good thing
because own development so many things
go wrong every day really that's that's
like you know it's like a everyone talks
about the demo gods and everything
everyone has failed my mom was like a
client side and I was supposed to show
them a way to do something this was in
London yeah and and I have spent five
hours and the developer next me leans
over and says hey banker I have to tell
you this if you came in in the morning
and by nine-thirty you had this working
I'll be very angry because I'm here
and I'm happy you are struggling and and
then at the end of you know four hours
of iOS I tell him you know what sorry
this is a wasted day so far let's go to
lunch so we go to lunch and we're
talking about you know games and all
that and my little mind is thinking
about it and then I after about 20
minutes I tell him you know what can we
go back to work I have an idea so we
come back try something different and it
works and he's like whoa how did you
make this work and that embarrassment
for four hours was wonderful right
because he looks at me and says okay you
struggled to do this but you got this
working this gives me confidence that if
I struggled to I can make this work do
and and i think that is that makes you
more humane and and it's okay to
struggle it's okay to fail and
perseverance right perseverance is not
where you try once and run away yeah 1st
lenses where you try and try and try and
eventually make it work and I think
failure is not important perseverance is
important and I think that is why it's
important to be uncomfortable I think
excellent so thanks a lot of income
thanks for having us pleasure wonderful
so you got this you know be
uncomfortable be perseverance right
that's the way to improve your career I
think so thanks a lot thanks for hey so
thanks everyone for watching thanks
everyone here for watching here night
hacking and keep watching because we're
going to have lots of cool interviews
and cool discussions with very very cool
people like van cats here all night
hacking thanks a lot thank you okay
thank you all right I'm just stop this
