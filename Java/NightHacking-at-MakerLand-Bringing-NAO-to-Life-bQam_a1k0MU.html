boxes because choreograph is a software
that you can use to program with boxes
so on the left you can see the standard
box library so those are our boxes that
are already been made and that you can
use for instance the safe box so you can
just drag and drop it in the in it and
you can link it so the arrow on the left
just means that is the start of the
behavior so if you link it to the to the
input of the box it just means that when
you start the behavior the robot will
launch those a box if you double-click
the side box oh look it's bigger on the
inside you have two boxes inside one box
the first one is just the text that you
can that you can write because the robot
has text-to-speech abilities so you can
just make him say whatever you want so
the robots here are in English so we
will write them into the text in English
for instance and here that's another box
and if you have a look inside so double
click oh look it's Python sprint so you
can also make your own boxes or modify
the existing boxes using Python and you
can see there are some special API that
you can use here for instance you have
i'll text to speech if you are
interested later we can have a look
together at the documentation and you
can see exactly what you can do with the
rocket or you see here you have
different colors for the links so why is
that that's because that's the type of
the signals so all those links are just
signals that are going from box to box
the black ones just mean that they are
just no more standard signal just a
signal like go but the blue ones mean
text so here basically the localized
Xbox are just outputs here the sentence
that you've written and the saitek just
gets the sentence and inside the robot
just launched the save function and say
your sentence so you see that that's
very basic right if you want to create
your own box I will receive a bit too
later probably so that's the first box
and you can use another one for instance
you can make the robot stand up
so you see there is something very
useful that's the the search input in
the in the library so if you have too
many boxes and you don't know where it
is you can just search for it so stand
up I guess would be better to to put it
before so you can always edit your links
you can just click on the suppress or
just did it and it's fun so
here you see you have two outputs so if
you want to have more info on an output
you can just put your mouse over it and
you get some tooltip so here you see
that the output is named success and the
other one is named feller so basically
if the robot has stood up correctly then
you can go here and ask you go here so
for instance if it's not okay you exit
the behavior and if it's okay the rabbit
is top so i will launch it on my fake
robot you can have a look at the fake
robots
so you see it works it will look more
impressive on a real robot but that's
for you after so here it looks pretty
sick one short but actually you can
paralyze some boxes for instance you can
make the robot talk and move at the same
time so we will just add a hello gesture
for instance is Nikolas made you
installed the animation library so if
you're interested later you can also
have a big hand side with our pre med
animations so very good so here you see
say and hello are connected to the the
same signal
Oh
yeah so you see the robot is waving and
talking at the same time so sometimes
you would like to make your own
movements maybe you can do it so let's
start by creating a box from scratch so
if you want to create a box from scratch
you just right-click in the middle of
your space and you add a new box yes so
you just need to put a name and a
tooltip but you need to choose the type
so you have three types of boxes so the
screed box that's the deuce the inside
state box that I show you with the with
the place on script so these are just
scrape boxes timelines that's for the
animation so that where we will choose
and flow diagram that just the boxes
within boxes within boxes it's very easy
it's very beautiful too to order your
behavior and but we will use timeline
so now we have a new box and it's a time
like box so if you double click OK here
you have something different you have a
workspace but you also have a motion
layer so animation on now works with key
framing so you need to put the robot in
some kind of position so on your side
you will be able to do it easily with
the robot i will do it with the fake
robot
other
so for instance that's an animation ok
so now I can right click on the layer
and just store the joints in keyframe so
for instance the whole body
and i will add another fun keep friend
so that's very basic okay if you want to
do a real animation it takes a lot of
work but if you want to happen with that
you can try and hear the little red flag
dress means that's the end of the
animation so we don't need to take care
about it so now you have an animation
and you can put it after they say or we
can use ok lets you some sensors and the
robot has a lot of sensors you will see
that you have tactile sensors on the
head over the hands you have bumpers on
the feet you still have cameras you have
microphones you have a lot of different
things for instance wiliest actor
sensors on the the head
what i will do it just here depending if
i touch the the first sensor the second
center of the rear sensor i will launch
something different so for instance i
will launched my animation or i will
launch another animation like this one
are Ardita yes where is air guitar yeah
her guitar
so what I want to do is just launched
this little behavior after the hello
welcome to make your own but you see
there is thus a box and the hello box
and you have two different output so if
I do that I mean maybe the robot has not
finished talking and if I do that maybe
the robot has not finished the gesture
so we need to make a kind of link to say
that I need to wait until the two boxes
are finished and so we already provided
box like that which is wait for signal
so that's this one and basically you
just need to ask the two inputs here and
nowadays box will i would put only when
everything has finished
and okay so you see here you have wells
you don't need actually so this one then
you can finish the behavior so let's try
it oh yeah I forgot we need to save the
behavior yes because maybe there is a
problem and you will lose everything
soon file and save project yes okay
would it happen often
running
are you
oh you see I lost everything I should
have done it before
oh okay I'm sorry
is that the right one oh yes
no I mean no yeah but
I don't need to be any straighter
back in a moment sorry this is not my
laptop soon I'm getting confused
marks
that comes
version
ok
wait a month
I need to redo everything I there is no
safe with our server okay so we just
redo everything as weak as possible
nice
we said right now
so the usual shortcuts should short web
too so ctrl s should let you say
hi
hmm
No
ok
so
you can save it as a PNG file which is a
kind of a zip file that we used to share
easily the behaviors say yes
my black side
okay so now we're done so hello welcome
to make your lungs waiting for the
signal so you see there is some green
things that goes for the signal so you
can see what is happening so now the
robot is waiting for my tactile input he
stuck in the tack to head box so i will
just simulated by double-clicking GD
output so this is our guitar that has it
here because in this box you can also
add compound
and added the sound so on the red robot
you would hear the air guitar
so then you can also add a lot of
different things like your loops and you
can also create like fake state machines
so
for instance yeah I would say yeah for
instance in our behaviors what we do is
just create behavioral layers and we use
it as a state machines so if you're
interested in doing that I can also
explain to your bit later individually
if you're planning to do a very big
behavior it might be good to organize
your behavior instead machines like that
so that's like the timeline that we did
to make an animation but you can add
layers of behavior you can create
friends and organize your behavior on
those frames and you have boxes that are
called go to and stop that allow you to
jump from frame to frame so you can for
instance make a game and create a
introduction the instructions and the
mode 1 mode 2 and the rear wall and you
know so this is a very versatile tool
and you can really go into the deepest
levels because you can you can script
your boxes but you can also add your own
C++ modules for instance you can say it
in the documentation so I hope you have
fun
why yes okay thank you
I don't have any more cables may be the
organizer I tried it and it worked can I
can I remove them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
