Network and I'm here today at the JVM
summit and talking to Charles nutter hi
nice to meet you so I tell us a little
bit to what you do with the jruby I have
been working on JRuby for about seven or
eight years now first it's Sun and then
at other companies now red hat that had
been sponsoring us working on making the
best possible ruby implementation on top
of the JVM but also solving problems
that we come across along the way JVM
features that are deficient or missing
and finding ways to work around the
limitations of the platform so you had
to talk today so what did you talk about
my talk was basically about all of those
little things that we've had to do to
work around the JVM tricks to deal with
native libraries native memory file
access and character encodings all that
kind of stuff in hopes that the folks
that are in the room at the JVM language
summit may be able to take some of these
issues and improve them in the future
okay so you're looking for people to fix
problems basically absolutely that's
that's the name of the game and open
source I got to find as many lackeys as
I can to to fix it all for us so you
talked also about like a FF I and so
tell us a little bit what that is so f
fi is a foreign function interface most
languages and platforms out there that
developers are familiar with have a way
to break out of the managed language and
call down to native code native
libraries written in C or some other
language and we very early realized we
would need that in JRuby we've done a
lot of the work to prepare a really nice
ffi library and a set of support
libraries for it we're hoping that maybe
we can get this into the JVM with the
jet 191 or a JSR and get this gig make
it possible for all developers all java
developers to be able to use foreign
libraries like that so you're also
speaking at javaone and so what are you
talking about it
at javaone i actually will go through
what the status of getting ffi into
OpenJDK is what we're hoping to
accomplish with it what some of the
current OpenJDK folks want to do with it
and hopefully get folks excited about
the the potential future in java 9 and
let them know that they are going to
have a way to do this sort of these sort
of calls in the future so Java one why
why'd you go to Java one javaone JVM
language summit and probably cause dem
are the the three conferences where i
get a chance to face to face with folks
from oracle folks from IBM all sorts of
people that are involved in OpenJDK
involved in the various JVMs the people
that i need to to work with two to make
it better platform for JRuby and other
languages and just not many
opportunities to meet up with these
folks from all over the world so Java
one's a big one soand do you recommend
to any Jay Ruby's to come to Java one as
well yeah absolutely i would i would
recommend that developers from all sorts
of off platform non JVM languages at
least try and come to java wan watch the
talks maybe submit some talks until tell
us what the the rest of the world is
like my my goal with a lot of my talks
at javaone have just been to teach
people what's actually happening at the
JVM level and below so they understand a
little better where we're going with
things ok thank you for taking the time
and talking to us thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
