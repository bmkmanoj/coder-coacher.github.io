the content come together well the Java
track is going to be this saturday and
we have amazing sessions prepared for
the audience and we have sessions about
Java 8 we have sessions about Java 9 the
stream API the currency API Java
certification and we also have bulk
groovy and cuddly as well so we covered
the JVM a little bit as well so we have
basic basic sessions to advance sessions
and it was really good because we said
we received a lot of submissions from
the cockpit call for papers and it was
almost 30 submission so it was very hard
for us to have to pick only a few
sessions so do you have a recommendation
on how people can can submit this image
I mean submit a proposal and get upset
accept it especially when there is such
a competition right yes if you're going
to submit a session to a conference it
is good that you have a good description
for a conference and also a title of the
session that that has something
different so in the description make
sure that you tell about the technology
that you want to talk about and also
what you are going to talk about because
if you just say oh I want to talk about
Java so it's very generic so if you can
be as much as specific as you can that
is good and help us to go through all
the submissions and maybe pick yours and
if you have an experience as well as
speaking at other conferences that might
be helpful because you already have
experience but we always also try to
give the opportunity to people that also
don't have much experience because it is
also it is always good to have new faces
that you can learn from so so giving
reference to
like previous talk maybe blogs as well
yes that is great if you provide maybe
your LinkedIn profile and your github
you'd help always help so we can see
what kind of repositories you have
worried what is your experience so that
is always helpful so you organizing also
the content for the JavaScript truck yes
I have I'm all about Java front end and
back end so tragically way that's
correct so how is what are some of the
topics on the Java JavaScript track we
have topics for a scale the architecture
so we have topics about JavaScript
compilers there are more advanced topics
we also have sessions about testing how
you can do some unit testing on the
front end and with JavaScript you don't
you don't need only to develop the front
end you can also work with hybrid mobile
apps and you can also work with hybrid
desktop apps and we have sessions that
will tell you a little bit how to test
your JavaScript code as well and some
other some other topics from the market
firebase that is that it's a it's a
topic that everyone's talking about
specially now that has a new version
ionic so different technologies so how
how do you see developers like using
javascript and java because I mean so
JavaScript now also goes into you can
also go to the backhand so so how do you
see that all the disintegration actually
happening in them I believe that that is
very good because we have the html5 that
is the rock star of the front end so you
can use the best of the both words so
for example if you like to use Java if
you are java developer you can use job
on the back
and.and you do what you do best with
Java and you can use html5 and
JavaScript on the front end and the
browser understands HTML Javascript and
also CSS so you'll be using you you will
be using something that the browser
understands and you have different
combinations there are different
front-end frameworks for example we have
angular we have backbone we have amber
as well they're one of the most popular
ones if we go to the mobile we have
Cordova for the gap ionic if we go to
the desktop we have electron that is a
you can wrap your application and you
have you have a native application that
you can run on windows or linux or mac
so we have different different platforms
that you can use javascript and of
course you can always use java on the
back end and you can integrate all these
platforms using javascript with java on
the back end cool excellent so I know
that in the past you would a book I'm
just curious if you are writing a new
book by any chance I had a book
published last week Oh see perfect
timing i knew it yeah so so what was the
book about it was a second edition of a
learning javascript data structures and
algorithms so it was updated to the
newest version of at my script to 2015
mm-hmm and i talked about all the basic
data structures so arrays tree scraps
and also algorithms that we can use in
real world so any any plan after this
book any other things that you're
working on right now I'm focusing on my
video courses for my training portal I
started a training portal it's the
loyola need training cool and I
published some free videos on youtube on
my youtube channel and I actually linked
all my videos in this rainy so at the
end of the course the student can have a
certificate that can presents to
universities and also companies josootty
I learned excellent and you did a
session probably at javaone last week
right so what was that session about yes
my session was about how you can
integrate html5 and JavaScript with java
at the back end so i demonstrated
several examples there was an examples
with one example with jax-rs so using
the Java EE api's so jpa you can also
use web sockets depending on the project
that you are going to develop and I also
did a demo with spring just to
demonstrate you can use whatever you
like in the java the java back end and
on the front end i did a demo with
jquery and backbone i actually used the
NetBeans wizard to do that so you don't
have to code anything is just a click of
a button and also an example with
angular 2 to demonstrate the new new
version and how it's easy for java
developers to get it get started with
angular the syntax of typescript which
is one of the let's say language is not
actually a language is just another way
of writing JavaScript but it's very
similar to java so it can be a good
framework for java developers to learn
and i did another example on ionic 2 to
demonstrate how you can have a mobile
application talking to java and an
example with sencha and an example with
electron so you have several different
platforms you have the web desktop you
have the hybrid mobile and you'll have
the hybrid desktop as well different
HTML applications talking with a java
back
and wow this is impressive I think very
impressive to see all the tools that
you're using so so thank you so much for
talking to us and thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
