technology Network we're here at devoxx
speaking to members of the java
community I've got Conrad milewski with
me hey Conrad all right how you doing
dude good so um tell me you you're a
Java developer your yeah so the last few
years mostly scholar developer currently
trying to move ebay onto scholar and so
far working ok yeah Dava van wert also
polish dog leader and also I found it
other groups such as a scholar user
group and for lambda lounge which is
basically for the other functional
programming languages that have a bit
smaller communities but also want to
meet each other ok so tell me what
wouldn't make scholar so great what do
you want people to use guy because I'm
it's a great mix of functional words
because like I said we had to face
lambda loan but that's for kind of
extreme languages like all extreme like
Haskell and I lisps right so but on the
other hand with Scala we have both the
Java words other at our hands and stuff
we know we know the JVM and on the other
hand we get all this function of power
from from these other languages so it's
a perfect mix I think excellent yeah as
long as you're using the JVM you will I
like that so tell me a little bit I the
reason why I asked you as I noticed you
did a quickie called disrupt to grow and
it just sounded like a really
interesting topic so tell me about that
night so the story behind the talk is
I'm a very very technical person and
always avoided all the soft fluffy
topics and the friend of mine was very
interested fluffy topics made a bet with
me that I will never submit I a jolly
soft talk and if you want to force a
Polish go to do something well you make
a bet and tell him you can't do
something so I did and that's how it got
here and the talk itself is out of my
comfort zone and that's what kind of
primary idea of a talk to stay outside
of what you're comfortable with in order
to grow
oh right because there's no other way
right you have to try something
different something you need not used to
and that's it and the talk itself was my
first kind of warm fluffy talk but it
got a nice reception and people were
also inspired by it I think so warm and
fluffy is ok as long as it's outside
your comfort zone right is sometimes you
have to certain sadly and happily we
have people in software so right you
have to talk to people so yeah
interesting so tell me some other things
you've done to get you outside of your
comfort zone what have you done oh my
for example I didn't mention that but
I'm also running the maguey cone with a
bunch of other guys with polish dog so
geek on has pretty much like devoxx the
same kind of style of conference it's
also hosted in a cinema and it's a
conference in poland running five years
and it was basically because we were
uncomfortable with the Polish situation
of not having a nice conference so again
let's let's do one if we don't have
something just just do it and that's
what we did with with geek on and fees
user groups and but what I'm trying to
do if I don't like something I just I
just do what I would like to have and
when people usually follow along and if
they don't it probably was a bad idea so
fail fast but gegen is still running so
didn't fail and we're very happy about
it well congratulations what time of
year is geek on yeah it's in May each
year in Krakow okay so geek on that or
go check it out excellent please do so
thank you Conrad I'm glad you dropped by
it's very interesting and salute I'm
sure we can learn more and find you out
on the twittersphere it's kto is so
peered at very patriotic excellent thank
you thanks for dropping by this is Tori
we out with the Oracle technology
Network thanks
