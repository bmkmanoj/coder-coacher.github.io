hacking and I'm here with Michael
calling and the green foot and blue jay
teams for those of you who don't know
about the format so you can watch the
show at night hacking calm or we live
stream it there's a social chat you can
log on to and then type stuff and then
we'll show up on the screen here so we
can interact with our virtual audience
and we'll just chat and hack and do
whatever comes to mind so it's a fairly
informal format alright so welcome yeah
I'm Michael and we are actually passing
the microphone around so it it's some
stage along the way we can't hear us
then you probably forgot yeah so so you
should probably you should probably
introduce yourself a little better than
I did so what do you do where do you
teach why the gyno okay yo be a yes be
sitting here bail you out there on the
screens can see that but you know the
weird sitting here at the university of
kent i would hold a closer if you can in
our lab might just take the closing so
we are in canterbury which is in the
southeast corner of England at the
University of Kent and that's where our
group works I'm a professor at the
University here and greenford and blue
jay you said it's the green route i
teams is actually just not two teams
it's just the same people doing both
yeah so blue tang green for the both
projects that came out of our group here
at the University of Kent and I'm the
longest standing member of the team it
started actually the whole idea at the
beginning started and came out of my PhD
thesis and then soft went from there
it's been going for quite a long time
more than 10 years now moved pretty long
whilst doing a project especially for a
university yeah it is it is unusual
certainly for us and we are typically
what universities are good at is
developing the new exciting stuff you
know the research he bit and and to
building prototypes of really new but
what we are typically really bad at is
supporting products
and so this is this is a neutral photo
you know yeah and supposedly actually I
saw a little nap downstairs which have
the flashing lights as people start up
blue jay and green foot so you actually
you actually have a real user camera
yeah we doin to her actually i'll let
the other guys introduce themselves and
i can see where they can bring them up
actually we can maybe look at the crea
that we call well on Devon I'm one of
the blue jay and green foot developers
I'm from Australia and that's where I
started working on on Blue Jay but I've
since come over here to Kent to do my
PhD so I'm in the process of doing that
at the same time as working on Blue Jay
and green foot and I'm hoping that some
good stuff will come out of my research
on to novice programmer errors and we
can incorporate that into the software
how do you how do you like canterbury
versus or is it not boring he said yeah
that's right I'm for Melvin yeah uh yeah
it's it's different um it's called it is
called a really nice day today yeah yeah
did you order this weather just for me
since I was going to get me the rain
that's why yeah you'd actually you're
getting a pretty good day for this time
of year yeah but now Canterbury is very
very nice down actually it's it's much
smaller than open as well but I'm
enjoying the experience of just being
somewhere new I guess um oh that's on it
now yeah sure I'm Neal Brown so I work
on the Blue Jay and green foot projects
as well and so technically I'm a sort of
researcher here but really I do a
mixture of development and outreach so
sort of doing that the actual coding on
blue Jane greenfoot were then going
around and talking to pupils and
especially recently to teachers about
green foot and so to try and sort of
demo the software show them how to use
it and talk about teaching with it we've
been doing a lot of sort of work in UK
recently trying to encourage so the
computing education in school
cool and actually Devon and Neal are the
people who actually write pretty much
most of the code nowadays I mean even
though i started the projects actually i
right little cold another nowadays yeah
apparently so if you're doing your
research thesis presumably on related
topics or maybe not yeah yeah so what
I'm looking at is sort of errors that
that novice program is Mike when they're
learning to write Java code okay ah so i
won't go into it too much right but
basically looking at a much more
advanced ways of trying to analyze the
errors that they make in and give much
better feedback so so if you're familiar
with the the Java Sea error messages
they can be pretty diabolical at times
yeah there are cryptic yeah if Devin
does a good job you might not only get a
PhD but but we all it should go into
gluten green for 10 that work of course
I mean it's the very idea nice and you
know so that hopefully you know keeps a
bit of motivation that people actually
look at that I mean that's the one thing
that we can offer the idea is that you
can actually have real users at the end
yeah that's pretty actually in pretty
girl you talk about users do you just
want to switch over to my screen here
and look at that at the moment um when
green photo blue jay get started up
somewhere it does a ping back to our
server for version check and we can pick
that up and so on this map this is a
live map where we can see in vocations
of blue jay or green foot so we can see
in every dot there's someone to starting
up the system right now cool and it's a
late night hackers in the yeah and it's
actually surprisingly quiet and europe
there's just a few so it's you know
someone every few seconds starting it up
and then you know say on average work
for an hour so actually we have to be
recorded at once and sped it up so if
you look at this this is the same thing
over day just run a bit quicker and so
you see where users are knows those so
we've got the time over this is you know
evening in the US
a lot of viewers so this year the u.s.
is usually very active its middle of the
night here right in Europe at the moment
so there's pretty but here you can see a
joke waking up China is a black hole
yeah Europe is awake waking up now is
eight in the morning in Europe and so
this is Europe waking up now China is a
black hole because they're almost all
behind a firewall they are users there
we don't see them because we don't get
they we only see those who have an open
HTTP HTTP connection going while they're
working so there is a narc area Africa
that's very dark and I think that really
is dark I assume that there really
aren't that many users surprised I'm
surprised you don't have more in South
America yeah South America or so is
there a few where we are now middle of
the afternoon in South America yes so
there's a few but clearly the the
hotspots r us and Central Europe yeah
yeah we need to at some point we need to
get you out to Java in Brazil so you can
surprise them yeah yeah the Brazilians
are they're pretty pretty good with Java
generally so in terms of users you know
it's their projects that have real users
so we have four blue jay we have about
two and a half million unique users per
year well and green for this is still
quite a bit smaller green forests around
250 to 300 thousand a year or so we
could so that's they're still sizable
mom that's juliana something like sixty
thousand a month or so so so you guys
got quite a lot of bug reports i would
say ok when your birds nuclear you can
talk to that we we do get a few there's
I'd like to say that we don't get many
because there's just not that many bugs
but I spent a couple of hours this
weekend actually turn on downer
particularly nasty one in Greenwood so
yeah that the bug reports they roll in
and we usually try and answer an email
that we get within 24 hours okay and
people are generally pretty happy with
the response they get from you know a
small team we've had comments come back
saying oh well your guys support is so
much better than you know that of
commercial software so we
be pretty happy without a thing well I
actually get to talk to real developers
not passed through multi tears of
different unqualified support engineers
that's right yeah support phone calls
that are and actually we have to say
that in a rate of bugs actually has been
relatively low for I know we are we are
essentially sort of a four-person team
and we are supporting a couple million
users mmm and we can reasonably
comfortably do that so and it's not it's
not looking too bad and yes Devon said
we really answer every support email
within a day and Devon you're typically
pretty good to solving problems pretty
much everything we do resolve fairly
quickly so so it's actually been been
going okay so a lot of the problems
people have with blue giant green folks
because the schools and universities
sort of locked down there their networks
in strange ways so often that we're
dealing with is not so much a bug as a
sort of installation or configuration
issue so we have a lot of those to try
and try and tackle so a simpler you can
make it the easier your lives become
yeah pretty much yet its own your
motivation where the developers do the
support make sure you don't put bugs in
yeah yeah yeah very good actually we
haven't actually said what you're doing
Benford actually is for you know those
make you yeah well maybe we maybe should
just show it down she goes over you
before which had more about it you want
to show how mucho I think I think we'll
do to try first so I journey blue Jane
Whitford are both environments
development environments developed
specifically for education so for
teaching and learning object hunted
programming and the target group is a
bit different bluejay was developed sort
of with a target wouldn't mind of entry
university levels of first first
semester University and green foot that
we went down in ages I'm more at school
and maybe I just show you bluejay first
so this is this is Blue Jay on screen
with a project open their go and first
thing that people typically see is you
know the the
interface looks very simple that was one
of the big and still is one of the
really overarching Ames's simplicity of
the interface we want we want the
students to not concentrate on the
environment you know they ideally they
should not notice blue jelly they should
think about programming principles and
not about the environment so if you
compare that in a weave months been
through it means and counted the number
of options you have in your face you
know it's all the menu items all the
buttons all the various menus and that
is you know it's easily even the welcome
screen for netbeans is more complicated
than this yeah so you've got about 300
options there no and go and none of them
is write a program and so we tried very
hard to to keep the defacing but so
there's a lot of going on behind the
scenes but you know I shouldn't be and
so you get the diagram and then the
first thing we actually do is not just
all right code but to interact with
objects so this is a simple class
diagram and if you have classes and then
you can right click on it and you can
invoke the constructor so you will see
every constructor here that is defined
in the class so this one just has a
default constructor and you can give a
name to the object and that's a default
name and i'll leave that and then you
get the object down here and you can
click on the object and you see all the
public methods of the object and there's
one for example make visible wear this
circle then cleans itself and there we
go ready / yeah and then so that's one
of the principles actually is to start
with a big concepts and not with the
with syntax you know no we don't start
talking at the beginning about where do
the curly braces go and you know what
does public static void main mean and
where's the semicon so we just get them
to play so here then you know they can
look at what can I do and then there's a
move right which moves the circle of it
to the right oh you know there's move
down and I can create another circle and
I can make that visible as well then
I've got two circles here and I've got
other shapes here you know so I have a
square and I can make that visible
there's my square and then I can play
around with it and I can have something
you know this was just method call so
this is what you see so far is you know
from in class you can create an object
in fact from Cal so you can create
multiple object education is important
to create actually multiple objects of
the same class to to get that difference
across and then I just the methods I
invoke so far we all know return value
no parameters but you can you can deal
with parameters as well I can have a
change size for example that has an
interferometer and if you have a method
with the pyramid and you invoke it it
displays is that from the javadoc yeah
it was well as talking to regenerate the
documentation so no no that we pass
ourselves and that comes out of and pals
are but we all that varies javadoc you
and look that is yeah so we generate
java took on the fly as long nice um and
then if the method has a parameter you
just you know um type in the value and
that executes sand so you know you can
they've seen an example of it into
parameter or you can lesser change color
where we have a string parameter and so
you can play around with this and so we
let them play with us for a while and
what's actually going on here is that
the first basic principles of object
orientation get established that you
know a program consists of a set of
classes from classes you can create
objects you can communicate with objects
by invoking the methods methods main
parameters parameters of types the class
determines the behavior of the objects
every object of the st. clouds have the
same methods and all that you can see so
when we start coding you don't do that
for very long we do that for 20 minutes
or so but once we start looking at code
is all in the context of objects then
it's so you have kind of a picture in
your mind what you Deb wish a mental
framework object orientation principles
are ya and so if you look at the
traditional environment slander if you
look at the clip so I'm it means we're
what you see mostly on screen is lines
of code then they think about lines of
code
and understanding things like the
difference of a class and object is
actually very hard thing then that's one
of the traditionally very difficult to
teach concepts because when you look at
your code you're actually looking
simultaneously at a class or an object
depending on what mode you're thinking
and whether you're thinking about static
or dynamic yeah it's just those are
those red things at the bottom yeah
exactly and so we never we talked about
it that's exactly it they know instances
are the red blobs and we all know here
that objects are red they always read
and then we get them know we get we say
okay show this and say okay now now make
a make a painting of a house it'll make
it make a house over the window and a
roof and the son of this guy and so we
let them play for and 15 minutes however
like that I can they just play with
invoking methods putting in paramedicine
and then when they've done that we get
them to open another project which is
that one here which is the same except
we have one additional calcium and you
say okay now create an instance of the
picture class and we can in fact after
half an hour so we can use that
terminology they are they understand
what that means to be introduced
terminology at the same time so they
create an instance of the picture class
and then I say well invoke the draw
method and they go there invoke draw and
there's my house and let me tell them
yeah really if your programmer and you
want a picture of a house you wouldn't
actually do it by hand you can write a
program that does it you know and then
we look at the source code we open up
the class it is and the next thing to
video say is just you know now the Sun
is blue so make the Sun yellow mm-hmm
and you know we don't even talk about
simplex or salsa they just they just
scan through here and if you scan
through here so I tell them well just
try to figure out where that's happening
and change it and then they see here it
says draw it there it says wall move
horizontally more wall more vertical
wall change size and window and then
there is the Sun is a new circle is the
same methods which they're playing
exactly so they start associating those
with
the code exactly for the last you know
15 minutes they've done exactly this so
they immediately recognize that this is
what's happening here and they see the
word blue here and doesn't take a lot of
guessing to you know put that in and
then we quickly tell them about taking
the compile button you know we're now
this is striped in the in the diagram
which means it's uncompelled and so if
it son compiled you don't have
constructor there so we briefly
explained that you have to hit the
button and then if you do it again you
know create a picture again and invoke
the draw method and yellow glue and then
you know that's the first and that's
then how we start coding so the syntax
starts in the context of changing
behavior of objects so we really start
now that's what we call objects first
methodology we all start room but
objects before we talk about sometimes
and that's that's so that's pretty much
the way and then you can know you could
do other things you've got another
example here where got a few more
classes so you we can we get a sort of
simplified you mail diagram so it's a
subset of your mail would be so your
screen so you see inheritance you see
and then you can do composition for
example I've got here's database of
staff and students so if i create a
staff member and i create a student
prefer remember can you come back later
thank you um and then if you have a
database object and the database has a
method that has an odd person we can has
a person parameter but you can pass in a
staff or student so you can just you
know they've click on say okay i want to
pass this object in here I don't know
you know do another at person and pass
that object in there and so you can you
can compose them as well you can play
around for them it's sort of very highly
interactive so you can then can you take
the instances on the order you've been
creating stuff and turn that into the
code yes you could so in fact we have a
few abuse that for for unit testing we
have a unit testing option which is by
default switched off but we could switch
on and if you do unit testing you
essentially play out your tests okay and
it
cause them at the same time in then you
just really save and it creates a unit
testing motors with our sequence
observed it it writes out the source
code it creates a unit test class from
your actions it just recalls what you're
doing and creates that in claim java
source code and you get a gigantic ass
yeah i remember when i was going
university quite well as a number of
years i'm going to show my age if i tell
you how many okay unit testing was one
of the things which they did not really
teach us at that time and yet every
company I've been at that's the first
thing which if you can't do efficient
unit test them well actually maybe I
show you because I think that's one of
the really interesting bits about Blue
Jay because Buddha even though it's for
beginners but for professionals I think
that's one area that Goethe actually
does better than many other environments
where if I go to the preferences here
and I say okay show me my unit testing
tools what I get Dennis I get a few more
buttons here and what I can then do is
say I want to test my student class I
get a create test class thing here
that's my unit so that the unit test
classes in the diagram always kept
together with it closet but it belongs
to and then I can say here ok I want to
create a test method and let's say I
want to test the name so I say test name
and then now my recording indicators on
and now essentially everything I'm
everything you you do have also yeah and
then I do something like I create a
student with a name as Fred year of
birth 1990 our students are getting
young now student ID so okay so I'm
string and so the name is Fred and then
I want to see whether the name was
initialized correctly so I go and invoke
my get name unless it and i see ok that
one returned Fred but independent of
what it returns now even if it was not
implemented in just returns a dummy
string I can now add my assertion and
say what I think it should return though
so I say okay I had expected this to
return Fred which is sexually so I one
is at the assertion and I close it and
then I end my recording and now it's
just rewritten this
I'm so if we look into the test class we
see no it's rabanne written the class
and here's my no fix our test one method
remove room for your toes and now I can
run my tests and get a green bell and so
that is how we start with unit testing
in a week first for first few weeks we
just do manual interactive testing and
we get them into the habit of testing
immediately after they written mm-hm you
know as a small method and then we
transition to regression testing with j
unit by just doing it manually at first
and just recording it so that it can
replay it and then later we get into I
mean this is just as you know the
standard dry unit class you can edit it
by hand there's nothing stopping you
from now modifying it in code so it
doesn't have to be interactive you can
just know they also go in by Jay evening
so we got a we got a comment from
Russell Russell wander up from nearby
nearby London I think he said southern
one thing but um hi Russell he made a
comment but you made at nine minutes ago
so it's slightly out of context so next
next time you say something we'll catch
it okay I think that pretty much sort of
shows the the basic idea of of Blue Jay
and some blue days no it's used a lot in
introductory programming travesties also
some schools for the u.s. some of the AP
courses used booty even though um you
know at school there's depending on age
you know if you go down low enough
greenford might be the more appropriate
system but it sort of even though we had
University in mind it's sort of been
bleeding into school it's cool little as
well doing more to say that my trophy so
it's fish to greenford good demo
it was like you wrote the thing after a
demo before in fact it's actually true
that Blue Jay demos for me I know much
more unusual way green photos the
younger system the more recent system
and most demos we do so over the last
year or two have revived in green foot
and blue jay is so well established at
the moment so there's a lot of sort of
word-of-mouth propagation that we don't
actually you also haven't chosen we're
doing maybe don't need to promote it
much anymore so so yeah my blue jay
demos are actually a bit out of practice
and green for demos is what what we do a
lot at the moment yeah I was not bad for
an hour practice tomo okay shall we show
green foot and maybe maybe one of you
can talk and i just type what do you
want stuff one bets oh yeah if you pick
the project and i'll try and say
something interesting about it ok and
what that sort is this is green faux
which as Michael mentioned Blue Jay
tends to be for sort of introductory
University for sort of ages 17 18
upwards but is perhaps a little bit dry
if you want to sort of introduce younger
younger kids to coding you notes it
teaches you the code but it's sort of
there's not as much sort of visual
feedback you don't get so the cool
things going on so if you think of
systems like scratch or co2 which are
other educational systems you know it's
a little about sort of making games
having fun making some cool stuff happen
on the screen so when we're looking sort
of a teenager's also weird greenford is
still a full java-based sort of text
based programming so it's not like
scratches blocks or sort of visual
programming it is full-on you can see
here the editor you know it is just java
programming but this time russ and blue
jay sort of UML class diagram what we've
got here is and a sort of visual
representation where you can sort of
make make graphics and make things move
around the screen so it's you can make
sort of games and simulations and things
what we've got here is a project with
wombats
so Blue Jays class diagram is
effectively transplanted over to the
right-hand side of the screen there
mm-hmm when you can see actually the
same same color scheme so each class now
has a sort of image associated with it
so a bit of sort of metadata and all the
classes that we usually use in in
greenford sort of either inherited from
world or from actor so world is is this
area on the left hand side it sort of
the background the container that has
everything in it so we've got a subclass
Accord won that world and so as Michael
to show you if you now right click on
that world you can just interact with it
like we did the objects in in blue jay
so you can just right click on the world
call a method and it's you know you can
see the share the same code blue jays
sort of mexico's is the same as green
foots so we've got the world class and
then anything in the world is then an
actor so you see one batch the subclass
of actor and leaf is a subclass of actor
so again we've got this class object
distinction the classes of the things on
the right there the wombat on the right
and you can have lots of wombat objects
over here on the Left actually in the
world and we can make a new one bat and
put it in the world we can make sort of
new leaves and put them in the world
inspected as well maybe you should show
that yeah surly open it up if this is
available Blue Jay and green for if you
right click on it as well as doing the
the methods if you do an inspect then
this shows you all the fields of that
objects and they can take our value so
that can help to sort of well help with
debugging it can help fertilize that
they've the red colour schemes it's a
different state yes so this is again red
for object but it's blown up and you can
actually see the fields inside it so all
your actors have an x and y position so
that's inherited from from actor if I
make a move forward now and you look at
the way yep so as we actually alter the
state of the object that's reflected in
the inspection window that we've got up
yep so as we so I guess one baths one
that's really leaves they really do
nevin should be able to tell you because
he's Australian he said no one bats you
know anyone that's you've had a one bad
for a pet I never did no I I did know
some people who did have though it used
to burrow under their house so it was a
very problematic pet yeah okay tell them
about the Act method because that's
where it gets interesting okay so one of
the methods is defined in the actor
classes is the apt method and all the
other classes that derived from actor of
course inherit that method but that
method special to green foot because or
a green foot knows about the Act method
basically now Michaels clicking on this
act button at the bottom there and what
that does is go through all the objects
that are currently in the world and it
calls the apt method on them and then
they do whatever it is that they do so
it's a way of implementing a sort of
standard behavior for the objects in the
world there's also a run button wheeler
calls act and a loop that's right
exactly just a loop around neck so those
those wombats are not very smart have
these ones in a very smart all know they
they move forward if they come before
they turn left and if they see a leaf
they eat it but they're not smart enough
to define those overly sitting on the in
the middle earth that are in the middle
of the world's sorry I guess they
understand collision detection either no
so but essentially what what what's
happening here is you you execute a
program mm-hm oh you make a program run
just by implementing an act method in
the object you know so there's no public
static void main as well so essentially
you just code behavior of objects and
green foot does the rest for you and so
so there's you know there's no of
infrastructure overhead you really think
only in terms of object behavior mm-hmm
and then you can you can do some other
things you
so so just to quickly point out Michael
so Michael play the are the last droids
clone so in our class diagram over on
the right you known only we got
listeners or all our practice i but
we're also showing the inheritance
relation which again is an important
sort of object-oriented city sheriff de
fev set up the sounds that would have
been more exciting yes yeah so we do
have sound on the asteroids the cell is
coming through this by now so so it is
useful because kids like making a racket
we are so it's over all the right hand
side which actually showing the
inheritance relation between the
subclasses of world and actor and the
parent actor class and so inheritance
often sort of viewed as an advanced
topic but actually in green foot we've
got it straight away from the outset you
know one that is an actor we don't make
a huge deal of it we just say you know
one bats an actor that's what this arrow
means and so that means you no one bats
have this this act method and so they
get the idea of inheritance even before
sort of perhaps you know this one is how
are we having to deal with it yep so
this is a piano example
and so here we've got just one class for
the piano keys and there's two different
images and obviously the keys is set in
different positions so while green for
its poor so you can actually drag around
any sort of actor on the screen so
they're not sort of a static background
they're actually just just classes
arranged to look like a sorry objects
arranged to look like a piano and this
is the key class which just looks for
keys being pressed on the keyboard and
plays the appropriate sound this pass to
its constructor okay so it's not a lot
of code no so the complexity is actually
see this possibly awesome i break the
complexity is actually we're using to be
manageable dessert lol you guys share
quite a bit of code between greenfield
and blue jay as well because this editor
yes the same exactly the editors the
same day is in fact there's a lot of
code shared and in fact to be to be
precise there is a full blu-ray running
underneath greenfoot and that is just
for practical code reuse purposes Peter
program joined us as well okay to go /
Peter and I pedia um and it's actually
that's another thing maybe you know the
editor here you know we've got this we
go scope highlighting so this this
coloring scheme that ultimately shows
you the the scope set colors you know
methods in one color if statements and
other loops in another and and that
comes out of the experience that one of
the biggest sin tax problems of
beginning colors at the beginning is
getting getting the brackets out of work
and so here if you know typically they
don't indent properly at first you know
then they always have one bracket too
many or too few and here if you get if a
bracket is missing suddenly you get
extra visual yeah you can get out
exactly you get used to that look just
sort of you know almost unconsciously
fairly quickly and also I've often
staring at that for a few weeks you know
what it's supposed to look like and if
you see something like this after having
used the editor for a few weeks you may
know this this looks wrong and then you
can see here that this if statement
actually reach
down to here and you can see well that's
not really what I meant let's put in
more opening ones oops yeah and so you
get and if you I put them on a different
line then you know you get this sort of
funny looking yeah so it's visually
obvious that realistic and so you ear
first of all you notice very quickly
that this is wrong and then it gives you
a clue also where it's wrong yes and so
this is now that's something so there's
some things in there even though I know
we are we are looking at a different
target group then then most other ideas
because we're looking at beginners and
other professionals and people have said
to us that actually some of those things
might actually be helpful in generic
ideas as well the other thing yeah we
always the old idea i used to work and i
was telling you about sheets and did
something similar for method variable
scoping because they were treated
fragments yeah the only problem is the
guys who designed it originally we're
all color blinds they thought a light
pink was the best color ever created for
coding so that was the background color
which most people cringe done so i just
opened up these two examples because you
know the asteroids of course is that's
popular with the boys they want to write
shooting games and i showed you the
piano just to show you know doesn't have
to be all shooting games or anything
anything you can think of where the
output is two-dimensional graphics you
can really easily do in green foot and
you see there's like the code is
actually there are fairly sure that so
um so we actually write some code that
might be might actually be most
interesting after all yeah we called it
hacking to me so I'll pass the mic over
again to one of you alright I've got the
empty turtle thing here
okay so we have a relatively empty
project to begin with with a turtle
which has no functionality so it has an
act method but there's no code in yes
others the oh how does the visual how
does a picture the image get associated
with the class okay done i think i just
created class you can talk about okay
yeah so as michael creates the class
here you'll see that you get this
dialogue which prompts you for both the
class name and yeah exactly okay you
still have the option of setting the
image programmatically as well of course
but this just defines the default image
that any object of that class will will
get so it's actually quite a neat thing
for students who can sort of take
ownership of a project just by actually
changing the image if you give them a
sort of pre-made we call them scenarios
but if you give them a pre-med scenario
then you know even if it's just a simple
game or something then they can actually
change the image or change the images of
the classes just to something else so if
you've got if you've got one bout citing
leaves they can change it to crocodiles
eating babies or something like that you
know whatever they want to do and they
seem to get some enjoyment out of that
as I said of a magical move one step
forward method to find it animal yes
actually I think oh actually it may have
a parameter I can't remember yeah I
can't remember how I did that so there's
no move without a parameter and we the
API is sort of slightly evolved over
time yeah
so in rudder it'll move okay so yeah if
we hit act then it moves one set of time
and once you click run then it
repeatedly moves and there's also a
speed slider down the bottom which
adjust the speed of the ok so the mod
bad simulation earlier had a grid that
was probably just the backgrounds was
drawn with a grid and move was the grid
wait that's right yeah so so the world
actually did you want to animal yeah the
it's not only the image I mean the it
was drawn on the background and it
doesn't have to be so it was actually
drawn on a background image but actually
you can define the cell size of the
world so that the world is always a
two-dimensional grid of cells but you
can define in every project individually
how big each cell there yourselves and
the one batter move map that some things
are relative to the salsa that's right
it's all in cells and here the the one
I'm we're looking at now has one pixel
cells they wombat had 60 pixel cells
okay and so often for really early
examples you want the bigger cells
because things are a lot more obvious
and then you can talk about neighbors
and things like that you know and then
once you actually want to do something
free form you can set the south sides to
want it yeah everybody and then you get
much smoother movement of course yeah
okay so yeah that that constructor has
three parameters and basically the first
two of the width and height of the world
and the last one is the cell size which
is it's always a square so it's 1 x 1
pixel
right so rather than moving while having
the the bugged actually turn so when
your honor just spins in a circle and I
presumably can do both here so with just
just a few simple commands and kids can
already get things moving around the
screen just do next statement okay so
peter has a question how young are green
foot developers typically and talk to
Peter I better uh that's a good question
I I guess we're sort of aiming it around
the age of 15 16 and I think that is
probably quite quite typical but we have
had reports certainly of even younger
kids using green foot uh I don't know if
someone else has got a better idea on
yeah so usually which sort of say sort
of aged aged 14 to 18 we have had sort
of people use it with slightly younger
kids of course that the main problem is
just sort of the syntax and getting used
to syntax requires a certain sort of
self discipline and patience that
obviously if you give it to sort of
seven or eight year old they're just
going to get sort of errors and get
turned off and go do something else so
sort of once they actually get to
teenage years so we still see it as a
follow on to things like scratch it's
not for the same age group but it's for
for later on when you want to move up to
full text programming you know greenfoot
could be your first experience of of a
sort of full-on programming rather than
sort of you know flow chart style
languages or things like that I just use
the mic level here yeah so so greenfo
obviously comes with an API so we've
seen the move in the turn there's also a
get mike level and so now if we shout
loudly at it well then the object moves
so you know just try to give simple
methods for forgetting input in we've
obviously got
a great way to have kids make noises
yeah yeah this is great for this is
great for a fairly early demo if you're
showing it and you've got a class
sitting there because they can become
active you know they can shout out and
they Keller they can either get some
influence on it um actually what I'll do
now is I'll just take five minutes to
fairly quickly cut through some things
and you can talk about it talk over it
while I do that so it'll be like mystery
coding I don't know what he to know
right but well as he goes like sports
commentating for hacking so says it's
got metals furred having input so we've
seen the mic level one there's also
obviously message for keyboard so it's
actually a static method of the green
foot class and you ask about a
particular named key so you can sort of
say a in quotes now tour by the a key
left here is the left cursor key and so
this allows you to quickly knock off
some code to do with turning based on
the keyboard presses so it always moves
but as you press left or right on the
keyboard then you're actually sort of
turn and so you get this sort of
playable character that you can steer
around the screen and it already
suggests sort of obvious extensions if
the kids want to start altering it so
rather than always moving you could have
move be controlled by an up and a down
where up moves forward down with
backwards they get the idea that moving
a negative amount will will move you
backwards so sort of by having a fairly
simple clean API you can already sort of
work out things to do with it here the
a12 edge method that we're using in the
turtle actually comes from from animal
and it obviously just checks if see the
object has reached the edge of the world
so when they reach the edge they ran
turn until it's sort of sufficient to
have moved them off the edge of the
world so now you've got some sort of
turtles which are moving autonomously
and we've got our bug which which we're
controlling manually and then the next
step is to actually make the the objects
interact so this is something that for
this important in object
yeah so so Michaels having codes Lee or
a pair of programming session so we go
to look at their see if you see the bug
instead so mostly interesting things
from green foot scenarios come from
object interactions which is also
important concept in object orientation
the ability to sort of have a reference
to another object to call methods on the
other objects that's something which
which greenford can help teach so what
recorded now is is look if the turtles
energy see I they're sort of touching on
screen if the turtle sees the bug then
it will eat all objects of the the bug
class so you can see we're using the
standards of the java mechanism for
spotting there the class of bug there's
also message playing the sound so now
when we do the eating there will
actually be a sound played so when the
turtle runs into the bug it will
disappear the bug and also play a sound
hell so that's just a sort of pre
provided cell with the scenario you can
also record your own sounds in green for
there's a built-in sound recorder for
for sort of customizing it so it's
fairly easy as you see to add new and
classes into into green foot as say
they'll always usually be either a world
or an actor you can have multiple worlds
for doing things like level one level
two different levels and games but
almost everything else is an actor so I
was wondering how you save the state so
that lets you save the world stay yeah
so this is very similar to the genius
method recording that we saw earlier so
when you've sort of clicked and added
some objects if you click save the world
it just writes the code so rather than
save it in some mysterious binary blob
it just writes the code that will
recreate the world so adds a prepare
method a call to the prepare met at the
end of the constructor and it just does
all the object creation and adding the
objects to the world so if you want you
can now edit that code or later on you
can move objects yourself and resave the
world and that will sort of adjust the
code accordingly so that gives a nice
way to sort of show them how to make
objects in the world and I sort of you
know having it generate the code for
they can do it manually and then then
see what the code looks like for that so
they can learn a bit from that so this
is also the one of our common
introductory examples so we have sort of
a playable character and we've got sort
of a predator than will try and eat you
and then you've got some seafood you can
do you have to learn it he'll and so
that becomes your objective you've got
to avoid the thing that's trying to eat
you and try to get all those with you
before yeah yeah this HAP's a few too
many turtles ffs losing a little bit
tricky oh they quicker than me too yeah
yeah I think that was your choice though
okay I can book us being able to program
now now they're slower than you now you
can add easy mode I can do it now very
cool so um we got we got a couple
questions while that was going on okay
so Russell commented that there's more
syntax than Python turtle and then
mentioned something about groovy robots
I'm not quite sure what he's referring
to maybe he's thinking that Ruby Ruby
and other stuff to be yeah it's also
text water the that's were the one thing
that was important to us is that this is
standard Java you know so we we did not
modify job at all it's the standard Java
C compiler Stern Show vm and so it has
the full Java syntax and technically
that's not the easiest language um so I
guess the whole point of blue giant
greenford is teaching people real
programming exactly so just program with
objects and never actually see the code
yeah exactly that's it's sort of
typically when when they start in
schools now a lot of schools are using
scratch for example where you get some
object concepts without actual textual
syntax where you have this drag and drop
block languages and then so they do that
first I get a bit of an idea of of logic
of objects and then this is the next
step where we actually want to teach
them
which with full syntax we want to get
them to then expand their concepts but
also it's a stepping stone into
professional programming environments so
at some stage we want them to see the
same thing yeah no I should i started my
daughter while she's i know but she's
done a little bit of scratch and she was
actually she was at the when you around
the bay area for the oracle a bunch of
the two day workshop yeah although she
ended up on the alice okay
coincidentally but yeah Alice didn't
really show you the code by default it
was all visual programming yeah yeah
this is this is more like what I've
actually want her and get her started on
what you say old yeah so this is this is
different age group you know things like
scratch or Alice you can go down to
eight year olds or so you know they can
do that so 82 typically we talked to the
scratch team they say typically sort of
8 to 14 or so of their target group and
then be kicking after that we say you
know 14 upwards and then actually
there's no ceiling to the top because
it's full Java you can make it as
complex as you like yeah but it also
depends on the individual I was doing
Pascal oh yeah it clearly is when we say
14 if that is if you have an average
school class there ya know if you've got
a bright kid who has a talent for it you
know you've seen 11 12 year olds do it
you know that's with a full school class
of average children it wouldn't work at
12 for us so 14 is hours of conservative
boundary but but for you know really
interested motivated individuals you can
go a bit lower ok Russell commented that
scratch has problems because it's small
talk based and teachers are would prefer
something python-based well in scratched
you the implementation is in small talk
but you never see the small how you see
from user point of view it's got it's
entirely own language which is this
block drag-and-drop block based language
you know this is great because it's
actually real plain old java code yeah
so this is this is we see that as the
stepping stone in the middle between
these block based languages and
something like eclipse you know so you
go through something like this way you
still have the
model of this micro world that you're
programming and you still have very
instant gratification you know you get
animated graphics on screen within the
first 15 minutes but you are starting to
learn in a real java yeah that's very
cool and um let's see the other question
we have was Peter different topic but
he's wondering whether use the Java
sound API for the mic level stuff you
were showing yeah we do use the Java
sound API and well the the green for
sound cody's is quite complex just
because the the sound seems to behave
completely differently depending on
which platform you're on that sounds
like you've worked in some of this code
Pai oven so we've got a you know three
different platforms and and there's
differences between openjdk and the
Oracle JDK as well which you have to
take into account but it does seem to
work originally well now on love you
have you tried playing this is also
Peters so I can have the questionnaire
you try play with a webcam at all no
have enjoyed that uh all right yeah let
Michaels behind the camera here setting
up an attack so yeah we we do have an
interface well there's a little bit of
custom software which we sort of serves
as a layer between the connect and green
foot which which Neil wrote and which
can do some some pretty nice things but
we haven't used the it's actually not
part of the cool api user to access web
games is it the media media layer like
I'm not even sure but yeah there's
there's some Java media input support
but it's not standard it's it's a
separate package that's not that well
maintained anymore right yeah so we
haven't really looked at that at all ok
ok and we have somebody else I can't see
names but by twitter ID it's your ex and
wondering if it's possible to translate
method names to other line
is for kids without knowledge of English
okay uh no i mean the green foot api
just like the Java API is you know a
standard API I mean I understand the
question and the point of the question
it would be nice if we could do that in
some ways but what they're using is a
standardized system what we do have is
translations of the javadoc okay our
wealth is at least one translation to
tell you I resources vallejo ice is in
eight languages and and that's what
their DUI interface also has several
possible languages so it's just the
object class names on the code which is
the API or in English yeah and if you
wanted to I mean there's only six green
foot specific classes so if you wanted
to create your own subclass of world you
know which was monde and then sort of
you know have rapper methods that were
named in French they had the same
parameters you could you know there
could be a sort of work around to do
that so maybe I'll just talk to a bit of
what Michaels doing so what we've got
hooked up here at which you can't see it
it sort of sort of where the camera is
so you can see see my dad says that's
working out so there is a a connect
device which is Microsoft input
peripherals that they originally
developed for the xbox so it's just a
sensor bar Stephens holding up there so
you can get them for about a hundred
dollars or that kind of price range and
you can play xbox games with them as
well so they have a USB connection and
people hook fed up to pcs as soon as
they could and started developing
drivers for it there is an official yeah
microsoft sdk for it now we don't use
that because Greenfoot being java we it
runs on windows mac and linux so we use
a set of sort of open-source drivers
that will also run on those three
platforms not just on windows so as
never mentioned we've just got a little
layer that set up to green foot
then you can actually take the the feed
from the video camera you can either
show the video or what the connects is
mainly known for is the tracking of
joints so this stick figure that we've
got on screen there is actually sort of
reflecting Michaels movements and this
is just a sort of simple little example
that does painting so wherever his hand
is sort of is in green foot it paints a
yellow dot and so we're not sort of
particularly outside the green frame
work here the we've still in a world
there's actually basically an actor
that's acting as no valet that we're
we're sort of painting on s'okay should
expand it gestures with a left hand and
right hand yeah so different ones have
slightly different customizations but it
seems real cool that you paint with your
right hand when that's sticking outwards
but you change color by is it raising
your foot in this version but yeah in
fact in left hand up it raises the
screen yep and right foot up change the
color but because I'm my foot is behind
the table it's actually got trouble
tracking the foot it something yeah so
it's we're not completely ideal for the
connect here with our table our sofa
arrangement but yes so the nice thing
about doing these sort of foot up and
hand up isn't it makes the code very
simple so we'll maybe just show the code
because the the Keating is not so much
using the Kinect I mean you can always
hook up peripherals it's trying to keep
the API simple enough that it's suitable
for beginners and that's where I think
we've we've managed to be successful
with the Kinect so that's the whole code
doing the painting yeah so what we've
got the code here the beginning we we
get an joint object which is the right
hand we then check if if the nearest
joint is a right hand slits and there is
joined to the Kinect camera and if so
then we fill an oval so that Phil oval
is part of the standard green foot API
for manipulating images so we've got a
mixture here to connect specific joint
bits and the green foot painting bits
and then you can see that so it's so in
fact you can start painting just by
pulling your hair
back away from the camera yeah and so
then the code for erasing with your left
hand up it's just a simple comparison
between the Y coordinates and so that's
that's why we're using these types of
gestures is for raised them as your home
oh yes that clear us a similar name for
your left hand is higher than your head
and raise your right foot above your
left knee and then you changed the color
quite quickly just a mother and it's not
flipping there yeah I guess whatever the
animation speed of the exactly so that
it runs it you know 30 frames a second
or so so while your foot is up yeah
while your foot is up there it just
changes and because that runs at 30
frames a second also you know it changes
quite a bit but because we just want
some random effect anyway that's good
enough for us for this for this demo
anyway cool I think we've been chatting
for quite a while maybe you should
actually be instead of randomly going on
think about whether there's anything
else that we should be saying and you've
seen that demo for the first time I
guess so yeah I'm the connect stuff was
rather cool actually I'd heard from
other folks who times your session about
the green foot blue jay session at
devoxx jealous yeah was one of the best
talks they'd seen oh thank you yeah well
that that will be recorded and available
on parlays yeah actually I was quite
happy at devoxx because for me that's an
unusual audience you know we I talk much
more often to teachers and educators and
devoxx in being a mostly developer
conference the developers are not my
usual audience and I was actually
wondering you know how how much interest
that would get because those guys are
not professionally involved in education
but there was a good to audience that
you had a good crowd they were good
questions and and that actually I think
there's telling us something that more
and more software professionals you know
computing professionals I actually
taking the initiatives and go into their
schools or run computer clubs or teach
their own kids so and I think that's a
really interesting thing
to do that you know because in many
countries at least here in the UK and I
think it's similar in the u.s. maybe a
lot of computing teachers at schools
have no computer science background and
they actually like it if professionals
come in and help them out of it and so
that's you know we try to give them some
tools that they can take into schools ya
know and I I think lots of technology
people are also interested in like you
said spreading the word with their
schools yeah I be found that in Las
usergroups another several years it has
really it's a visible movement one of
one of Stefan's calls to action was to
for all of the Java user groups to
consider running a dev ox for kids event
yeah that box for kids is the event they
ran right before devoxx they did one in
flemish one in french in belgium to get
injuries kids to bargaining and they had
robots and they had programming
environments and little lab projects for
them to youth like a mindstorms but
that's I think that's was it it's a
fantastic thing to do it's a great
initiative and we'll see that next year
we'll get involved in that as well well
I can't do French or Flemish but yeah
but I think his call to action was
having all the user groups in their
respective countries and languages do
something similar yeah I know they'll
dig up the brand yeah yeah burn with use
and I know that at least the London guys
in there and drive a community they've
talked about it now they might take that
up yeah and that's a language I can
manage that yeah and better more Taylor
fairly good at that sort of stuff I'm
sure they'd be happy to yeah yeah I'm
actually looking forward to to getting
more involved with it I think that's a
great great thing to do they've getting
people who actually know how to do stuff
and the kids together yes it's a good
idea all right so let's let's close out
with um maybe some some upcoming stuff
you guys are planning to do or
conferences or other places where you're
going to be showing this resources from
where they can get this maybe website
sir places you like them to see and any
closing comments or calls to action you
guys have okay so should we start by
showing the the websites may be so there
is first reverse places to go home
reserves afterwards so if you just
google for green foot or green foot org
saying you'll find our website so we've
gotten there actually one of the
features we haven't mentioned this that
in green fill itself as a share button
in the interface for a green foot and
what that allows you to do is actually
take the scenario you've written and
upload it to our website so it's a bit
like we sort of refer to as YouTube for
the green foot scenario so all the
scenarios you can see on the right hand
side of the website they're just ones
that people have developed in the
interface just hit that share button and
uploaded it to the web sites this uses
Java applets to show a a sort of web
version of the same scenario so it
should behave exactly the same it's just
that obviously you don't edit the code
on the website that's that's done in the
interface welcome to Java outputs yeah
so so that's just to mention we've got
on the website we've also got the
download so green foots free open source
it's Java so run anywhere you've got
Java and a half of our USB stick yeah so
we've got this standalone one that sort
of bundles at a jdk in there so that you
can actually you don't have to install
Java particularly useful for schools
we're installing things is perhaps a a
bit of a difficult thing to do so we've
got a standalone version for Windows you
can just run straight off the stick but
the documentation section there we've
got tutorials so that's sort of similar
to the turtle example we were doing
we've obviously got the Javadoc we've
got a whole series of videos called the
joy of code which michael has made which
is sort of how many you got to 10 20
hours of video now something like that
taking you through from the very first
thing of installing Greenfoot up to sort
of doing you know things like collision
detection or more advanced scenarios
we've also got green for hooked up
taveras peripheral so we showed you the
connects there's also a few cents aboard
sir robot things like connecting to two
game pads or for the American audience
this material for doing AP with with
green fluid or adjoining mess with green
foot so we've got a whole series of
resources on our website for people to
take it further there's also a textbook
which has been published which you can
use to to do green foot on the very
front page there's a the bottom of the
link to the the green foot book we also
have a website called the green room
which is mainly intended for teachers to
give their material for teaching with
green foot but if you are sort of
interested in doing a you know and after
school club or things like that then you
can always just get in touch and we can
sort of sort you out an account on the
green room so that you can then have
sort of teaching materials for for using
with green for so things like slides
quizzes examples assessments there's a
whole variety of things on the green
foot site generally contributed ISIL by
Ozil by teachers or academics who've
sort of developed a resource and share
it so that others can use it so that's
our sort of web tools for Blue Jays
we've also got a website and as a blue
jay textbook which is quite popular so
that's how a lot of people and get into
blue jay so blue jade org or just just
google blue jay answers a bit of
information on there as well again Blue
Jays open source and free runs on Java
so run everywhere so that's a lot of
information so upcoming things I guess
will we tend to go to a lot of education
conferences so we'll be at the 6e
conference in Denver next March for you
talking a bit about Blue Jay and green
foot there we've got a project coming up
to do data collection with Blue Jay so
we're currently adding to blue jay says
it's a lot like the sort of cliffs usage
data collector things like that try and
actually track how people are using blue
j to learn programming for things like
Davin's error message we're hoping to
collect data so that we can actually see
which error messages give people
problems how long it takes them to fix
it to try and get ideas on on how we can
improve the error messages so that's a
sort of big upcoming project for our
sister so it blew it up so it sends back
a lot of usage information so that we
can then hopefully perform analysis and
get all the research is to have a look
and see what they can make of it as well
you want to close up yeah anything we
haven't covered that you if you stills
on your mind no no I think that was a
great introduction a bunch of guys in
the stream really liked the demo and
walk through and they they mention them
i try it out with their kids now that's
good that's good that's always the great
starter start to start at home and then
branch out to your user group yes little
schools and universities yeah actually
sometimes we've seen it carry it into
the school through a kid just someone
starting it with a kid the kid telling
the teacher it's something they're doing
doing it with your own kid is always
always a good thing actually I used my
kids as guinea pigs as well so I've got
two daughters and I got them to do
greenford very early too just to find
out where the major problems are yeah
they're struggling I'm sure he learned a
lot in them that you wouldn't have
normally picked up on essay as a season
for grammar so yeah that's what kids are
full cool alright well thank you thank
