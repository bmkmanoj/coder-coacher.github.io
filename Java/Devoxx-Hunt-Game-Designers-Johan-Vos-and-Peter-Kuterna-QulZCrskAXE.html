Network and I'm here today with your
hand and Peter yes to talk about the day
box hunt and how it's built was built so
Johan tell her you've built which part
of this of this new game for this game
have built the back end which is using a
java ee 7 technology it's built on top
of glassfish for that one and we're
using lots of Java 8 ap is like streams
and lambdas and so and the back end part
that's what we've created in 2 Peter
tell us about your experience of
building them the Android app so i built
the android app it's an android app we
need bluetooth low energy so it's only
he's available on devices for 23 in
higher so it's a rather limited but
we're here to take a conference so
mostly people are already having the
latest OS software of android on their
phones so that it's not normally an
issue for us and basically what we try
to do is we try to keep as much as
possible a first offline on the device
because people don't have always working
internet connection on the venue or
outside and then as soon as we get
connectivity changes we figured sinks to
the server and then the service tells us
you got these achievements or he's
always right this guy so what were some
of the challenges with the backend to
build such an application well one of
the things is you never know how many
people will participate in the game can
be a few people can be many people so
you have to build for scalability but
also keep into account that its own that
might be another real success so that
only a few people play with it so
scalability is definitely an issue but
good enough with the java 7 technology
and we're running on
I'm some ec2 infrastructure using
DynamoDB for storage and that scares
very well and glass piece of course
scales very well as as well so
scalability without knowing what will be
the requirements that's often orbit
think yeah we're okay performances of
course also important we want a fast
responding application and the
conflicting requirements are often while
the clients phones want to have the
information they want to have I did
something I detected the beacon now give
me immediately my current school and my
current ranking because that might
change you might be the leader after a
detection and so we had to do some lots
of synchronous processing and also lots
of a synchronous processing so we have
to try to find the balance and I think
so it worked pretty well we have the
balance between responsive application
and still doing the required
computations before we return an answer
okay so some question to you what were
the biggest challenges with the content
and the biggest challenges what I always
like to do is for such a project is to
try out new technologies so basically
what we have used in the android
application behind the scenes is is also
X Java so to do it's an easy framework
library to offload everything from the
main threat and do it in the background
like the communication with the backends
processing of blurring images that we do
on the separate threads so that we can
have the note those nice animations on
the UI tatum that they are not
influenced by networking operations on
the back end that's one part and the
other part that's always I'm most
difficulties to have a when you have
local data that is not in sync with the
server that you get in sync later on and
that you don't lose the data that's
always a tricky part it's also difficult
to test
so what do you do for that you store it
locally on the device sorry stories
first locally in a simple signal lights
database and then as soon as we get
connection again with the server we
gonna see how many beacons did we detect
that we're not yet sync with the server
we put them in a nice request we sent
them back to the server they come back
and only if that is okay we're gonna
clear everything in the local database
again and sync our achievements
afterwards so that everything is nicely
synced with the back end so will this
all of this project be open sourced or
available for duplication I I would very
much like to open source it on purpose
we didn't open source it before the
conference because while we did it with
a small group of volunteers in a limited
time frame and I'm although we use HTTPS
for example for security there might be
some backward engineering possible so
it's people look at the code during the
conference and at this conference there
enough geeks around that I do it they
might find some ways to to automate like
yes to automate the detection of work is
for example exactly so that's what we
wanted to avoid but apart from that I'm
as you know i'm all for open source so
yes if it's a michael we're going to
make this open source great so that
would be fun for the people to to create
their own games thank you so much for
talking to us today thank you
you
