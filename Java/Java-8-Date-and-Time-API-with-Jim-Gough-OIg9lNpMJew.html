community I'm going to introduce the
Java rate date/time API so just briefly
going to go through what dr. jsr is and
why I was involved in this in the first
place and we'll discuss what's already
in Java 7 then we'll look at some new
things and what how you work with
date/time some parsing and formatting
examples how you can interoperate with
Java util date and then we'll look at
some advanced queries as well and I'm
part of the JCP group on the ljc
that was elected on to the JCP committee
around three years ago now the JSP is a
mechanism for standardizing technical
specifications for Java so this is one
of the this is one implementation that's
gone through the JCP process to to reach
its final state we launched a initiative
called adopts GSR this was the pilot for
adopter Jetta and the program generally
is to encourage members of the Java
community to get involved with jr's
it's also to evangelize jr's to the
wider community in order to increase
participation and you can still find the
project on job net so Java date is in
the language right since the beginning
of launch of Java and you know what
there's many good discussions about what
was wrong with the current
implementation that you can go away take
a look at and some of those is you know
the things things are mutable and date
is actually really a date time and
they're also the classes for sequel so
there's a mixture of date times dates
for sequel times for sequel
there's no timezone support and it's not
easy to use things got a little bit
better when we move to calendar but you
still had it was still mutable you
couldn't format date directly and you
know performing arithmetic operations in
terms of how humans would specify things
in terms of something is two months away
from now wasn't wasn't clear or it's
easy it's quite tricky to get that
correct so Steven I've got a bit of a
question for you here which is an
example from Java one in 2008 how many
bugs can you find in this date time code
how many bugs
Lanyon - only a few lines
okay well if I could remember the
constructor for the day hi
I probably would be able to find a bug
in that but offhand I can't remember the
order of the parameters that's cool so
I'll skip on and show you that there's
actually six bugs in this code I am
browsed yes it looks it looks like on
the face of it it's quite a quite
logical thing to do but you know in this
in the state constructor here you've got
2007 actually the way that des
constructor works is it's an offset from
the year 1900 so this would be 1900 +
2007 to get to get the date and this is
actually the the month here as well is
12 and in date construct - that was 0
indexed so that would actually be an
invalid month to be out of range 11 is
how you specify December in terms of
timezone got get timezone this is
actually not the ISO specification of a
timezone it's got an arbitrary
underscore in there as well to split
things up and you've got a new Gregorian
calendar here you can't actually create
a new Google in calendar you have to use
the instance methods on there which
makes it very difficult to sort of unit
tests and to mock out and then you can't
format directly calendar object you have
to convert it to a dealer and then
format it so this is an example of a few
things that were tripping people up
consistently so we're going to go
through the basics there's new packaged
in Java 8 called Java time and we now
have proper objects for representing
date and time separately and together
and so a local date is just a date that
doesn't have any time attached to it
simply a 29 for the 9th 1984 which is my
birthday and a local time is just a time
13:32 a doesn't doesn't have a timezone
attached to it and it's just just a time
a local date time is actually a
combination of local date and local time
and his own date time actually starts to
bring timezones into into the mix as
well so let's skip to the IDE I've got a
few examples here that we'll go through
I was some unit tests here to sanity
check that what I show you is is isn't
true and so how do you create a new
local day the first thing I did when I
picked that this was gonna local date
and actually that's that's not
and everything that we use in in Java
date time is it's based on factory
methods so if we we'd actually do this
and local day off it's a very convenient
it's got like what you'd expect you've
got year month and a day of month that
you can specify and you'll notice it you
can actually special specify the month
as an integer or as a in enum month so
in this example we're going to Henry the
eighth's birthday so that was the Year
1491 the month was due and the day was
the 28th so that gives me a very easy
local date and not specifying anything
else that can now be used in coding and
understood quite quite simply so what
about a local time well again you'll see
that a lot of the Constructors for
making these things are consistent so
we're using off again and this time I'm
just going to use 1350 watt and which is
again you've got our minute hour minute
and second or a minute second in
nanoseconds this is an additional level
of accuracy that's been introduced into
the 310 API said nanos so it just gives
specify 51 we don't need to go down to
accuracy so now what about a date time
so again so be to be too repetitive but
this is actually and this is quite nice
when you when you get it at IDE as well
as quite nice for the autocomplete
everything's named nicely so here we're
just going to do a combination of the
above so you'll see that you can go
pretty much left to right and things
increase in terms of their accuracy so
we can use 1491 month June 28th
13:51 and we find out that I'm not using
that property and and then actually well
would you want to specify that if you've
got this stuff and you can actually do a
local date time from actually do I mean
from I'll just quit Val I still mean of
and we could just do here get Henry's
birthday and get sample local time so
that's another way that you could just
combine
so the odd method really is how you
would go about creating a a date time so
what if you've got a local date time and
you want to convert it to a local date
so if we do this let's just create a
local date time and then we can do this
now so this is really simply how you
just get what is right now and and then
we can just do here two local date so
you've got the conversions here so you
can convert things through to easily
convert between the two different types
and we'll go into some more of these in
a bit but to local date will all work
for now so here I want to get the
difference between a zoned time in Paris
and London so we could do a zoned date
you can if I get so it's own date time
and again we can use off and actually
let's use now and then do with and this
is where I'm rusty so I'm going to use
my autocomplete to take a look through
what have we got on here so this would
be a nice time to actually go through
what we have
so we've is a temporal adjuster and
we'll go through that in the short walks
it's a bit of an advanced concept we've
got until so you can measure time
periods as well and what I actually want
to do with this
is find a way to use my zone how is it
actually in this now method hold on
okay this is why skip to my notes Claire
forgotten oh yeah okay Cicely Paris this
is why I was looking for and here I
could just specify my son-- so going
back to what we had and previously you
specify it in the ISO format so we've
got Europe slash Paris and then we'll do
the same for London and we cheat and
just copy and paste that and switch this
round so we've got London and London
here so now we'll just find the
difference between Paris and London
we just Paris - London cool let's just
run those unit tests and make sure that
I haven't done anything silly
ah I have because it doesn't go file so
here I just really want to find the hour
so I can do get hour and these get
methods are really convenient on these
objects you've got pretty much you can
get absolutely anything off there makes
it very easy to read what you're trying
to do so if we just rerun those tests
with hopefully the co compiling this
time and we should see that there
they're all green phew okay so let's
just switch back to the slides and
because now I want to talk about working
with date and time so just basically
gone through some very simple I bits
pieces you that's how you're going to
create date times from from now on in
the new in Java rate which is to use
them and in so we've got a call top for
about instant duration and period so an
instant is actually probably the closest
thing to java.util date when you do a
new date you get effectively a
millisecond value of where you are from
1970 from the epoch an instant is
exactly the same thing it's just a point
in time on the time line and a duration
is a measure of time so you can take one
instant to another instant and say
that's fifty four point five seconds and
so that's just purely time-based and a
period is different because it's a it's
kind of it's based on like what we would
perceive as human so we'd say we be
likely to say and five days time
one I'll meet you in the pub in five
days time is probably a reasonable thing
to say as opposed to X number of
milliseconds from now so this kind of
period to forget allows us to interact a
bit easier with the API it's also the
difference is quite subtle but important
when working with zone date/time
operations so period will use and
details within the chronology they are
using and for most people that'll be the
ISO chronology which is the standard
date/time calendaring system and so if
you put the same amount of five days in
seconds and it was going over a time
zone then you'd get as I going over
daylight saving then you might lose an
hour whereas if you put a period that
would resolve and a Java dot util that
actually mentions close to instant and
it the in Java rate is how it got a new
method on it which allows us to be
compatible and it you just use to
instant on there to convert that into an
instant and then from there you can
start using the the new API so I've got
some second examples here which will
start to explore just working with these
so I'm just going to run my unit tests
to check that everything fails and they
were all compiling so start from
something that we know is not completely
well it's not it's not completely broken
and so let's just say it's today after
tomorrow and so we could create a local
date and today and we'll just use local
date now for that and then if we want to
create a local date for tomorrow then we
could do the local date and specify and
the exact date for tomorrow but we can
actually do today dot and there's these
convenient methods on here plussing -
india so in this case we just want two
plus plus one day on so we could do this
and then we could to test if today's
after tomorrow we can then say and we
could check tomorrow is after today so
it's a bit a bit slow the other way
around of specifying things you could
also say
today is before tomorrow so these
operations that we were talking about
that it allows you kind of easier access
without having to go comparing
milliseconds and say is this milli is
this value in R or milliseconds less
than this and we can also use so if we
wanted to find the last day of the month
this is again something that can differ
depending on like what month you're in
obviously February 28 days others are 31
and 30 so we can use a temporal adjuster
and I mentioned this briefly when I was
panicking earlier so if you do a let's
just say we want to find the last so the
day of week in the month so we do local
date say now and then we can say with
and then there's these temporal the
concept is temporal adjuster and you can
implement your own but in this case
we've got a temporal adjusters which
actually gives us loads of handy things
that you want to do date time so we just
say last day of the month in there and
now we've got our local date we can
actually just say get day a week and
that's just going to go to take take the
time now and then the width will move
that date on and then the get dev week
will get that date out so now we're
going to talk about the period class
that I was mentioning earlier so how
many days is it until the longest day of
the year so if we do our local date
today and that's local date dot now and
and then if we do
take our longest day and then we could
do this of well actually let's do it
let's do the let's take to jet today and
adjust it so we can do today live and we
can say with undo month dot June and
then we can say dot with day of month
and do 21st cup so that's our longest
day and then what we could do here is we
could do period dot between and then we
start date is today and then we'll go
for our longest day so and from here do
we want to do get days so you've also
got on this period method you know you
can we could actually say we want to get
the number of months the years again
it's quite nice too you can see this
stuff very quickly when you kind of hit
the dot oh yeah these are all things
that I could do with that
so this case we want days now here I've
got to date time zones I've got one for
Los Angeles timezone and one for Europe
London and what I want to do is see
duration how long is it until the new
year so I could do duration again dot
between and I set here and GMT new year
okay and just to wrap round things off
if I wanted to if I create a new date
this is the old Java and Java 7 way of
creating a date and then we've got this
to instant method that I was talking
about and then the thing to remember
about a to instant is it's going to be
in a particular time zone now with that
you can do system default if you if you
don't care if you did care you can
actually specify a time zone here and
then from here you can do to local date
so this would be the standard way to
convert to from Java util dot date to
local day okay so I'm just going to
quickly run this up and make sure that
we've only got this last test failing I
haven't done anything and silly
what are they done with the test
duration so ah yes so this is one of my
intentional issues that I've left in
you'll see here that what I've done is
we've this tends to happen sometimes
with when you're trying to test date
times now and you would say I've got
time now and I've got some time I want
to measure what's happened between it it
might be you measuring some time for a
tried to go through anything whatever it
happens to be and actually what I'm
doing here is is wrong I'm doing similar
kind of thing as what I'm saying now and
then in future measure difference but
there's I can never make this test work
because it's always going to rely on the
time it takes to execute so what you can
actually do is when we did the dot now
in the in the in second example here to
create this you can actually specify a
clock and the clock all methods would
now take a clock and the idea with that
is that you can you could put the system
clock in there for a standard for this
for your actual main code but then in
your unit test you could put a clock and
you can fix the time to what you want so
you can actually start to mock the clock
you know if you've got code that's that
complex then this is what you do so for
now I'm not going to address that in
this test I'm just going to comment that
out and cheat a little bit and move on
to an example that's in a little bit
more depth so what what we're going to
do now is we're going to try and find
out given the months in the year what
are all the days and the last days of
every month so if I was if I was writing
this in in Java 7
the first thing I'd be doing is okay I
need to return a list so I'm going to
create my my dummy list and I'm going to
say that that's a new ArrayList I use my
diamond operator and why I said well how
can i to write over the month so i could
do for month month in and I can do month
get Valley Oak values okay and then what
I need to do then is to take a local
date and get it to the lat
day and then get the day of the week so
I'm going to create my local date and
we'll just call it date for lack of a
better variable name and we'll do local
date now and we'll adjust we'll adjust
it to the year so we'll take the year
that's been passed into the method here
and we're going to take the way to put
the month in as well which is the month
that we're doing in our in our for loop
and then we're going to use I'll just
put this on to the next line so it
doesn't go flying off the edge when you
use with and use our temporal adjusters
again like we did in the example above
to get the last day of the month and
then we want to do get day of week so
just to walk you through what's
happening here and actually that's a
good point that needs to be a day of
week I've gone too far so what I've got
is I've got my local date and I'm just
saying take one from now and adjust it
to the year that we specified give it
the month and then get last anymore
forget the day of the week so then
standard here we do list or add day
everybody's happy we return that list so
let's run that and make sure that
there's no schoolboy errors okay so
we're looking good but really if we're
starting to do things like this in Java
rate we've maybe not watching another
video on how to do lambdas so I will
just briefly discuss how I'd convert
this into a lambda expression so let's
just comment this and figure out what
we're going to do here so we've got this
list and we're creating a new one and
returning it or we can get around that
with using streams to give us our data
and just return the result out from from
there so we basically have to do the
iteration over so we need to get the
months so same as we've done in the for
loop and we're going to need to apply
basically a transformation to each item
and then we need to collect that into a
list okay that's doable so let's just
comment this out for now and we'll just
keep it we'll keep it here in case we
get stuck so let's say so first of all
we've got our month values
so let's say there's a cool thing on
streams if I guess fast streams probably
stream yep so cool thing on a stream API
which is just of now if you're using
collection so if you've already got an
ArrayList you can just do dot stream
here what we can do because it's a
primitive array because it Zenon we just
do month dot values so this now gives me
a stream to play it with which is kind
of cool and here what I'm going to do is
kind of going I need to apply
transformation while that sounds like a
map operation to me so I'm going to use
a map on this and it's a lambda
expression so what what are we doing in
each of these things and well we've
effectively got a month and to that
month we're going to apply effectively
what we've got here so let's just steal
this code so we're effectively going to
separate this out so it's not too bad
and remove the comment so we've got
local there not now same thing exactly
the same thing as above and and then
finally what we want to do then is dot
collect now so we were taking a stream
we've got our data coming through which
is twelve months we apply the
transformation and then we want to
collect it too and there's this cool
thing called collectors and this has
some really useful things to collect
things into we could just do doc collect
to list cool and I'll see we just want
to return that so looking at the
complexity we've removed all this boiler
pipe we've removed time to create a
empty ArrayList having to have these
four loops for really just thinking
about the data here which is exactly
what lambdas is intended to do so it's
quite easy to just refer to that and I
think it's slightly more readable as
well and if we run this hopefully we
haven't made any errors yeah there's a
bit nervous when it went Orange there
for a short time but that's it all tests
passed so it's a little bit more of how
you can use and what I didn't mention
was temporal adjuster is a functional
interface which is why this stuff kind
of works nicely as well
cool so I talked about java.util that
date or pausing and formatting
I'm not going to spend too much time on
this just to show quickly the features
of parsing and formatting so you've got
this class called date-time format it
and it's just one thing that does so
much but it's also got convenience
method on it as well because usually you
don't care too much about the format
unless you're receiving some file from
somebody that you can't go and hit if
they go it in the wrong format so here
which it's got the nice defined preform
at ISO date you can build a custom
pattern and I'll show a quick example of
that and all these all the objects like
like we could use local date Dolph and
local date/time dot of we've got a
format and a part so let's look at that
so you've got our formatting examples
here I will just run quickly the
supporting unit test as well and if they
pass we worry they don't cool so we just
want to format a simple date and we'll
use today
so let's do local date dot now and then
format and we'll use the ISO date-time
format it so it just due date time
format a dot I so that's it really nice
same thing with if we want to specify a
format we can do now edit format
date/time formatter and you can use this
of oops it's got it's got a bit carried
away off pattern and here I'm just going
to grab this pattern that I've got here
so the example I'm passing in is
month/day/year specified I think that's
the American style and one thing just to
note here with the with previous
formatted date-time format is that we
had all the format's date format is that
some of these letters have been changed
and that's not to annoy people it's to
bring people in light is to bring the
the API in line with the standards that
are out there for representing this and
so just be careful if you try to port
code straight over from a previous
formatter
and then this one you just got a local
day again and we could use a pass and he
because I'm just using I so again I
could just pass it a date string
hopefully now this just works yay
so this is again there's so much I could
go into but given time constraints
it's just worthwhile just showing these
things and you can actually if you're
looking at this before job right it's
launched you can go and see the Javadoc
for this now download java.net I think
it's on and and you can just have it
have a look even if you if you don't
have time to have a play and just be
aware of what what's coming up certain
ease makes life a lot easier okay and I
haven't got type of this which is why
that's just done that I just want to
talk about a few advanced examples and
so I landed in San Francisco Monday was
quite surprised that it seemed like
everybody was too busy to do stuff and
it's because banks and schools on
holiday and so I've written a few
examples here to try and interact with
the calendaring system for something
that's not already specified so to
example we've got Martin Luther King Day
and we've got the quarter of a year so a
lot of financial institutions you need
to know is it quarter one to three or
four for reporting purposes and that's
not something that's provided out the
box so I'll just quickly go through a
quarter of year I don't have I have
tests for these but I'm not going to
sort of code them up so you'll see here
that we're doing a query so this is
basically as saying we could take a date
and we can perform a query operation on
it and we can write that query to
basically be whatever we want I will
this new quarter of Year query here
let's just put this down so we can see
and and all I do is you it's got this
set it implemented temporal query
interface and you can basically return
whatever you want so that's quite nice
because if you want it to return a list
of something that was specific to your
business logic or business domain you
can do that
you can specify pretty much anything
while you can it's a generic and and
then here we've got so here I'm
overriding a one method in here which is
query
I'm expecting this to be a local date it
could be Yuka passing a time it would be
a local date from that temporal object
and this is this temp the temporal
concept is something that's kind of a
bit lower level is what kind of premise
the local date local time classes which
actually brings onto a really good point
if you think about when you use
ArrayList you normally use list on the
left hand side and ArrayList on the
right hand side of the assignment with
dates you use the concrete classes and
because otherwise you get into a world
of hurt and it's clear clearer what's
going on as well so first of all I just
take this and then I go okay well I'm
gonna write my logic now to say what
this is so I say now which is just what
this is an ecstasy might is before and I
take now and I create the month of April
and I say with day a month one and then
that just is then returning and it's the
first quarter its second quarter third
quarter four of course so I've added on
to I bolted on to the API something
that's important to me but if you didn't
care about quarters of years it would
just be bloat to the to the API and
which had to be careful with and this
one is to find the next Martin Luther
King Day
it's M Dunning the same kind of thing
it's used but using the query so I do
and I take a local date and do from
temporal again so I've got a date and
then what I want to do is I take the
current year Martin Luther King Day so I
get Konya Martin Luther King Day I pass
a year and then I say local date of that
year January the 1st and then I say this
is a cool day of week in month so you
just do free Monday and that takes you
straight straight to the third Monday in
the month you can also if you're a bit
if you didn't know what you were doing
when you're writing this last week you
can use something called next or same
nextdoor same day and that means you can
actually not know where you're landing
in a calendar and say if I'm on a Monday
don't go one further on and if I'm on if
I'm on any other day then progress so
you actually use that to logically
iterate over days that are in the
calendar which you might want to do if
you were going to go over something here
and
like some data and pass it back and then
what I do is I say I use the period pass
again so I say period dot between I've
got my date now or when's the current
Martin Luther King Day now a period can
be negative or it could be zero if
you're on the day and then there's these
handy methods of is negative and is zero
just to say you know all those is
positive as well so you can use that to
test without having to sort of use an
integer comparison and and here what I
do is I say okay if if it's negative or
it's zero so I'm on the day or before
the day has passed then I want to find
Martin Luther King Day in the next year
so I just recall my method might lift
King Dania and just increment the year
by one and then return it or otherwise
it's where we're between the third
Monday in the beginning of the year so I
just I do that so that's all code
examples I've got one of the things I
wanted to mention if you've got this far
and still listening you might like okay
well this is all really cool if you
using ISO date/time but what if you're
using like a another calendaring system
or maybe I want to write my own
calendaring system and you can do that
and it's all supported inside the API
and actually Oracle provides a bunch of
calendars for internationalization out
of the box and so the nice thing that
one of the hardest things about its API
when people say why why is this taking
so long list this is boxed and the stuff
is to write an API that supports the
majority of users that will be using ISO
date/time but then also make it so it's
it works and is workable for a bespoke
calendaring systems actually takes quite
a lot of thought and it takes a lot of
trials to get that right I think that's
where when people say why is it taking
so long you can sit down and have a
really long conversation about in the
pub until you drop off your seat that's
all I have thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
