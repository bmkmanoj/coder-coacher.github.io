of suffering from jennifer stern
arriving really late yesterday and then
showing him straight for four beers and
alcohol it's a great way to greet people
yeah why not so why don't you tell us
about some of the secrets of the the
java zone conference so this is this is
a really a really cool venue were edward
we're inside container inside and
contain their containers is the new deal
i would understand doctor and everything
so we had to buy some containers for you
for the night taking very very
appropriate yeah anything else which
you've changed up this year Oh almost
everything we were until three this
night working on everything so we have a
new main stage and a few other in and I
saw that I like to tweet my pictures up
for the nast and now you're out
yesterday it was a secret also revealed
sighs I guess a few thousand people have
seen it now so yeah tweet away yeah okay
yeah and we also have a new after party
concept in the main expert area if it's
that part of what's upstairs here no
it's the whole all venues whole venue
and we have in the main stage we'll have
a big in which in bands as well well be
but first we have all the talks that's
most important technical talks yeah big
bands yeah it is it has been a busy few
a busy year but a week to get everything
prepared yeah no I mean I'm involved in
all the conference organized
organization is co-chair for java one
and i can i can definitely feel although
oh so now everything is working so who
my heartbeat is going down slowly very
good at so um oh and also afterwards
there's a journey zone yeah the journey
song because you're joining in all right
yeah i'm gonna join it yes we will ride
on polar bear sits well
and yeah it will be awesome we let that
even in Norway technically because it's
so I think today it's our Island I think
I'm like geography it's not like that
why i think it is underwire of norway
yeah kind of yeah we like to treat our
speaker as well so so they come back
next year so that's why we do journey
zone we've been doing it for like six
years now and this is water what are
some of the other places you've gone
with the folks webuser been to glaciers
in northern norway and went to bicycling
rides over the mountains last year we
wasn't a big sailboat one of the biggest
sailboats in no way we have 50 people
climbing up and down and writing the
sailboat I was riding but you're not
sailing the boat so yeah that's a little
little perks of being a speaker yeah
coming over to Norway yeah we're
independent the driven conference we we
don't pay speakers instead we do give
them a tweet afterwards so we think that
fits with our fill of it's a good it's a
good it's a good model yeah bring things
open yeah and even the exhibition halls
really really nice i was walking i'll
send some pictures later there's a big
coffee stand behind us yeah we're in my
professional we had to treat our guests
well as well so we have an eight
restaurants serving food all day for all
the guests wow we can't go hungry so so
I heard there's a there's a Duke
somewhere yeah right outside the our
venue it's you who who drops little um
yeah yours for you have to go into beard
Java n 0 and write the code you guys on
the YouTube can't do it but that that
special deal for all people who are
actually making the conference look like
me and almost 50 50 other people and all
the speakers of course you will get to
beer yeah so so yeah in fact is also
very active and engaged organization
committee yeah we're almost 50 people
from all over Norway so more active and
I'm not than others but everyone chips
in okay so how does the content
selection work here because I've heard
I've heard some stories that you guys do
things a little bit differently yeah we
have a program committee with around 10
to 15 people
up once every month or every day when
they call for speakers ends and they did
together discuss and work work you out
the program so this year we had more
than three times as many submissions
them then we can fit in the venue so
tough to go through and actually select
the talks yeah pick the content yeah and
you do it like a like a group meeting
where you actually discuss and you yeah
they raised or mon topics and they take
every talk and then discuss for a few
minutes and then yes or no okay so we
had if we ended up with the list of more
than double the first round and then we
have to go round and round and round
whittle it down and pick different
sectors actually drop all the good talks
but we end up with a real good program
good problem yeah to have that you have
luxury problem yeah too much good
content to give it a talker there any
talks here particularly excited about oh
I don't know if I actually get to go to
the talks to have to just run around but
any talks you're gonna watch the
recording what's the first one you'll
watch the recording of oh let's see I
have what's mine I haven't actually
gotten time to look into this yes sorry
about that but I always like Tim
Berggren so okay so to whatever he'd
speak smooth I love is he thinking about
how I think I speaking about how we can
learn something from filmmaking yeah
yeah that was that sounds that I looked
at his talk and I almost consider
pulling minute for an interview yeah so
he's my favorite I've been to join
someone with him a few times also he's
it's a great guy a great speaker
exceptional if I can see one talk it
will be that one but I all trials watch
the videos we actually post the videos
within like a few hours of the talks Wow
but so that's really good right after
now I have to run and check if they're
posting the video and we're posting the
interviews yeah after the interviews as
well as greatly online immediately okay
