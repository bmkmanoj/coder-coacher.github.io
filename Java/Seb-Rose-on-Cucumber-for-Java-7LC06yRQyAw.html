the Java zone conference my name's
Stephen chin and I'm doing live
interviews with various speakers and
interesting folks all day today and
tomorrow you can watch them live at
night hacking calm and I am joined now
by sèvres how you done man I'm doing
well yourself cool and I'm well you
don't want to know how I'm doing okay I
don't want to know how you're doing
because i'm still trying to crunch on a
book deadline and my publisher wants me
to review copies and you didn't look
that stressed earlier yeah so you don't
know me well enough but um stress
visibly showing stress is not one of my
strengths good yeah so we want to chat
with back cucumber and behavior driven
development so um what would you like to
talk about so and at first like to talk
about how behavior driven development
doesn't have anything to do with the
tools so you mentioned before we went on
air that you were responsible for a BDD
tool back in the day yeah I built a
behavior driven development framework
for javafx what was it called jf extras
test basically the idea was it would
give you a way where you could kind of
specify your your story and then the
preconditions of the actual test case
and a slightly more fluent manner than
you get with like j unit or other
frameworks that it was it was designed
for um the old javafx scripting language
so there's an awful lot of BDD tools out
there yeah and a lot of people think if
they're using the tool or they're using
the given when then format then they're
doing BDD yeah absolutely if you're
that's what tools are for sure eggless
check out this video back though it's
okay we're done and and what I'd like to
what I say a lot when I'm talking at
conferences and meeting people is that
it's not about the tool so behavior
driven development by behavior it really
is underpinned by collaboration between
your business people and your technical
teams and you can do behavior driven
development without ever going anywhere
near or two so in the java space i don't
know
if many of the people watching today
ever read that wonderful book by steve
freeman and that price called growing
object-oriented software guided by tests
and in there although they don't call it
be DD they do something that's BDT as
far as i'm concerned that you just use
pure j unit wow so it's about making
sure you understand what your customer
wants give it getting feedback from them
discussing it with them and then
solidifying it using some form of
automation once you've finished the
collaboration yeah but i mean you know
having good tooling probably helps to
make it a little bit a little bit easier
to execute and maintain and keep the
test suites kind of you know clean
absolutely and so what we like to see is
once we've got our collaboration working
we're all working together nicely as a
team then cucumber means that you can
write things in business language using
a bit which is language and now your
business people can look at your test
specifications go yeah that's what we
meant and then you can even go one step
further and use those as your living
documentation yeah one of the other
things things most BDD frameworks do as
well as they um they make the test
results human readable as to 5342 out of
5400 tests have passed although Wade you
know a bunch of exceptions and stack
traces for the ones are still so clearly
I don't want to undersell the joy of
cucumber being author of the one of the
books on cucumber for Java and being
part of the cucumber team nonetheless
you can do it using our spec you can do
it using j unit if you put the
documentation into the names of the
tests well cucumber jabra that's the way
to do it but it's not necessary BDD is
about the collaboration about getting
the teams working together so that the
bits that nothing falls through the
cracks that we don't have to make
assumptions when we sit down and hit the
keyboard we actually know the examples
that need to be satisfied rather than
constantly having to either go back to
our business or make guesses mm-hmm well
that make sense and I'm you know that's
that's a very short way oh that's a
short message but that's pretty much the
whole message if you're not talking to
your customers if your customers aren't
reading your specifications
after you've written them then it's
probably not be DD because you're not
getting that feedback you're not closing
off that loop ya know so I mean that's
an interesting message I was chatting
with um Patrick the wall who's the UM
the founder of the DevOps movement and
so a lot of people now they think of
they think of DevOps as the the tools
which people use to accomplish DevOps
they don't actually think about the
human interactions which which are what
make up the development and operations
relationship and he was describing how
they actually like started DevOps how it
got kicked off and it literally was it
was about people and interactions it was
about applying the agile practices to
operations group so that they could get
the same like um benefits about
interactions and introspection and
looking at the way that you do their
processes and they communicate with
other groups and um if you're not doing
that if you're not looking at it from
like a people and zone process approach
then you're probably just checklist we
do DevOps and we're using these
containers tools and we're doing all
this cool stuff and if if you're lucky
you might be we've got a team that says
dev ops on the label and they do
infrastructure support but because we
call them Devils it's all okay night
yeah exactly so yep it's you know a
straight to to reduce every discussion
about technology to its the people
stupid but it's often the people that we
need to deal with this a culture is the
organization that we work within and
it's only once we've got some of that
well balanced and sorted that the tools
can really deliver any value so I've
been into lots of customer sites where
they've got cucumber Testone but written
by testers in ignorance on their own
nobody's ever looked at as soon as a new
requirement comes in they're all broken
they stop whole teams that are dedicated
to just keeping those running because
they've been structured so poorly no
one's quite sure what they're testing
anymore there's no value to having that
yep now that makes a lot of sense so I
think that's a that's a good message for
the listeners anything else you want to
and the cucumber for java book is
available from a store near you nice
nice very glad to have you on the
interview Seb thank you very much folks
who want to see the recordings could go
to night hacking calm where all the
recordings are posted and we're live
streaming today and tomorrow from javis
own and interact with us by tweeting
hashtag night hacking so thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
