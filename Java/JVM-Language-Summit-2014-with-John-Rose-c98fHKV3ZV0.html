Network and I'm here today with John
Lewis and John hi hi so John we are at
the jvm summit so what is what is
happening well i'm just enjoying the
company of a lot of brilliant colleagues
the the fun for many of us the jvm
language summit is the the most
enjoyable several days of the of the
year professionally because we get to
exchange ideas with with our peers from
oracle and from other parts of the the
java ecosystem so who is here give us an
example ok so for example we have
workers from facebook who are
integrating the JVM into their stack and
using it in very aggressive ways and
these are these are smart guys and it's
fun talking with them about what their
latest ideas are for using Java and for
processing the enormous amounts of data
that their company works with so I'm
tell us more about like the JVM summit
and the sessions yeah so the JVM summit
is we're in our seventh year of it and I
think this is the fifth year that Oracle
has sponsored it and what it is is a
small one-room gathering of JVM
implementers and language implementers
the intention of it is to give talks to
each other and figure out how we're
using the JVM to implement new cool
kinds of languages and programming
constructs and what the pain points are
and how to evolve the JVM to fix the to
fix those pain points so for example for
in previous years the invoke dynamic
functionality has been an important
topic and the design of invoke dynamic
owes a lot to the conversations that
we've had at summits in in past years so
any project this year's that you want to
talk about yeah yeah well it's
invaluable time to air out ideas that
that are coming that we think are good
aren't worth doing and check them with
the community and get there with all the
brains acting on some focusing on some
good topics the two things that we're
talking about at least Oracle other
people have their other really cool
ideas and we mix them all together but
two initiatives at Oracle our project
valhalla and project Panama and these
are two large container projects in
OpenJDK so they're open so people can
contribute to them and speak into them
and share their insights project gajala
is about among other things value types
which is the far the largest has changed
to the jvm type system that has ever
been done and will refresh the JVM and
make it more applicable to vectorized
hardware and GPUs and other other new
kinds of hardware that that wasn't
really significant when the JVM was
first designed and then project Panama
is a little bit more backward looking in
some ways it it will connect the JVM in
in new ways to existing legacy C
programs or that's probably unfair to
new C programs that have been written on
these new hardware platforms and which
the JVM doesn't currently have clean
access to so it's a so rather than
Valhalla is about internal changes to
the JVM to refresh it and make it more
applicable to today's hardware and
Panama is about an outward move where
the JVM can access other data structures
such as database data or foreign foreign
files so and all the talks and so forth
will be online afterwards right
everything will be online wonderfully
they we have videographers collecting
the the talks and the authors will also
be sharing their slide decks so as in
past years there will be a good record
of these talks we intentionally limit
the number of people that come to the
summit even though we have 10 million
Java programmers in the world
unfortunately that whole community will
not fit in a space where we can
all talk to each other maybe at Moscone
Center we can do a big one but the jvm
language summit is intentionally
designed to be small enough so that
everybody can fit in one room and a
person on one side of the room can
engage all the way across the room with
the other people in the room when a
speaker asks for comments he gets
comments from the whole room and
everybody can hear each other and you
can oh you can't do that with more than
about a hundred people wonderful thank
you so much for talking to us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
