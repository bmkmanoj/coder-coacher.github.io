Kirk I'm doing just fine how are you
doing good so last time we were together
spending a lot of time together it was
actually at my place yeah that was a lot
of fun do you put you kicked me outside
and gave me a whole box of stuff
extremely important work for the java
community can you describe I was picking
a raspberry pi out of box plugging it in
to all the necessary bits making sure it
worked fixing it if it didn't and then
repackaging it very nicely into another
little box exactly so you were warring
kits for a kids workshop yeah to teach
you know young children about how to do
java programming on raspberry PI's I
think that was it was it was a
unfortunately the only contribution I
could make to that event but I I hope it
was a useful one any also you also
survived my my younger daughter
Priscilla jumping on you she she tried
for by that restraint that was amazing
she tried her best to I don't know but
damage me and just about any way
possible but no she was great she was
great entertainment for the day okay so
speaking of people trying to damage you
I heard you at a pretty a pretty
exciting Boff last night Oh is a great
pop um whenever I go to these job events
I always like to hold like basically a
free-form open forum before you know
just bring your problems or whatever
what every day do you have and we just
sit down there and we try to make a
discussion about it see if there's
anything we can learn about different
things and so real a real birds of
feather session just get a bunch of
smart people and let's start yeah yeah
that's the root cause I don't know about
even it's real smarter just anybody
who's got something everybody can
contribute it you know and yeah just try
to get initiate the discussion but then
get out of the way or something like
that and that unfortunately didn't work
out so well last night because we got
into the subject with garbage questions
so some people started showing off for
the garbage collection logs which means
I had to do some GC analysis in
consulting very good yeah
consulting on your GC logs yes it was
it's a great idea i mean it's it's
really really fun it's a good
opportunity to for everyone to learn I
plans for that Samoan was there so I got
you know actually nice feedback from him
also cool and yeah there's a whole pier
was there there's a whole bunch of
people that showed up that or did you
guys come up with any insights or
anything but that you built a nice take
away from the discussion in the eye yeah
I think there were there were a number
of interesting things that we saw I mean
we had one guy had a memory leak in his
application he didn't know he had so
that gives us some work to do when he
gets back home there was some other
there was some other magic numbers were
able to distribute it to people to help
them understand exactly what it is that
they needed to do and I almost got fired
by calling telling my CEO that he was
actually wrong on a couple of things so
he doesn't like that when you do it in
front of people so much so they so he
was actually afterwards saying yeah I'm
going to be happy to give you the pink
slip good Belgian beers and everything
else unfortunately this one we didn't
bring beer and it's like my bad big
mistake yeah so so we did actually get
into looking at some of the benchmarking
I done with g 1 &amp;amp; 0 what sort of results
of you found I'm sure I'm sure like you
know given all the good things I've
heard about g1 you must just be seeing
this huge improvement in performance and
application of time and it's well let me
say I I had a little bit of help with
Pierre on this particular benchmark
which was really good because Pierre you
know just did a nice session on how to
fail at benchmarking so so we did
everything he said to fail no well
actually not to fail but we but actually
using some of the stuff you said to
actually set up a benchmark that was
actually able to measure overheads of
the different collectors so and really
for this nice big juicy been
mark CMS was still significantly better
than anything we can do the g1 and you
know we tried different configurations
with the g one straight configurations
just like recommendations and then
looking at the problems and everything
and and i think the the real takeaway
with the g1 is that you do need a lot of
spare cpu to actually make it a
reasonably good collector for your
particular environment so this benchmark
wasn't actually what i would call a
showcase benchmark for the g one but it
really was there to measure overhead and
it did its job we found like the two
really biggest sources of overhead we're
object copy costs and another thing
called remembered set refinement and and
and it seemed like whatever we did to
fix one aggravated the other and so you
go and fix the other one and it would
aggravate the first more memories of
refinement remembered set refinement
well I don't know how deeply you want to
get into it in this particular form but
essentially the remembered sets are
there to track pointers from specific
regions into other regions and so this
is this is essentially used to so that
when I'm collecting or doing our garbage
collection on a region I don't have to
scan the rest of the heat to find the
roots I can just go to these remembered
sets and see them right now when the
mutator threads are actually working
they actually have to inject data into
these remembered sets but instead of
injecting directly what happens they get
put into a queue and then there's
refinement threads that will go through
the queue and then not actually update
the data structure and it's it's as it
you know by nature it's a sparse data
structure so there's some funky graph
theory that gets that gets applied to
the whole thing that allows them to make
a compact data structure out of this
farce data structure but it comes with
some overhead when you do that and so
you know this whole process comes with
some overhead so and of course on
type of benchmark we were doing that
would take away from the throughput okay
so you you're basically in a constraint
system where you were using all the
available resources yeah well I would
say the benchmark was running very hot
in to intentionally so we're in a zero
sum gain so what we're looking at is
there's any reduction in throughput it's
because of what the garbage collector
was doing or if there is any
inefficiencies because of the code that
was being jit it you know the code
that's jaded is somewhat different when
you have the g1 then what you would get
when you have the other collectors total
time spent garbage collecting or like no
just total time it takes to clear a
workload total time to clear the work
loaded and just take train the garbage
collection is part of the that's part of
the job that's absolutely part of the
job absolutely okay so with all the
knowledge and performance tests against
deep inner workings of garbage
collectors which you know have you ever
considered writing the pepperdine
garbage collector no because I know a
lot about garbage collection and I know
it's something that I'm not clever
enough to even begin to start tackling
it's a very difficult problem your scope
and what you do I have a lot of
admiration for the guys who actually
write these algorithms because honestly
they're not trivial yeah not trivial at
all so cool what was good chatting with
you about your ball yeah about what we
were doing with kids and you know manual
labor assembling kept workshops that was
really fun and I look forward to
chatting with you next oh we're getting
heckled here whoa cackling okay so Oh
Stuart gave me a quote which I probably
shouldn't repeat this summary this
conversation is I gave you a raspberry
thank you very much I really appreciated
it all right tactic thank you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
