hi this is Tori we out with the Oracle
technology Network we're here at JavaOne
talking to members of the Java community
I've got Paul Sorenson here who's senior
director of the global certification
program hi Paul hi how are you nice nice
yeah it's great how's your Java one bin
no it's been great it's a great
conference issue okay so you're all
about jennife Java certification and I'm
just gonna put my developer shoes on and
go I know I'm good why do I need to get
certified well that's a great question I
mean that's a question everybody's
asking what should I do and with with
the transitions and the changes that
have happened with Java
you know what's we're all gonna do and
why is this important to me but if you
really look at the crux of the issue I
mean there there's a lot of opportunity
out there that that's the main reason
there are over three billion devices
that run Java and you see other signs
around to talk about the pervasiveness
of the technology and that's growing I'm
with home automation that's the big
thing around the corner and there is
going to be a lot of opportunity that
you're talking about homes individual
homes and devices in those homes and
Java is going to be the platform those
are developed on so the key with with
certification is you can it's an
endorsement from Oracle so you can get
an endorsement from Oracle that you meet
certain standards we credential you with
that that certification and you are
attached attached to that name I mean
that you're attached to to the the
technology and endorsed by a big company
that sponsors as a big sponsor of Java
wow that's really cool so if I'm
interested how hard is it how many I
have to take a hundred thousand classes
and it's gonna take me forever right no
it's not exactly that way but I wouldn't
say that it's easy I mean it's a tough
credential and we make it that way
because we want to make sure that it has
value once you've earned it so if you're
going to you'll present that credential
the people who you're presenting out to
the companies they're gonna use that as
a way to know that you have certain
skills and you know certain things and
that's important that way so for the
Java OCA and I'm going to talk about
se7 because that's our most recent
credential and we've updated that it's
all new we've developed that thing
really from the ground up and with se7
you take one exam at the OCA level the
Oracle certified associate level and one
exam of the Oracle certified
professional level neither of those
exams is easy but really that
professional
is kind of the flagship level where you
want to be similar to with son the GS
cjp Java programmer and then you of
course can always go up from there and
those credentials become tougher and
tougher require some training and then
some real tough practical exams so it'll
take you some time it's doable but
you're gonna have to work hard okay
you're gonna have to work I'm assuming
you have things like study guides that
are gonna help people along the way yes
yeah we have some great materials in
fact Oracle University and we fall under
Oracle University has some great
training materials and more than ever we
got up got with the curriculum
developers early on and we said we want
to make sure that these align well so
the training course is if someone takes
them they're gonna be great preparation
for those certification exams and so
that coordination actually resulted into
a real tight-knit connection between
those tests and that training now I'm
not saying that you take the training
you're gonna go pass the test it's not
that way it doesn't work that way you
need a lot of practice you have to
program you have to code and you're
going to do a lot of stuff a lot of
study outside the course but those
courses are a great way to to be able to
prepare for that exam okay one question
I get on Twitter all the time is can I
get my certification without showing up
anywhere physically can I do it all
virtually yeah unfortunately that's not
the case you know in order to maintain
that credential as a high standard
the exams are proctored and what that
means is you actually go into a center
someone validates the your ID validates
that you're you we actually take your
picture it's printed on your score
report and so you don't want your mom
looking at your score report is saying
hey who's this yeah so it's got to be
you that takes that test and then you're
actually watched while you take that
exam and then at the end of it you can
get a score the score comes back within
at least an hour and so you get almost
immediate feedback on how you did but
definitely you definitely have to have
to show up wow that's really cool so
that gives it a lot more meaning to the
people that are looking at it right the
potential employers say wow you you
didn't hack this test she really took it
that's right it increases the validity
and the value over over time and overall
to have that a proctored program Wow so
this is pretty exciting how do I find
out more where do I go there's a there's
a couple of great places that I would
folks - first of all our certification
website that's really the source of
truth for everything in our program and
the source of what credentials we have
because there's a lot more than just
that Java c7 programmer but it's
certification Oracle comm and then in
addition to that I would encourage
people to take a look at our blog which
is blogs oracle.com slash certification
and then we also have a you know Twitter
account and that's the Oracle cert and
Facebook Wow so you're out in the social
media answering questions and available
to help people when they need it yeah
without question we watch this closely
we respond we have a certification form
as well that's that's where the
candidates talk to each other we kind of
sit on the periphery of that and only
step in if people have something really
that nobody else can answer but that's
kind of a fun word to use as well it's
on the OTN network well great Paul thank
you very much for your time I really
appreciate it I know you're busy putting
together classes and getting that
training out to people so it was great
to see you here at Javel thank you I
appreciate that all right thanks a lot
