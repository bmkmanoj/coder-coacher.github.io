started
welcome to modules and services my name
is Alex Buckley I work in the Java
platform group at Oracle I edit the Java
language specification and the Java
Virtual Machine specification and for
many years now I've been working on have
been who have worked on the module
system that's in JDK 9 can I do a couple
of straw polls whilst I have you all
here who has downloaded JDK 9 please
quite a few hands who is familiar with
Metron slash services a small number of
hands ok who is familiar with Java util
service loader some of the same hands
but also different hands which is quite
interesting um who has built an
application that calls service loader on
a small trait we're really shrinking ok
so that's what this talk is about I
often say that modules are quite
different than most language features
such as lambdas lambdas are about the
shape of programs in the small
individual for loops turning into method
calls with lambda arguments you can
reshape a program to use lambdas without
anyone noticing
modules are about the shape of programs
in the large we deal with classes and
packages and get bigger from there if
you reshape a module it's quite likely
that other people will notice and
although modules are expressed in source
code of the Java language they are in
some ways outside the language they
define architecture rather than code I
say all this because services that I'll
be talking about here are the purest
form of architectural our construct
offered by the module system there's
something you have to design for very
explicitly it's actually possible that
in your daily work you will never come
across services and all
so if you're thinking sower
service-oriented architectures that's
not what this is about was anyone
thinking so uh no I guess I can take
that line out of the presentation so now
that we're here let's talk about three
things what services are in JDK nine
what they can do and how they can make
old code more modular so what are
services and I should also check did
everyone see the keynotes on Monday who
didn't see the keynote on Monday that's
a bit unfair okay some people did it has
anyone seen any other modularity talks
so good quite a few hands so that's good
so this is this is additive to those so
you'll you'll you'll build up from there
so when we talk about modules we talk
typically talk about two things module
dependencies and package exports Java
desktop is the JDK module that contains
AWT and swing as you can see it
expresses a dependency on the java xml
module for some internal implementation
reason so that it can access all of the
public types in the api exported by Java
XML and Java desktop exports the
java.awt package so that anyone who
requires Java desktop can themselves
access the exported public types of the
AWT api the coupling between Java
desktop and Java XML is very tight if
java xml isn't found at compile time
then Java desktop which requires it
cannot be built and if java xml isn't
found at runtime then no system
depending on Java desktop can start
since desktops dependency on XML is
unresolved
there is another kind of coupling
between modules that is much looser than
that it's so useful that we've built it
into the module system it involves one
module requesting and implementation of
an interface and other modules providing
implementations of that interface I'm
actually going to say that again
because that's what this entire
presentation is about one module
requests an implementation of an
interface other modules provide
implementations of that interface as an
example the Java desktop module could
request an implementation of some print
service lookup interface while another
module print Lib has some class that
implements print service lookup at
runtime code in the Java desktop module
to do with printing can call a simple
standard API to obtain an instance of
print service lookup the instance in
this case would be of class a fast print
from the print Lib module but Java
desktop does not require print Lib this
means that Java desktop can be resolved
by the module system even if print Lib
is not present at compile time or
runtime also print Lib would not export
the package that contains that fast
print class fast print is a class it's
not an API that other modules should
access directly other modules like Java
desktop should invoke methods of fast
print only through the print service
lookup interface what do the module
declarations look like for this
relationship it's very simple Java
desktop would say that it uses print
service lookup and the print Lib module
would say that it provides print service
look up with the
print glass print service lookup is
called the service type the service type
is usually an interface but it can be an
abstract class or even a concrete class
if you really have a need for that fast
print is the provider class the provider
class must be a concrete class that
implements or extends the service type
and declares a no arts constructor so
that ik so that it can be instantiated
by the module system we say that Java
desktop is the consumer module he stops
with the dark blue arrow and print lib
is a provider module he's got the purple
arrow notice in Java desktop that you
are seeing requires take a module named
java xml exports take a package name and
uses take a type name three different
properties of a module three different
keywords three different kinds of
arguments the provides in print Lib
takes two type names one for the service
type and one for the provider class and
that provides directive is the modular
equivalent of a file called met room
slash services slash print service
lookup that would have listed the fast
print class prior to JDK nine if a jar
file has a module info class compiled
from this module declaration then any
files in mods in Metron services are
ignored the module declarations idea of
uses and provides wins
just to clarify what's going on here
there is no dependency injection here if
your module says uses some service type
and you have a field of that service
type then it is not the case that an
instance of that service type is
magically assigned to the fields you
have to ask for an instance
of the service type explicitly so let's
talk about that to obtain an instance of
the print service lookup interface code
hypothetical code in the Java desktop
module employs the service loader API
introduced in Java 6 the key method in
service loader on the second line is
load it takes a class object java.lang
class representing a service type so
print service lookup dock last as long
as Java desktop is containing this code
says that it uses print service lookup
that load method returns a service
loader object capable of yielding
instances of that service type the
module system works behind the scenes to
assist service loader the module system
automatically discovers provider modules
at startup by scanning modules in the
Java Runtime image and modular jars on
the module path now there could be lots
of provider modules there could be more
than one provider module for print
service lookup which means more than one
provide a class that implements the
interface each instance that service
loader yields of the service type is of
a different provider class helpfully
service load at implements iterables so
the P the PS L's which is the service
loader object implement iterable so you
can for each your way through the
available instances known to service
loader looking for the one you like
in this case Java desktop hopes to find
a print service lookup implementation
that offers a specialist print service
involving a particular dot flavor I
don't know what doc flavors are but I
know they're to do with print service
lookups if service loader yields no
instances of print service lookup
or if it did but for some reason none of
them in the for-loop body there could
offer the specialist service desired in
this case by the code then the code has
to decide what to do in this case it
decides to return a default in service
objects now all of this code would
typically live in a static method of the
service type so that print service
lookup is its own factory for obtaining
implementations
now before JDK 8 interfaces couldn't
have static methods so most service
types print servers lookup were abstract
classes rather than interfaces but now
that interfaces can have static methods
its more common for the service type
print service lookup to be an interface
at this point everyone asks if service
loader finds all provider classes that
implements that print service lookup
interface and yields an instance of each
one
how does Java desktop that contains that
code specify that fast print is my
favorite implementation of print service
lookup alternatively how does the print
Lib module specify that my class fast
print is the best implementation of
print service la carpa trust me the
other question everyone asks is about
ordering how does Java desktop the
consumer module specify that it prefers
the fast print implementation of print
surface lookup to the net print
implementation but that it will be happy
to run with net print if fast print is
not present now bear in mind that
provider modules on the right usually
don't know about each other so they
cannot reasonably be involved in
selecting or sorting implementations the
consumer module Java desktop is
obviously the right place to do it
but this quickly leads to complicated
schemes that encode provider preferences
in a module declaration
now we're trying to keep the module
system simple so the answer is no one
specifies a global sort of static
preference for provider classes at least
not in a module declaration for the
consumer instead the basis for choosing
one provider class over another is
application dependence it's a choice the
consumer module has to make by
inspecting the properties of available
provider classes when they come back
from service loader and by properties I
don't mean reflecting over their fields
I mean calling methods of the service
type on every instance of the discovered
provider classes so recall that Java
desktop this is code in Java desktop
calls after it's got the service loader
and it's iterating through the print
surface lookup implementations it calls
the get default print service method on
each instance of print service look up
and then makes further calls on the
result is dot flavor supported to decide
if that instance is acceptable for
whatever java desktop is trying to do
the consumer module should not be
concerned with the identity of the
provider classes the provider classes
are private details of the provider
modules in fact we strongly discourage
provider modules from exporting its
provider classes because if they're
exported it encourages people like this
guy to code around the interface and
directly against the class at which
point you've been you've lost the
benefit of loose coupling
so my advice is to think of a service
type the interface for which
implementations will be found as a
coarse grained selector a service type
like print service lookup should offer
enough descriptor methods about the
quality of implementation for a consumer
module to select the best provider class
in our example so far print service
lookup the service type print service
lookup is actually a proxy for the real
print service objects of interest there
may be many instances of print service
lookup on a system in different modules
each one representing many instances of
print service but able to offer a
default print service to consumers in
another scenario the service type might
directly represent an object of interest
in this example the print service
interface itself or the bottom actually
offers a rich enough set of descriptor
methods dot flavor related that it could
perhaps be a legitimate service type of
its own how much abstraction you design
into your service type depends on your
application the main factor is how heavy
the ultimate objects of interest are for
example if the nature of one of these
print service things is that instantiate
in one might be slow
perhaps because a provider class might
scan the network looking for printers
then there is value in print service
lookup instances to act as proxies that
decide whether a print service instance
is actually available but if the nature
of a print service is that it's cheap
and easy to instantiate then the value
of print service lookup as the the proxy
service type is diminished I hope it's
clear this is nothing to do with the
services are nothing to do with print
services services are a completely
general mechanism but to exemplify them
I have to get a concrete service to a
particular service type and
a small set of provider classes and then
the question is is great I've got
multiple provider classes what do I do
of course the other question is what if
I have no provider classes what do I do
we'll come on to that it's interesting
to look at the service types the
interfaces consumed by Java desktop the
service types in blue are proxies or
factories or wrappers if you prefer
print service lookup is among them there
is e there is in the middle print
service lookup the type next to it
stream print service factory is the same
deal and looking from the top you would
call methods on instances of input
method descriptor in order to find the
one that offers the desired input method
capital i capital m and you would call
methods on instances of image input
stream spi service provider interface to
choose one that can best convert your
data into an image input stream the
Javadoc for those five SPI types sort of
near the top even says the intent is
that it be relatively inexpensive to
load and inspect all available service
provider classes ie implementations of
image input stream SPI those classes may
then be used to locate and instantiate
more heavyweight classes that will
perform actual work in this case
instances of image reader image writer
image transcoder image input stream and
image output stream the service types in
Brown are not proxies or factories but
rather they represent the actual objects
of interest
so while MIDI device provider sort of in
the middle in blue is just a proxy for
obtaining MIDI device objects MIDI file
reader just below it in Brown is real
business logic a provider class for MIDI
file reader
knows how to obtain actually a MIDI
sequence from a file the bottom line is
that the service load API and the module
system are agnostic about the
granularity in design of your service
type which means that details like
quality of implementation issues are
kept out of the module declarations now
you may be wondering where are the
service types the print service lookup
interface actually live a service type
is just an interface in a package in a
module that package will almost always
be exported from the module all those
green arrows so that other modules such
as Java desktop is a consumer and print
nib as a provider can require the the
service types module and access the
service type a consumer module like Java
desktop needs to access the service type
for its users directive the dark blue
arrows and for the code that employees
service loader
to get instances of the service type in
other words the print service lookup
type name is actually in the code of
Java desktop so there's a real access
across modules there a provider module
like print neural-net prints needs to
access the service type for its provides
directive and of course for the class
fast print or net print that actually
implements or extends the service type
in general there can be many consumer
modules on the left and many provider
modules on the right for a given service
type a consumer module will say requires
and uses while a provider module will
say requires and provides the arrows
looked complicated when they're all
drawn out but but browsing the source of
module declarations
requires users requires provides makes
it pretty clear what the module
relationships are and by the way this
was this has this to some extent is
irreducible even if you were doing a
service loader prior to nine this is
what was really going on these are the
essential relationships between the
consumers and the providers the good
news is if you skim for example the JDK
module summary or even the Javadoc
produced from your own modules it's very
easy to see which modules are consumers
and of what and which modules are
providers and of what and that's
definitely in an advanced over grapping
for service loaded load calls and
wondering which jars on the classpath
have files in Metron services all that
said it's not man dat tree for a service
type to be defined in a different module
than the consumers and providers in the
JDK it's common for a module which
defines and exports a service type to
also be a consumer module for that
service type for example the Java
desktop module exports the java.awt mSpy
package at the top so that other modules
can implement the spi types and act as
provider modules and Java desktop uses
at the top on the right java.awt mSpy
input method descriptor so the code in
java desktop can use service loader to
get instances of that service type many
well-known frameworks in the JDK such as
logging file system and date/time
support this kind of customization via
provider modules
it's also relatively common in the JDK
for a consumer module to also be a
provider module for example Java desktop
uses print service lookup really does
and also it provides an implementation
in the form of Sun print print servers
lookup provider this allows the code in
Java desktop that returns print services
to be assured that it can always return
at least some instance of a default
provider class some print print service
lookup provider ultimately you can see
that a single module like Java desktop
may contain the service type and the
user's directive to help the code
employing service loader and provides
directives to specify one or more
provider classes so that's what services
are service relationships uses and
provides our a first-class thing in the
module system programming against
service types being a consumer module
allows the provider modules and the
provider classes to be strongly
encapsulated and many JDK frameworks use
services I shouldn't say use cause uses
ism keyword build on services rely on
services and are customized with them
so moving on how to use services for a
particular use case
it should be obvious that services let
you plug in implementations that weren't
known to your program at compile time
they are discovered dynamically via
service loader for examples that show
this I recommend the Java 9 modularity
book that's out this week it's not so
obvious that services are actually the
key to encoding a number of
sophisticated relationships between
modules that might otherwise appear to
be unsupported by the module system in
particular I'm going to talk about how
optional module dependencies are neatly
encoded with services as an example
consider the Java scripting module in
the JDK it offers an API to evaluate
snippets of code the details of that API
don't matter there is some some class
eval that evaluates snippets of code now
at runtime there might be many
implementations of scripting languages
capable of evaluating snippets such as
NASA horn that's Oracle's implementation
of JavaScript or groovy or JRuby etc how
is the Java scripting module meant to
depend on them it seems like it seems
like we need a way to say in the module
declaration for Java scripting requires
optional module name so that Java
scripting would read whichever modules
are available and if none are available
that would be okay the module system
would still start even though some of
the required things might not be present
the trouble with requires optional is
that it would only make sense when the
Java when the Java scripting module has
already been built but suppose you're at
compile time
what if source in the Java scripting
module refers to a class in one of the
optional modules either JDK scripting a
Sehorne or groovy script engine and that
optional module isn't present at compile
time it's not acceptable for a Java
compiler to proceed when it can't find
classes referenced in source code nor do
we want to relax the java language with
some form of loose dynamic typing that
says well I see there's a reference to
some type from an optional module and
it's not here at compile time but it
might be here at runtime so I'll just
compile it and hope that the types will
work out that's not really the java way
now you can get a bit further if you
would in your source code never refer
directly to class names from the
optional modules and instead access them
via reflection but that's a very painful
programming style it's how you had to
code on the Java ME platform when
different devices implemented different
API s and you had to dynamically
discover what was there and code it
through the reflection API it just
doesn't scale this is a slide you will
want to take a picture of the proper way
to program against zero one or many
modules is with services services
introduce a level of indirection by
means of the service type you can
mechanically translate an optional
module dependency at the top I should
say sort of a hypothetical optional
dependency you can't write requires
optional right it's a hypothetical thing
but if you want to write that you you
can translate it to a pair of non
optional dependencies on the module
which exports the service type there's a
consumer module Java scripting which is
going to use the service type and their
various provider modules on the right
that require the service type module
tutor so they can implement script
engine Factory and they declare that
they provide implementation
this scheme at the bottom decouples the
number and the identity of the provider
modules on the right from the consumer
module which is what optionality is all
about I recognize this is an abstract
picture the benefit is it fits on one
slide does this make sense
it's very hard to tell up here whether
this programming idiom that we've burned
into the java language with these
keywords uses and provides which is
clearly more about the architecture of
the relationship between different
modules it's sort of the opposite of of
lambdas in their individual expressions
in method bodies it's very hard to tell
how well it comes across but really this
is the essence of modularity it's about
making the consumer modules not care who
the provider modules are modularity is
basically about not caring and services
or how you do that you just rely on a
well-designed service type and you let
the module system find the providers so
since Java scripting is a JDK module it
will not come as a surprise that it's
not only the consumer module that says
uses but actually also where the service
type lives so at the top the Java
scripting module it both uses the script
engine factory interface because there's
code in Java scripting that call service
loader and Java scripting actually is
where that interface lives so it exports
it for everyone else to implement then
further down the NASS horn and groovy
modules again all hypothetical there
isn't actually groovy module called that
but I've got to have some example they
each provide their implementation of
script engine Factory and the module
system discovers the role of these two
modules as provider modules
when the system starts up assuming that
jars for these two modules are on the
module path now code in Java scripting
and you'll find my pointer code and Java
scripting can employ service loader to
get instances of script engine factory
and call its methods without worrying
where the implementations come from the
script engine factory interface has many
descriptor methods to let provider
classes encode the quality of
implementation of the script engines
they ultimately offer I'm not going to
show script engine factory because it
would be a big long list of get methods
it's pretty easy to look up and you'll
see a sort of get get the name of the
script engine and get some details of
what it some of the language features
that it supports you will notice the
Java scripting module does not say it
requires JavaScript jdk scripting nass
horn or groovy script engine in fact if
you look closely you'll see that those
modules require Java scripting where the
service type lives so in effect the way
you get optional dependencies with very
loose coupling is by inverting them
rather than a high level scripting API
module requiring lower level
implementation modules everyone looks up
by requiring the module with the service
type so service relationships encode
optional module dependencies that means
that services are not just giving loose
coupling as a sort of a mechanism in the
module system but actually a better
separation of concerns between the
interface and the implementations and
services are almost always a better
choice for discovering implementations
than messing around with reflection
class dot for name and the like
so nearly done let's talk about cycles
this is a graph of some of the modules
in JDK 9 what do you notice about it it
is a cyclic there are no cycles there
are no loops it is a directed acyclic
graph the module system does not allow
cycles in your requires directives it
has taken almost a decade to detangle
the tens of thousands of classes in the
JDK to the acyclic and relatively sane
States you see here we'd like to keep it
that way
in fact one of the motivations for
investing in modular ization of a code
base is the knowledge that once complete
there won't be any backsliding into the
ball of mud that cyclic dependencies
allow and we're not the only ones who
think like this java application
architecture from 2012 is an outstanding
book about modularity in a section
entitled you actually couldn't make this
up it's true cyclic dependence is the
death knell
it says excessive dependencies are bad
excessive requires basically are bad but
cyclic dependencies are especially bad
it goes on to say generally speaking
cycles are always bad however sometimes
some cycles are worse than others cycles
among classes are tolerable assuming
they don't cause cycles among the
packages or modules containing them
cycles among packages may also be
tolerable assuming they don't cause
cycles among the modules containing them
module relationships must never be
cyclic however in real life there are
sometimes cycles which seem inevitable
let's look at a real life example
let's assume there is a logging project
that consists of two modules logging API
and logging in pull one requiring the
other so that the logging API module
requires the logging implementation
module that's the blue arrow why well
maybe a static method in the API module
has been traditionally using reflection
to create instances of the locking
implementation now let's assume there is
some HTTP client module in an unrelated
project it wants to log HTTP requests so
it starts to require another blue arrow
the logging API module there are no
services yet it's it's just too requires
and finally let's assume that the
logging implementation module wants to
add a feature where it can upload logs
to a web server at this point the author
of logging in pull is out of luck in JDK
9 because for logging imple to depend on
HTTP client via are requires the third
blue arrow would would create a cycle
and worse it would create a cycle across
projects that's a very uncomfortable
level of coupling to manage for the rest
of time what can the author of logging
in pull do to upload logs to a web
server well one option is to find
another project that offers an HTTP
client module but that seems like
cheating another option is to email the
author of the HTTP client module and ask
them to stop requiring logging API but
now the author of HTTP client is the
person in the position of find another
project even if the author of HTTP
client is willing to use a different
logging
the author of logging imple would still
have to wait for a new release of HTTP
clients that did so who is at fault here
it's not the logging in pull module who
is just trying to reuse remember in the
keynote Mark said a module is a set of
packages designed for reuse the logging
imple module is just trying to reuse the
logically independence HTTP client
module and I don't think the problem
lies with the HTTP client module who is
just trying to reuse a public logging
API the fault lies with the logging API
module it is poor style for an API to
rely to require its implementation for
two reasons
first it means implementation details
are likely to leak into the API which
makes the API less understandable second
it means that exercising the API needs
the entire implementation to be up and
running which makes the API less
testable plus given everything I've said
so far it's kind of obviously wrong
consider the Java base module it
declares the Java util collection
interface but it will be stupid for the
Java base module to depend on to require
any module that implements that
interface implementations depend on
interfaces not the other way around so
the best outcome is for logging in pull
to depend on logging API rather than the
other way around implementations
dependent interfaces but then I hear you
ask how does the static method in the
API create instances of the logging
implementation of course with services
here's what the logging project should
do
first the logging API module defines a
service type logger in some package and
that package is exported widely the
Green Arrow's exported consumers
exported to providers second the logging
implement the comes a provider module
it requires logging API that's the blue
arrow and provides an implementation of
the service type the purple arrow
note that the logging implementation
module does not export anything finally
the logging API module with the service
type acts as its own consumer it says
that it uses the logger service type and
then at runtime it asks service loader
for an instance of logger this instance
would then be returned up to the HTTP
client module which has no idea of the
relationship between logging api and
locking implementation it occurs to me I
should have deleted the big blue arrow
from logging in pull up to HTTP clients
it should be gone pretend it's not there
I know you're all pretending it's not
there right now the HTTP client is
forced to code strictly to the logger
interface with no access to the
underlying implementation class because
it wasn't exported from logging in pull
the great trick basically is that
service loader act on behalf of logging
API to look down into locking imple
without logging in pull so without
logging API
requiring logging in pull and without
logging imple exporting anything to
logging api in other words there is very
loose coupling between the api and the
implementation so it's easy to switch
out logging in pull for a different
implementation at runtime and again the
HTTP client module would be unaware of
this happening
I need to speed up if you've get the
feeling you've seen this before it's
because you have ten minutes ten minutes
ago I said the way you get optional
dependencies is by inverting them rather
than the high level scripting module
requiring low level implementation
modules everyone looks up by requiring
the module with the service type
services play the same trick to break a
cyclic dependency rather than the high
level API module requiring the low level
implementation modules the
implementation modules look up by
requiring the API module developing
services takes work but the payoff is
that services bring out the structure of
the whole program more clearly than
anything we've ever introduced into the
Java language and since our number one
belief for Java code is that reading is
more important than writing we think
that services pull their weight and
deserve to be widely adopted
so cycles hurt program understanding and
maintenance service relationships are a
natural way to break cycles and really
in just a few uses and provides and
service loader calls you can express an
awful lot of application architecture so
service is a first-class they literally
give you looser coupling but logically
better separation of concerns and it's
all about the architecture rather than
the code jdk nine is here please
download it if you haven't if you want
to know more about the module system
there's a number of JDK enhancement
proposals jep's especially jet 261
basically every question that you're
going to ask is answered in jet 261 and
with that thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
