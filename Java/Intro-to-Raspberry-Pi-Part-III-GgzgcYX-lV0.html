running inside Raspberry Pi and it's not
just running they really make a good job
optimizing the virtual machine for
raspberry pi 4 g's specific armed v6 so
the instructions was very a DD de
refactoring for this specific on version
and the performance is very good and I
think that Java had the server side for
raspberry pi is the first platform to
have a good server side or enterprise
side for for embedded and no no no not
not using not in this version i have i
have i use by far j but not in this
version i will show the reason why later
but pie for j is really growing very
fast and I don't know if the plan is to
sometimes you have a kind of pie for GI
standard pie for J so I don't I I never
saw another option for java commanding
the gpios so you have the device X's API
from Java me 33 that you can also
commended the GPIO from raspberry pi but
in the java SE the most use it is the
pie for J Robert sivaji will be here
tomorrow so he will be talking about par
for J for us ok so here the good thing
is that 10 years ago if you want to
write and bedded or to work with and bad
that you need to learn java me which is
kind is java the language is java but
you have to learn specific things about
the the Micronesian the veto machine the
life cycle of the application another
way to make you eyes and everything
now we can use our old knowledge java
knowledge FSC knowledge to run inside
raspberry pi so this will make any kind
of java developer are a embedded
developer so that's the very good thing
then that it's sweet is it was my
surprise i was in 2011 talking giving a
talking Ninja and I i met with ninjini
and i say we need a job Enterprise
Edition embedded and she said I like
this name but the name is javon batted
sweet because it's not the java
enterprise java embedded switch is a
complete stack with the virtual machine
a lightweight glassfish and also a java
DB so you can have rest restful
applications running inside your
embedded and it will bring a new
paradigm a new paradigm for
architectures because we may be the
embedded cloud will be the new client
server so we are now talking about
embedded and it's not more server its
cloud it's not part Wyant is embedded so
i think that this will make up big
revolution is a lightweight java ee
server this tag comes with Java Sea
embedded glassfish and Java DB and that
it cloud as the new client server you
can use it to make a lot to make
gateways for internet your things so in
there is much building that I work it we
have infrared we have serial
communication we have different types of
communication for each device and I use
a javon that it switch to be the gateway
for all this device so is very nice and
you can have cash persistence process
integration security and
it's funny because five years ago I was
ultimate isin my gate my house with
arduino and it was very easy and i said
ah but now i want you to start the data
what time I'm opening the gate what time
I'm closing the gating so when you begin
to think about storing data or send data
to the to the network using Arduino it's
kind of expensive compared to raspberry
pi if you buy an Arduino and shoot for
later nach not the Wi-Fi for Ethernet is
the same price of the raspberry so
doesn't make any sense to have are doing
we fit energy if you can use Raspberry
Pi and especially if you need wireless
communication because the wireless
shoots for Arduino is almost it's half
of the price of a netbook so crazy thing
and and actually you are going to put a
shoot it happen all the time we for do
you know you have a very small micro
controller and you add a shoot with an
arm to do some same thing in specific
and another shoot with another arm so
when you see you have three or four
different processors running Arduino it
wasn't required a speaker on the same
thing and then we put you nose or
subsystems that linux for me to build on
the microcontroller now exactly the same
architecture I have running here so
because you can have a dedicated control
for anything pwn when you need more than
one and it makes a lot of sense in cases
more sophisticated piece and sensors and
when you need a performance
applying for well the band you can have
jpa servlets rest and i'm i'm using this
phrase your fumer as a server so it's
different you are running fumer and
services so you have javafx for
raspberry pi I don't need to talk too
much about javafx and raspberry pi
because it's the totally buzzword here
in Java one you saw the tablet yesterday
the open-source tablet so you can do it
with good performance Bruno will talk
more about it but you need to make some
a setup for running javafx on Raspberry
Pi basics are three steps the first one
to uncomment this lining in this file
overclocked to 1 Giga is recommended but
it's not required and the memory split
to 128 megabytes for the video and last
month I think that last month Oracle
just released the event processing for
embedded as a efficient all part of Java
embedded sweet so now you can collect
the data you can start locally in Java
DB you can process the data with complex
event processing so it's getting crazy
it seems that the servers they are away
in the cloud but now they are much
nearing the embedded side so that's the
feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
