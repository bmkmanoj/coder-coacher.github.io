Network and I'm here today at TDC with
one of the main organizer Yara sander
sanaya hi hello thank you very much for
coming and supporting this conference so
tell us how is it going it's the last
day so how was the conference yes you
know it was very nice we had the five
days more than 36 different tracks on
subjects lots of them related to Java
architecture testing testing mobile
embedded Raspberry Pi we had some
workshops and hackathons so lots of
people excited happy coming here to OTN
move to take these funny pictures so you
know very happy with the results to now
so there was a special track for the
raspberry pi k town can you tell us a
little bit about it yes it was there it
was very funny because raspberry pi now
it's very everybody wants to to learn to
have one so we have lots of boots here
ruffling raspberry pi just showing how
much people are interested on this
subject so the hackathon was a two days
activity and we began with a workshop
teaching how people can run Haas berry
pie and put Java on it and then we made
a very nice brainstorm where people
could discuss the ideas and select the
better ones to be transformed in
projects and teams after that all the
team started developing which one was
your favorite project you know I loved a
heartbeat one it was a good UI and we
had a little raspy you know doing
movements and Java facts on the front
end so it was very nice we also had one
that was more mechanical the animal feed
so it was interesting to see how people
could develop in you know one day and a
half because we were not doing overnight
so they could develop this feeder for
animals since the scratch we also had
the jukebox showing how
no musics and coming from internet with
a little vote for people to vote truth
Twitter so they integrate with social
media and we also had 14 face detection
we're integrating for camera that shows
exactly where on the image the face are
so I like oh you are planning to be at
javaone and maybe like duplicating the
the event so tell us a little bit about
it yes the domain idea is you know to
start on the user group conference with
a one-hour talk or workshop from
venetia's so start discussing and using
the time to teach people something and
then we will have three days during
javaone starting five pm-2 to start
building that so our team will be given
support and helping people to develop
the ideas and people will be able to
develop entire day night and all the
time but to have a certain time for a
given support so I do expect to have
lots of great ideas directly from Java
12 the end of the Raspberry Pi hackathon
thank you so much Yara thank you for
being with us and organizing this
wonderful event thank you no no it's my
pleasure to have you and all the support
you and all the team have been given for
Brazilian community for worldwide
community thank you very much for being
here with us and having this great time
