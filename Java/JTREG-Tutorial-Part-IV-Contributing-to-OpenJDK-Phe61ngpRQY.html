for contributing to open JDK my name is
Balu Chandra idea I'm working in Java
platforms group as a principal member of
technical staff at Oracle here is a
disclaimer in this tutorial I am going
to explain how to contribute to open JDK
tests but I commanded practices relating
to test cases open JDK workspace and
there is a reference page that lists the
links to learn more about jetty right
let me start with how to contribute
first think sign Oracle contributor
agreement or OCA OCA is available at
Oracle tech net work website then read
through open JDK bylaws that's available
on open JDK door java.net there is a
fake use that's available on the Oracle
TechNet work website general guidelines
about contributing to JD case available
at open dedicate or java.net slash
contribute website this website explains
step by step guidelines how to start
contributing to open JDK but same rule
is applied to contributing to tests as
well then subscribe to JT rake - use at
open JDK dot java.net here ask general
question about JT recuse subscribe to JT
rake down at open JDK door java.net and
ask tough questions send any enhancement
proposals to JT rec - this alias
subscribe to quality
- discuss at open JDK door java.net
Lia's this is a general discussion alias
to discuss quality issues about openjdk
you can propose test cases send change
sites and send feedback and so on to
this alias recommended practice while
modifying an existing test case make
sure that do not overwrite the test
scenarios unless existing test scenario
sees obsolete with the new fix test case
should run on Windows Linux Mac and
Solaris there is no exception
if the test case is not applicable to a
particular platform make the test case
pass code reviews we recommend to get at
least two peer reviews and then send an
email to open JDK component mailing list
for a feedback open JDK workspace open
JDK workspace use mercurial source
control management system to bring over
JDK 8 workspace use HG clone HTTP colon
slash slash HG dot open JDK java.net
slash JDK 8 slash Teddy k-8 to any local
directory then change to local directory
and execute a convenient shell script
provided in that directory to bring over
remaining parts of open JDK workspace
tests are located in JDK test line tool
tests are located at Lang tools slash
test hotspot tests are located at
hotspot slash test and nashorn tests are
located at national slash test problem
list dot txt if available present in
test route directories at the moment JDK
test repository has problem
East dot txt file it has all known
problematic test cases in JD case test
repository if anyone want to contribute
if don't have any idea to where to start
perhaps this is the place does this one
of the place to start looking at the
test cases and start improving those
test cases in addition to invoking JD
reg command directly to execute the
tests there is a convenient to make file
present in each test to test root
directory to execute tasks using make
file export necessary environment
variable and then execute to make
concurrence equal to auto and make file
target here is some general environment
variables required to execute the test
using make there are many more
environment variables available best
place to start learning those
environment variable is to start looking
at make file itself to execute Lang tool
and hotspot tests export environment
variables and make concurrence equal to
a toe and make target is jetty reg -
tests to execute JDK tests again export
environment variables and then choose
relevant make file targets such as JDK
underscore n io one JDK and score in a
or two and so on Derek and of score all
will execute all the tests present in
JDK test directory let me move over to
references open dedicated java.net /jt
reg has lots
information about JT right core tools
project which is accessible through open
JDK door java.net has source code for JT
rake all the emails sent to dedicate -
Dao aliases are called and is accessible
through mail dot open JDK door java.net
if anyone have any questions about data
like features and if anyone have
proposal to enhance JT rake send email
to JT rec - Thao at open JDK door
java.net alias in addition to that JT
rake bundles fa Q's and tags
specifications general help about JT reg
is available at the command line using
JT reg - online help or JT rec - help
or simply by typing JT rake this is end
