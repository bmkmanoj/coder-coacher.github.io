digital TV and in the market of Brazil
and Latin America and why Java is
involved on that i'm here with fatty
agua spa to discuss this topic just a
quick introduction for you digital TV is
a project that was by the Brazilian
government to standardize the
interactivity and the digital TV in the
country and why Java is involved on that
Java is part of the standard on the
middle side the middle probably probably
already heard about it it's called Ginga
so that said I'd like to introduce
Thiago Vespa which is one of the best
experts in the subject how important is
Java in the contest of digital TV in the
region latin america in brazil with java
we can reuse a lot of libraries that we
have in another applications we have a
lot of documentation and we have several
developers around the world that knows
that deck knowledge which java can do
more scalable applications and we have
some some technologies that we can use
with videos images pictures
that we can do very good applications
and that's why Java is very important
that's good and talking about the
community just in Latin America we have
probably one third of the whole world
community java developers community are
here just in brazil 130 up morale as
130,000 developers developing java so
it's it's really a lot of work force for
the broadcasters that our thinking and
our publishing job applications running
on top of Jenga so talking about java
and digital TV which technology we're
talking about here digital TV is mainly
a java and the environment so we have a
lot of good frameworks that we can use
like java media framework the
lightweight toolkit and we can use the
same way we are using in the mobile
applications so with these technologies
like cdc and personal base profile we
can do a lot of stuff a lot of good
applications and reuse the several
libraries that we have in the another
another java amir applications so great
so we have java me cdc media pack ppb
luid so all in all as part of the
brazilian digital TV stand what did the
broadcaster are doing tell us a little
bit about what what to expect and what
we can see in terms of applications
several broadcaster here in brazil use
java as the
the best technology to develop digital
TV applications we have some broad
because that only use Java to develop
applications I saw red actually I have a
TV route that runs Ginga at my home and
I saw an application that runs on top of
a soccer game and it is really cool
because I could see the statistics of
the game I could see who are playing the
name the profile of each each player and
the classification of that particular
team in the championship and also we
could I could vote which is the best
player in my opinion and at the end of
the game we could see the compilation of
all the votes which really cool but I
know that there are applications on top
running on top of soap operas as well
which is pretty popular in the country
what else we see the community doing or
the broadcaster do in terms of
applications and we have second screen
applications you can watch TV and see
more information in your tablet your
phone and these informations is
synchronized with what is what are you
watching in TV thanks a lot for your
participation and to introduce to her a
little bit more about this topic digital
TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
