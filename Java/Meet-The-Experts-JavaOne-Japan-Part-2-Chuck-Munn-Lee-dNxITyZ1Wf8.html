yesterday very much about these new
infrastructure services at a lot
multi-tenancy and you know kind of these
cloud-based services that will offer and
he really wants to know that is you know
going forward I'm it was not entirely
clear if you're talking about glassfish
by itself or if you're talking about the
j2ee standard and so will these
multi-tenancy and I you know is all this
bad stuff is this going to be part of
the wider standard or is this are you
referring to the fastest and
confrontation so I think this is in
reference to my key presentation this
morning yes it will be it will be a
standard so we will compare different
implementations so you would fall from
Oracle you see implementations on
glassfish on blood logic but there will
be a wider standard tcp is seven stand
apart of it
they support many kind of makers many
kind of also like that it would be how
the optional for application server
providers to support it or it will be
necessary currently it is optional
because the e7 really defines our past
performance of service so it doesn't
care about the infrastructure and how
you implement it so you could implement
if you know on whatever from cloud
provider or whatever platform which OS
platform
you explained about the concept software
service as not returning how do you know
for example the application there is one
HTTP request on the request how do you
manage this request is for reach them
and how do you link yeah currently all
this work is actually still filming
still being done so it is actually not
available at this information so yeah so
I will not be able to answer it but
right at the right at the right at me
black on black on the year so I'm not
sure whether you there was a
presentation where where where use the
values attend an ID okay so with so with
with the tenant ID so in the java ee ee
7 the concept of a multi-tenant is that
the one application you can deploy
multiple times so today you can do that
with good rhythm with the same
affliction twice because the database
and i shall we say you'll be accessing
the same database etc right so so in the
future with a multi-tenant ID the
container will do the differentiation
for you right so presumably when you to
additionally request either ubm data or
you you have a different name space to
go into a difference are obviously know
if it is customer ate a nuke if customer
in and be in installs the same
application obviously that URL is going
to be different you can't go to the same
URL right but application wise the
container would appreciate it and that's
up to implementation about how if we
shall text
she's from quality tenant order in all
our own fortune Alice no no me toques
who the other car how do you are my tan
genie or perhaps physiology soul eater
vida loca there are children in kamala
hook for you I to understand they are no
one any one of Georgia law ll talk soon
another one another Chloe nagarajan was
long and she saw they are no hanashi no
not a big technology to 90 applications
Ibaka probably no g socially gto garu to
you a little body myself
thank you any other questions
it's very simple question but developer
web socket and it will this be supported
in in Java 7 yes there are terrible
going on to support web web sockets okay
yeah it's one of the great quite a
critical component so today you can use
right web software applications but you
use a voice off a non-standard API to do
it not just recently the release of it
but yes techniques we got Salamis or
email at all my children to achieve
again when I know they do in custody
tonight an open source ok no Felicity
crystal ball project now it's our night
we can I just a little show that anymore
no marks or should you know I don't over
that
go through for her body for evil dr stag
night you're a potential more money to
be respected educators or baggage mmmm
done it was instinctive an old desk at
the mall so they're 80 80 kilometers on
youtube capable of it but the year
before he came thomas available because
i think
sometimes it so um there's talk of
moving the server context definition
arrow xml you know and I guess the
thinking there is that we you know we
don't want to have this ballooning
coating that just keeps getting bigger
and bigger so do you have any like like
a simple thoughts about that or ok so
I'm not sure so you can touch-type oh
 to you it is
I know
I just want to get what one thing so let
30 allows you to do web.xml is optional
in sublet treetop 0 so Java EE 6 solar
web.xml is optional thanks so this is
Sir select we got zero in Java 36 is
optional and all framework can be self
configuring mostly small sample 0730
Saturn Santo and also well then see
value y long history of an ID all the
frameworks can also be self configuring
the mr. sec framework don't you don't
have to configure web.xml that framework
can configure themselves
thank you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
