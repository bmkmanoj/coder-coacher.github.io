Java evangelist at Oracle what I want to
show you today is the scene built it's a
great tool that allows you to design
your Java FX application it's actually
very simple mainly you're going to be
dragging and dropping your components
while you design your application as you
build your application the tool the sim
builder is actually going to generate an
F XML file that you can actually hook it
up with a controller with that business
logic that is totally separated from
your user interface so this is actually
a great tool it's actually very simple
and intuitive even somebody that has no
knowledge of programming can use this
tool let me show you before we continue
the end result so this is the
application we're trying to build is an
issue tracking application you have your
project as you select your projects is
actually going to show you the issues
they are having with that particular
project you can select any particular
line in your table and the description
of the issue is going to be displayed
underneath you can actually create a new
issues and just put anything in your
description you can save it and you have
your new one you can actually also
delete it and the item will be gone so
this sort of interfaces we're going to
create it and what you can see is
resizes is one of the main issues here
it's actually working really nicely so
we're going to see how we can use the
tool to define on all this information
how the application will resize how the
components are going to be placed etc as
you delete components you can actually
see the message line here that will
display the message and then goes away
so now that we understand what we're
trying to build let's go back to the
scene builder so this is the same
builder let me go through a little bit
of the step the tool itself so what did
the area is what do we have so this is
the end we saw what we're trying to do
you can pre
view your application at any time so you
could go to the preview menu and show
the preview and this is just a preview
of your application so you can see that
differently from their demo I just want
this one doesn't have any data because
this is no runners this is just showing
the UI interface okay over here so we
have the main menu we have the library
when you can actually see what are the
components that you have available for
creating your applications so first you
have your control your computer
containers then some controls you have
everything about menus shapes etc okay
down here you have your hair key this is
actually very very important for you as
a developer so if you know about JavaFX
you know that all the UI components are
placed in a scene graph so sometimes it
get a little bit confusing to know where
the component is placed in that
particular scene graph so this allows
you to understand a little bit how the
components are placed for example let's
have a look at this particular label
right so if you pay attention that label
belongs is actually within an Xbox on a
horizontal box that is at the same time
within another bigger box that contain
that link that label plus the text field
and at the same time it's actually part
of the anchor panel the lower and
Cortana then below belong to this
vertical split panel that at the same
time is within the anchor panel that is
part of the split panel so you can see
exactly where your component is located
so it's good for selecting components
it's good for adding components you're
gonna see that you can actually grab any
theme from your library and either drop
it here in the content panel or in your
hair so we're going to see how this is
very useful for you so you have your
content panel of course at the top level
you have your selection selection and
message panel so you can either select
your components from here
and if there is sending message you also
gone up is also going to be displayed in
here finally on the right hand side we
have the inspector panel inspector panel
allows you to see information about a
particular component so for example if I
want to see this particular hyperlink
you're going to see the properties what
is the idea for that project the text
that is being displayed and we'll see
more details about that later on we're
using any style sheet for this
particular components you can see the
layout and some event if there isn't
anything associated with that particular
component with that particular element
okay so now that you're pretty much
familiar with the tool itself let's
start creating a new application so
we're going to start from the scratch
I'm just going to move the window over
here so we'll see we're building I just
want you to see the whole screen okay
pretty good so when you create a new
project a new project really all you
have is a container in this case the
container is an anchor panel the anchor
panel will allow you to add children's
and the children's will be anchored to a
particular offset of the anchor panel
edges so first thing before we go any
further I want to resize the area I want
to have an area that is 800 by 600 so we
can go here to the layout and just
change the predefined prep and the
prefer width and height to be 800 by 600
okay click it now we're going to start
adding components so you can either move
through the library or you can also use
the search and feature list first and
just go through the library I'm just
going to create the first split panel so
in this case we need a horizontal flow
so I'm just going to grab it and drop it
you can see that as I drop it they have
the area at the container what is going
to be placed it's actually highlighted
in orange so let's really
you can either resize them manually and
use the tool to say modify click to
parent and it's just going to take the
whole space for you
let me just resize this remember we just
need a three view in this size I'm just
going to take let's say 25% you can see
that as I drop the new panel we start
populating the hierarchy here you see
that the split panel at the same time
containing two panels the left one and
the right one and that's how we're going
to start adding more stuff into it now
we like to add a second split panel in
this area in this anchor panel over here
in this case we want to have a vertical
flow so we're going to take this a split
panel with a vertical flow in the
previous panel we added here into the
container into the UI what I want to do
it is now place it into the hierarchy
you can either add it here or to the
hierarchy so I'm going to show you that
second option so I'm just going to move
it so I can show you something over here
okay so the split panel as I move into
the hierarchy you see that the
containers where you can possibly drop
the object is actually highlighted I
want to actually drop it here into the
second anchor panel the anchor panel
that is actually to the one hand side
okay drop it and there we have again I'm
going to use modified fit to parent so
it will take the whole space and again
resize a little bit and let's make this
30% okay pretty good now what I want to
do is I want to save it for this
particular exercise we have we already
created the controller class Java class
for this UI interface so there is
already a NetBeans project that has been
created and the only thing they need
pins project is actually waiting is for
this F XML file to be created so I'm
going to save and I'm going to place
this file into that project directly so
we're going to save save us and then
into Angelo
this should be a scene builder and there
is a NetBeans project into the sole
ourselves and then we have the space
here we're gonna call it exactly the
same issue tracking light this is the
name of the net beam project the
extension would be added by default okay
now we have issue tracking life dot F
XML file okay so moving on so we have
now displayed and to anchor panels okay
I want to name some I want to provide
some information to these a elements
here and so the idea is when you provide
with an ID for an element over here what
we're doing is actually creating a
variable in the document namespace so
now later on we can refer to that
variable inside the code but we need to
make sure we remember the names that we
use over here so for example for this
second panel here we can actually set
the properties and in the properties
that is the FX ID this is the one we
have to remember for this second anchor
panel we're going to call it details
okay very good now what I want to add is
I want a gem start populating a little
bit with some components so let me go
back here remember we need a 3v over
here and on a table view over here so
moving back to the library remember you
can also use the self functionality to
look for your components so as I start
typing tree you can see that the tree
view is actually selected I can just
drag it and drop it modify so fake the
parent very good now we need also a
table so you start typing and the table
view is also in the list you drag it and
drop it and also notify to fit the part
okay pretty good now we need some names
for both of those so the tree view we're
going to provide it with a name three
and four the table view we're gonna call
the table very simple
so remember these are the one you're
going to use in your Java code to refer
to these elements that we created over
here
okay so we're moving on to this ankle
panel over here we're going to use some
hyperlinks on some labels so first let's
look for the hyperlink see the
guidelines that you have when you drop
your components so it's very easy to
align components so then we need a label
we grab it we drop it over here and then
we need another hyperlink and then we
drag it and we drop it over here with
the help of the guidelines okay pretty
good now we need to start modifying
these components on properties like the
text to be displayed and the ID to be
using the Java code so you can either
select the component here you can either
select the component over here and you
can change the feet the information over
here or you can double click and it will
automatically allow you to change the
information so for example for this
label we updated the text we do not need
a 90 because this doesn't we are not
really going to have any control for
this label on the code so we're going to
leave it blank for the first hyperlink
the ID that we're going to use is going
to be project ok and the text to be
displayed also project for the second
one the ID is going to be the bulk ID
and the text to be display is going to
be ID ok pretty good now as you can see
the three components were placing the
anchor panel I want to group them again
in an H box so if you want to cook them
a range thing into an H box after you
crater you can select them and you can
go to range wrap it into the H box so
the H box is created for you I want to
name these H box as the labels okay now
we need a text field that we're going to
place next to it
so let's grab this text field place it
next to it make sure we have the good
alignment
let me move all the way over here so I
can resize this component so it actually
take pretty much the whole space left
for the text to be displayed I don't
want to be anything and for the idea
that I that I want to use for this one
is size not six and then let's let's
display also side Muslims okay break it
and now what I'm going to do is again
I'm going to group these things together
so I want to group these text feel with
the labels that previously created range
wrap it into an H box okay pretty good
this H bolt is going to be called title
line okay now over here you can actually
see how things are help work them this
hierarchy works so you can see your
anchor panel that has an age box and
within that age box you have a second
age box that has just the label and this
previous each box has the H box with the
label twice the text field so it's
actually very easy to understand and to
navigate through your components pretty
good now we're going to add a label and
a text area so the search for the labels
label we're going to just drop it
underneath and we're going to also use
up text area we're just going to drop it
underneath the lip resize it and before
we finish again we're going to change
the ID for this for the text area we're
going to use description value okay and
for the text area I actually do not want
to display anything for the label so
what we want to do is there's not really
require any ID which is going to have
the scription
okay quick so I can always preview what
I have so we can always go to preview
and show the preview and you can see how
your application is looking so few
things
resize layout of the component how the
components will resize so as you see it
right now is not really working right so
you can see that the text field and area
then I'll get display properly so we
need to adjust that information so let's
move into how to use the alignments and
that information another cool thing
before I'm moving to that is and you can
use the tool to help you to populate the
tables and the tree view with a simple
data so you can actually view and show
the sample data so you can see how your
application will look like even without
the data so this is all sample this is
not the real one okay so moving a little
bit into how your component will resize
as you resize your window so let's start
with this text area so we go to the
layout area so for this text area I want
to grow in all directions as I sat as I
resize the window so I want to have
constraints to resize in all directions
okay pretty good now for the text field
I want to always grow horizontally okay
so let me just resize these so you can
see the options so you have the H Pro I
want it to be always to always grow
horizontally okay and for the text line
I want to grow in to the left and to the
right so I can come here and because I
don't see them the ID of the component
you can always ask the tool to display
for you so you know exactly that we need
the title line and the alcorn and
constraints will be to the right and to
the left
okay let's save the project wait
one other final thing is for the labels
itself I do not want them to disappear
so as you shrink the window I always
want to display this so what what I want
to do is the minimum width I don't want
to use this I want to use always to be
the predefined size
okay so I don't want to shrink too much
let's preview it again and hopefully
when we resize the window you can see
that the text on the field okay
the labels are not showing and it's
because I didn't actually say enter they
didn't actually have it defined let's do
it one more time
okay and now when I resize you can see
that project ID is always there and the
text field and them text area are per
hour I'm actually growing properly okay
now we are going to make some space on
the top because we want to add some and
bottoms of the top and some images and
stuff like that so I want to use I want
to shrink a little bit the first display
panel that we added so it's very easy to
select it from here so I know exactly
I'm going to be shrinking the right
component so I'm making some space in
the top pretty good what I'm going to do
I'm going to import an image so I'm
going to import and as you'll have the
image here the PNG perfect okay now to
make sure I'm placing it correctly I can
drop it in here and you can always just
shrink the information hide the
information that you have and you can
see that the image was actually placed
in the art compound so it was actually
placed in a proper place so you have it
you don't have an insight display panel
you just have it in the world panel very
good then it is is very good okay now to
the right
inside I want to play some bottoms so
let's look for some bottoms okay so I'm
going to place three of them so that is
that way the first one is making sure
it's actually properly aligned
okay first one
second one and then up top okay
and now some information for this one so
the first one is going to be so let's
change some properties so the text to be
display is new okay and the ID is going
to be new issue okay
the second one is save okay and it's
going to be save issue okay and the
third one is going to be the lid and the
idea is to lead ish okay pretty good now
I want again to put them together into
an H box so we already know how to do
that we select we say range wrap it into
an H box and then we have it and we want
to have more spacing between the buttons
so I want to actually modify the spacing
to be 15 and then there you have and we
need to also play a little bit with
layout so for this one I want them to
have them grow to top and left hand side
okay break it let me just move it a
little bit to left now what we want to
do is we want to associate em event I
what what is going to happen whenever
you click the new save or delete button
so let's select first in new and we can
go here to the event in the events on
action this is the method that will be
invoke when this button new button is
going to be and click it so we want to
with this is actually going to be the
method but with the controller is going
to invoke the way you put it is um use
the number and you say new in this case
we're going to call the method you issue
fire okay for the save is going to be
save issue fire
okay and for the delete is going to be
delayed issue fire okay and the last
thing remember whenever we delete there
was a little message that appear here
for a for a small period of time so
let's add that label so we're going to
grab this label drop it in here let's
just make it bigger and in the layers in
the properties we don't want to display
anything unless there is mesh is coming
and we're going to call it message bar
okay so this is your application and
let's try to preview it on one more time
okay kill and if everything is correct
you can resize it properly there is no
issues with that and some sample data P
display okay for you
the last piece for this a particular
demo is how to add the stylesheet
information so we go to the anchor panel
we want to decide the style sheet for
the whole application so if we go here
we can see in the properties you have
the style sheet area so we can add a new
style sheet and we already predefined
one style sheet so then you open that
one and then we kind of started using it
for example let's start with the text
field okay with the text area and here
with the text area you can see the style
class that we're going to use so we're
going to add some stomach
style class in this case is description
value okay if you want to see in any
moment what how does the style should
look like you can always open the edit
you will actually open up a browser and
display for you okay
click it and so this is actually would
you have this is a style sheet that we
are actually using a pretty simple we
have description value with the song
background color we have something for
the tree with the background background
color is black
and we also have a little bit afford the
buttons where we have their bottoms to
be a little bit rounded okay so let's go
back here and so let's move into the
tree for example select the tree and the
style class is going to be the black
tree and for the bottoms let make for
each of them we're going to change the
style class to be the rounded bottom and
you can see how they change in shape on
the bottom and also the last one round
apart okay pretty good one more last
preview and then we're done this is your
application using your style sheets
everything working properly so now
finally we're going to save it again to
make sure we have all the changes so
let's move to NetBeans in this case I'm
going to use 7.1.1 so what I want to do
so we created the F XML file we place it
into a project in NetBeans what we're
going to do is we're going to open that
project and have a look so in this case
we put it into Angela seam builder and
track issue light okay so if we expand
it this is actually what we created we
have your it should be very familiar for
you you have the anchor panel then a
split panel with two anchor panel your
tree view the ideas that you provide for
your view etc so if you're a developer
you can either create this F XML file
manually by hand you can create the tool
that will generate this actually pretty
clean and code and then you're going to
have your controller in Java that I'm
going into many details that would be
actually good for a second video but
what we're going to do is in your
controller you have access to your
of XML elements you see their particular
name that you just created okay so what
we're going to do is we're gonna run it
okay we're compiling link we have your
application up and running so this is
what we created in this case we don't
have the sample data we have the project
information as you select the right-hand
side is actually being updated you can
select a new one and you'll have more
description you can create a new one a
new bug and you can actually add the
information in this case say our test
team you're going to save it and as you
save it or delete it you have the label
being displayed here so for example you
delete UC issue is being deleted and
everything hopefully is being resized
properly as we define and everything
seems to be in place so congratulations
you have created your very first JavaFX
application using the same builder thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
