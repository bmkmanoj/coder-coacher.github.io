solution architect and senior sales
consultant in embedded Java group
channel alliances at Oracle here at
Mobile World Congress were showing
Oracle technologies Oracle Java based
technologies embedded database
technology spanning all the way for
small embedded device to Oracle big iron
database and analytics engines on the
backend so from developer perspective
what we're showing how you can develop
an application leveraging the same skill
sets that you have on desktop as an
enterprise g of enterprise program you
can bring this essentially same skill
set and start developing application own
devices it's a couple of products that
we introduced in the last year of one of
the Magellan vedic server based on
glassfish optimizer run on embedded
devices allows you to use Java
Enterprise Edition skills that you
already do developing weblogic
application glassfish application on the
server side we're also introducing
embedded version of a complex event
processing engine something that would
allow you to implement complex complex
data analytics solution on devices in
deployed on the server own on device
again leveraging the same skill set the
same application from the data center to
the device so back to the demo set here
what we're showing is a building control
application applications that are
leverages Java technology embedded on
devices we have a small gateway here
running java SE embedded and proof of
concept of building control application
we have tablet as it allows our control
of various appliances on display the
tablet that shows a real-time
environmental sensors data temperature
light intensity motion control current
energy consumption as well as a
real-time pricing information it's a
emerging trend of utilities changing the
pricing scheme from fixed price to a
usage-based in time based pricing is
this something that is incorporated in
our demo we're also showing how you can
take all this data generate on devices
sensory data environmental data
workloads of the appliances energy
consumption of appliances and make this
is all data available on the backend sir
Oracle business intelligence software be
able to visualize the data analyze data
process and the Fitz's data up string to
oracle enterprise applications
that type of business intelligence are
anyone enterprise-class servers are
running on oracle enterprise class
databases and application infrastructure
and in the second part of our presence
here our booze here we have example of
those applications running on Oracle Big
Island</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
