me a little bit about how you been
enjoying the party party is going great
i had honored meeting james and alex and
and some of the other experts here in
person you know home week amazing all
the luminaries and folks who have worked
on java the JCP over the years all
aggregated in this the single room here
if anything happened to this this
facility heaven forbid this would be the
biggest loss java I hope not yes
invention innovation and brain capital
in the world and then Duke was also one
of my favorite so getting to meet him in

shiny new Duke I think we got the new
Duke suit oh is that yeah oh cool it was
cool so what were you doing this is the
15th anniversary of the JCP what were
you doing 15 years ago in 1999 1999 I
was just getting my hands dirty with web
programming I guess because that's
around the time when I was in like I
believe like seventh or sixth grade and
I was just trying to learn my you know
the first few programming languages i
started with basic and moved on to like
see and then like dabbled with like HTML
and in the middle and then finally
landed on Java which is my favorite so
call ya know I think I and I and I
admire the people like you know who
especially who those who take out the
time off there from the daily day-to-day
work and contribute back and be active
member in the community you know through
JCP and GSR that's just amazing yeah and
I think well we take for granted you
know growing up with programming
languages like Java and higher-level
languages what people had to go through
exactly actually do real hacking and
they didn't have huge communities and
Java user groups like all the resources
which we have today totally to learn
programming and to enjoy our jobs Sam
who's your favorite JCP member well it
has to be you man cuz uh hey Here I am
cuz honestly I mean I've been following
your work too but uh but yeah it's it's
you do a lot of evangelism to you know
you do you do you've been doing it
before you were at Oracle right you were
like Stephen java and Twitter and you're
like doing the job FX and and I guess
maybe that's one of the reasons they
wanted you into at Oracle because you
already really vente lysing and being in
the part of the community yeah no I mean
it's something I'm passionate about so
it's nice when you can actually find a
job doing what you enjoy doing there you
go call all right so we have some prizes
we have a book awesome thanks a lot this
is hello world first I guess for 10
years 10 years of Java and ended up
being on the night hacking program you
got one of the exclusive the sticker
laptops going on my lap oh today perfect
