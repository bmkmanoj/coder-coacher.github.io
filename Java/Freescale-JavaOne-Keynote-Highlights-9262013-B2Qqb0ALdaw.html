but I don't know what picture you have
in your mind of the Internet of Things
for me this pictures evolving daily and
moving ever faster the idea that edge
node devices can be everywhere in our
environment monitoring local climate
conditions monitoring mechanical factors
stress loadings and also traffic data
making smart roads happen over the last
decade the microcontroller industry has
shipped 150 billion devices into the
market the vast majority of these were
not interconnected they were single
local points of intelligence today the
plans for those products are becoming
ubiquitously that they will be part of a
larger network the other big change
coming is the move toward software as
the huge differentiator and today in the
embedded microcontroller community our
customers spend approximately sixty
percent of their R&amp;amp;D on software
compared to hardware development until
that becomes enabled by cost by process
technology by miniaturization and power
reduction will have a wide range of
subnet protocols this is the
infrastructure the landscape of the
Internet of Things all the way from the
cloud down through processing nodes
local connectivity networks all the way
to so-called edge or sensor nodes but
for us one box platform together with
Oracle and partners offers our customers
and developers an easy-to-use gateway
which means that instead of diverting
attention away from product development
at the edge node into having to provide
proprietary gateway solutions that may
work with only a few providers our
customers can now focus on the
technology development of their true end
application who will develop the edge
nodes we hope you we don't have enough
embedded programmers in the embedded
industry today to make this happen we
need to bring security modules trusted
transaction processing encryption
standards ultra lightweight low-power
versions of those to the industry in
rapid time scale if we can do this
together the internet of things will go
from being a concert and from being
things you read about in the Wall Street
Journal to our reality tomorrow and
certainly over the next year's II
