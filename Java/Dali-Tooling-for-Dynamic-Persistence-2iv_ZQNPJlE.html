new dolly java persistence tools project
at eclipse or software developer at
oracle and i'm here today talking about
actually just gave a presentation on
some of the new advances in the Dalai
tooling for java persistence we're
trying to understand and get more
involved with html5 web applications and
do do more in that area to solve
problems in the persistence realm so i
just gave a talk show in new technology
out of the clips link that we have
tooling for in golly that basically
allows it allows to us to put a restful
interface on top of a database and allow
html5 applications to very easily
consume this interface and get data from
a database so on the dollies tool side
a lot of work with dynamic persistence
and tooling around dynamic persistence
which is a way to declaratively to find
classes and mapping metadata together so
that classes are not actually required
this is interesting for web application
developers who may not have a background
in Java or may just not want to be
involved in building the amount of Java
classes necessary to have a proper jpa
implementation that they can utilize so
what this does is it gives web
application developers kind of a simple
but powerful way to access data over the
web in the restful manner and as a
result we can tool that in the dalek
project and it all comes together nicely
through Asia relative so that's what I
have to say it today about about my
experience at Eclipse console thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
