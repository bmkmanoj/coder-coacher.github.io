this year is make the future java java
was one of the pioneers in terms of
doing collaborative and open development
so we've been working with the community
very actively a lot of you bet your
business bet your careers on Java we
have bet our business from Java so
that's a very important part of what we
do there are three factors that we
believe are critical to the success of
Java the technology innovation of course
the community participation and our
leadership in terms of the stewards you
can see that in the last year we've
added as many new platforms for Java as
we're added in the previous decade now
what I'm pleased to announce today is
that we are intending to propose a
project to contribute this
implementation to OpenJDK as of today
we're announcing the availability of
javafx on Linux arm it's a developer
preview version as well as seen builder
on Linux you can see here there are many
exciting projects that are going on in
openjdk where there are corporations and
individuals from all over the industry
collaborating in order to make the
future Java this explosion of devices
that are connected 24 by 7 that tend to
stay on 24 by 7 is the next IT
revolution and Java we believe is the
right solution for this space it's the
most widely deployed but the least known
among the Java platforms java ee 7 is is
the largest release you can see it's
over 33 specifications going into EU 7
is the largest release that we've had at
least by that measure remember this is
this is your platform you know
participate with us join the JCP join
some of the specifications and if
there's something that you think should
be in there bring it in
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
