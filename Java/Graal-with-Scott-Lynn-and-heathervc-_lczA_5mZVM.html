swamp up and our second interview today
is with Scott Linn I'm Heather Van Kyra
so Scott welcome to the swamp up thank
you thank you very much
you gotta give me the microphone I'm not
used to sharing the microphone I'm sorry
you'd have to just remind me if I forget
all right so welcome Scott tell us a
little bit about yourself yeah so um so
I'm in charge I'm the product
sorry Arco Linux product strategy
director at Oracle very cool so yeah I'm
actually I've heard a little bit about
Oracle Linux not too much because I work
in the Java space but that's cool and
interesting though that your talk is
actually on a different topic today here
which is simplifying and optimizing life
on the edge withdrawal which I didn't
know what growl was but you've shared
with me it's the holy grail for DevOps
tell us just a little bit about you know
what that means how came to be call that
and why well I can't so growl is an
open-source project that started in
Oracle Labs I don't know if our if the
people out there are aware of that we
have a labs organization that does
research projects and they created an
open-source project where what growl
does is it virtualizes the language
environments so you know we've had
virtualization now for years we
virtualize the hardware then we
virtualized the US with containers you
get docker right now we're virtualizing
the language environments the runtime
environments and it's actually a
polyglot virtualization technology what
that is is multiple multiple languages
can run inside the same inside the same
virtual machine okay and all of the
normal infrastructure that's necessary
for two languages to communicate can be
removed because they sit literally in
the same in the same process well yeah
actually now as you're talking I think I
was doing some interviews at aura dev in
Sweden in November and I think Yaroslav
was there and I think he was talking
about grah you know Yaroslav and prague
no I can't say as I do this ok ok he
works
in the Oracle lab so actually that's
really the first person I met that works
in our class so you mentioned Oh
Oracle labs I don't know if anyone knows
we had a lab and I don't think I really
knew until you know I talked to him a
couple of times last year so he's given
talks on growl at a couple of different
conferences in Europe at Prague and then
I saw again in Sweden so yeah yeah
actually a interesting thing about growl
the growl project team is it's actually
spread out over what used to be the Holy
Roman Empire so they're all over Europe
so that's what I'm going to be talking
about today is how we can simplify
programming how we can simplify
development we can optimize development
you know Twitter is using growl and
they've seen a 25% boost in the number
of tweets that they can push out with
the exact same environment using growl
versus using a language the default
language environments like Ruby and
rails cool so you most about efficiency
for developers then efficiency and
simplicity because you can actually
interact two language environments can
interact directly the objects can be
moved back and forth easily and so you
don't need to do things like build a
JSON file and then have the other
environment read the JSON file are
transferred via pipe or something has to
encode and decode all of that you just
pass the objects back and forth well it
sounds like an interesting talk I see
your talk is right after the happy hour
I mean everything's in relation to the
happy hour for me today so when is your
talk I'm right before the happy hour ok
yours is right before the happy hour
ok between everybody and their boos all
right well something to do while you're
waiting for your first wine and then
also so actually I when I thought when I
saw your name to interview and then I
looked at it in your title I think it
was I figured we talked about Linux but
your talk today isn't actually about
Linux but in that vein though I should
ask you I was going to ask you so what's
cool about Oracle Linux and maybe
something developers don't know about
Oracle Linux since that is what I
thought I was going to talk to you about
today was Oracle Linux I was like ooh
I've never met anyone that works on
Oracle Linux before and I'm curious well
so one of the one thing that
people don't know is that for DevOps
Oracle Linux running you ek the
unbreakable enterprise kernel so we
support docker on Oracle Linux 6 unlike
our competition that's a differentiator
and yeah I mean I know developers love
docker that's the cool thing now so any
other cool cool tips maybe that people
what else don't people know about Oregon
Linux before we just close it out and we
go hear more about grow well it's free
to use it's free to update all of our
errata are available for free so you
don't need support to use it so you can
run it in your you can run it at home on
your laptop or you can run it in your
production environment without having to
pay any any piece all right well I've
learned a lot here talking to you and
even connected some dots about Grall and
the project and what's happening with it
so I am going to make an effort to come
to your talk today and learn more about
it nice to meet you thanks for joining
us
nice to meet you too thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
