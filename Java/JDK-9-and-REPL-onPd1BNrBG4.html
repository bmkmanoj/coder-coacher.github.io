and this is a night hiking at devoxx
belgium and my guest is Pavel and your
last name rosenblum okay it's
complicated it's supposed to be so um so
you so tell me first of all what do you
do for a living so do i work as a Java
developer for Swedish consultants is
called J way and so you did us a short
session wait yes I hadn't yes I had a
quickie it was about rebel yeah veneer
Apple that's coming in Java 9j shell
okay and so can you tell us what rebel
does well rapel is a read eval print
loop for java basically it's an easier
and faster way to evaluate small sips of
code so when will do something simple
and play around with things it's very
nice to have and and you brought your
computer with you and so you're going to
show us actually how it works yeah a
doodle quick demo yeah so i have java
installed on this laptop so I can start
today so just by doing so Jay shell is
right now is integrated with jovan I the
JD Kane I an early release right yes so
I'll start it and now i can evaluate
small sips of code so let's do something
better simple do plus term is creates a
variable of named all the one that has
the valium and i can use that value is
as expected if i can type it so i can do
math with that as well I can call
functions and methods there is a tab
completion
from my point of view the most
interesting use case is when we have a
new API that want to play with so in
Java nine we get collection literals so
I can do something like this starting
with Java nine collection set of 12 and
a clear set and here the Raptors or type
it is a piece of a compile-time type 2 I
would like know what the runtime type we
get and to do that I can just add get
close and to get much more information
so for me it's very nice way to vary the
api's or two Dementieva eyes okay so
especially with Java nine because you
have like new API is that you need also
to to yes or if you want to play without
a new library that you've never played
with before it's very easy way to test
new things so right now so if someone
downloads desk and they also test it
with dedicate or with the codes that
that they created before well it you can
just add a class file it's that is
command called open that allows you to
open any java file so I happen to have a
file called food a Java it can open it
and now I have access to some methods on
that cloth so so it's really simple and
very intuitive to to use the very easy
to work with very easy to play around
with near things and that is hope that
IDs and other tools get integrated in
some way so that we get even more
support to do things okay so where do
you find the information about about
those tools well ever finished well
varies manual as always but it's all
documented on JT canine homepage okay
and then you just download the early
access release and that's it yeah okay
simple did you cover anything else so
doing your quick session that means very
short question well I had a psychologic
mo but it was mostly about racial okay
well thank you
Bell for coming and demoing the red ball
tool thank you so much yeah thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
