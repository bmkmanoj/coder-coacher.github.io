you doing Marcus thanks fine hi Steven
nice to see you again it's been what
little over a week right since Joe one
yeah I'm still in recovery from from
Java one last week but you're looking
bright and chipper so I think you're
you're doing slightly better than me I'm
in my own time zone I can't complain so
this is my favorite conference travel
yeah absolutely so what are you talking
about here at order which are the were
the session topics you're gonna be
giving here actually I talked about two
different sessions one has a java ee
enterprise camel focus and the other one
is about how to secure your java
applications so I lessons learned some
stuff that the typical java ee
enterprise developer doesn't know cool
and also I think a big topic you've been
talking about recently is micro services
as well this is actually more like under
the covers because camel is something
that's been out there as a framework for
solving your day-to-day integration
issues and just recently people started
to talk about micro services and
honestly most of the companies out there
are kind of stuck with java ee in a good
sense because it's a very stable it's a
mature platform it can be very easy and
it can scale very good yeah that sounds
kind of a proven large-scale enterprise
so anymore again I'm not complaining but
microservices just require a different
architecture approach at that point and
java ee has little to nothing to offer
in that perspective there are a few
tweaks about a few things that you could
do but the real important parts are that
integration issues actually tend to move
out of the lower architectures like
centralized ESB infrastructure's now
into your services so you don't need to
solve all the integration issues in an
ESB anymore but you have like a teensy
little integration aspect in every
little micro service so instead of
decentralizing ESB so you could just use
something that is easy like camel just
put it in there okay so you're I think
what you're trying to say is the
java developers are pulling their hair
out trying to get micro services and an
architecture which isn't a good fit for
it right totally totally true i mean i
just recently wrote a little riley bug
80 pages easy to read go to my blog I
solid net and download a copy for free
it puts everything into context like
into an enterprise context what outer
architecture do you need like service
registries service discovery what
aspects do you really need to look into
how could integration work so it all
tries to keep enterprise developers on
track with the latest buzz words around
microservices cool so free book from
O'Reilly that you can download a little
bit more info about right you know
trending topics like micro services and
how to react with your business
containers dev of them fell in there
earlier the guy Frederick was
interviewing Pete hunt from google about
caverna tease you have any opinion about
the using that for deploying to dr
containers I do have an opinion I think
it's the all right so asking you if you
have an opinion what's wrong question
cuz I know you're I have pretty much an
opinion on everything so um seriously
it's the only way to put docker into
production because you need an orchid
saturation layer yeah what I like the
most is that many companies actually
contribute to it so it's open source
it's nothing that's closed its google
it's rad had many other companies
putting their knowledge into it and
actually we have a very nice open source
project around it which is called open
shift origin so if you really want to
run containers in production scale that
might be exactly the thing to look into
call okay and that leverages caverna
teas and other technologies to kind of
as a deployment architecture obviously
it's darker its coo Bernie teams plus an
orchestration layer a little bit of
DevOps features that everybody knows so
it tries to to close that gap a little
bit in terms of outer architecture stuff
that you need around your microservices
installations call so you're you're here
this weekend or dev what's the what's
the next big gig for you what's your
next I think I'm
flying out to tomorrow night's more or
less directly headed to Belgium ok your
box it's been exciting for me and
redhead nice yeah so I'll be there doing
interviews as well awesome line me up at
the box you're you're welcome to join
for another interview although i think i
think for DevOps we we need to have beer
at the table for the interviews yes
please i mean that's mandatory another
thing might be interesting divorce is
running kind of a life show so you'll
get daily live reports more or less and
there will be some extra non-conference
activities around and I are you going to
be doing some secret I i agree back
backstage interview right this is part
of it so we got to see a lot of speakers
day we're gonna see some backstage
activities and there's some other secret
things planned so i might run into you
and yeah we're also going to take kind
of best of night hacking and include
that in the DevOps live smells as well
so there'll be a little bit of a little
bit of everything mixing together for
the UM for the live stream there so
should be exciting can't wait cool
alright well thanks for the short
interview have I think he's already
given you a sticker um you did give me a
polo shirt polo shirt you probably
appreciate that it's better the sticker
is just too massive for me to mess yeah
I like just like teensie ones yeah I can
do this I consider a while fly swamp
sticker what about that one see this is
a privilege only people who actually
interview on the show I get it get the
sticker whenever kid gives you something
you better appreciate it right alright
thanks a lot David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
