technology Network we're here at the
floor of embedded world and I've got
James Allen with me today hey James hi
hi again yeah yeah hi again and you're
with the Indaba embedded group right job
global Java market development group ok
and so what's a company like Oracle
doing at a place like embedded world
yeah you would wonder at database
company hardware servers well Oracle
acquired Sun Microsystems and what that
came along with Java platform you take
that and see what's going on on the
internet and we're now going from social
media and further into what things can
be connected to internet and if you've
been following the market there's a
whole machine-to-machine movement and
Internet of Things phenomenon and with
that Oracle and its partners a huge
possibility for creating new solutions
generating additional value for the
products and services that our customers
are already deploying today at this show
we're showing that Oracle is actually
has the assets and a technology to
deploy and create these kinds of
solutions with risp and ecosystem
partners and so if I can take you around
a book today I can show you some of the
things we're doing with that what we're
calling our device to data center
platform that is a suite of technologies
from Oracle that can be deployed all the
way from device through the middle tier
and at our back end so that we can
actually take the data from these
devices harvested process it in a way
that we can take it and analyze it and
turn it into useful business information
that we get a better understanding of
our customers requirements our customers
customers and be able to then turn them
into new services okay great so the
booth is a big circle so what do you
want to show me ok let's let's take a
stroll connected and smart world and so
to greet connected smart world you need
a platform be able to do that because
it's very complex to integrate things of
various different technologies but
Oracle has through the use of Java
technology on devices through our
middleware assets we actually have a way
to go end-to-end and create a complete
platform for instance one of the markets
that could take advantage of this is a
automation market where you can take
things like a gateway and be able to
deploy services into homes we're just
here we're showing ability to automate
potentially a motion detector that can
be used in health care elderly patient
might be at home fix a fall can't get to
a phone but through sunspot technology
we have accelerometer technology that
can show that there was a fall event
capture that through event processing
technology we have in a gateway and
ultimately call the service provider
ambulance medical services to come enter
the home but also automate entering the
home as well through using RFID
technology and provisioning rights
management so that people can authorize
who has access to that home in event
that a person at home can open the door
themselves wow so sensors can just be
literally and everything right on on
grandma on the door in the ambulance
everywhere right it's a smart home with
the ability to deploy health care and
emergency services and the rights access
management great so let's let's keep
strolling and see what else we can find
here we're showing all of our pretty
much where's here I mean we're talking
about our technology from the Java and
their devices to the middleware now and
we take in some of our middleware
technology and Java technology and made
it fit into these gateways because these
gateways are kind of the Gateway to
deploying these services so we're taking
Java technology making middleware now
that you traditionally see on servers
things like databases event processors
the Java Runtime itself and build
deployed out in the Gateway so we can
create those services including the web
services another area in industry that
can leverage this technology is what we
call smart energy or we call building
control and automation here what we're
showing is the ability to use Java
gateways and Java technology power smart
meters power meters and in this case
we're working with our ecosystem
partners such as freescale freescale
crates standard processor platforms that
we deployed in these environments we're
taking standard platforms such as chip
architectures like arm
and operating systems like Linux working
with commercial partners like freescale
to be able to integrate these things
into actual solution for the industry
let's here you'll see a power meter
where the hardware's from freescale and
also a data concentrator that would be
something typically you see in a smart
energy deployment particularly from some
public service provider and its convey
Belov control appliances in the home
from washing machines to hvac systems
lighting systems and so forth and here
we're actually will show a tablet that
can display the information coming from
these leaders and we have various to
play you I technologies from javafx to
oracle application developer framework
wow so javis is an on a really small
device and then it can go all the way up
right yeah it's scalable that's part of
the reason why we have an end platform
is Java is on a device but it also runs
on the Gateway and ultimately it also go
to our back-end servers and then have
web services and the whole software
sector take the data store it analyzed
it process it but the thing is we have
Java is a common platform across what
that mean to make the communication
across those devices seamless it takes
the same developer skills to work across
the entire environments so you have a
more collaborative and effective
development environment that can be
shared thanks a lot James</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
