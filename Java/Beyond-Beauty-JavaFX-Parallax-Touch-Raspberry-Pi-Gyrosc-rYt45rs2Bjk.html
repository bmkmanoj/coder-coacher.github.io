today I know it's January is just the
beginning of the Year Happy New Year
everybody but they talk today hopefully
is gonna be fun
this was my idea for JavaOne last year
and to be honest video always looking
for how to have fun
what is the next thing that I'm gonna be
working with and what do we have out
there so simply I have my Raspberry Pi
how many of you have the Raspberry Pi
yes one two to you
so a cup of you might have heard about
the Raspberry Pi I already own a
Raspberry Pi is a lot of fun it's just
so many things that you can do with it
so we have the Raspberry Pi and then we
have a small screens that we can
actually plug into the Raspberry Pi so
you can actually have a display so oh my
god okay that's nice and then you have
all the i/o pins on the Raspberry Pi
that you can connect stuff to you so
last year I did a presentation here and
I think pretty much all of you were here
remember faces where we actually use
some of their IO pins and I decided okay
let's try something different there is a
port on these i/o pins are using the
protocol I square C and seriously I
haven't played with it before either
will be nice idea to do some research in
its find out what devices come using I
square C and what could I do with it so
I found out that a lot of the gyroscopes
and accelerometers use the I square C
and the good thing about the I square C
and I talked a little bit more about it
is there is a bus and I can connect a
bunch of skies there as long as they
have different addresses so I'm a cow
cool I have my Raspberry Pi can connect
stuff to the I square bus
what about gyroscopes accelerometers so
I have information about positioning
right then I have a screen and say okay
I love job effects because I've been a
fan of JavaFX from the beginning and
even though when we talk about embedded
we always need a UI right interface so I
come and I actually build my own kind of
tablet is homemade
it doesn't look as nice as the Duke pad
if you're seeing one from the Jasper
Duke path but but I'm proud of it
because it was pretty Duke path and it
was built by me so so we basically have
the Raspberry Pi screen horn make a case
and a gyroscope and accelerometer in one
chip that is using I square C so my
whole idea was okay I know we are not
embedded you eyes need to be simplified
we want to be simple UI but they don't
have to be ugly so I was trying to
incorporate some of the position and
information provided by the gyroscope
and accelerometer to control my screen
to have some of 3d kind of environment
without really needing to go into treaty
I started treaty many years ago at the
University I didn't want to go back into
just building a whole 3d interface for
embedded so that was the whole kind of
inspiration for the project do something
nice try something that I haven't tried
before and just again have fun has a lot
of have a lot of fun so again we I love
making things look beautiful that's one
of the things I'm always building you
eyes
the user interface they use last year in
a de box
it was a nice UI all built-in JavaFX so
I'm always looking for having
nice-looking you eyes which is actually
getting harder when you have embedded
devices so you have to go simply current
your eyes I didn't want it to be totally
static if we have a small device that
you can flip around turn you should
incorporate that information to do
something in the UI so as I move I
should be moving the screen and stuff
like that so I wanted to have really
dynamic screens that react to
positioning etc again job effects it was
perfect a fit for me and put it all
together was the experience and that was
about the talk so one of the first
question that had come to my mind we
have the Raspberry Pi you can had either
Java SCM better on the Raspberry Pi or
Java ME embedded on the Raspberry Pi so
first question is which one should I
take
so there are decisions that you have to
make when you go with Java ME embedded
you have a really nice API for accessing
all the peripherals so you have the
device access API that allows you to
very easy connect to prefer Ziya square
C SPI just general IO pins
etc but I didn't have Java fix so for my
project I really went through using Java
SE embedded even though I didn't have
the device access API on it as part of
it I'm going to show you that I found
another library available that allow me
to connect to peripherals in a very easy
way but again when you're talking about
a device is you really have to choose ok
once I really want to have UI another
style will be a little bit harder
because it the peripheral talk wasn't
part of the platform itself but again I
mean there is doable and correct me if
I'm wrong but I think SEM Barrett is
also looking to incorporate device
access APR in the future so that's
something that will be so
in the future but as it is today I have
to come with a solution for my
particular project so I want to walk you
through this all the talk that I have
today I blog about it so if you want to
go in more details or do it yourself at
home you can actually follow my blog so
we're gonna walk through the hardware so
the Raspberry Pi I want to spend much
time on it I think I have one slide
because they're being you know raspberry
PI's being around for a while and we
pretty much know about it I do want to
stop on the protocol again I'm not a
hard word person so it actually took me
a little bit to go back research see how
the protocol works and what the API was
doing for me
the good thing even though I show you
the protocol the api's have called hide
all the low-level details so it's
actually pretty good but it's good to
know what what you're using enabling ice
core C on the raspberry PI's so when you
get the raspberry pi documentation it
say it has highest score C and SPI
available and yes so you always expect
to connect things and start working
that's not true you always connect
things and never work so I found out the
hard way that ice core C is not enabled
by default on the raspberry pi so there
were a few steps that I have to follow
to actually enable the I Square C so I
document all that then the hard word
that I use there's no particular reason
this board that I use is MPU 9150 it was
actually very good because it has a lot
of information in one single chip so we
have an accelerometer and a gyroscope
and it also has a temperature sensor so
it was a lot of stuff in just one single
chip it was a little bit more expensive
we're talking about like 50 bucks pretty
much more expensive that the Raspberry
Pi itself but you know you can just just
change it and take a cheap accelerometer
I did want to have both a seller ometer
and gyroscope so if you think about it
what I was trying to do is have my UI
react to positioning right so like
navigate through the environment using
you know my movement on the device so
there are selador mature will tell me if
I'm doing an angle right so there are
selamat will detects things like the
like this and we're measuring against
gravity so I can find out what
inclination I have here what angle I am
doing while the gyroscope will allow me
to the tag if I have an angular
acceleration if I'm rotating right so
for me to move the screen if I rotate I
detect that by the gyroscope once I
stopped the gyroscope is not gonna give
me any reading because I don't have any
angular acceleration I stopped this is
when the accelerometer comes handy
because your celery meter is actually
reading some angle so I have to really
combine the angular acceleration that
the tech yes you're moving but once
you're a stop and you're doing an angle
the Acela domitor will give me that
information like okay if you're still
doing an angle keep moving if you're
flat
stop the movement so it really a
combination of of two things in there
accelerometer and gyroscope so again
this chip has everything in one so it
was easier they're registries that hold
the information with one next to each
other so I can actually read all of them
and use it so I just it just came handy
for me
why dad wanna know I don't want and it
used is core seed that I was the
protocol that I wanted to test on the
Raspberry Pi child board electronic is
the LCD screen they're supposed to have
a smaller a screen um I don't think this
out yet out there yet they're telling
that right there okay so I'm still using
the old one which is actually pretty
pretty decent-sized and we do have a
promotion code if you're interested in
getting your own screen for the
Raspberry Pi thing is very handy
then this software again I'm going to
talk
found use and I scored see again because
I was using Java SE embedded rather than
ME embedded and then I found out this
principle is parallax is nothing new
it's been used a lot especially in the
past year for game programming so
bringing that back a little bit and just
use it and again all effects for the
implementation so just a snapshot of the
Raspberry Pi again I'm not going to
spend much time on it here has them name
the the pins that we are able to connect
the stuff to and I'll have a better view
of it later on so what is really
important here so yes we know it has a
CPU that is arm11 system-on-a-chip kind
of package the memory is what really
interests us is the i/o connectivity so
we have some header pins and pretty much
why selectors courses because I haven't
done I did work with this before and I
have a summary of the demos that we did
last time but pretty much trying to do
something that I didn't do before so in
last presentation we cover serial
communication recover USB with a
Raspberry Pi and simple GPIO kind of
cover to connectivity again I squared C
with something new and again there are
many devices the more you search about
our square C the more cool devices that
you find like the Wii has a motion plus
we actually use I square C so you can
actually I took apart one of the eyes
one of those devices and try to plug it
in I haven't done much but it's suppose
yeah so they supposed to give you more
accurate positioning so there's once you
have the protocol working it's a lot of
great ideas I actually working on a new
idea that is actually long time ago when
I joined Sun
that's like 13 years ago
so don't make the calculations there 13
years ago when I first joined the team
we have a demo that it was a wearable PC
so you can imagine 13 years ago the CPU
was huge will have all cables are all we
have a wheel looking headset we have a
hand mouse it was it was pretty nice and
I think I'm I'm having the idea of
bringing that back because we have the
Raspberry Pi that is tiny I found a pair
of glasses are not a fruit that are like
$90 of course there are no like Google
glasses but they're pretty good and I'm
planning to take those support and put
it in a in one hat and you know play
with really wearable PC nowadays so it's
a lot of good ideas you know we say no
very useful but a lot of fun
so these are a little bit back on the
GPIO pins so here is the two pins that
we're gonna be using for I square C
there is one line for data on one line
for clock that we were we will discuss
later on in more details and we have the
SPI pins over here that I'm not really
covering today so this is in the past a
summary of the different things that we
did one thing when you're talking about
embedded having a console to your
embedded device very useful most of the
time you don't even have screen or UI so
straight from the Raspberry Pi you have
a wart lines but remember those are
using only 3.3 volts is the TTL level
and we need to bump her up to 12 volts
signals that's the standard for rs-232
so for that one we use the max 32 32
just to run up the voltage there and
have this serial console to the PI so it
was very straight connection just a
couple of
things connected so it's no no very
difficult this was one of the guys that
give me the most nightmare it was a
Robert that I have to put together like
within four hours and it has like a
million of screws and I always blame
Simon for it but it was cool the idea
with this it has a USB and if you plug
it into the Raspberry Pi and if you
rotate the USB device pretty much you
should be able to talk to it so the way
was done was using gni so I don't go
into details but pretty much we have
native code and then we have G and I
around it and some because it was very
low-level kind of robot arm we did have
to do some synchronization and
calibration so once you move it has it
can open and close one you open you have
to wait and you have to stop that
movement before you go to the next one
so very simple details and then also GPR
yos so you have a lot of GPIO pins
available in the Raspberry Pi so cool
things and easy things will be connect
some motors in this case we use some of
the Lego motors in the old versions and
again we use a dual h bridge and we were
able to control two motors are the same
at the time so pretty simple just moving
two motors in the Lego again pretty
straightforward connection with the
Raspberry Pi
and now I ascore see so again the only
reason why I went to square C is just
play with something new how does it work
and I found a bunch of devices that use
it so I found it that it will be like
really really useful to have that
connectivity ready dice
is used a serial interface and is
synchronous so the data is going to be
move along the clock signals so the
master will control the clock signal and
the clock rate can vary can change the
master has control of that unlike a
synchronous kind of protocols and it
could be bi-directional so this is a
little bit of data size so I don't know
my face over there is kind of blocking
my diagram so I don't know
you
oh when I when I took your video off it
cut the audio okay
sorry
no I can't hear me now can you hear me
now yeah I can't hear my head out okay
okay perfect
so basically there are two buses one for
data and one for the clock signal
there's only one muster at the time they
can change so one is late can become a
master and one master can turn into late
but there is only one master acting at
the time addressing a 7-bit address and
then we have a pull-up resistors
normally for i-square see you do
required or resistors the raspberry PI's
includes those pull-up resistors so you
don't require to have any extra
resistors in your system and we will
look at them at the setting later on a
little bit of information about the
protocol itself so you will have a
communication and an communication
signal for the start communication
signals who is going to happen is we're
gonna have a high on the clock and the
master will send a signal from high to
low while the clock is high this means
there's a start conversation for the end
of conversation again the clock has to
be high and the master will say a low to
high signal while the clock is high so
those are the two signal to begin the
conversation and to end the conversation
and then when you want to transfer data
so again we're gonna transfer 8 bits
long and after the 8 beings we do need
to send an acknowledgement so every time
the clock is high we can transfer data
so when the clock is high as when you do
the communication of data one two three
at the eighth and then the last one the
ninth is when the receiver acknowledged
that he got the information the whole
communication will be like this on a
stark condition and a stop
addition who you're addressing because
remember there could be multiple people
attached to the same boss
so who you're addressing to if he's
reading or writing and their next
knowledge man and then the communication
is star data and knowledge data
acknowledgement until a stop signal
happen so it's a lot of things going on
in the I square protocol the good thing
is you don't have to deal with any of
these low-level details because of the
api's but I just didn't want to delete
doses like because I want to show you
really what they work of the API is he's
doing again when I connected so seems to
be so simple I didn't need any resistors
so it was like 101 connectivity my
surprise is I score C is not enabled
there is like a blacklist file some word
that needs to be clean before I square C
is enabled so you need to add a couple
of lines under etc' modules you need to
include the I Square C I did install I
square C tools I think it was very easy
to allow you to see if you are actually
the device is actually detecting the
devices okay good so I finished very
useful it's not required but it's useful
and then there is a black list
so under et C mod pro of the D there is
a black list if you're in that list it
means that it is not working by default
you have to remove this line so SPI is
not enabled either by default high score
series not enabled by default so remove
those two lines before you can actually
do something
so again can you see the devices so the
picture is not very good but when you do
i score c detect you specify either buzz
one or zero
normally zero is for older version of
the raspberry pi normal is buzz one but
anyway so here you can actually well
barely see there is a device found
address 40 and there's an old ones that
is seen at address 70 so once you see
the devices again use your at least see
the devices then it's time to test
program in them under the deaf directory
you should see this
now SPI on ice core C should be in there
if no just right to run again multiple
with the I squared C def just to make
sure everything is working
so again just few steps that you have to
do for enabling I square C and SPI at
the same time so this is um the hard
word I use again no particular reason
for it just I found it useful this
particular board because it has an
accelerometer a gyroscope temperature
sensor a bunch of information in the
same chip
it has also a compact I'm not really
using the complex and also you can
adjust the sensibility of the device so
it's not the same if you're trying to
sense a wheel in a car rotating and my
rotation of the device so you really
have to adjust the sensibility and this
one allows you to do so
it has the pin a d0 the third one from
the bottom up allow you to either ground
it or not so you can have two devices on
the same bus there will either be 68 or
69 address depending if you ground that
pin so just by switching the less
significant bit of of the board not
really leaving to but just in case if
you need to you can ground one and have
two different addresses and then the
voltage supply that we need it was
perfect for the Raspberry Pi so
connecting things again so we have these
two data and clock signal and then
voltage and ground in some of the pins
so it was really one-to-one connectivity
again because of the raspberry has the
pull-up resistors otherwise you will
have to put one resistor between them
connectivity but no just one to one
pretty much ground to ground voltage to
3 volt is in the Raspberry Pi data to
data about Sun o'clock 2 o'clock it's a
really simple and then remember to
ground or not this pin over here and
that address is the one that you have to
use in your code so this is the screen I
have the 10 inches it's a touch screen
so it's actually pretty nice it's pretty
decent one and again if you want to
discount the the manufacturers child
Borg electronics are in Malaysia
the only drawback for this is the
shipping is a little expensive I think
the shipping for for the screen is like
50 bucks and the screen itself is like
100 130 140
so Shiba inus is pretty expensive
because it comes hold away from Malaysia
but I think it's really great solution
and again you can build my I was really
proud because my my daughter's they they
play with the iPad all the time I'm not
so proud of that part but my little
while so exact mommy can I watch these
neon days I'm like no honey does mommy's
work but it's there I mean you can build
your own low-budget tablet would work so
this was the first prototype we couldn't
really say yeah well that's fine so we
have this screen over here the part that
we don't really see and I put everything
on so the idea was to have over it or
everything on the same plane so I can
actually get the reading from the
sensors there was a light sensor I still
haven't corrected that it's a light
sensor for the for the screen so we'll
adjust the brightness of the screen that
comes with the screen itself touch
sensor for the screen goes through USB
to the Raspberry Pi and then I have my
cheap MP you 9150 and then I also use an
accelerometer so while I was testing
things I also have the ad XL 3:45 as an
accelerometer I just started with just a
seller ometer once I got a word
can I move into a cellar Roma turn
gyroscope kind of information so have it
both in the board and I just plug it to
to the pins I think that's good enough
thank you the cameraman for the software
again Java AC embedded doesn't have
connectivity doesn't have the api's
directly for accessing peripherals I
found this one wiring pi is a native
library it's written in C and it was
inspired by our doing a wiring packages
and it has all the core input and output
for the Raspberry Pi so it's very well
done has access to GPIO pins I asked
where CSPI Ward line so pretty much
everything we need it it also come with
a common line utility GPIO to program
set up the pins the good news about this
is it has a rapping about it so we have
pi for java so these guys robert stivers
and chris walls data awesome job and
they have pi for java kind of API that
is just a bridge between the native
library writing a PI talks at the
Raspberry Pi they are were actually a
Java one last year so they have a
presentation about the PI for Java if
you want to have a look at the
presentation and again they have a
groups Google Groups and their own
Twitter they're very responsive I is
interchange a couple of emails with them
with questions and stuff like that the
library is so good it actually comes
with some demos so you have actually
some worked some code to start with it
was amazing so you find your solution
around it this is a little bit of what
they PI for Java is so again all about
GPIO s how to export import set the
direction at the touch at the text
detection the state and again no just
for the GPIO s but everything is Corsi
SBI communication so it was really well
done
this is where you can get it there and
get it from Steve still have me there
but that's fine you can find it also in
my blog just install it check that
everything is there the samples
directory should be there and again it's
just just make sure you add it to your
class path for compilation and running
not rocket science they're very easy to
use again build them own system working
with demos or uninstall it if you just
don't need it
so come very handy so a little bit of
the code or how to use PI for Java so
the first sample was just to use a
switch connected to one of the GPIO pins
again in this case is number two be
careful the GPIO pins IDs do not
corresponds with the number of the pins
of the Raspberry Pi don't ask me why I
have no idea but they do not correspond
ok do the same okay oh do you know that
so in this case the the switch is
connected to pin T and then for the code
is X actually simple from the GPIO
factory you can get an instance of the
controller and from the controller you
actually get connection to your pin in
this case you are connected to GPIO pin
and how you're going to read it you can
add listener to your particular pin so
you listen to changes into your pin if
you're high or low or changing a state
and just print the information so one
method to to implement handle GPIO
European digital signal state change
then if you want to stop all the GPIO
controller you just shut it down so very
straightforward how to connect to the G
pios on here to the state and change now
for ice course is even simpler so first
you get a connection to your block to
your bus and from your bus you try to
connect to your device in this case my
device was 68
we're actually not seen any of the
comments on my code so these are no
block these are comments but that's okay
that's okay I can put it out with the
mouse that's fine
the funny thing again you plug things
and you expect everything to work right
away I connect the yes I connect the
sensor I was I was able to detect the
device but I was not able to get any
reading so no matter how I flip it it
didn't read me and give me anything well
I didn't know that by default this
particular chip is in its own sleep mode
so you have to wake him up and the way
you wake him up is by writing 0 into
registries we don't know it took like
the whole day or even more trying to
find out because the documentation for
the chip is like a 260 pages trying to
find out that you have to wake him up so
start reading so but anyway once you
find that out everything is easier so
just write zeros on those two registries
again just to wake him up and then
configure the gyroscope under cellar
ometer again this is I don't remember
but again this is part of the
documentation some of the baits are for
the sensibility of the device and other
others are for if you want to do testing
mode on your device so just turn it on
off some of the testing and
sensibilities I don't remember exactly
what I put but you can play with that
the tricky part again was these two
lines to wake him up once you're done
with that you I start getting some
readings okay
so for the reading so we have three X's
a data for the accelerometer and the
gyroscope x y&amp;amp;z each of them was 16 bits
so we need to read 2 byte two
consecutive bytes and put it together
and that was the x value and the same
for y and z so the way we do the reading
is you start on the registry that you
want to read in this case there are
seller domitor the information is
starting 3 B that's the first registry
and we're reading 6 bytes because we
need - 4 X - 4 y onto 4 Z and we have to
concatenate those so that's pretty much
what we would say a step on registry 3 3
B and read 6 bytes I can actually read 6
and 6 12 14 bytes because the way the
register our accelerometer then the next
two registries are temperature values
the temperature sensor and the other six
registries are the gyroscope so I can
actually read the 14 and use them so you
read the data and then again you are
concatenated their most significant or
less significant bits of the value that
you're reading and use it and pretty
much for the gyroscope is the same you
start at the beginning of the registries
43 and you're gonna read 6 registries
and then concatenate the 2 values for X
Y and C oh my goodness we have like 2
chocolate cookies and so that was pretty
much about the hardware you know how to
connect things and it's actually pretty
simple once you figure out the small
things that there's more things that
take the most of your time because
programming was just the easiest part so
a little bit of the principle going back
to the UI so I use
the parallax principle and it's we see
it every day when we are driving if
you're in position a you will see the
tree being to the right-hand side of the
mountain as you drive by the tree will
be located on the left-hand side nothing
has changed in the environment is just
your perspective your point of view on
there on the environment
so give you an illusion of death in a 2d
environment so the things that are
closer to you will move faster than the
things that are farther away so that's
the principle pretty much no new year
resolution okay I'm on vacation this
week so next next my new year resolution
I start next Monday so I have pigs a
cookie everything I found a very good
article about the vanish point when you
have when you want to do a parallax
effect in a small area and it's more
environment you can Steve I need like a
little bit less contrast so you really
need a vanished point hernan cortes
if you google his name I'm sure you find
the article if no I think I have the
link for his articles did up an article
about how to find the vanishing point is
is that points where the things are
relative to you when they move so it's
that point and the way he did it is we
cannot really see there is how wall here
on the right hand side there it is a
little better so he took two lanes
following the 3d parallel lines in that
wall and when they're actually crossed
does the vanish point that's what you
want things to move relative to he also
crossed to used two lines parallel to
the floor and to that wall and trace
that particular line here and then that
math allow you to
find out how fast or how slow each layer
will move in relation to the vanish
point for during the UI so again their
whole idea is to have layers as many
layers as you can have the longest that
it took for the project was to build the
UI because the more layers the more
reality realism that you're gonna have
in you UI and is what it takes the most
and again thanks to Photoshop I'm a
Photoshop addict I was able to create
the layers and create the layers and
play with the layers so consume a lot of
time the more the better the more layers
the better it is time-consuming but it's
worth it
so mine UI is a little bit of childish
this is the UI this is an environment
that I have a jungle where I have you
know monkeys dogs Alliance a river stuff
like that and I just gonna place them in
a different layers and try to move them
at the different speed so this is pretty
much how the final screen looks like
oops
so again of gel effects well this is the
JavaFX user group so I expect that most
of all of us love Java effects play with
it
like it I think it was a great fit for
what I was trying to do first I need a
nice looking UI easy to do with FX I
have to do a lot of animations I need to
move the screen so animation was a
requirement binding some binding the
values from the ratings from the sensor
to my layers so easy to update a X
number of layers multi-threading so I
have to have one thread getting the
information from the sensors but I have
to be responsive in my UI so I have to
have both so multi-threading was
required in my project and it was
something that I was mature enough and I
knew enough
to use it so I think it was just a
perfect choice for me again be careful
when you need to do things like that in
JavaFX
the UI cannot be unresponsive so you
have to keep you need to be listening to
something make sure you put it in the on
threat and the way then Java effects we
do it is through a task so you create a
task and in the Cole method is when you
do whatever it is the things that you
need to do so put it in a separate
thread so it doesn't block your UI and
the last piece was binding we are all
familiar with binding and the way I did
is each layer was bound so the
coordinator of each layer was buying to
some information of the sensor so the
sensor values change all the layers were
updated accordingly so it was very easy
to update all the layers at once with
that that should the demo ok so I don't
want I don't know if you want to show
something in here ok see I'll let me
power so we have a little bit more light
let me unplug my computer I can either
use Ethernet but I'm just going to
connect a keyboard so I can actually
type in the console on and get things
easier so have a mouse ok ok so we have
the PI coming up so we have the screen
so we have the Raspberry Pi yeah and
this is the sensor it goes straight to
the GPIO lines this is just the
connection to the screen the screen is
the ones that power the Raspberry Pi
that was kind of weird for me
so this USB is actually powering the PI
and then we have the sensor the touch
sensor from the screen goes to the
via USB and that's pretty much it we
don't have anything extra we have the SD
car what it's actually know is it's kind
of a sponge now yeah and then cover with
metallic paper so it looks like like
metal that is is this plastic don't be
fooled and some the Raspberry Pi come up
so all I'm going to do is I'm going to
log in okay I'm just going to the
directories wait I have the demos I'm
just gonna make sure that the sensors
are working
I'm trying to get into the right
directory hold on I love this tiny mouth
this tiny keyboard but sometimes typing
could be aa tricky oh yeah I love those
I'm gonna steal one of those so from
Brazil one of those is gonna be missing
just for you to know a case so let's see
if the sensors sensor testing it's
working so let's test the sensors I
don't know if you're able to so pretty
much we're getting zeros on one do you
want me to good well if I hold it up
it's gonna change so well this is I mean
it's not that interesting just a bunch
of values so -36 yes
okay so I said flipper you can see -
twelve twenty degrees twenty five so
that's actually the angle in degrees
thirty thirty eight forty forty three
negative and then going to the other it
goes positive and then if I go to you
and she get a pretty high on Y values so
forty one forty three forty six seven
and then it goes all the way to what is
there reading I cannot really see sorry
seven series yeah so it's pretty much
that's pretty good now if I turn so we
see that the reading we're getting a
accurate reading so we can actually
shoot the UI now is the interesting part
these are just numbers
okay hopefully so I need a slot so I do
some calibration hopefully it configure
the devices the sensors I take a little
time while it loads they the the
multiple layers once the layers are up
is a way better performance it's coming
up we have the mouse okay so we have the
screen so hopefully as I move sorry
Steve is gonna be kind of hard so you
can see how the multiple layers and then
the whole idea we did is as you move you
can actually see discover things in the
environment like treasures that are
hidden otherwise behind the layers and
stuff like that let me just pull back
and you can see if I keep moving the
layer she can see
the multiple layers on the top and then
you can play with the speed oh there is
another treasure here you can see you
can play with difference with the speeds
I mean if you want to move with faster
slower create more for me I think I have
like a minimum angle that is required
for the movement so if I just turn a
little bit it doesn't detect anything I
have a have a minimum of 20 degrees or
something so it's able to detect
something so you can play with those
value but the whole idea is you can play
with it oops
we cannot go very far us I have the
power let me put it to the beginner it's
actually 2d there is nothing is nothing
is truly 2d different layers so it's one
so there if different multiple images
one on top of each other they have a
layer ordering so the farther aware the
layer this lower it moves the closer the
faster it moves so it does pretty much
and then I have an animation again it's
a small one and believe it or not it's
just doing that is malaria takes forever
to create a UI so I put it back up let
me go try to get it back from there
and another improvement will be like
speed the more the more slope that you
have the faster it will move I'm just
trying to put it back to the beginners
know that I'm hiding it from you or
anything I'm just trying to go back
somehow that's it wanna that's you can
play with it a little bit so again yeah
yes registering the value I haven't
really measured that so I for me I don't
have I don't require like up like a real
time kind of response it was more like a
game so I wasn't too concerned about
that I was more concerned about having
something they gave me that that effect
that I was looking for well one of the
things that I want to do what a what
about PC is there is these device am
Tomic atomic ink that is um Canadian and
startup and what they're do it they are
doing a bracelet where they can actually
read your finger movement that gesture
so it can actually detects by your
tendons how you risk move or fingers so
they will do some gesture recognition so
that's my whole idea to have the
Raspberry Pi and being able to control
my Raspberry Pi with the risk just by
moving my fingers or my hand control the
UI so I was looking into flying an
airplane with my hands like you know
taking off low and you know going around
so and then but but they haven't they
still haven't released the devices so
while I'm waiting what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna use a gyroscope here in
my hand
and I'm looking for some band sensor so
I can actually at least add reading from
my fingers but pretty much it can give
me like you know the the reading of my
hands acceleration some I'm looking into
something temporary solution while the
Tomic wristbands are available I think
it's gonna be super cool so I'm again I
wasn't too concerned about I think I'm
reading I don't remember how often I'm
reading for the sensors I don't remember
to be honest yeah but yeah but again I
wasn't too concerned about that too much
of you know real-time reading or
anything like that because it was just
for you know having this impact so I
wasn't too concerned about that or going
into into that so again it may be not
very useful things but a lot of fun and
again that's one of the things that I'm
planning to do with their wearable PC
having some gaming devices so and there
is cool I don't know there are cool
devices out there a lot of them use a
nice square see that I didn't even
imagine now that I have a working
instance it's fun it's a lot of things
so I think that's all I have for you
again I think the Raspberry Pi I love it
I think is really cool device
you
running on Java 1 a 3d environment on a
Raspberry Pi so you can actually have a
very sophisticated 3d environment on the
Raspberry Pi so I think it's a great
tool is just your imagination that is
that's what you need to use your
imagination and see what is the next
cool things that you're gonna build Java
works great you can just decide if you
want to go with Java ME embedded or SC
embedded what what is more important for
you for me the most important was the UI
I really need it again opportunities are
limitless I'm just a lot of fun I think
technology is a lot of fun I see it
every day on my work I love my work and
I love playing with devices so let's see
what is the next big things that we
build it's actually extremely simple I
finish again what it took me the most
was creating the layers that's really
time-consuming the Photoshop are is is
the worst dance card we normally have
like you know graphic designers that
will do their job but if I'm a system
engineer trying to do their job they
take me forever so that was one thing
and finding a little stuff like having
things working and the broccolis thing
you know digging wise not working
otherwise the code is very simple it's
pretty much the layers each layer has a
position so the further away they slowly
move but pretty much is binding to the
values that are being read on the
sensors so it's pretty it's pretty clean
and easy code well that is not really
using that was using an old VM that it
was called the Squawk vm so I don't know
what is have you do you know the status
of this quark I think but I think they
are doing something with them I'm not
really sure
working on some new technologies we're
gonna be really say but the old sunspot
hard work I think is no longer being
pushed forward yeah so it had a lot of
the same sensor you thought you can
attach to Raspberry Pi but now that the
model for how people feel this episode
changed and again it has a different VM
and everything it was her squawk for
yeah yeah exactly yeah this is just SC
embedded so and use it just as an
additional controller and it's it's much
lower power than the Raspberry Pi it's
much harder to get good portable power
solutions where that's what I see you
can use your base station and bad
collective a despots yeah I mean I think
what you do today is you probably if
you're building from scratch you these
uh we're the new Java ME little power
boards coming out together with some
sensors hooked up using the same device
API that we support for Java ME and
little support for java SE in the future
and it lets you do everything with a
full java via either Java ME or Java SE
across both devices and probably the
easiest solution
okay so any other questions for Angela
all right so let's go a big round of
applause thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
