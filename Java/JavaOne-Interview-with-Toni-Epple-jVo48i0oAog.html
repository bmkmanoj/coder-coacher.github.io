and I'm doing interviews with javaone
speakers all this weekend next today I'm
interviewing Tony Apple he is going to
be speaking at javaone about javafx and
other technologies Tony how are you
doing I'm fine how are you good good
this is your my fourth interview today
so on this is even more aggressive on an
interview schedule than I did last time
I was driving through Europe and I met
you I try to set standards for overdoing
things very high you must be very
excited now javaone is not far away um
busy yes maybe excited once it gets a
little bit closer and I realized that
stuff is gonna all fall in place so how
are you doing it for java one have you
um are you pretty much prepared for your
sessions or still scrambling left i'm
still still in the middle of the process
of preparing everything because it's so
much it's there are so many sessions and
then yeah and you do you do like cool
stuff like you know real application
development and graphics and your the
standard for what you do is is very high
from what i've seen we're going to do i
hope we are going to have a lot of fun
because that is my main idea going to
Joe one and having fun yep and I hope
that I choose my own presentation very
nice so what sort of stuff you're going
to be talking about a java one what's
your main topics i'm going to be talking
about javafx naturally and i'm also
going to talk about netbeans and
netbeans platform cool and most of that
in combination with java effects and the
third topic out i'll be talking about a
specter browser which is cool croton of
a few been in collision with yarda yeah
exactly we going to have
to talks about this topic and they're
all of these talks are little bit
interconnected so I'm going to do for
example for for his back to browser
project which is a project that creates
a virtual machine written in JavaScript
well that runs in any browser so you can
have Java on your machine without having
to install it so you can have Java like
for for example on the iPad or on
Android devices and and for this project
I created an API that allows you to it's
that allows you to draw to it canvas to
html5 canvas using Java and I made an
abstraction on top of the other and on
top of that basically so you can plug in
other technologies behind behind an API
and one of these technologies is javafx
and since I have a game library that
I'll be talking about as well at John 1
i'll also use his game library to write
games in java that run in the browser
and on the ipad on android and wow so
your arm you're doing you're bringing to
life the cross-platform javafx vision
that i'm some was ever able to fully
pull off yeah it's mainly yarda that is
like who is making that possible but i'm
i'm one of the early adopters who is
creating visually attractive
applications at least i hope so very
nice very nice I'm looking I'm looking
forward to discerning you can give us a
sneak preview of um sure sure so um
there are here i'm going to switch up
switch to your desktop so folks can you
can see what you're hacking on we can
see that you're watching the live stream
that's that's good and netbeans yeah
this is netbeans and it's this is a
project that is available on github and
it
so it's a modular game library FX games
and there's a game engine which is the
most basic module and the game engine
gives you a canvas graphics context that
you can use its it's this abstraction
that I was talking about it to just
today I get some major refactorings that
it's not only using javafx but you can
also use this abstraction layer instead
and I've got a physics engine which is
Jay box2d that you can plug in so you
can create physics games like angry
nerds and stuff like that but um I've
got a time engine so you can you can use
for example this this kind of tight
editors that should show up now on the
on the screen so you can create time
maps and stuff like that we are the app
is shown up there now okay and you can
create games with that well like a
couple of sample games with that and
like one of the simplest ones that was
the first one but it's like I think it's
not a little bit more than that while
it's 100 lines of code or so um well
alright that's the wrong one and you can
have very simple games and just a couple
of lines of code and you can see the
physics engine is it rather overkill as
soon as it comes up on your screen yeah
ya know so you're using a physics engine
for a punk you see physics engine
profile and this is just a debug and but
i also created other games like this is
my demo for the physics engine just a
simple one and this is a demo folder for
the plane game engine not using anything
that
this is facing Gators very nice we can
hear the sound effects other goes on a
graphics now for space invaders oh nice
so this is this is basically so how many
how many lines of code is space invaders
with your your gaming framework I don't
know it's like it's just below 200 nice
and i also created a game that is
already using this is tight engine and
that is tower defense and there's also
in the in this project so you can but
the graphics are not very nice but but
if you switch if you change them you can
see that's nearly enough not to Berlin
so you can see so I did it a couple of
tutorials and blog entries about how i
created that's why it looks familiar i
remember reading part of your tutorials
along the way i mentioned it on the
spotlight podcast as well oh nice yeah
oh you're having way too much fun for
you for a full-time job yeah I I would
would have loved to do to work on this a
little bit more because this is the one
I want to show at 21 I guess at the
tutorial session how to create this kind
of games and another one um is like this
sample game here which is which is also
using tile engine and it's this kind of
RPG game title based RPG game and wow
there's a graphic bridge coming from the
refactoring from today oh yeah yeah but
still see um knife you could flick a
classic RPG yeah just
couple of lines of code you can create
games like this and they are quite
performance so we we had this game here
running on the Raspberry Pi and it's
it's really there are no performance
problems adorable so it's running same
speed it is running here so it's it's
really the library is really quite quite
nice and it's a lot of fun creating all
these games I'm trying to create these
games to really work on the API so I
want to eat my own dog food so I can
really find out what I can but I can
improve and so far it's I find my API
really nice was everything it's very
simple for almost everything there's
only one single way to do it that makes
a right way of course the right way and
the second doesn't work then you make
the API correct and you fix all five
sample apps which use it yeah so I had a
question from jim weaver whose on the
stream and he was wondering as a person
who a developer owns a software
developer in a training company do you
feel torn between software development
that you'd like to do and business
activity to you know keep the doors open
how do you choose like what type of
projects and and what would they be um
well I usually tend to to create fun
applications that that that helped me
with my project um so for example if if
I create new controls I recently i
created in a touch control which is like
this touch wheel control and that's
that's a control that I i will be using
a couple of projects that I'm when I'm
working with things you actually lands
that you'll make money on that one yeah
I i I'm pretty sure
and the nice thing about the projects in
that that you do in javafx is that most
of them are very visual and most of them
are related most of my consultancy jobs
are related to the or creating the right
architecture creating the tooling
creating the toolchain and like getting
getting the visuals right getting
everything pixel perfect and that is
something that is fun because that is
the nice I the business stuff to the to
the guys um who do the domain logic who
know the domain logic and I just happens
on the user and the artist on the
architecture so if you if you could
choose this is James follow-on question
would you be what would you really like
to be working on what it'd be games or
something different if you could work on
welding well games is definitely
something that I that I love to do I'm
not actually I'm I do not play games
that much yeah well you used to play
games apparently you have a good you
have a good sense for like classic video
gaming which retro video games coming
back like um you know playing like old
versions of castlevania or like you know
16-bit games yeah 8-bit game yeah yeah
that's that's fun that's that's just and
it's you can learn a lot when when
you're creating api's for 44 games and
and I learned a lot about API design
when i created this api especially since
i had yarda to UM to do some make a
refugee yeah no no yardas yarda is a no
go rocket science and catagory he well
he literally he wrote the book on API
design literally he actually authored a
book on that specific topic specifically
and he's had so much experience from
architecting Andrey architecting and
working through the NetBeans api's and
keeping them backwards compatible and
redesigning them over and over again
that he uses such an expert on that
topic and many other things it's it's
great to chat with him so we're chatting
about for Luke soon we're tearing about
jaroslav to to lock how do you say his
last name no I don't know Tula why would
I would say but but I I don't know he's
checked so I don't know better than you
do and I'm going to have two
presentations together with him about
his back the browser project and um yeah
it's always a pleasure yeah yeah I know
you're the art of might be making a
surprise appearance at on some other
prominent part of the conference ah I
can't expand I'm looking forward to that
cool alright so thanks thanks very much
for the short interview tony and i look
forward to seeing you in san francisco
and hopefully will drop back in your
neck of the woods for my next night
hacking tour and I'm coming up in
october november you always look talk to
have a good time and and uh I hope
you'll have a good time at deering cha
one as well be because it's probably
going to be yeah I'll have a good time
weighs over I think that's when I can
relax I can't imagine i'll try to i'll
try to leave you alone just say hi no no
you're good you're good popping any time
alright thanks very much done that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
