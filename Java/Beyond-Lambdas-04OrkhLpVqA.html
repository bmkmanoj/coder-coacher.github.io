welcome to the beyond lambdas panel at
Jay focus we are the the lunch
entertainment well you guys enjoy the
the fine Jay focus cuisine and with me I
have some of the experts in JVM and and
java language designed with me so we're
gonna we're gonna take a look at what's
coming up in java 8 and then look a
little farther and see what's what's
beyond so first some introductions for
our panelists so I'm gonna let you guys
self introduce Martine
hi I'm actually not a language designer
or JV mix bit but I am a major in user
of Java jvm languages so I'm gonna have
my opinions on that you're being
unusually humble today Martine I'm
Morris enough to Lynn I don't think I'm
I don't consider myself an expert on
anything very much but I write books
about things so as I can try and
understand them and currently I'm
writing a book about lambdas I'm Marcus
dogger and I work on the Java language
team these last four years I made will
be focusing on the JVM was a polyglot
platform and dynamic language is on the
JVM evoke dynamic performance the nos or
inscripted and stuff like that I used to
be the chief architect for the Jets and
the Jayhawk at JVM way back when okay so
the first person who did not belittle
themselves and say they were not a JVM
guru I think we have our winner here
I've not the Java programmer them cnc
plus 50 plus plus he just happens to
enable all the rest of us to hack
thangka well I could Subramanyam I
concern myself a student of computer
science I like programming I like
learning about languages so I play with
maybe about 10 different languages the
Java of course being one of them very
good
all right so I want to ask you guys for
the for the upcoming Java 8 release
there's there's quite a lot of new
features and stuff in it
what what are you most excited about
seeing coming out for the Java community
the two biggest things are the lambdas
in the stream API and hemodynamic
invokedynamic
and it pretty much sums it up so was it
invokedynamic was it seven it was but
the implementation had a couple of flaws
and it wasn't complete and we really
haven't seen many applications of it
before John eight
very good so the biggest application of
it is lambdas well in JRuby maybe yes
Charlie and Naz were and other engines
people have really started to use it
right now okay so with the changes for
invoke dynamic in in 8 it's actually
getting practical use with the jvm
language community as well as the Java
yes api's and there's stealth
performance work ongoing and you'll see
eight update releases with which will be
even better at invoke dynamic all to
working towards the long-term goal of
the Damian was a polyglot platform it's
ditched the J and just say the VM in the
future that's like me that's amigo that
would be very cool all right
anyone else wanna pitch in I'm also
gonna add the the g1 garbage collector
as a has been back ported to seven you
just to seven I should say but the
version in eighths doesn't crash my JVM
which is nice and yeah that sort of
early experiments we've been doing with
it especially on larger heaps but it's
performing actually really nicely so far
and I would add you know in addition to
these as a consequence more more the
more so than anything else is their
evolution of the JDK itself to support
some of these lambda expressions and
features
so I think the most the most interesting
thing about it is for me it's not so
much the technical aspect but the
culture change that lambdas are going to
bring them in this big push going on to
take Java to take Java forward which it
hasn't gone forward for a long time and
we are well you're gonna see it becoming
more like we're going to introduce the
habits of functional programming to a
lot of people who haven't known about
them before I think it's gonna be really
interesting to see how that works
yeah I totally agree I think the biggest
change is going to be not you know as
much in the language as it's in the
minds of the programmers using it so
you're gonna you're gonna take advantage
of lambdas in your C code now yeah wish
I could now I've been with a lot of Java
code these last two years which is a new
experience we like parts of the novel
and in for instance yeah nice and that
it's like Java C we always have to be
one version behind the current Java for
bootstrapping reasons so I'm afraid it's
dr7 there and in Java C Tim with
everything i rewrite in the functional
style with lambda it's like get rid of
60% of the code mass and that's not a
lesson exaggeration so I'm really exact
about as well being in a lisp guy as
well it's I mean it's it's not
everything he would want beautifully but
it looks like Java and it makes Java
easier so okay so we've been chatting a
lot about about lambdas and so to two
comments the first is I think I think
Stephen Colburn is probably rolling
around and screaming because nobody's
actually mentioned his hard work at the
date and time maybe this is a really bad
exercise well you're absolutely right
but I wouldn't call that really exciting
in the same kind of way mainly because
joda-time has been there for such a long
time already and I think I know anybody
it is arrived though the home only
finally it finally did who writes my own
production code against
really old data typing fee huh yeah
deserves all the credit for that yeah
absolutely they think the London Java
community some of you guys helped out
with Richard Warburton who's actually
was one of the committee's on jr3 Tim
and yeah we held a bunch of HEC days to
help shape the API things and I can't
tell you how much of a joy it was to use
a date and time API that actually made
sense and you know dealt with the things
like time zones properly yes fantastic
okay but you know actually I'm gonna I'm
gonna discount everything you guys have
said so far because Java 8 that's like a
a March thing and that's that's so close
it doesn't even matter I don't even know
why you guys are giving talks on lamp
does everybody knows about it
I mean what we should be talking about
is with what's coming up in future Java
versions so I'd like your vision what I
like your business I agree with it when
people invite me to conferences not want
me to talk about eight features my god
that's so 2009 I mean - exactly so you
know we're obviously we're not we're not
product managers we're not gonna set a
roadmap for Java on stage here but if if
you guys could pick features or
capabilities which you think the Java
community the Java developers really
need what if you were to the Java King
what would you be adding to Java to make
a difference I'm taking you away yeah we
told you strictly the Java language now
from GDK or we took in the JVM we we we
are not going to restrict and limit you
so yes I'll talk with a big elephant in
the room and the big elephant in the
room is how much we all love generics I
think I think what we really need is a
revisit of generics and really
indication available in the language I
would I would say that's one of the key
things to consider
so one of the things which I which
lambdas and some of the new language
features the stream API is a particular
force you to do it forces you to be
really good
understanding of applying generics and
Java developers it's been wet a long
time since 1/5 came out and folks have
not gotten any better at it like we were
we were looking at the stream API and
you know big trying to figure out why is
there question extends question super T
everywhere it's like oh yeah well
actually you're never gonna pass the
superclass in but because of the special
generic type rules you have to like
increase the bound to handle interfaces
where you could have possibly multiple
superclass interfaces applied to it and
it makes perfect sense when you know the
details of the generics implementation
but for the average developer it's not
very intuitive that's a fair point the
the generics part of the language spec
is probably one of the most mind-numbing
ly difficult ones to read and understand
and I'm not actually do anyone really
get I don't think I'm like Scala
generics are not touring complete I
don't say value types and which enables
a lot of other things I would say more
polyglot stuff because that's what my
brain is like strong tail call optimized
yeah we're different one place for the
JVM architecture we need fewer GCS
there's like still six of them which
comes on each other in a complete graph
and this two Jet's which make a
quadratic test matrix and like we need
to unify Andry architecture stuff there
to make it simpler and faster and that's
all I mean that's on the roadmap but not
gonna change any public API for anyone
it's just us starting the basement to
have to worry about stuff like that a
lot
some of the architectural choices that
were made in hotspot are at the end of
the road now like probably the c2 Jets
which pretty much everyone including the
market gold Jesus it's time to do
something to be able to get further I'm
implementing an optimization and it
takes like several weeks instead of
several days which it would in LLVM
we're in the old a rocket or in pretty
much every anything else so we're having
some math issues there after the years
yeah
they've been morbidly afraid to change
stuff in the jvm because of
post-traumatic stress syndrome from Sun
or whatever but that's gonna have to
start happening now and so I guess you
know you kind of have a good perspective
as a look at JVM guru who came in to
work on hot spot yes and having worked
on another JVM architecture so is there
is there specific technical debt which
you're looking at we're like this is an
area we really want to improve there is
specific technical debt both in the GBM
and in the infrastructure but both of
these are being addressed and we are
seeing a light at the end of the tunnel
but to me in 2010 it was like being
teleported back into medieval times when
we look at I think we're getting better
all the time I think one of the things I
definitely understand I've really seen
some JDK enhance but proposals going is
just getting Java closer to the beer
middle called closer to the native code
so I think we're seeing some proposals
about foreign function interface is very
good white where you know that sort of
area where hopefully we can start to get
Java to safely talk to the native s fix
instead of using some misc unsafe peek
and poke which is just dangerous and
awful but there's a lot of safe things
that can now be done and to make that
available to the day-to-day developer
and get you know some real low-level
performance out of the JVM would be
fantastic a big need for it where where
I'm from in London anyway the financial
sort of services space yeah so you see
lots of frameworks cropping up out of
the financial industry yeah for
extremely high transaction high
throughput low latency yeah some time so
forth so that that level of optimization
would give you guys an edge up in your
implementation yeah it would be great to
do it more safely in the city of you
know using these kind of undocumented
unsupported you know some miss gun safe
type fight mechanisms
yeah it'd be better for everybody
general oh well you're probably never
gonna see a generic public peek and poke
KP I know I wouldn't want to give that
to people like there are they shoes you
know you're just asking for sig faults
you'd be surprised how many people do
yeah I know some of the VF yeah and the
other thing that we're going to need for
high performance down the line there's
going to be Tibet to make better use of
the massively multi-core architectures
that we're going to get coming up so I
mean increasing the management of
immutable data increasing the amount of
immutability that we have yeah in long
term it's gonna be a big issue lambdas
are a step in the right direction
because there's a programming style they
encourage you to be do a functional
style but they don't enforce
immutability I don't think well nobody's
ever going to enforce the mutability in
Java I mean it's a blue color language
and it's gonna and it's gonna stay that
way I think but if it's gonna be
interesting to see how far it can be
pushed in that direction yeah I mean I
think collection literals is one of the
things that's being proposed which which
would be a great great step in the right
direction there's a bit of debate going
on about whether it should be mutable or
immutable by default and things but I
think every small step we we take to
make things immutable so that the new
date and time libraries in Java right
for example actually you know era
mutable by default which is a great leap
forward
I know id authors who try to supply a
coding style that enforces immutability
for your java code I've seen I've seen
some work on that yes I mean we've been
able to use a subset that actually is
immutable yeah as you said blue color
language statement based but functional
yeah I put on the blue color especially
for the guys yeah I didn't want to go
back to the real fight generics actually
hey not a concern there that could be
potentially damaging for jvm language
into operability
because if the runtime information is
actually kicked it's gonna be a lot
harder for other languages to poke in
and interrupt with Java in a in a
performant manner so I don't know if
people have put forward into that it's
beyond my realm of expertise but you're
thinking education might be bad for ya
true verification what might be bad
because how hell is JavaScript going to
be able to interpret what a what a you
know a dog object does at runtime when
it's been strongly typed well I think
the static tech languages certainly can
make use of it
I think dynamic type languages at the
programmer level menard and force the
type information but I don't think once
it gets converted the bytecode it makes
no difference after all it's the
compiler issue not the runtime issue
isn't it really efficient least a lot of
can of worms in the runtime as well I
mean it can't be implemented but every
object header would have to have a
reification type and I mean I can I can
imagine that'll be performance issues
getting it getting it efficient language
wise but there might also be issues I'd
be really well thought through before we
we head in that direction but if you
look at what Microsoft has done over the
years they've taken c-sharp and they
have introduced fairly decent amount of
reification into it not not perfect yet
but I think there's quite a bit of space
before we hit the problems I think they
also value types sure what I what I
would really value out of verification
would be if they sorted it out properly
would be to reincorporate arrays as a
reasonable datatype instead of the
instead of the current situation where
they have a completely different typing
system from collections and the whole
thing i mean that the inter operation of
arrays and collections is just a
disaster and I think and I think quite
serious for Java C that sorted but I
think they can be resolved independently
of going the fullest tip to full
reification to run so I think it's sort
of a special case which would be
incredibly useful to Java developers to
solve and it's probably a step that's
you know doable in a reasonable time
frame whereas full reification I don't
think when even if we were to go and do
it we probably wouldn't see it till what
ten eleven yeah maybe but they like that
before and there is also other like
things that look like syntactic sugar
them actually help you sort out the
collection confusion we're certainly
doing object literals for nine for
example that'll really help yeah Dibley
okay so we got a question from the
stream
somebody was asking Jim Weaver was
asking about reactive programming and
whether this unloaded a yeah whether
this is a pattern the lambdas api's
think possible or something which you'd
need additional language features to to
do properly with java well these guys
are mulling over it if you have any
questions in the audience you can either
just you know shout them out or raise
your hands or you can tweet to hashtag
night tacking and then I'm watching the
Twitter stream and all ask questions to
these guys which come in off Twitter so
please I think one of the benefits that
we have is really ability to use any
library compiled in any language on the
JVM so there's nothing really stops us
from using akka for example from Java or
any of the other jvm languages today so
while lambda expressions does make life
a lot easier
I don't think it is any anything more is
needed on the Java side itself it's more
of a library issue how we design and
develop applications it's not a native
feature to language you support by more
of a hygienic interface by a library is
more desirable I think yeah I think it's
a sort of natural language evolution
isn't it you get you get an idea or a
theory once it's proven itself over time
it tends to get built into a framework
and it may be either for that once has
really proven itself as a solid
foundation of computer science it
becomes a language feature so I would
say it's certainly too early to you know
fully baking reactive programming ideas
and to the JDK we use our X Java at J
clarity quite nicely from Netflix and
that in combination with levers you know
coming up in March will be also a
problem quite nicely I also argue that
in a way language that does a lot ends
up being largely less flexible so we
want to certainly keep the language we
used to be some somewhat of a core
features on on top of which libraries
can be easily built rather than clang
text in the
we did something on a certain level and
it's hard to really see where that
balance is but it's important not to
cross that line and make the language
more complexity and then in turn make it
less flexible you know rather than
saying here are the small building
blocks the most essential ones and then
you could build libraries with it it's
been a great strength for the Java
ecosystem that we do have this amazing
ability to build fantastic libraries and
frameworks and these building blocks on
top of the core JVM and yeah I don't
think the Java in the JVM should push
too far out to that space either and
sort of you know stop the creativity of
the community
it's definitely agree any more any more
questions from the world but were you
staring at Mecca he had a question for
you oh we have a question okay all right
thank you right and in the meantime
we're gonna promise all of the features
mark Reinhold see everything will be
delivered well I guess the standard
Oracle disclaimer applies enough any
purchasing decisions based on anything
we say because it might not be true
especially this is entertainment blue
sky thinking if you think this is
entertainment you really need to get out
more yeah well I'm still quite curious
about yeah I still want to see see kind
of jigsaw take hold in some way shape
form at least to split up the JVM and
Jenny care itself because it's just even
with the compact profiles it's just too
big to drive down into embedded properly
in things so yeah we should probably
also mention jigsaw in the context of
like you guys you guys are dividing what
permits on the stream he just asked
about jigsaw so he was wondering how
that related well it's gonna be the
release driver for nine I believe I mean
no jigsaw no nine just like lambdas was
for a Java so it's gonna be one of the
more important things that we did yeah I
would like to see a lot more of the
community certainly in terms of OSGi
interrupts and things like that get
involved really nice nearly I know there
was a project called project Penrose I
think yeah which was kind of half
started last year
and I think even if jigsaw arrives but
that sort of Interop work isn't done
it's going to be a bit of a disaster on
release it won't be as well used as it
could be yeah nothing is finished yet
but there been like three restarted yeah
I welcome the fact that it seems that
jigsaw is not gonna have a big impact on
the language no I think I think that's a
really good thing because I think I
think there's the the changes in in Java
8 are gonna take some time to settle
down so yeah it's been argued a lot that
they should be more disruptive but I
think it's deliberate effort
architecture wise to keep it there don't
believe the language as much I think
it's a good decision it's pretty good
because I mean this this enables the
embedded world a completely different
life I remember a Java JDK 1-0 back in
95 which victim 1.4 for a megabyte
fluffy I could carry the entire JDK on a
floppy in my pocket and did and maybe we
can get back there for the bare-bones I
mean it's nuts yes it's a bit bloated
isn't it when you download 400 mix of it
be nice to be nice to write hello we'll
do not have it take up 70 mega yeah you
know well I think while the size of the
JDK is is something to be concerned
about that the bigger problem really is
the issues people run into the
deployment when there is real collisions
and it's just insane to even think that
we don't have a proper way to version
libraries I think so it's a bigger
problem that has to be solved for you
know Hector price deployment much more
than anything else I think
okay so let me switch the conversation
so we got a question from the audience
and it was about how you know if you
look at the evolution of Java it's
getting higher level and more abstract
and you know a lot of the fundamentals
like you know 10 20 years ago you really
had to understand how machines worked
how you know the underlying code worked
on the device to actually do programming
and now you're so far tracted from it so
our programmers today coming out of
schools better or worse off do you think
think they're worse off I mean even
though you're on a fluffy abstract level
with the futures and promises and actors
from whatever you call it if you don't
understand what's going on beneath the
covers you're doomed yeah absolutely I
don't think it's true that we need to
know less I think we need to I mean I I
believed for a long time I knew how
computers worked as I learnt it I like
to have to Muse worked a really long
time ago and they actually did work that
way for really for a really long time
then I woke up of a few years ago and I
noticed hey they were really changed a
lot
and I think to be able to be an
effective programming now you really do
have to learn more I don't think that's
changed at all I think it's actually
become so more emphatically the case
I've worked on performance in the Java
project these last two years spent it
was absolutely essential for me to
understand how the hardware architecture
below me works anyway in order to get
the performance I needed so it's pretty
simple at the higher candidate comes to
us and like yeah ok see you did
Commodore 64 assembly demos in the 80s
and he will be good usually yeah so I
have a slightly different opinion on it
especially the fact that I actually am a
faculty I would say it really depends on
the school and also I don't think it's
fair to paint everybody with one brush
yeah think about an example in the
medical field there are general
practitioners then there are specialists
and there are going to be certain
programmers who don't need to get to
deeper levels as much as I would desire
to myself I would say they are fine on
higher level and then there are certain
people who really to go not just one but
maybe several levels of abstraction
below and I'd really understand the
deeper problems because not everybody is
going to do everything in the world and
it's not scalable to do that but I would
argue that it's sort of upside down
because why the brain surgeon is is a
very specialized thing you consider it
the hardware person I considered the
brain surgeon the Java person and like
going understanding what the hardware
does is being able to to simple a broken
leg because everyone needs to sort of
have some understanding of what's in the
Machine there is register machine below
it it's not gonna go away in a matter of
might you abstract it but sure there are
by by by the argument that our
specializations sure but sooner or later
you sit there with a core file and
customers screaming at you what are you
gonna do like well but I think the
education point of view some of the
flaws I see today is quite a significant
number of students not even knowing what
a command prompt really is to me that's
very dangerous Oh Arthur absolutely yeah
and and the other thing I would say is
one of the things I've been trying to
reset the clock is when students come
out of four-year degree programming in
either one language are one type of
language it's extremely dangerous
I would also blame the computer industry
for that to spend on the internet I mean
if you hire painters you don't ask how
much brown they worked with which is
like what they do when they say how much
how many coats to see have you written
in your life for life sure
do you know Java EE right these are
tools these are not the job right I
would argue that they should really be
exposed to to a fairly good extent at
least three or four fundamentally
different you know types of programming
and then they get to decide which one
they can have a preference over
absolutely
learning one thing really good shouldn't
be at the expense of ignoring and being
ignorant about other absolutely and if
you have to teach them only one language
like to be less I mean I think for the
Java developers today because Java has
moved away further and further from from
the beer middle and it's starting to
creak and groan under the weight of that
a little bit so in the good old days
things like JIT and the garbage
collector would more or less just take
care of these problems for you but you
know with with the hardware having
changed so radically under our under our
feet and with the amount of data that
we're now pushing through applications I
think at least for the next four to five
years Java developers are gonna have to
understand at least a little bit on what
goes on under the hood until you know
Marcos actually you know finishes all
that good work he's suppose to be doing
and it makes makes the JVM sort of
automatically adapt to these conditions
again so you've got a small a bit of a
small amount of work still to do yeah I
sort of computing what my hourly wage is
given the amount of time I work last
week and it was a bit discouraging maybe
Larry will let you go on his yacht for
for a week as a holiday to make a
counter-argument to work what I said
earlier to myself one thing that does
shift this quite significantly maybe not
necessarily down to the register level
but is to understand what impact
multi-core processors are gonna really
have yes I think that makes a huge
difference not having any clue about
what threading is and why things are
shaped differently on a multi-core was a
single processor can be really
disastrous for that brain surgeon was a
Java programmer dimension and that would
make a big difference
threading is a false god I mean it
doesn't exist on the higher abstraction
levels with the pure parallelism it
doesn't exist on the silicon either so
yeah so one of the questions we got on
the stream and this is kind of taking
what we've been talking about for
lambdas and api's to the next
abstraction layer which is a lot of Java
developers are actually Java EE
developers so what does what do the new
API is the new language features mean
for folks who are developing on on
enterprise Java Java 8 we have done a
lot of meet at a time annotations
there are various like annotation
containers that weren't there before etc
I mean I know very little about Java EE
to me Java EE seems to be you have a jar
file and you use reflection to
introspected for annotations and then
that's as far as that job II's or
someone else should ask that question
well so fundamentally if you really look
at Java EE I probably have a little bit
of a business pessimistic view but most
of what Java EE is doing is to protect
programmers from really hurting
themselves yeah you know hey you can't
be doing threading after all it's too
complex we'll take care of that in the
container so I'm hoping with more
immutability that becomes a more Morpha
practice with lambda expressions we
could be able to use build applications
with less reliance on those containers
maybe pick a more lightweight I would
say then what we have right now so the
effect would be that the containers who
will just become less of an obstacle so
so like you guys are all pretty much
agreeing that as the Java language
evolves you need less and less of the
specialty yeah you need leave ceremony
around the es yeah well it's like
looking at design patterns right the
more patterns we have is a reflection on
the quality or the lack thereof of the
language and a better language actually
requires lot fewer external factors to
be applied okay so let me give you guys
another zinger so should in future and
on our future Java is there a reason why
we would want to break backwards
compatibility
there are plenty of reasons why we would
want to you yeah there's nothing
that we can ever ever do we I mean
sure everyone fantasizes about it
scholar rewrites everything every
half-hour but we simply cannot afford to
if we lose the concept that that class
file that you built in 1996 doesn't run
with the newest JVM we will lose our
market share I will argue one point on
that I think security should trump
compatibility yes on the other hand if
he wants to curate the upgraded Java
instead of running that Java 131 let
your banking system in Japan has spent
the last 10 years as an excuse an
environment whether so I also think with
with the introduction of jigsaw the idea
of being a little bit more flexible
about compatibility you know it opens up
the discussion I think but sure but I
mean backwards compatibility is one of
the more important things that gives us
well I think well it's certainly got
value I think we have to compare that to
the cost of providing right it's it's
it's a it's a fact in life that when we
ask for something we always give up
something else and by asking for a
backward compatibility as far back as
1.0 there's a huge amount of things we
are giving up so at some point we got
decide how our backward is backward
compatibility so I mean deprecation
stuff I mean surely we can remove threat
stop now it's 2014
I mean that that's one thing that we
would I mean that's not what I mean when
I say that we have to maintain backwards
compatibility yeah but a serious
seriously breaking backward
compatibility would need forking Java a
man and I'm not convinced that the world
will be a better place yeah Chavez for I
don't think so no but if you're using a
deprecated API it has been deprecated
for like three Java generations I mean I
don't what really stop doing that yeah I
hope enough to remove those could start
the orientating Java util take was
deprecated as well yeah get rid of it in
2020 I would ask you 1.5
far enough to look back or should be
even look back beyond that but I just
don't see a lot of code in the wild
running one for I mean that's a problem
right but you know large old enterprises
who built one job right back in the day
and that's kind of their equivalent of
the mainframe or the cobalt system that
was there earlier and they wrote it once
and they doesn't never touched it again
and so a big thing to do a proper
industry survey on how much of it's out
there but a picture there's probably
still quite a lot yeah so I guess the
question would be for somebody running
on three one five are they going to
upgrade their production systems to run
Java II know but I mean there's a limit
to where our responsibility ends I think
they don't right yeah we can't guarantee
I mean that's end of life support wise
as well now we can't guarantee that
you'll have like every security update
everything will be backwards compatible
everything will work if you just from
your side as well keep upgrading your
systems I mean no harm will come to you
whereas Scala is like okay I've a new
top version not nothing runs
so let's difference is there okay so
going back to something we talked about
earlier you got you were chatting about
having more you know bare metal
performance it's not quite being NATO
but closer to the so what do you guys
think about exposing more of the
hardware details to Java applications
like you know number of cores or
specific details about the hardware you
could tune the program is that going too
far with that get away from the
portability of Java or is this something
which needs to happen for Java program
that's necessarily going too far we
already exposed difference between the
original jello one adjust one Mouse
event because max were the least common
denominator with one mouse button and
stuff like that and I mean we have to
expose some of the things for the user I
think but exposing the corn say peek and
poke hearing and memory isn't a
different thing altogether the ideal has
to be the Mugen
we shouldn't want to expose more of the
hardware than we that we have to because
the JVM should be of the very area users
should be able to take advantage of it
for us the dream use gives you right
like parallel stream and it will use the
correct number of course for you and you
shouldn't have to care i'm sign it mean
i can understand that in some cases you
want to know more about the machine
you're running on okay the question is
often i mean it's usually a good way of
shooting yourself in the foot to try to
work around the vmware fool of vm you
have to do what you're doing
people have system g sees in strange
places which sometimes forceful GCS that
is strengthing some preferences they do
object pooling which just floods up the
old space on the heap and they think
they're clever by reusing these say i
mean that yes this is dangerous ground
with mines in it so you have to you have
to be careful but just reading like
system properties i don't see the harm
in that because sometimes it's even
useful in different environments okay
and then something else we talked about
before was tail recursion as something
which might be interesting are there any
other specifically jvm language features
which you guys think are important going
forward things that would change in the
core virtual machine so i i've linked in
one thing that i don't think we're gonna
get for a very long time but i'm a big
fan of meta programming so if there's a
way to do a decent minute programming
with java i would be definitely excited
but it's before thinking yeah they just
added a whole minute program i think to
scotland in the past year too and that
that was controversial even for the
scala community the amount of
flexibility and opened up for people to
shoot themselves in the foot well
there's always gonna be people who are
fearful of it and i can never convince
myself avoiding a language feature for
the sake of fear i think the flexibility
should be in the hands of people who are
qualified enough to use
but but having the flexibility can open
up so much more to develop lightweight
tools and libraries and framework that
is not so easy to do today in Java yeah
and so many security bugs but yes like
okay so let me switch topics to how
folks can get involved so you mentioned
jep's Java enhancement proposals here so
for somebody who doesn't work for Oracle
as a JVM language hacker what what
certain ways can they help to contribute
to the the future Java let the London
jug that's a prime example of success
there that we have with us so it's
probably a couple of ways if you've got
real resources and you've got you know a
really strong academic background and
languages iron ore VM design that sort
of thing then yeah sure go ahead and
propose a formal research chip or even a
feature JIT potentially but you have to
be prepared you in your organisation you
and your company to put in some real
years of effort right because anything
that goes into Java or the JDK or JVM
has to be maintained for till the end of
time hopefully right and it's a really
really serious commitment if you want to
contribute on a more casual level for
example you found a bug in the in the
string string API or or in one of the
meta libraries or what what is typically
called core libs so I guess which is
just purely Java code itself then there
is a new adoption group with an open JDK
and basically there's a whole bunch of
us Java user groups around the world and
some other organizations who have more
casual contributors to Java and we help
you learn to build Java we help you
provide patches for bug fixes we help do
things now like test the latest builds
of Java on all the major open source
projects around the world so nobody gets
any surprises signed and so forth so
it's called adopt open JDK if you just
Google for that you'll find it very
easily for join the main lists I mean it
is sometimes scary to just throw out a
question that might be deemed stupid on
the mailing lists but no one's gonna no
one's gonna yell at you and and
happier for you if your participates and
usually the traffic is high the
turnaround is fast so for example for
multi-language Java is a polygon
platform we have the MLB M dev list we
hang around a lot and check out the Open
Data kidnapped basically okay so I'm
going to toss out a backwards a question
on a previous topic because the lag is
the stream is slightly delayed in terms
of questions and then I'm gonna give you
guys a new topic
so the previous one was actually a
comment on meta programming from stuart
marks and he's wondering stable that
includes macros I would love macros in
Java sorry guys if you want to kill me I
would still love it I'm not ashamed to
say it those would be hygienic macros
Alya how'd you get back but still I'm
just gonna say no fight bring on mr.
kuffs are you gonna which side are you
on
well I'm an imma need to be convinced
for sure okay alright well we'll say
we'll save that one for later in the
parking lot how about so the the Stewart
maple who's running the new virtual jug
has a question about Internet of Things
so what sort of capabilities do you need
in future job at his support embedded
and Internet of Things devices needs to
get a lot smaller yeah
doing so will help with some of that
it's not the convergence needs to happen
there needs to they probably need to
rethink again the just-in-time compiler
and the support for that yeah also
memory management so memory memory you
know there are embedded VMs but they are
fairly primitive I mean I guess the
architectural visual the product
management business we can use one code
base and compiled for the different
tiers everything between embedded and
server where we're a ways from realizing
that dream but I don't think it's
impossible in the long run that would be
a wonderful nirvana but I can see for
example you know the new g1 collector
that's coming very much as geared
towards large heaps right so it were you
know we're not necessarily seeing the
same level of effort
put into the embedded side yet not
though I'm seeing publicly on the open
JDK yes and things anyway I appreciate
Java and bidded has had a lot of we have
too many things are completely different
for the same thing like two completely
different compilers the test matrix is
not a matrix it's like a hypercube so we
have to have to unify functionality and
I mean the product vision is that
embedded in server I have more in common
and more will come together I can
include invokedynamic on on the emitted
why not yes that would be awesome
I think one of the one of the tricks
here is to start with the question what
has to change to support it but rather
than saying what should be there to
support it and then see how we can use
what we have I think I think a lot of
times we are constrained by what what we
have and that may not be the right
approach to really provide some for a
different platform or a new platform I
think the if you look at it as a pyramid
there's not a whole lot of change that
has to happen at the language level but
enormous changes that has to happen at
layers below yeah so it is it is always
talked about to take what's existing and
move it over sometimes much easier to
just create something brand new and make
it efficient and then make sure it
compiles the same language syntax down
why Stewart marks even awake by the way
isn't it 3 a.m. there sue Stewart stayed
up just to see you guys that's pretty
cool that's out that to close out the
panel I want you guys to each think of a
presentation title which you'll be
giving five years from now you know on
Java and you can you can be as creative
grandiose or realistic as you want in
your title but MIT you know it could
come true I'll just take the easy one
rockin with Java for our game with job
could be anything now that's gives me
the flexibility so you your
you're taking the easy out will you
still be like 35 years from now I hope
so would see how would they get by then
right ones run everything right what's
right everything yes that that that was
a infamous tagline that we had for Java
for a number of years write once run
anywhere you guys need some more time to
ball are you know you're gonna fight out
how Java trumped the JavaScript
heartless how Java trumped the
JavaScript I bet anyone any applause for
that one ideally you have to start by
explaining what JavaScript was all right
so you guys in the IT industry this
JavaScript thing okay can someone come
up and tell me why afterwards because I
well yeah it would be it would be a
story of struggle and survival and I
would say survival and triumph all right
so give our panel a big round of
applause and thanks very much for
watching please enjoy the next Jay focus
session which begins in ten minutes I
can amuse by Stuart can you fly Stuart
