LOL oh that's you nice tree that's just
so so ask you thank you that's just so
it would be good to have some self for
starting ok perfect and there we were
streaming okey but not recording yet ok
welcome to night hiking at devoxx I'm
your employee from Oracle technology
Network and I'm here today with
venetia's and Yara hi hello so we are
talking about IOT so tell us so what are
some of the challenges of a IOT of
building our own project well there are
many many devices being connected to the
internet if you look at the history the
internet started in 69 with just four
computers in 90s it was all about almost
200,000 computers and now we are talking
about for billions and with
international things we supposed to have
at least 10 times more devices connected
to the Internet in the next two decades
so that's a lot of stuff to build we
have many different types of boards
protocols security issues privacy issues
different types of sensors different
level voltage levels so it's very hard
to to maintain the compatibility to to
to to have the knowledge to deal with
all these differences but but really the
main challenge for doing an IOT project
is to start sure right to have time and
understand what you want to do and how
technology can change your lives maybe
you have you know a kid and you want to
do something at home maybe you want to
do something at company at your company
but I believe the first main main
challenge is to find the project that
mom that motivates you and to start that
project right and especially with all
this complexity then it's a little bit
frightening to to start yes what to buy
what to write so so you you've been
working for a while on all those IOT
projects and so you came up with the IOT
surfboard and so what is the IOT
surfboard well we started in the IOT
space because of Java actually we
started with
sport I think that Java was ahead of the
time in terms of international things in
the history we had a Java ring he which
was the first almost the first wearable
in the computer history and after
sunspot we start playing wii far doing
word we know just got very popular and
we started building platforms to make it
easy for Java developers to start
playing with IOT and home automation our
first project was the J home automation
we want the Dukes Choice Award in 2011
with this project and so we make more
and more research about what the
developers are looking for to start and
we notice that they want to have
something complete because in IOT you
must buy the boarding when store the
censored in another store download C++
libraries and then after you build your
own device you start integrating with
Java so that's a long process before you
start doing the Java code that is the
most people want to do the Java code
with things so the concept of our IOT
surfboard is to bring something easy and
rad to plug and play wii in your machine
so just plug the USB cable in your
machine and you our gratitude to to
start reading the sensors controlling
the relay and we having the IOT
surfboard temperature humidity infrared
support relays real-time clock Raspberry
Pi connector 2g 3g bluetooth Wi-Fi
connectors so it's very easy to start
playing with our board because we
provide the hardware we provide the
filmer that is already uploaded to the
arduino board and we provided all the
api's for you to access the board using
cloud or using bluetooth for using
zigbee so is a very complete solution in
platform in terms of international
things so here another thing
is interesting is that you have lots of
challenges here when you want to
integrate like you want to know the
temperature and then you want to know
also the control the light or something
with infrared so you need to do first
level is coding to access these sensors
or actuators and then you bring this
information to a Linux can be a
raspberry pi or Intel Edison or your pc
or any other computer and then you start
working with that data to create the
business logic to create a business
model to integrate with cloud computing
through MQTT co-op or any other protocol
you have so the idea with the surfboard
was to focus on the Java developers or
developers that are already experiences
with cloud with enterprise with message
queue and all these things they already
know how to do in well design software
but they are not very use it to this low
level code for interruptions timers and
everything you need to code for the
board so the main idea was to create
this this small operational system that
runs on Arduino the few more and also
the the bridge between this software
that runs inside that we know that is
really tiny not that that's that much
intelligence on that just the data
gathering and bridge this gap to the to
your platform to your Java wear whatever
your Java is running can be the rasp
edson or your PC so all this code that
connects to the board and bring and then
push this data to a server or to a cloud
using protocols that Java developers
know like rest like JSON API is this is
already done so the idea is to offer a
playground for developers with lots of
sensors that they might want to use for
their own projects if they butt
it's not closed so everything is there
and it's open you have all the
connectivity for connecting to other
sensors as well so that's a very good
playground to start but it's an open
playground so you can connect almost any
other thing you want to that yeah and
the other thing is that here you can
replace the Arduino Nano you can take it
out and you can put any other controller
or processor so what we are doing today
we are using instead of using Arduino we
are using the Gemalto module so you can
have 2g and 3G connection and you can
have all the java programming language
to write your own gateway and you can
have a surfboard standalone connected to
the internet and it is the edge device
in terms of reaching the sensors and you
can have the gem auto concept boarding
doing the gateway service providing the
internet connection providing the obd2
over the air so this is the cheaper
version so we don't have java here but
we we have java running in the gateway
in the service but you can replace
arduino nano for a java board like
keyboard k 64 f from frisky so you have
many options to make it more
professional and start doing like
industry projects so just to be clear
when he tells about this jamaal to board
the multi boards run Java ME so you have
all the code to access sensors and all
that that comes with Java ME so that can
can be debt with Java ME or with java SE
you can run on Raspberry Pi oriental
medicine ok so if I understand correctly
i can plug this with any sensors right
yes like where do I get the sensors ok i
buy this and then what do i do yeah you
have a many onboard sensors I'd like to
the temperature the humidity alcohol
sensor which is a very funny one is not
connected here you need to put the
jumpers but but you have these in the
basic box you have the infrared sensor
light sensor
and to come true you have the relay you
have transistors where you can plug DC
motors and create a robot using this
control stepmother here and you have led
you have a speaker and so if you want
more you can use all the connectors to
extend the IOT surfboard and use like I
want to plug a salir o meter I want to
plug a LCD display so you have many
connectors to extend your surfboard and
customize it for your project ok so
basically I get this and I have pretty
much I can start my project right
exactly do a breathalyzer you don't do
you know an application that measures
the temperature of our house and
depending on the temperature it turns on
an equipment with the infrared it's a
playground by itself so you can interact
with anything that has a remote control
based with with infrared so you can hack
your TV remote control to send tweets or
you know to do anything that use
infrared for that besides being able to
turn on and off any equipment that is
turned on power source so you know that
you will spend lots and lots of hours to
play just what with what we put there
yes if you want if you are more advanced
user then you have you can use other
other benefits of the surfboard so as
Benny told you have the voltage
converter so when you are connecting
different equipment it's common that you
have one equipment that it's five votes
and the other three votes and so that
you cannot connect them together you
need this voltage converter you also
have all the protocols so if you want a
more advanced at home automation you can
use the power of zigbee to integrate
even with all the thing that you already
have at your home and Bluetooth if you
want to go to mobile and integrate more
with mobile applications so lots of
connectivity and things from the
beginner to the more advanced at one and
especially good for develop
evangelos or developer advocates who
knows as we used to to come to Java one
with big bags and boards and lots of
things on protoboard and everything that
was very complex to use as demonstration
so if you work with you know custom
demonstrations or for talks it's really
really easier right so yeah and then
it's really compact so it's really it's
really nice yeah thank you is a
four-layer aboard SMG so all the
soldering is made by machines so the
quality is very very very good we tested
more than we produce at 250 and no fails
until this time so we are very happy
with the results but to finish about a
surfboard something that our users in
Brazil they are doing with surfboard
simple stuff like if you have air
conditioning in your in your house and
you have instruments sometimes you don't
want to be aware with the temperature or
just the temperature you want to turn on
or turn off base it on the humidity
because humidity is very bad for a
sensible instruments so we have a
customer that he is ultimate izing the
air The Courier to take care about the
humidity and also the temperature
because most of the Earth's they just a
callable the temperature and another
very common situation in Brazil now is
summer very hot and the people used to
sleep with the fan so in the middle of
the night the temperature just dropped
and you wake up and you are sick because
it was too cold and nobody turned off
the fan and you were very heavy sleeping
and so you can use that to ultimate eyes
and make your fan more is marked because
the idea of IOT is starting starting
grabbing datas and collecting and
controlling things this is the first
step once you have the data you want to
take care about some advantage with that
data so you
start making the things more smart so
that's the second step and much more
modern mature there is a lot around this
step with cloud computing business
intelligence big data so internet your
things will be part of all the
developers life for sure yes for sure
but I would like to go a little bit to
another subject which is that what have
inspired us on the last two months so
what we did we we are interpreting the
words we were always working with
software software or training or
developing software and this is the
second board we have developed so but
this time we need to do a big investment
for creating this first batch and we end
up making a deal with a crowdfunding
platform in Brazil a platform that most
Brazilians know that is in Portuguese
and we want to have our first experience
with crowdfunding and after these days I
i just realized how much in common we
have on the Java side of the community
where people work with open source where
people's are truly makers right people
that are making things happen that are
making the future Java be different that
are making and creating the
specification through java community
process our community is a maker
community and all this maker spirit that
that's coming is bringing the same old
message that we are all aware that you
know that you can make the difference
you can make your your projects to be to
be to come true and to this 30 days
crowdfunding campaign it was a marathon
we had a goal and we need to achieve
this goal in 30 days and we need to to
teach to show to do marketing and you
know all the challenge that we face on
open source and I really hope to see
more and more hardware and IOT projects
coming from the java community people
have all the conditions to do that and
java technology is everywhere
and as Venus said IOT will probably be
part of a bigger strategy on most
companies so llevaron leveraging all
knowledge java developers and java
advocates and java architects they have
until now and just adding you know this
IOT part of the project or bringing this
to your own life at home you know with
your cat with your dog with your
children or anything it's very nice and
can be done so i hope it goes beyond the
java community right it's also like
everybody is kind of interested because
everybody has a home everybody wants to
control and not get sick yeah that's
true so there is a any some nice excuse
that you put two passions together like
you like dogs and you like technology
you can do something related you like
beers and you're like technology so I oh
cheese a bridge between passions
absolutely so thank you so much anything
else you would like to tell people who
won't you do start up themselves or any
just go for it yes I would say you know
listen listen a lot ask a lot get
feedback talk to people but you know
think about what what is your thing yeah
and if you are starting with IOT we
together recorded some raspberry pi
videos in the Java channel at youtube so
we have in english and in portuguese a
series of a raspberry pi on java video
so you can start watching this video and
having some fun we have some demos
controlling like a fan using 3g
connection so that's one nice place to
start yes a lot of the basics actually
in this video's yeah that's yeah and
thank you very much for this opportunity
it's always a pleasure to be here I hope
you keep night hacking and keep
producing all this great content from
for the java community well thank you
and congratulations for the first
business that not the first but the
first iut chrome fun yeah thank you ok
thank you you landed
thank you Thanks java and what is his
dreamy where is this wing it's streaming
