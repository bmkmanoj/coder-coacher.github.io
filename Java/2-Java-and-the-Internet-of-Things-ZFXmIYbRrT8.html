going to talk about Java and
international things if we look at the
Java history 10 or 15 years ago we can
see that Java is always with new types
of devices like Star 7 may be the first
tablet of the world or the Java ring or
we have even the same spot for
prototyping and doing crazy stuff with
Java ME so that time the internet was
all about people and devices and
facilities for people not for things so
we have the industry working on personal
devices like tablets and especially
cellphones and the companies they were
looking for enterprise solutions like
business-to-business as away integration
and things like that so now we have
international things as a big and great
reality all around the world and Java is
very prepared for that because we had 15
years of collaborative development with
companies and experts and JCP work the
great JCP work and java we have a lot of
tools open-source tools testing
environments and a lot of Riera
reliability with big companies big banks
using
different types of business and Java is
real much platform because Java was
created to to be operational system
independent from the hardware from the
type of processor so it's a big
advantage for interaction things with
Java platform we can have very small
devices to single word computer devices
run in Java we have Java card Java me
and beddit we have Java TV we have Java
C embedded for a computer with more
memory and more CPU and we even have a
version of Java EE for small computers
called Java embedded suite but for this
set of video we are going to talk just
about Java me embedded and Java C and
better Java me embedded is a platform to
small devices with very small amount of
memory and for headless application
without any kind of user interface and
you can run Java me in microcontrollers
with real time operational systems or
minimal operational system and Java me
is used all around the world to make
wireless modules for measurement smart
metering it health and many different
types of machine to machine
like cars running Java me inveterate
jhemini and method is not anymore just
about phones we have a real platform for
prototyping solutions with 3G connection
like this
gemalto concept board is a very nice
word for prototyping solutions using
Java me and 3G connection we have even
Raspberry Pi running Java ME embedded
and for bigger computers like Raspberry
Pi BeagleBone black and other we have
Java C and Java C embedded is the same
Java that you used to use in your laptop
but you can run in devices small
computers and you have java fact support
and you have a big set of arm family
support in java c embedded and the big
advantage is that you don't need any
specific knowledge to be an embedded
developer so you can use your regular
Java knowledge to write embedded
applications using Java as C embedded
and now the tools around the Java C also
so we can run Java C very well
on Raspberry Pi with nice graphics
support you can create amazing
graphical user interface using java fax
it's very well optimized by oracle so we
can do many different types of projects
powerful prototypes using Raspberry Pi
and Java and you can even run Java C
embedded in vigo easy through the new
version of vivo robotics platform you
can start JVM and job is seeing that in
this nice robotics platform so with Java
we can have an end-to-end solution and
we can use Java in other layers of our
architecture like we have this
architecture strategy and from the
gathering the data from the sensor in
reaching streaming managing storing and
even processing the business
intelligence we can use Java in all
these layers of process so let's go to
action if you want to download the Java
embedded platform as the case just go to
this URL or click here in the next video
we are going to talk about raspberry pi
so see you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
