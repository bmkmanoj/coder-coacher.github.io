conference my name's Steven Chen I'm the
java community manager for OT n and i'm
joined by bruno Borges are you doing
berna hi stated doing fine so we're
going to talk a little bit about the
cloud today so how's how's the weather
bruna the matter is pretty cleaning
outside so there's no cloud deployments
today nice cloudy day now like a cloudy
day to talk about a cloud all right that
was that was some nice cloud so let's do
an exception today exception yeah we're
going to talk about cloud even if the
winner is likes clean but yeah you can
talk about cloud that's a good point ok
that ok so I think you have a demo of
the Oracle cloud are you going to show
the Oracle cloud I can show a little bit
yeah but I like to cover a few things
before down so I brought these back that
I've been presenting all my sessions
yeah it's a pretty simple question why
should people move to the cloud where I
should developers move their
applications to the cloud and it's funny
because the first answer that I got is
scalability the second the second answer
I get is like I it's it's faster to just
have an environment provision the
maintenance I'm not going to do that
somebody will do that for me right so
they're a bunch of answers that are like
very technical answers why moving to the
cloud and it's interesting that all
those answers when they are combined
together to give it new a new answered
which is actually the real answer for
why moving to the cloud so it's cale
ability maintenance provisioning time
all that all costs it's one of the last
answers that developers think about
because developers don't spend money
their bosses do right yeah so the
purpose don't care much about cost their
bosses you so that in my in my sessions
developers are always giving the cost
answer so the resolver why should you be
to the club so as a developer the reason
I would move to the cloud is because
when when all those things are done by a
vendor
somebody that is provisioning the
environment the hardware the soldier
configuring optimizing all that yeah I
can care I can take all my time and just
focus on the application all the time
that I was expanding installing
configuring software I can now focus on
building the application on my solutions
and that gives me like better
applications and I can develop faster
and cheaper that's the actual answer so
when you don't have to care about
installing configuring optimizing you
just focus on your business out if you
get stuff done that's what just get it
done get exactly so that's that's the
actual answer on why should developers
think about moving to the cloud not just
about oh I want to use these container
cool stuff that somebody put out there
that's just a means to an end right
developers should actually focus on on
getting things done as fast as possible
and better spend more time on the
quality they have more time to test the
application so they have more time to
fix the bugs and so on this is this is
kind of like having a shorter commute to
work yeah so um in terms of Oracle cloud
11 interesting thing that people wonder
about Oracle cloud is oh is it a cool
cloth at I can use well the first answer
is you can use it is a cloud that people
can use but we are actually trying to
solve customers problems in the cloud
putting our own stack our own products
in the cloud so you're going to see
applications are a HC em ER p crm
applications in the cloud in our we
developers we can focus on the platform
now the platform as a service is the
part that is really cool this is where
are we going to have database java
application servers java containers
mobile integration all that that you can
use to extend all the SAS applications
so by by using oracle cloud itself to
extend sense you are actually using the
same infrastructure so you make the best
out of the
and you can develop fast one example
that I can show you is the new service
that have just released this week here
at javaone that is called application
container cloud service used to be
called java SE cloud service you change
names so this is the actual Oracle cloud
you're logged in today yes this is the
actual cloud we already have data
centers on different continents so i'm
going to log in to us too i'm gonna
provide my identity domain i have it
noted here and then i'm going to provide
my login username my username and
password hard to type with one hand
there I gotcha
so this is the dashboard that developers
will see when they when they are working
with companies that have oracle cloud
yeah and they need to expand their
applications this is the dashboard a
will access one one of the first service
they will access to is developer cloud
service this is a service they will have
access to source code project manage the
Hudson builds everything they can look
into like they do it github for example
right so they can manage everything here
so this is our spring boot demo that I
was building and it's all right there
the code we can just look it actually
live running on the other service that
is application container clubs release
this is brand-new we just released here
at javaone 2015 so this this application
container actually runs dr. containers
behind the scenes we have this spring
good application that it was loading
developer called service and this is the
demo running so you're actually running
spraying on the i'm showing separate
container clouds yeah because its
application container you can run
anything you can run pretty much along
will be very happy right Josh long would
be very happy I'm quite sure he will yes
I hope he tweets about this that's the
only thing that I ask for him so we are
not only like spring it can be anything
Java server side it can be a patch it on
meee it could be well wildfly swarm you
can do like a spark Java it's a cool
framework that can just be read services
in anything that you can start with a
shell script actually and then fire up
the JVM and you want anything you want
and last but not least you can actually
also build no Jas applications that
you're already running I think you need
to keep spring boot on the screen a
little bit longer ah yeah let's make
sure that Josh tweets about it okay so
um this is why don't you show that we
are pushing java and in the cloud for
anything wait wait wait go back up what
was that oh really greetings free food
spring food thanks Josh tweet about that
on Oracle cloud
right so on I hope I hope developers
will have the chance to work with make
the best use out of it oh you're the
last extension for the customers running
on article proud so you know use Oracle
cloud saves us commute time to work and
make it Josh long happy that's a yeah
great cell alright thanks to you for the
time no I have a session to do with Josh
so that's why he is that's why he's here
that's why he's here well I don't know
about that I don't know if I go with
that guy let's go wooden understanding
him and he is cool yeah okay thanks very
much for the interview Bruno thank you
man have a good question bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
