Tallinn Estonia and I'm joined here with
yevgeni Kabana or JK what do you go by
well you know I've seen snow but in the
company can pronounce if Danny who isn't
in Estonian so everybody just call me JK
either one is fine with me really okay
so you just said I put your journey
basically okay so and the afghani is the
CEO of zero turnarounds yeah or as I
affectionately refer to into big cheese
the Big Cheese the pictures you make all
the hard decisions around here like what
handle on do yeah what color the napkins
are and you know all the all the
important stuff none of the one of that
product or another but we're gonna we're
gonna we're gonna get you to do some
coding today right oh well yeah you
might well you might I might roll some
code that might be nice we've got we've
got Sauron on the stream from Jutland
jutland denmark you can watch the
session yesterday where sir and I did
some groovy effects a key he wants a he
wants a great cop sponsorship how he's
hitting you up for money hub live stream
nice nice absolutely not there you're
flexing your CEO already alright cool so
I mean I think what we'll probably do
for this is we we have some time with JK
now and then later on we're gonna we're
going to take a short break and then
we're going to swap to perhaps a bigger
room maybe we'll do it here but Anton
and some local folks will visit yeah but
I was thinking probably it would help to
level set folks and actually for the for
the one percent of the viewers who don't
know what J Robert ya know
you want me to show terrible just like
that no no no foreplay no nothing that's
truly to sharing jerilee alright well I
switching to my desktop now or what
Nathaniel that could be arranged ok so
I'm showing our website actually and
whoa so you know because I'm CEO I don't
actually have to know what the products
too so I have to go to the websites to
look up top but it looks like terrible
is a tool that has instant rule out so
you know so so so durable used to be
this ten-year-old small JDM plug-in
which would reload your classes on the
fly so that was five years ago when we
released it in 2007 so today it's
actually a fully pretty pretty cool tool
which does well which basically takes
whatever changes you do in your ID and
just supplies them to your running
application and this changes could be to
go there could be two resources that
could be to configuration and I totally
you know pays to just show what it
really looks like so so I'm just going
to go to my D which I don't do often
other day yeah the biggest things the
biggest thing that sucks about being the
CEO is that you don't get to write a lot
of code so yeah so actually next too
much fun in two weeks I'm carving out
some time to write some code so it's
going to be my my fun week right ok so
so terrible today you can install it
like in a very simple way from eclipse
marketplace I'm not going to show that
that's just a one-click install and then
like all you have to do you know once
once you got it in your clips or
IntelliJ IDEA or netbeans we have like
very very heavily integrated plugins for
free of them yeah definitely my my
colleagues in Prague would be very glad
oh yeah and that netbeans is good
nothing so that members is catching up I
think I was chatting with Anton he
me that you guys actually work quite
closely with the um yeah yeah because we
used to used to for support for netbeans
we had to do quite a lot of binary
fetching on the fly because netbeans
just wouldn't supply the api's when he
did but actually I think starting from
what's the current seven that one I
think was the last one we were well I
think starting out with the seventh
series they basically gave us all the
API as we need it so we could clean up
the horrible you know binary patching
medicine like they realize they realize
durables not going away yeah yeah yeah I
think I think they might have been
hoping for a little bit there but anyhow
so you know in the in the starting with
the five version of Joab lecture have
this very nice config center so all you
have to do to enable gerbils you just
stick off the servers you'd like to
you'd like to use with terrible so the
ones you'd like to I've reload on which
you like 20 application which were all
distant then you even can do like add
external servers or even add remote
server in the cloud or something so we
support pretty much any configuration
can think of and then you take off the
projects that you're going to use and
the resume in like this deployment URL
in case you have a remoting thing going
so you actually say which you know where
the application is running but we don't
need it I'm running everything locally
and so that's pretty much all the
configuration there is and you know if
you need your license and you get like a
evaluate license or a free license for
example if you run scholar doing an open
source project or just a non-commercial
project then you can get use it
completely for free that's good yeah so
anything non-commercial you can
basically get the social licence it's
going to post a tweet once a month on
your behalf but I don't think it's a
such a big price to pay all right so and
once you've got that going so I have the
Tomcat running I mean just for that but
pretty much that ticked off box and now
I can go to the application which is I
think somewhere here so it's like you
know very very ancient application it's
a spring pet clinic so I think it's
older than the company but at least a
couple of years
nevertheless s2 is a nice demo app
because it's you know everybody half of
a people you spring the other half use
everything you know still use Java EE so
so it's it's a good app and basically
what durable does is just a little bit
of magic that if I go you know change
some code and then go back and press the
button then the changes are just
reflected and there's not a lot to show
but that you know you can do some
refactorings you can can introduce a
method if I remember the shortcut woohoo
I remember the shortcut and I haven't
done that in a while and then you can
still do some changes and then you can
still all tab and like it's still going
to change so you know changes to code
changes to configuration you can inject
beans create new beans like great new
EBS basically do almost whatever and so
the vast part of durable is actually
something like 50 plugins which
basically do all this configuration
reloading so if I go under durable and
well it's the interwebs is a bit slow
today but anyway summer is there giant
list of plugins we have and this is you
know this is the complexity that the
main complexity of the thing is
basically testing it against everything
degrees with different yeah I'm server
different so I de yes I think it says
something like against 45 app servers
now so our testing matrix is something
like crazy just like you know it was
like something like 50 40 45 or
something like app stores I haven't
watched it for a while it's probably
also about 50 and then there's about
like you know thousands of tests against
different frameworks different
everything and just like this giant
matrix so it's produced yeah so that's
that's cool no no this is where I get to
ask you mean questions okay so this is
you can answer yes to know as a response
so does it work with java effects it's a
good question i think it should because
if it runs on jvm then gerbil should
work with it so i can just like Jay
rebel and then suddenly my
my classes every room now I think I
remember somebody was asking how to run
it with an applet view or something and
you know and if ya if you run Java fix
on desktop that's easy if you want to
try to build an applet I think they're
that was also pretty easy so alright so
we should we should get the charts on
point maybe eight hours I'm to enter
this problem in Atlanta yeah yeah live
code ya know Jeff I fix this you know
salons on the JVM so we don't care
because we work with white coat once
it's bytecode they told us a yes what
about are there any other neat tricks to
like areas you should avoid when you're
J rumbling like things you wouldn't
really want to touch uh well I mean we
don't support a superclass change so so
basically if you you know if you have a
but we don't have support changes to the
static type hierarchy so if you have a
class and it like you know extend
something implements something then you
can't actually change that so that's
that's you know that's what you were
still end up restarting for but it's
it's less of the you know it's not much
of a problem because most of the time
you just yeah if I know your kind of the
typical use case is the flick iterative
small changes to a big application with
you now I mean yeah I mean now users
just a thief from the conversations and
from the service we have then they
typically restart a few times a week so
you know so it takes down from like a
few times more or less an hour to a few
times a week so I think we're good yeah
so do so application servers have been
getting much much faster at restarting
as you know you can pretty reload
applications pretty quickly now so
where's the has I cut into the benefit
of Jay rebel or there's still quite a
lot of benefit because its people's yeah
so you know so it's funny to a point
because the thing that is slow is stupid
I mean okay so used to BES servers with
for small application servers would be
like brutally slow and I was very
annoying because you have like a two
liner and then it takes like a minute to
redeploy it so that was weird but I mean
like as soon as you have like a decent
side application and basically our
applications yet out of time towards the
SOL zeros so but you know it's it's it
definitely is a good development though
I think it actually maybe even got you
know the guys like websphere the guys at
weblogic they put a lot of effort into
that and I think actually the impact is
maybe less than they expected because
reality is that you know we see it
pretty well that application is the
significant larger impact than the
server startup time unless it's of
course ridiculous is low so there have
been some versions which were just
ridiculously slow so that's that's great
for development is this is a leading one
because I know you probably want to talk
about this as well so that's very that's
great for development but what if what
if I had like a live application on I
wanted to hotswap some some classes into
my production so here's a funny thing
like you know we actually build a
product initially which is called
library ball and which was pretty much
like you know that we you know people
asking us can we also hot swap that in
production and what we actually found
out is that our assumption was little
that our some fuzzy little wrong and the
customer such was also little wrong that
what they really want to do they don't
want to hook some things in production
they just want to have kind of the same
the same experience that they have with
gerbil which is very smooth very easy so
we actually you know where as we started
building a product which is doing hot
swapping in production then now we
moving more towards building this one
click update experience for applications
not necessarily you know based on the
same technology so do you have a brief
demo of that as well as a lots of fun
things so why liberal is our tool which
focuses on live production updates and
so it's growing up pretty nice so here I
have the actual live remote console so
library it manages application if
managers servers and it also gives you
an overview of what's been happening and
setup is really really simple it's one
of the things we learned is
just like with terrible you know it
actually more than tools should be
downloadable easily should be installed
beleza you should be configurable easily
because you know because your unless
you're doing consulting work you know
where you have to buy a consultant to
come and installed for you then it
should be very simple so we really ain't
that it could be deployed even in a
fairly complex environment you know in
in minutes like so inside an hour even
if you have a very complex environment
you have it set up and you know it's
it's working for you and so so I have a
couple of service they're on the same
machine these are Tomcats also I have
them grouped ask you a service and you
know and i have an application running
there and such a very very simple
application it sets our demo chat
application so i can say hello and i
have two versions of its actual running
so and yeah so that is you know pretty
much what it is but that's unfortunately
so it's a chat but unfortunately very
sad sad because it doesn't have smileys
we're gonna add smileys oh very girly
and you know and this is and this is the
experience we wanted to build so you
press update you select what service so
you can even you know do gradual rollout
so you can roll out to part of the
cluster whatever you want so you select
the servers you select the version so i
have a few versions upload it and
they're just usual wars with you can
specify like name and version when you
upload or you can put a small xml file
which you know specifies it for you and
then you slide the strategy so hot
patching is the one who inherited from
durable and it's a little bit cleverer
than durable because it's doing actually
static purification to ensure that the
object is actually compatible and if
it's not compatible is going to disable
it automatically so but otherwise it's
pretty much the same but honestly you
know a lot of folks are just using their
voluntary starts and rolling restarts
are pretty much taking down one server
at the time and automatically with
directing requests and sessions to other
servers well that's what
down so from the user point of view
nothing much happens well I mean from
the if if you if user survives pass the
time out his session is terminated but
you know you can set the timeout however
long you you want so I'm going to set it
to one minute because we didn't have
time to wait for 60 minutes yeah but
basically when I press update you know
then it starts running and one of the
cool things we did actually recently is
that and this was real you know this is
the new direction heading in is that we
kind of starting to manage all aspects
of an update not just the gel
application update but also everything
else around it so in this case if you
look at the versions version 2 and world
version 1 as well but version 2 has
libeled directory and this has some
scripts bundled with it so basically you
know one of the first thing we did here
is that if you need to update the
database if you need to change
configuration if you need to on smoke
tests then there are certain pieces so
you can just bundle some scripts with
the application and there are certain
phases when the scripts will run and one
of the coolest thing is that's all those
scripts are actually incremental so only
the new scripts will be Ron it's only
the difference between the old version
the new version will run which means
that you just can keep putting them in
and then you know whatever object you do
from a diversion to whatever version
just the only this crisis the deltas
yeah all the delta's run so we can
actually should be able to see it here
so if we go to tasks and details then we
can see that for example hi to is
running right so high one wasn't run
because it was also present in the
previous version and so the put you know
there are different types of things you
can you know update DB placeholder
script is here but there should be
somewhere more interesting one the
self-check script should run let's go
back a meanwhile can show it so for
example very very common use case is
also smoke testing right so smoke test
should run once application has been
updated but before it is visible to the
user so we have a special not a special
but we have a phase which is called a
pup and that basically means that the
application is up but
it but the next phase which is up
visible this is actually when it becomes
visible and the script will get a
private port against which it can chest
so this port is not visible outside the
local host right so and we have here a
self-check script which actually just
all this one just does a simple w get
but it could be running selenium or
whatever and it actually uses the direct
URLs which is like the the environment
variable with pass which contains that
which contains the privateer else of the
applications running on the that server
so so you can do all the testing and if
you actually fail then this is like the
cool part about liable then if anything
at all fails doing an update then it
just will roll everything back through
this on the previous version yeah and
and generally the ideas that just to you
know to basically save the same
operation teams from one point time but
from other point a lot of stress because
you can always you know you know you can
always roll back whatever you rolled
forward so do you have any best
practices or capabilities for dealing
with databases yeah so I was actually
going to talk about the next version we
generally don't talk about our product
roadmap but I'm but it should go live in
a week so so I think it's you know I can
talk a little bit safe yeah so the world
arrived will be the public beta but it's
so actually in the next in the next
month or so going all out to dot 6 which
will have like completely you know
built-in database management so it will
kind of basically 12 but the liquid base
with some changes so we first for
proposed just this kind of incremental
schema schema management because it's
pretty good and it will also for example
warn you if your changes are not
rollback able so it will do you know
ahead of the time verification and we're
also doing some other clever things
and one of them is actually property
management and that's the one that also
is fairly fairly cool so if you have a
lot of different environments and you
want to do you know you take one
application we deploy like is it like
testing environment staging environment
production environment many people many
folks have multiple production
environments so property management and
configuration management across those
different environments yeah yeah that's
that's tricky for large clusters and the
Appalachians well even for small things
like you know even managing things like
database you know database you are like
string of some of our passwords like
it's it's kind of a pain because you
have to manage the cross different yeah
I see in volume really bad practices for
ya database passwords or credentials
being checked in accidentally yes
exactly yes so so he actually now can
see the self-check script running and
like successfully saying that yeah
everything is fine so we can continue
the update so you know so um does any
this stuff work with cloud hosting with
what cloud hosting like let's say you
have yeah I know well I actually we
don't care we have like an application
centric you so whatever service you have
whether they're in the cloud whether
their local anywhere yeah it's doesn't
matter so you know cool so I've um I've
been poking the flips on the live stream
see if they may questions for you yeah
Andre Andre arm raised on the stream hi
Andre so he was going to ask you about
general plus javafx but I've eaten will
get the answer from Anton on that yeah
his next question was your experience on
class loaders yeah so he's wondering
when we can expect to see Java modules
product from the amount that means what
he says when can we expect a Java
modules product from them jigsaws nah
not too far away so he's wondering when
your stuff will will work with the mommy
module
as far as along with testing against I
mean jigsaw is us to I think fairly far
away because I don't think it's going to
make Java 8 yeah that so it's it's still
like a few years away but I mean we as
far as I know where you're testing
against all the new stuff so so I'm sure
our products will work like you know I
want us to say I'm not a huge fan of
modularity especially not a huge fan of
modularity based on class odors yeah
yeah because had some bad experience
with class sizes well you know I'm
actually I think one of the few folks
who understands class odors and that's
why I also understand that scary yeah
yeah you know the thing is that almost
every other like jello has basically
class or their months to double double
dynamic linking so most languages will
have a static model name or static like
naming and then like dynamic linking
against the name Java has double dynamic
linking where it may there's a dynamic
linking against the name and then
there's dynamic linking against the
class holder and that level of
indirection it's really creates more
issues data source problems oh and I'm
grabbing over with your mic yeah I'm
rubbing off the mic so there might be
some noise there while I'm clipping it
back on we apologize we blew anyone's
ear drums on the on the other line of
chair well that's really weird thing
there oh they're gonna fix the clock no
no I'll get it I'll get it it's just you
know it seems to almost defeated my
engineering degree but not quite so
Andres on to his comments back was osgi
too big jboss modules xml config jigsaw
vaporware yeah well Salem is built on
jboss models and I'm Tom just actually
did a blog post on Salem and you know
it's and just I just can't get excited
about modules I mean about netbeans
modularity that's Kirk's question it's
one of the simplest out there which is
definitely a plus and they mostly
the men beans guys are mostly clever
enough that they understand that you
shouldn't do dynamic updates with them
so they you know they disabled the
hobbits in production which is gay
because it simple is good yeah simple
simple is always better Oh Kirk says
getting notes ha oh it's it's simpler
than the other stuff let's say this way
I mean always ji has complexity on top
of complexity for at least from my
perspective yeah it's actually um so so
when I think you're going to be at a J
focus Kirk so when you're there we can
we can give her a chance to rebut yeah I
think anything he doesn't agree with oh
I don't I don't think we disagree much
with kirkham on those topics I mean it's
just it's just the wording you know it's
just the words we use and yeah Kirk says
it's been around longer than I was GI
netbeans okies rebutting that netbeans
is not osgi moduli or somebody on the
chad said it was same as it was based on
I was GI modularity no no no it's it's
it's my actually her funny part is they
you know eclipse which is that bolster
boy it was your I didn't used to be
based on that was Jai and then it was
much much simpler and then they migrated
at some point Joe is giant o Neill yeah
it all got much much more complicated
from there yeah yeah it's so um I was
thinking well well you know folks are
chatting on stream Randall you might
come back to the chat let's give folks a
virtual tour of the of the zero turn
around offices here so I have some I
have some photos and it's unfortunate
that you couldn't come like a month and
a half later because we we just outgoing
as new the new offices is imminent yeah
yeah it's imminent but it's not quite
there so actually this year moving all
three officers to bigger offices so well
three major ones is dr. dominant Boston
this looks like a good picture to start
with so this is
oh yeah the mail the main area here yeah
yeah we've got um bean bags on the floor
you know some green carpeting and green
carpeting it's not extra grass growing
it's a carpet it's hard to say but hard
to tell but it's it's actually carpet
and the break room yeah so this is what
we call ziti cafeteria it sound kitchen
it looks it looks kind of cartoonish
though is that is that actually a
functional cycler yeah its sights it
takes XKCD I think by the way yeah
actually I think I have I think I have a
picture of the actual I'm really hoping
we have rights for that well if you
don't know it's too late yeah and
actually there's a in the same kitchen
that's not quite right side up with
sideways but in the same kitchen there
is a terminal to the New York Boston
Boston Boston office yes it's a virtual
window to boston though we're supposed
to its job you know why max but
meanwhile ymx are getting here we have a
just a small laptop on the window yeah
yeah in the meantime let's see what else
we have here more office pics here's
another angle of the main the main
office area oh and I like the chest
forward to we stop a chessboard like
that in my last company and we don't we
play very slow just games so we have to
at least in the company at least two
masters I think it's like you know the
gross moisture and then there's like 11
11 below that so and there and actually
quite a few folks will play chess fare
very well so I'm not anywhere among
those and you know in competition for
the epic chess award and now but but
some folks here very very good yeah and
there was an extra room back there and I
found I found a guy wearing a black
t-shirt I don't know what that but
what's that
Rawdon yeah yeah this is a big French
big fence across the I guess straight so
yeah actually that's um not tomorrow I
get day off tomorrow it actually sunday
Sunday's snowmobiling so we hang out
with a violin guys and I'll get some
life yeah Monday snowmobiles but monday
monday we're back live streaming and
we're actually going to have the bottom
guys all right and that here's the
highlight of the office this is the last
picture will show let me see which one's
right side up now that's the sauna yes
you can have a us you cannot have an
office in Estonia without the SONA that
was just hiding behind a random door on
the side here yeah all hidden little so
we're gonna you know we're gonna warm it
up in the evening get you drunk and get
some naked pictures great great I'm
looking forward to that one applauding
like streaming equipment or camera
survived that well yeah at ease a good
question you know cool all right well
that's that's the current office in the
new office is going to be even better oh
my god a new office is going to rock but
yeah I saw I saw something about a big
duck am I love to talk about the gun it
on top secret I don't know the darkest
secret oh I didn't say okay dude that
was the people in our street haha yeah
cool so what what else what else should
we show or what other questions do we
have on our on the stream we'd be going
for about 40 minutes so we're going to
wrap up in the next five minutes or so
yeah oh well well suppose have you got
for us I got one thing I'm going to prep
while your job while you're thinking
yeah well the comments on the old Phil
we're there's a lot of big fans of the
oatmeal actually I actually own the the
last the signed copy of the his last
book that why I cat's watching to kill
you so it's a very good one and some of
my folks in Boston had to actually stand
align for that so
big props to them nice
well any questions coming from Twitter
what not well comments on the oatmeal
that's good yeah people like the oatmeal
and if i can get this picture and we'll
have something to close out the stream
length but i think that was a good
introduction to zero turn around j rebel
Roy rebel Anton Anton is the uber geek
as I found out over lunch he's been
hacking on JVM languages and up to up to
six months ago he was actually probably
one of the one of the hackers doing a
lot of work on this stuff too yeah right
now right now use to be a more product
management right ya know he he wait I
think he's still a a geek at heart oh
yeah of course no we are all geeks its
heart I mean it's hello how do we both
have your budget moved in product
management so it's still very much fun
all right here's what i want to show so
i finally I finally got from Matthias

folks i'm interviewing our venkat
subramanian holly cummins gnome 10 and
heinz co booths nice to actually have a
trick question from there from the chat
oh yeah I saw that I saw yeah go ahead
and we'll mention the question and then
answer
all right it's trick questions toddlers
with a Star Trek there's a target which
why are you for what's the trick I don't
know yeah I don't know either I think I
think you sound like I'll try girls
guide to the galaxy honestly I think I
think you stumped us Andre what was the
what was the correct answer each I curse
guide to the galaxy honestly I mean it's
it fury that's pretty good but you're
talking you're talking about the book
right yeah not one of the funky know
what evers they made out I mean the book
definitely hear ya la vodka and actually
the zero Charlie called Bible sorry geek
Bible is sure you're joking you know
this book about Richard Feynman so
literally have it in every office unlike
its a manager reading it's how to eat a
guide on how to be a gig so guide for
how to be a gig from the you know the
one of the best geeks the the on the
quintessential geek yeah alright so
let's speaking of geek stuff yeah let's
give you
you
early confirmations on
you
and
well God some we're still holding you
know we actually still holding on some
folks to confirm and but we got about 10
speakers confirm or less confirmed and
we're going to be putting up the
schedule in a few it may be like it a
busy guy you like your geek and you run
a company and your conference organizer
well this is more like a geek out as
Malika obviously we're not doing it for
the money yeah but it still work it's
work but we you know we have 80 people
at zero Charles so we have you know we
can spread it around pretty nicely so
okay it's about seven people in the
organizing committee actually also have
a steering committee which we partnered
with Vardon and new for Jay and London
java community or actually folks from
those places so that works pretty well
as well okay all right so to close out
the stream we will we had a nice shot of
some tea here this is an awesome tea set
up which the the guys gave me some
really good party earlier today so they
the tea crowd here is very good I'm
impressed that they can do so much with
the UM the local water well extra lemon
this is not water from the tap its few
feelers yeah but you got you got to get
water it's straight from China to do it
the right way alright so what to close
out the stream Kirk asks if you have any
opinions on multi-tenancy oh my has well
I yeah not really actually I mean folks
sent it i think it's a bit overhyped
like folks tend to talk about it as if
it's an issue but you know i took you
some fairly large companies and it's
almost always cheaper to just spin up
another you know vm and then to
multi-tenancy so very large companies
with very many you know big sized
companies which i don't know if i should
mention names but just do one instance
pier one user and seems to work out
pretty nicely for them so so i think
what the dance is good if your app is
working for that but it's not some kind
of a you know not some kind of a super
buzzword that you should follow okay I
like DevOps you should follow the rules
devops devops religion but not mopey and
now i should note i'm not religious in
any any manner so the opsys also good if
it works for you cool alright well
