and this morning we have the pleasure of
talking to members of the netbeans dream
team and the founder of NetBeans himself
very exciting interview here biggest
interview I've had on the couch with me
here at or ahead last week so thanks for
being here let's get started with a an
update from kirtan telling us a little
bit about what's been happening with
getting NetBeans into the Apache
foundation what's the status there right
so probably the biggest news in the
entire software development universe is
that NetBeans is moving to Apache and
the reason why we doing that is to open
up the governance model and to get more
code contributions and to expand the
participation of the community in the
development of NetBeans and people have
been asking for this for years people
have been within the dream team outside
asking to be involved in the roadmap
which Sun Microsystems always drove an
oracle always drove and there was some
interaction with the community about
what features do you want and whatever
but it was always kind of Oracle or son
driving the driving the project driving
the roadmap choosing which issues are
important should be done and what we
wanted to achieve now is by moving
NetBeans to Apache having the first
development tool within Apache so we'll
be more or less the official Apache
development tool and focused on NetBeans
as a development environment as it's
always been also as a tooling platform
so anyone with any technologies that
they want to promote all the demos with
I'll be productive in they can create
plugins for in the NetBeans dueling
platform and of course as always
NetBeans as application framework so
organizations building large software
systems like at NATO at NASA at Boeing
and can continue doing that with in
Apache NetBeans but also contributes to
that on an equal level with everyone
else and there are no organizations in
Apache there's only individual
committers so everybody involved will be
equal and we'll all be working on this
project together with many developers
from Oracle as well so it's
it's gonna be good the feedback that
I've heard about the news that this was
intended to happen has been really
positive well good news around has there
been any updates since the first
announcement that we're moving that
direction I heard there were a couple
movements in the positive direction yes
so so we announced this just before
javaone an open world and we did a big
session together with james gosling at
napkins day at javaone and he said I
think I think to his words were
unspeakably amazed or something they
were like this to like unspeakably
impressed by this move to itachi and the
whole room was applauding and massively
packed out and since then and so there's
a whole process I mean apache is all
about process we we started with a
proposal the netbeans proposal which is
on the apache wiki which has been
accepted by apache and we are now in the
incubator and at this point you're
looking at the licenses of NetBeans and
seeing which ones are incompatible with
apache and we're trying to solve those
particular scenarios and there are two
or three places where we know that that
there are things we need to sort out and
we've actually gone through the process
and salted those out so for example
built in to NetBeans is a fork of the
java compiler and that's not something
that oracle is donating to apache so we
need to sort out how to work with that
and how to integrate that and whether it
can be developed at apache and we don't
want to do that anyway so all these
kinds of things we're we're working on
right now and we seem to be coming to
the end of that so now we're at a place
where we can almost do the software
ground which is a document that we have
to work on within Oracle and give to
your patchy and after you've done that
then we can move the code to the Apache
gets repositories and we'll be doing a
lot of experiments with their Jenkins
and with their release management and
one thing we're looking forward to is
having having a clearly visible release
management system because right now with
a net with the NetBeans there's one guy
who knows how the whole release
management structure works literally so
if it gets run over by a car we can have
a problem so this is one nice thing
about apache that everything is going to
be very clearly document and described
and everyone will be able to do the
whole release management structure for
example
sounds very exciting very positive
movements writing great progress are you
busy right so yarrow you want to share
what's your perspective as the creator
and founder of NetBeans how do you feel
about this well I basically share what
Guardian said I can just add that
netbeans as ID has a excellent
integration with maven sometimes I even
think about NetBeans IDE as the user
interface for maven and maven is Apache
project so how NetBeans is going to be
Apache project as well so the tool
widely used tool for building Jabba
projects maven will be at the same at
the hands of the same organization as
NetBeans so I hope we will find some
synergy and make this connection even
stronger and more fitting together oh
and so we have some NetBeans dream team
members here Tony what any you know
perspectives or thoughts on the move and
things are looking forward to once
things get started and there's more
ability to have the contributions from
community members yes sure so for us in
the NetBeans dream team we've been
discussing for a long time that we want
to have more influence for the community
in inside NetBeans and we had this been
able and dictatorship basically this
model that was driven by Oracle and now
we've got exactly what we want because
Apache is a community where everybody
has equal say all the initial
contributors I happen to be one they
have have an equal say in the system and
this is really great so we have to now
we have to basically deliver because we
got from Oracle but what we always
wanted and so now it's basically our
turn to actually contribute it and
of my perspective is so we are doing
Duke script development mainly and
actually viewed script happens to be
based on that means api's so what we
want to do is to contribute more and
closer integration of that into internet
means ID and we were really excited
about this move and I'm looking forward
to to being able to contribute more and
easier yeah so you mentioned the dig
scrip you had a couple fun demos that I
saw with you recently you have the Duke
to toothbrush is that what it is a
toothbrush freshman you had the
embroidery machine to was you know
embroidering Dukes right so did you
bring this something to show us so
actually I was a little bit short notice
to show a demo I can show you the I can
show you the juice brush so it's funny I
happen to find I I happen to find this
toothbrush and and I found out that you
actually have an API for that and with
Duke script it's very easy to create
applications for it so what I did was I
created a smoke mirror and since we're
in sweden i used ikea objects to do that
and so now if you if you basically start
brushing your teeth a minyan will come
up on your on your mirror and start
growing teeth as you progress with your
brushing process so that's one of the
demos that I did and yeah I was really
excited that this year at javaone I had
the opportunity to actually be in the
community keynote and have james gosling
this as the user interface to start the
demo james gosling has used this brush
can't you
goes in the monument in the museum cool
all right well I've are so we have you
here also from the dream team our local
netbeans dream team member living here
in malmo any perspectives you want to
share things that you've seen or heard
in the community around Sweden about
this news and from the NetBeans users in
community sure I think it's great news
that we're moving to apache I think I've
never been a Nepalese committer before
you step in since version for
professionally and I'll always provide
net being said my project I say that if
you want what's the best study for java
ee development that's that means and if
you want to have me to help you choose
netbeans so so but now I've actually
registered as a initial committee for
Apache nothing so I hopefully to be
contributing cold as well and not just
promoting and using it I always have the
feedback enabled so every if it happens
to crash it doesn't happen often but
when we get a bug report or something
it's automatic you submitted to get the
bug tracker so but now I hopefully
hopefully I'll be able to fix some bugs
as well and I think this is also really
good move from a patchi's point of view
because if we succeed with with the
process that we've started it really
proves Apaches model as well because
nettings is a really large project it's
one of the larger projects that is
involved with apache on that level but
also on the level of and we are bringing
a whole bunch of new contributors to
apache you know this this about 60
initial committers who are assigning
independent contributor license
agreements with apache and I'm for
example james gosling is now for the
first time and apache committer which it
wasn't that he wasn't that before and in
fact he became the first committer and
because as soon as i mentioned to him
that we doing this discussion with
apache like this was before java one
before any announcement I was kind of
like you know saying how would it what
would you think if we were to do this
and apparently immediately
right to apache and signed his license
agreement and sent it to them and then
he got an email back saying wait is
netbeans even you know in the process
where the pad seals even before anything
he was already signed up and he put
NetBeans and big capital letters on this
license agreement and I got an email
from Apache saying wait I know we kind
of investigating things but why is james
gosling suddenly interested in signing
up to your patch in netbeans so so we're
getting all this new energy and more
people involved in the apache process
which are so i think we also of great
benefit to to apache by means of the
smooth growing growing the whole java
ecosystem right so keeping you know
growth in all areas is important and
actions speak louder than words right
you've got people already signing up
right as contributors which is great to
hear any other exciting news or
developments that we should share with
the community coming here from ora dev
any exciting tidbits or favorite things
or passions that you found here at the
conference it's my first time at the
conference I've really enjoyed being
here meeting some of the developers and
it's kind of experiencing some of the
local culture in the city hall and
hearing from the mayor any highlights
right you want to share before we close
out the interview what we call or
otherwise maybe the SONA experience it's
definitely my favorite so whenever and
already I've happens is that on the
first evening all the speaker's going
this big bus to the sauna and you know
and and everyone gets fish and and and
schnapps and and then you got out and
you get this town and you're you're in
the zone and you jumping it to the
Icicle baltic sea right i mean that's
that's a normal thing that you do here i
would say oral it's it is a normal thing
i'm not the usual visitor to that place
because you have your own sauna in your
own house right when i saw this the
speaker's own experience of being
announced i thought that oh crap i need
to practice
but so so actually last week and I fire
up my soul not home just to see you how
long can i stay in there in these
temperatures yeah it's been a couple of
years since last time it's great
experience sounds like good fun you
watch Tony you are you want to share any
of your favorite moments at the
conference or doing the experiences
outside the conference here so one thing
that I really like on this conference
are the keynotes because they clearly
show that we are not just a bunch of
computer geeks but we care about the
society and the topics discussed here
are interesting important and I am
really glad to see this kind of topic at
the developer conference right to get
into some of the social and human sides
of technology and how it impacts our
humanity is really interesting anything
you want to share with us Tony before I
know you're heading off to catch a train
in about three minutes you need to head
out to catch the train I had an overall
great experience here I I was late for
the sauna because i love sauna actually
but i loved everything here and the
Wizards to the local to the local
companies we get introduced to a Swedish
culture and as the artist said it's not
just the developer conference but we
learn a lot about soft skills lot about
our responsibilities as developers what
we're doing about privacy concerns and
everything and that makes really really
compelling package it's the first time
I've been here and it's definitely if I
get reinfected not the last time all
right well thanks for the fun interview
it's always fun to get members of the
dream team together from NetBeans so
enjoy the rest of the conference and
thanks for your time don't come
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
