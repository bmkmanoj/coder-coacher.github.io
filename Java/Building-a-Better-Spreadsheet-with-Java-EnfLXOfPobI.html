and I'm here talking with August
Eccleston thank you for joining us today
yeah thanks for having us so what is
most unique about your solution and why
is it important well what is most unique
about our solution is the open thought
to pull to the non developer to take
advantage of thousands of many years of
research some Java coding and this Terra
coding is done by some of them some of
the best researchers and and
institutions worldwide now currently
these solutions are locked away in
cryptic IV is we open up all those
libraries to the end users and that's
the most unique project
well that sounds fascinating I'm curious
the software industry has months of
analytics spreadsheet solutions and on
the other hand a lot of data
visualization tools what was lacking
that motivated you to create something
new all right so so everyone is is
aiming toward end-user programming and
and and these these are tools they
deliver that in in a limited sense no
but if you look at for example in the
other tools we look at deployment and
compare that to our deployment model
then what we do because we are a IDE on
top of Java
basically you're writing java classes
now once you're finished with your model
you can deploy it into any java system
and just like any other child class so
the path from building the model to
deploying your solution into the into
production system is effortless you
basically take any job any library
created by by for example like we talked
about earlier the leap I our library you
download it to the computer and it
becomes like your collection of
functions in the spreadsheet from day
one
so from day one you have access to this
huge community is this huge number of
solutions and this is unique about the
system not no other system will give you
such an extensive and efficient library
of solutions from from day one one is
locking now concert is based on all on
open standards your solution is is it's
just Java code and whereas if you
compare that to other solutions you
usually have to do a rewrite
meaning that you know an analyst or Kwan
the creator suits create a solution
paper fine but still isn't usable it has
to be rewritten and that's because the
system has it locks you in a place we
lock you in and then Jeff the delivery
solution correctly we don't have that
there's no locking you one other thing
is that related to this is that once you
finish the creating a solution your
solution in the console and environment
you can you can throw away the console
environment and the solution is a
standalone solution without the
environment so that's that's a huge the
grantees and something which is critical
in many cases because you don't want the
tool to go in with it with this solution
into the production system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
