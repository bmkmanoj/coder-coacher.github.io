alive at the night hacking stage here
the hacker got in the Box Belgium 2016
with me I have a same Apple Simon so
what do you do and your daily work wow I
hope my boss doesn't watch this I tend
to travel to conferences drink with my
friends eat with my friends hang out
with my friends and that's pretty much
it that sounds like a pretty cool job
you get a cool job yeah they're in
happenings yeah so as a developer
advocate for zero turn around or any
developer advocate really it's it's
about awareness it's about goodwill for
the community and it's about you know
also allowing people to understand the
kind of stuff that the company that you
work for der does as well as just you
know educating people in the community
for helping out communities making the
Java ecosystem as good as it can be
alright so i know that you also a fellow
java champion and as java champions we
are involved with the community so what
do you do with the community as a double
champion so yes I mean there's a
different reasons as to why people could
be Java champions some because of the
work they've done insert and open source
projects for example from my point of
view I I did a lot of work with
different communities so I actually
started many years ago with the London
Java user group or the London the ljc
it's called the London java community
and basically I tried to I try to give
as much to that community to help him
run to try and help lead in terms of
what new things we can do help run the
conference help help with the
administration that kind of thing to
basically and also give talks and stuff
like that and so it's really you know
helping helping that community and
helping people learn about Java really
and of course recently about three years
ago I started the virtual Java user
group and this was really because for
years ago maybe I had a child with my
wife and we were like okay travelling
quite a lot what do we do and it's like
well wouldn't it be great if there was
if there was content
available to anyone who wants to learn
java or wants to you know learn
different things about Java and it was
available to them wherever they are they
don't need to be next to a jug or an
active jug and they can get the best
speakers in the world and not just hear
from them but interact with them ask
questions of them and things like that
so i created the virtual jug around just
over three years ago and it's already
ten thousand people strong 10,000
members strong we had a vdrug 24 which
is a 24 hour v jug conference 24
back-to-back sessions and and yeah the i
mean the sky's the limit with something
like the v jug so we just you know
enjoying ourselves and growing the
community yeah beejive 24 there's
actually been a big marathon of and
speakers and everything going under the
covers right I don't know how you guys
manage to do that yeah it was like kind
of like that you know doc on a water
horse won awards away you see that the
feet are going crazy underneath but on
top of the water you know this this
beautiful bird is swimming across the
water need a look doesn't look like it's
you know doing anything with much effort
but under the covers yeah there was a
lot of lot of work going on from a lot
of people myself obviously oleku who
helped run the v jug Roberto Cortez from
Tommy tribe ivan-san Ivanoff from from
SI p there are some great people who
have helped us and made this possible
and like any community we don't you know
it's not about one person we rely upon
the community to help and you know with
the java council podcast we have Martain
we have myself we have a tricia g that
it's it's a community that runs it all
right so pretty much calm and carry on
all right absolutely ok so we have some
people Simon thank you I Java I must
have been looking sober so thank you
thank you alright well Simon thank you
very much for this insights and for
everybody else watching please have a
look at the brittle joke and I suppose
that there will be an announcement
