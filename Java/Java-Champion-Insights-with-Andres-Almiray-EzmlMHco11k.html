with the Oracle technology Network
advocacy team and I managed the Jake
Java champions program and i'm joined
today with andres I'll very welcome I
guess I know how are you good and I'm
just wanted to ask a couple questions to
help kind of like let people know who
the java champions are and so the first
one is what do you do for your day job
well I basically work on every
technology almost every technology thats
related to java I've canoe in
Switzerland we love java and we also
love the groovy but personally most of
the projects that i couldn't be working
on every day to java fix ok and you know
when you're not doing that what is your
like how do you give back to the java
community since that's kind of a pillar
of being a job of a champion right one
of the things that i really like to do
is to contribute to open source i have i
started a couple of open source projects
10 years ago but since six years ago
what we have been doing to in order to
give back to the community is that we
started this group called the hacker
garden it's basically a group of people
that come together and hack on an open
source project of the choosing it can be
anything as long as this open source it
can be on any language although we
preferred he will be related to the Java
ecosystem in some way and at the end of
the session what is important is that we
pushed back there that contribution to
the open source project so we push Lee
we make a pull request or we write a
blog post or create a video something
that is mixed it makes it very useful
for the community and I've seen you do
this all around the world right at many
different conferences we try to to make
it as often as possible in different
places we have three different locations
in Switzerland bassel where the group
originated Zurich and loosen where we
run in almost every single month and we
also have the in conferences like this
one's had a box and we just ran it last
week at the box Morocco the second time
that we ran a hacker gotten in Africa oh
wow very cool well thank you for all
that you do and thank you for your time
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
