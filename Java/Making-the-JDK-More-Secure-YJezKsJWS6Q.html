session on making the JDK more secure my
name is Sean Mullan I'm the open Jake
JDK security group lead I also worked
for Oracle and if you want to follow me
my twitter handle is Sean J Mullen I
mostly tweet about Java security stuff
so it's a good way to keep keep up to
date on what's happening in this area as
we go forward
so of course the first thing I need to
show is the obligatory safe harbor
statement so here's my agenda just
before we get started how many people
here are familiar with Java security
raise the hands okay more than half of
you how many people consider themselves
experts in Java security isn't just me
and one other guy okay well the good
thing is you don't need to be an expert
in Java security to get something out of
this talk what I like to do at the
beginning is just give it a quick
high-level overview of Java security
there's a lot of components that make up
Java security so it's a I think I feel
it's a good way to as a refresher and
also sets the stage for the rest of my
talk because I will be discussing about
most of those components and a little
bit more detail so what I'm going to do
is start out with an introduction and
goals and I'm gonna go through the
improvements that we've been making to
make the JDK more secure by default then
I'll talk about some of the exciting new
security features and it just released
JDK 9 and then we'll wrap up with the
conclusion and pointers to more
information so before I go into the
introduction I just want to tell you a
little bit more what I mean about making
the JDK more secure why isn't that ok
here we go
so it really can be broken down into two
primary goals the first goal is to
provide you with a secure by default
environment when you initially install
the JDK so we want to provide provide a
default configuration that makes sure
that you're properly restricted by
algorithms that are either weak or
broken or essentially are no longer safe
to be trusted we really want to reduce
the risk of you know attacks to your
applications especially if they're
processing data over the Internet and
that internet may be susceptible to
attack that data may be a subset tool
attack the second goal is to deliver new
features that keep up the rapidly
evolving security landscape anybody that
works in security knows the landscape is
changing rapidly algorithms are being
broken new ones are taking place so we
can't sit on our hands we want to
deliver the features to you that helps
you build security into your
applications and meets the requirements
of today and the future so my hope is
that you come away from this
presentation that you have a strong
feeling that we're committed to both of
these goals and helping you deliver
secure applications so here's my one
slide overview of Java security now I'm
just kidding what I'm going to show is a
diagram of the different components that
make up Java security so at the lowest
layer we have the Java language at
runtime security component so these are
the things that are built in the Java
language that allows you to create more
robust and secure applications so things
like automatic memory management
different language access modifiers type
safety and so forth and then there's
features at runtime such as the bytecode
verifier make sure your bike codes are
well-formed and have not been tampered
with and then optionally you can also
enable a security manager at runtime and
the security manager acts as a central
authority for protecting your sensitive
resources from potentially untrusted
code
above this component we have a large set
of AP eyes and libraries that allow you
to build security into your applications
let's just look at each one of these in
a little bit of detail so over on the
bottom left we have the JCA
also known as jce which is our low-level
API is for cryptographic operations
things like message digests digital
signatures and so forth so right of that
we have a PKI component also called sir
paths and these contain AP is for
parsing and validating chains of
certificates and so forth above that we
have something called the simple
authentication and session security
layer in the middle we have AP is for j
sse that includes our AP is for SSL TLS
and d TLS which is brand new and JDK 9
I'll be talking about that a little
later over on the right we have api's
for verifying sign jars and up at the
top we have an api for the java
authentication and authorization service
so this allows you to do things like
user based authentication and
authorization and in the middle we have
gssapi and a Kerberos implementation
underneath it and over to the right we
have AP is for XML signature verifying
and generating XML signatures now the
nice thing about all these API is that
they are provider based and what this
means that you're you're able to plug in
different implementations of different
algorithms so the JDK itself includes
implementations of all the well-known
standard algorithms and and a few more
but you're free to go out use a
third-party service provider implement
your own service provider so it's very
flexible and extensible in that manner
and then finally at the top we have a
small set of security security tools for
managing security we have key tool for
managing the contents of key stores
certificates keys and so forth
jar signer for signing and verified
jar files policy tool is a a clunky
graphical user interface for editing
policy files it's actually been
deprecated and we're going to be
removing it from the next release of the
JDK so we I wouldn't I wouldn't start
depending on it now if I were you and
then all the way to the right we also
Reeb undle the standard Kerberos
utilities k8k list and K tab on the
Windows platform
so that's Java security in in a nutshell
so the next part of my talk I'm going to
be discussing the improvements we have
made to the JDK to make it more secure
by default so what are the specific
goals that can be broken down into three
different goals we talked about making
the JDK secure by default the first is
to restrict weak algorithms and
protocols by default so here we look to
industry standards recommendations for
deciding when an algorithm can no longer
be trusted and when we should start
deprecating it we also look at other
products what other competitors and
vendors are doing to make sure that we
keep pace with them so an example here
is when we restrict to jar files that
are signed with md5 md5 can no longer be
trusted for digital signatures
so these jar files are now treated as
unsigned jars the signature is
effectively ignored so it can't be you
can't do any damage on your system any
permissions that are granted to it will
be ignored the second goal is to ensure
our defaults remain strong so are the
JDK various api's tools and some of our
implementations fall back to default
algorithms if you haven't specified a
specific algorithm the problem with that
it's done for user friendliness so you
don't have to remember all these
algorithms but the problem with that is
what was secure or strong when it was
originally made the default usually
doesn't last over over the lifetime of a
JDK release so an example of where we
change something is we change the
default settings for key tool and jar
signer were changed from sha-1 based
algorithms to shot to based algorithms
and then finally the third goal is to
add support for stronger algorithms and
protocols we try to ensure that every
single security operation or function
has at least one strong choice or
alternative in the JDK and again the
history of a JDK support release can can
span
many years so often what we have to do
is back port support for stronger
algorithms from later releases to
earlier releases to ensure that those
earlier releases have as as as much
security as the later releases so an
example of this is when we back ported
support for TLS 1.2 to JDK 6 so now with
JDK 6 you can use TLS 1.2 by default
instead of relying on the less secure
TLS 1.1 or 1.0 protocols okay
the cryptographic roadmap has anyone
seen the cryptographic roadmap at that
URL raise our hands oh wow okay phew
okay so the cryptographic roadmap was
about a year ago initially published on
August 18th 2016 what we found is that
while we working on these changes to
make the JDK more secure by default we
needed a better mechanism to tell you
the users that these changes are coming
in other words heads-up many of these
changes have some compatibility impact
so you need to be aware that they may be
coming in case your applications may be
impacted so one of the primary goals of
the crypto roadmap is to provide
guidance to you for determining if the
change may impact your applications so
we provide tips tools for determining
hey you know sha-1 is going to be
restricted in six months how do I know
if I'm going to be infected so we try to
provide tools and tips for you to figure
that out the crypto roadmap also shows
all changes that have been released in
the past one to two years if you want a
historical perspective you can go
through all the changes that we've made
and there's quite a lot of them in the
last one to two years and very important
it changes may not apply to third party
security providers so if you were using
a third party security provider check
with them to make sure see if they're
complying with these respect
so here's a couple snapshots of the
actual crypto roadmap today the first is
just the banner at the top of the site
and the second is the top of a table
which shows our planned changes upcoming
in the next three to six months I just
wanted to go through the different
columns in this table just to give you
an idea of what's actually in it in that
table so the table contains one two
three four five six columns the first
two columns are the date and the release
that the change is targeted to and then
the next column is the algorithm or
protocol that is impacted or will be
changed the fourth column is the action
what what are we doing what is the
change and then the fifth column is how
to test or enable the change so how do
you how do I know if I'm gonna be
impacted by this change typically that's
a pointer to another document that
contains more information and then
finally there's a change log showing
what if we if we made any changes to the
entry since it was put into the roadmap
so let's just get to go through the very
first example October 17th
which is only about two weeks away and
the targeter releases our JDK six and
our 28th does anyone know what our 28 is
oh J rocket yeah so we still support J
rocket so it's still up in here on our
roadmap the particular algorithm and
protocol that's being affected is the
DSA public key algorithm and the shot to
24 with DSA and shot to 56 with DSA
signature algorithms what are we doing
we're adding support for the shot to 24
with USA and shot to 56 with DSA
signature algorithms and DSA keys with
sizes up to 2048 bits the reason we're
doing this is prior to this release
that's coming out for DSA keys we only
support sha-1 based signature algorithms
and DSA keys with the maximum size of
1024 bits
both of those are considered somewhat
weak and and somewhat risky there's
there's been you know published
weaknesses in those key sizes and
signature algorithms so we want to
provide you with a strong alternative if
you're using DSA keys this is an example
of adding support for stronger
algorithms I just I meant to say that
these changes already in JDK 7 and later
so don't worry about not if you're using
those or releases since this is a new
feature there's nothing you need to do
to test it just when it's available
start using it and it hasn't been
changed since we first announced it so
the road map contains a lot of changes I
don't have time to go through all of
them today but I thought I would pick
out two two of them that I thought are
the most significant for you to hear
about today one of them is one that
we've already released and the other one
is a one that's almost being released as
of today oh I'll let you know you'll see
in a minute so the first one is disable
sha-1 certificates so here what we've
done is we've disabled or restricted by
default sha-1 TLS certificate surfer
certificates that chained to public root
CAS are now restricted by default this
restriction is already in JDK 9 and it's
already an 8 you one forty one seventy
one fifty one and 6161
those releases were released in July
this restriction applies to all
certificates in the chain so not only
the server certificate but any
intermediate CA certificates that Knight
may fall if they use sha-1 the chain
will be blocked as well and revocation
information if they do if you download
OCSP responses or CRLs that are signed
with shot one also the validation will
fail and the certificate chain will be
blocked when I see say public root CAS I
mean the ones that are pre-installed in
the CA certs key store when you
initially install the JDK so if you're
using your own enterprise
I see a or self-signed cert s-- this
restrictions not going to apply you can
go into the I'll show you later you can
can go into the properties and make it
apply to any route CA but for now we
wanted to keep the compatibility risk
you know Enterprise CAS usually take a
little bit longer to adapt to
restrictions so we're giving them more
time this particular restriction adheres
to the see a browser forum which is a
form of CAS and browsers that come up
with ways to use certificates more
securely
they say effective first January 2016
CAS must not issue any new subscriber
certificates or subordinate CA
certificates using the sha-1 hash
algorithm and more information about
this feature can be seen in Jeff 288 so
this was actually a JDK 9 feature which
we then have back ported to our earlier
releases ok this is a little bit of a
quiz have any of you ever written code
like this
and if I compile and run it what do you
think the result will be it's generating
a 256 bit AES secret key and then is
trying to encrypt some data with it
anyone anyone No okay well it's a trick
question depends what version of the JDK
you're using if you're using JDK 8 or
earlier if you try to compile then run
it you'll get an exception in thread
illegal key size or default parameters
you'll probably get it confused what's
going on you'll search the internet for
an answer and you'll go aha I need to
download the Jacey unlimited strength
jurisdiction policy files first I need
to install it try again then I run it
everything works fine so we had to do
that for a long time because of us
import-export laws on strong
cryptography I'm happy to announce that
we does those those regulations have
been restricted and as of JDK 9 we've
enabled unlimited cryptographic policy
by default so now you no longer have to
download the unlimited policy bundle JDK
9 includes both the limited unlimited
policy files and you can use the crypto
policy security property to configure
however the default value is unlimited
so but if you want to change it to
limited you can this means there's no
limits on strength of cryptography out
of the box your application can use the
strong as strong as keys as as it wants
and today will not be blocked most
significantly the most apparent changes
that allow things like aes-192 bit and
AES 256-bit to work out of the box this
change is also scheduled lis backported
can I take questions at the end just
yeah right here it's done in two phases
because we wanted to sort of mildly
prepare you for it in the October
release about two weeks both policy
files will
bili installed but limited will be the
default however it's just a simple
switch of that property you can even do
it in your code say security set
property crypto policy unlimited and
then you're gonna get so you don't have
to download it it sits there in the JDK
and then in January that default will be
flipped to unlimited of course I have to
say give a disclaimer you are advised to
consult your Export Import Control
Council or attorney to determine the
exact requirements for your situation or
region that you exist in so I'm really
happy to announce this was a huge pain
point for developers for many many years
so we're really happy that we've been
able to do this I'm going to go a little
bit under the hood just for one slide to
show you how the restrictions are
actually configured the restrictions are
configured via security properties in
the java.security file there are 1 2 3 4
5 properties that we use to configure
that
the first is JDK cert path disabled
algorithms and these are restrictions on
certificates CRLs and OCSP responses if
any of those violate the algorithms
listed in that property they would be
blocked by default the second is JDK TLS
disabled algorithms these are
restrictions and algorithms used in the
TLS handshake protocol but will happen
here is that it will try to negotiate to
a stronger cipher suite if it's
available but if the only cipher suites
that are available are violate you know
violate the restrictions in that
property then your TLS connection will
fail the third one is a little different
it's called jdk TLS legacy algorithms
here algorithms are negotiated in TLS
handshake protocol but only as a last
resort only if no stronger candidate
specs are available so what one we have
here is Triple DES Triple DES is known
to be not really known to be used it's
it's going it's on its way out but
because the interoperate compatibility
risk is somewhat still negligible we
wanted to put it here it's only uses the
last resort
and then eventually we will put it into
the disabled algorithms then JD cage our
disabled algorithms our restrictions on
sign jars if they violate any of the
restrictions they're treated as unsigned
and the final one is JDK XML D cigs
secure validation policy and these are
restrictions on XML digital signatures
these contain not only restricted
algorithms but also somewhat unsafe
constructs that you can put in XML
signatures things like exit XSLT
stylesheets and things like that that
are generally considered unsafe so these
are the default restrictions as of JDK 9
in the java dot security file the
earlier releases should be pretty much
the same but I think there's a couple
we're still in the process of
backporting I'm not going to go through
this in in a lot of detail if you go to
the java.security file the syntax gives
a really good description of how to how
to use these properties and configure
them obviously I don't recommend
removing any of the restrictions but if
you want to make them stronger or add
new algorithms this is actually one of
the ways you can test things that are
coming up on the roadmap then I
definitely recommend doing that if you
need to
and here's just a quick graphical
example of how the restrictions won't
work here we have assert path its
consists of two certificates and entity
certificate issue to Alice and an
intermediate CA certificate issued to CA
to the signature algÃºn that Alice is
using is insecure so if we pass this sir
path object to a pickax surpass
validator the validate method it will
then read the java.security file read
the JDK SERP at the sample algorithms
property see that md5 is on in the value
and basically throw a surpass validator
exception with that message if you want
it more debugging output to see exactly
which certificate triggered that
exception you can rerun it and use a - D
Java security debug equals cert path
option a couple other ways you can
diagnose things keytool has been a
diagnosed in Han stew to warn you about
weak certificates if you use the print
cert option it will then warrants emit a
warning if the certificate is using an
insecure algorithm such as md5 with RSA
similarly Jarrah signer you can use the
- verify and - verbose options and it
will warn you if the jar was signed or
digested with an insecure algorithm okay
that brings me to my next topic which is
tell you about some of the exciting new
security features in the just-released
JDK 9 so highlights there are nine new
security jep's in JDK 9 overall you can
see significant cryptographic
performance improvements support for
important new TLS extensions a LPN OCSP
stapling we have support for new crypto
algorithms sha-3 and drbg support for
new protocols DTLS new restrictions on
shot 1 certificates which I talked about
earlier and more secure defaults the
default key store type has been changed
from JK s to pkcs12
so here's a list of all the jets there I
call this 9 for 9 those 9 features for
JDK 9 it is mostly for reference I'll go
through most of these on the next few
slides so first in the JC e or JC a
layer we've added support for shot 3 so
shot 3 is a new family of cryptographic
hash functions it's based on the catch a
key
algorithm and this was the winner of the
NIST sha-3 hash algorithm competition
this was held over a span of about 5
years I think it ended in 2012 and catch
Scheck was declared the winner and the
standard is now defined and NIST Phipps
- OH - there are four variants just like
shot - so they shot three 224 256 384
512 where the 512 is the size of the
resulting hash now to be Kurt perfectly
clear shot 2 is still perfectly fine to
use there's nothing wrong with it shot 3
was created and should be viewed as an
insurance policy in case shot 2 is
broken it's it's based on a very
different algorithm than shot 2 so it's
very unlikely that shot 2 and shot 3
would be broken at the same time so now
you have a drop-in replacement for one
or the other
JD KD 9 ads message digests
implementations for for all four shot
three hash functions and more
information is at Jeff 287
create PKS s12 key stores by default so
this is very simple in JDK 9 the default
key store type security property has
changed from jks to pkcs12 why did we do
this for it well for a number of reasons
pkcs12 is stronger than jks it uses
stronger cryptographic algorithms to
secure the key store and its contents
it's also standards-based so it's much
more likely to interoperate with other
implementations that support pkcs12 and
it has a richer set of features so with
jks you can only store certificates and
private keys with pkcs12 you can store
certificates private keys secret keys
and so forth so it's a full-fledged key
store JDK 9 key tool now creates pkcs12
key stores by default if you don't
specify the - store type option this
feature had a little bit of a
compatibility risk so we recognized that
early on we had a build in a
compatibility mode so right now a key
jks key store can actually load a pkcs12
key store and vice-versa
this is supported in both JDK 8 and 9
and this essentially ensures that if you
have existing code that is hard coding
jks if you do like key store dot
getinstance jks and suddenly the default
is changed to pkcs12 that that code will
still pass it will be able to read a
pkcs12 key store and you'll still be
able to get the contents out of it that
you need and more information is at Jeff
2 - 9 the next JC enhancement is
strictly a performance improvement but a
pretty significant one at that here
we've used hotspot intrinsics
to speed up the performance of G hash
and RSA G hash is the hashing component
of the AES GCM cipher and we've been
able to improve the performance by of
aes v CM / j 2k hea anywhere from 34 to
150 times
depending on the data size the larger
the data size is usually the more
performance improvement you're going to
get and I'll give you a little bit
secrets actually higher than that
because in JDK 9 we snuck in a fix
towards the end that that improved the
performance even more so you might even
see it 2 or 2 to 300 times as fast
that's JDK 8 but this is what our public
Doc's say right now so I'm going with
that for now it's supported on the Intel
x64 and SPARC architectures and Olson
RSA we did a modest improvement we
improved it by 10% on Intel x64 and more
information is at yep 246 the last of
the JC enhancements for JDK 9 is called
drbg based secure random implementations
drbg stands for deterministic random bit
generator it's also known as a PRNG
or a pseudo-random number generator drbg
uses a deterministic algorithm to
produce a pseudo-random sequence from a
random seed so the security and the
randomness of the seed is is critical
it's really important for pseudo-random
number generators now this is a security
improvement over the existing Java sha-1
PRNG algorithm it has stronger
algorithms a lot more options and it's
also based on a standard so it's been
more widely reviewed the Java sha-1 PRNG
is a propriety algorithm that was
implemented in-house a long time ago
a little bit of the Java details there's
now a new secure random algorithm named
drbg and we have implemented all three
drbg mechanisms hash drbg
h MACD RPG and CTR drbg there are
several new api is in the java security
package for configuring drbg mechanisms
with different security strengths and
options and you can use the secure
random drbg config security property and
the java.security file to configure
which of those three mechanisms
mechanisms you want to use by default
the default if you don't do anything is
hash drbg the seed source by default it
is specified by the existing secure
random source security property and I
don't recommend using the set seed
method unless you really know what
you're doing just use this default seed
source and more information is at Jeff
273 okay over over into the TLS area
we've got a couple of new exciting
enhancements in JDK 9 the first is OCSP
stapling for TLS so OCSP is one of two
mechanisms that are commonly used to
check the revocation status of
certificates the other one being CR ELLs
now typically implementations use client
side of a CSP checking but that is
problematic it incurs significant
performance overhead the client has to
make a network request to the OCSP
responder wait for the request and then
see if there's a certificate is revoked
or not often OCSP responders become
overloaded and can't handle the traffic
and because of this most implementations
have implemented a soft veil policy
where if they don't if they can't get a
successful response from the over the
network they will consider the
certificate is ok
the problem is that an attacker if an
attacker can actually block that traffic
the OCSP responder your security is
essentially gone because he could block
the fact that the certificate is revoked
so with OCSP stapling the server is now
responsible for obtaining and sending
the osseous response to the client
this says several immediate benefits the
first is performance responses can be
cached at the server and periodically
refreshed and then sent to all clients
the second is functionality so if you're
using something like a captive portal in
a hotel or a cafe to connect to the
internet post ESP client checking
doesn't work because they can't check it
until you have an internet connection so
there's a chicken and egg issue there
OCSP stapling solves that and finally
privacy with client side checking Yosi
responder knows exactly what server
you're connecting to with OCSP stapling
that's also addressed OCSP stapling does
not yet solve the soft fail policy
problem but I think it puts us on a road
to eventually addressing that once most
servers in the Internet across you know
the globe support OCSP stapling then we
can use something called OCSP must
staple and then the implementations can
start implementing art fail policy a few
of the Java details the Sun JSOC
implementation supports the TLS
certificate status request extensions
RFC sixty sixty six sixty nine sixty one
it's on by default in the client so the
client always says I support OCSP
stapling if if you're willing to send it
back to me it's off by default in the
server because we wanted to make sure
the administrator opts into something
like that you're making an outbound
request to a no CSP responder that's
something that the administrator should
have control over but it can be easily
enabled you just set this system
property true
and then there's a few other system
properties that you may want to
configure for a finer finer
configuration and then more information
is at Jeff 249 TLS application layer
protocol protocol negotiation extension
is also supported in JDK 9 this is an
extension it provides a mechanism for
negotiation the application layer
protocol before the TLS handshake is
complete so the way this work is the
client offers the supported protocols
that it supports as part of the TLS
handshake and then the server chooses
which one it wants to use the one of the
main benefits here is it avoids an
additional network round-trip at the
application layer to negotiate what
protocol they want to communicate over
once the TLS connection is complete it
also allows the server to choose which
certificate it may want to use so it may
have different certificates depending on
which protocol is being negotiated this
is specified in RFC seven 301 and the
primary or critical use case for this is
HTTP 2 so I believe they require a LPN
they OPN allows them to determine what
HTTP protocol is going to be used and
they're very happy that we've put this
in several new AP eyes have been added
to support this feature and more
information is that in chapter 2 44
and then the last the JDK 90s features
is called DTLS have this extends the jss
8j is the API and implementation to
support DTLS 1.0 and 1.2 so DTLS allows
applications to use TLS over an
unreliable transport channels such as
UDP regular TLS is for reliable
transport channels like TCP IP so an
increasing number of application
protocols are using UDP things like
session initiation protocol electronic
gaming protocols so now we're providing
a way for them to establish a secure
session layer between their Java clients
and Java servers or any other service
applications use the ssl print engine
programming model if you want to use
DTLS and more information is at Jeff -
1/9 ok so I couldn't I couldn't do it
JDK nyan talk without talking a little
bit about the module system in jigsaw
just you can't do it so I just wanted I
have a couple of slides and some of the
security features that that brings so
first all of our security components I
talked about earlier on that big slide
have been modulized these are a list of
all the modules and the packages that
they export and the service providers
that each one of them contain Java dot
base contains all your most common and
useful security API so you're gonna get
JSC in there you're going to get your
Java security api's your crypto API s
and most implementations that pose as
well
and then the others have been modulized
as appropriate the nice thing about this
is that you can use j-link
to now build an application and JDK with
only the modules that you need and this
has a direct security benefit is that
you're reducing the attack surface area
of the application that you then deploy
some modules have been deep privileged I
don't know if you've heard of this but
some of the modules are now loaded by
something called a platform class loader
and this allows them now to be granted
only the required permissions they need
so if you're using a security manager
this is an example of one of our modules
JDK crypto EC and it's been granted
one-two-three-four-five permissions
that's all it needs to do its job
doesn't need any other pitchmen
permissions prior to JDK 9 in this this
module or this component was granted all
permission by virtue of being installed
in the scenario extensions directory
that's way too many permissions why does
it need all those permissions so this
allows us to adhere to the principle of
least privilege and only grant modules
the permissions they need and no more
and then everyone's heard about strong
encapsulation if you're at the Tech
keynote mark Reinhold talked about it
quite a bit and here we're encapsulating
most JDK internal api's so that they are
inaccessible at compile time they're
relaxed at runtime by default but you
can control that using the illegal
access option you can set that to deny
so that they are inaccessible at runtime
as well
okay conclusion so overall we continue
to make Java more secure and incorporate
new security features going back to
those two goals at the beginning of
slide I hope you come out with a strong
feeling that we're continuing to make
the JDK more secure by default and
incorporate security features that help
help you guys build secure applications
but I want to give a big shout out to
everyone here you guys can help us we
let us know what you think is important
we're here to listen to you participate
as a security group and a security dev
discussion list and if you're interested
you can work to becoming a contributor
I'd also live a give a call out for
folks to come to my boss tomorrow it's
gonna be about the security manager so
if you love the security manager you
hate the security manager you know
nothing about the security manager come
along and we'll have an open discussion
about some of the challenges associated
with the security manager and what may
be the potential future of the security
manager is oh one other thing
JDK 9 security guide I really recommend
checking that out it's complete been
completely revamped it's now all one
guide instead of having like a dozen
different guides so it's easier to find
things and many of the features I talked
about today have programming examples I
didn't have time to show examples today
so if you're looking to build those
features into your applications try them
out but this is the best place to go for
that and then a few pointers to stay
connected this week different things you
can check out I have about four minutes
for questions I will just pop back that
conclusion slide up just so you can
any questions yeah how does it process
it how does it process the OCSP response
it's it's in it's in these it's this
extension that's attached to the server
hello message
I think the server load message are one
of the server messages that are in the
TLS protocol and then our implementation
has been enhanced to actually validate
that response according to the
certificates that the server sends as
well right it doesn't have to
that OCSP response is signed so it's
signed by a the OCSP responder so you
have to be able to validate that
signature on the OCSP responses to
yeah yeah yeah
the other questions yeah I don't know
well I mean the tool was so clunky to
begin with that it was kind of
embarrassing
so whether there'll be another tool
maybe someone all you know come up with
an open-source project with a better
tool but for it'll always be there if
you want to go back to JDK and use it
you can you're fine to do that but as as
far as it's a it's still in JDK 9 but in
JDK 10 or whatever it's gonna be named
it's no longer there any other questions
ok thanks I'll be out in the hall for a
few minutes or up here until they kick
me out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
