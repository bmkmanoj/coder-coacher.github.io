hello everybody is watching us online or
record the session at night hacking TV
it's a great pleasure to be here at
devoxx and here i have now with me bird
sitter which is one of directors of
developer experience at a big open
source company and we're talking what
we're going to talk about today I'm
going to talk about vertex because
vertex is one of my favorite open source
projects yeah why is that because it's
awesome for numerous reasons one it
takes job and makes it a dynamic
language almost you can actually just
treat Java right from the command line
as without even have to compile it you
can just run it straight up which is
cool but it also supports other
programming languages on the JVM things
like groovy as an example and there's
some groovy in some of my demonstrations
and so different programming languages
including Java on the JVM it also has a
reactive framework and if you can see
the screen share that's showing right
now it also says products is a toolkit
for building reactive applications on
the JVM so in that case you will see a
reactive or event-driven programming
model and you can build holistic
reactive systems out of it and when the
demonstrations i have is actually a
system of different vertex components
that actually allows you to play a
real-time game so we'll show you that
concept question we talked about
developers be interesting reactive
applications and reactive programming
and probably may be very lexical why
this should be doing that well in most
cases people love to talk about
scalability the fact that these things
are more scalable in that context I
personally just like the programming
model and kind of the in the case of
like a burglar web app I have an example
of a web application it just cleans up
the programming model makes it super
straightforward not to mention is just
fun it's actually very cool and one
thing that I like showing and we'll see
this in a demonstration is this concept
of a real-time web application in other
words if you remember if you've seen
google docs in action where multiple
people editing the same document
simultaneously in that case you can
build application like that with vertex
you know so really where everybody's
changes are being seen by everybody else
and that's kind of a really neat
application if you think about it okay
so we should be talking about highly
scalable applications
and the application with fast response
times we're talking about reactive
programming well reactive programming
courses certain programming structure
like a unit RX Java or spring reactor
things like that and in the case of road
exit specifically works with RX java
however you can also build holistic
reactive systems and so if you look at
the reactive manifesto they talk about
reactive systems and their you worry
about things like elasticity resiliency
as an example responsiveness so in other
words you have to know that that's just
that component is going to respond a
certain service level agreement and it
has to consistently respond you know so
you have to have that level
responsiveness a great elasticity and
you have two great resiliency if a
component goes down does the system
react correct correctly to that event
and maybe the last component that is
specifically around concept of message
passing so everything in a vertex Pay
system is through messages so you Lilly
will basically a will call B will call
see and while you do a rest payload we
have some rest in the demonstrations
you'll also just do it through pure
message passing all in membrane so
vertex specifically has this concept of
the event bus and then within the event
bus which might not be listed on this
screen here I'll have to go find it but
it's specifically around that concept of
in-memory message passing so you can do
pub/sub and you can also do one to one
thing to request reply you know so it's
very powerful little model to basically
for all your different components
interact with each other all and all the
verdict census is actually see each
other in that case oh that sounds kind
of cool because some people think that
reactive programming is just call back
basis programming so maybe vertex more
than that yep definitely more than that
and it is focused on building whole
reactive systems reactive applications
and that includes your traditional web
applications if that's what you want or
any form of you know real-time kind of
interactive application at its base
level vertex is specifically toolkit for
building any kind of network i/o type
system so you can just actually just
conclude the jar in your pom.xml and you
can then have it immediately available
within your spring app or your java app
as a way to open up a socket and listen
for events coming in so at the at the
base level that's what you get right if
you just want to listen to on a socket
and whatever you want to stream into it
you can oh that's pretty cool and you
have something to show for us yeah I
want to show you guys a demonstration
application we just got working earlier
today we'll be showing it later in the
week
and let's see here let's see what i got
running some people at devoxx would be
able to play this game exactly so let me
pull that up and let's pull this guy up
you're going to see some activity here
let's go and get started so this is
actually a real-time game so if you
watch here you can pop balloons and
interact with them and you can watch
what happens in a background there we
really need multiple monitors to really
appreciate this but as I'm interacting
with the system okay so I come over here
you will see changes in real time coming
to that dashboard so as each individual
specifically is popping balloons like
and you can kind of see what's happening
there so as we make changes to the
application as an end user you can see
those changes are actually flowing back
through a vertex based system and
they're actually then going actually to
a the jboss prms specific system which
is the rule system that we have swinging
out on the drools technology and what it
is is those pops actually translate to
business rules which then get calculated
for the actual point system and then of
course your number of consecutive pops
the number of achievements that are
calculated or then return back to this
dashboard and there's two types of
dashboards one to score four teams and
that's updating in real time and then
one more for individual scores
individual achievements and of course
this fills up when there's a bunch of
players there's only two players right
now and then if we look over here we can
also let me do this you can also just
pause this game in real time ok so again
changes made to the system happen
instantaneously that if i want to make
these if i don't make these balloons a
little smaller make them hard to see
make them super fast i can change the
point system associated with it let's
turn this off let's make it blue and
listen update configure and to hit go
again so in this case all the systems
are now updated right literally every
player is going to see those changes as
soon as we make the change if I'm one
come in here and make it something
different I want to make it a yellow
background and I want to make the
balloon super big and super slow
brighter in their color as far as
opacity goes update and you can see
there's the change and of course and go
back to playing the game over here and
you can see the change is happening up
back on the dashboard so while the
system
you can see our points updating so well
this entire system actually was made up
of several components right there's
obviously the front end which is a
mobile web application that's optimized
specifically for the mobile browser it
actually handles 60 frames per second on
the average smartphone that's based on
an open source library called fazer in
the JavaScript world even it opens a
WebSocket back to vertex back in the
cloud running on our cloud server and
that transaction for each pop goes
through vertex over to the drools engine
to specifically do the business rule
calculations determining what
achievements you've made what your score
is that data then gets pushed back out
so that vertex then grabs it and throws
it into these do dashboards you see here
so there's actually two different vertex
processes as well as a traditional java
application server running back there
running the business rules so there's
actually three major components in the
overall system and you can see as we pop
balloons it's pretty much keeping up
with me here and it's all done a sink
right so there's no blocking I oh and
the entire system everything is done is
synchronously and that's really the
coolest part about that demo to kind of
show you some other aspects at vertex
data can i give you feel for so one of
the reasons that you can handle many
multiple simultaneous players is that
you're using biotics for their cinque
ports yeah everything is done through an
async programming model at vertex
promotes and so like here i'll just show
you a little bit of code for like hello
world to make it super easy and I don't
know if that actually is quite visible
there make a little bit bigger but you
can see it where it says vertex create
HTTP handler and the request handler
there and it always responds with vertex
devix belgium in this case and
java.util.date and it runs on port 8080
and as I was saying earlier where you
where vertex kinda is a mix Java a a
scripting language if you will so
basically I don't have to compile Aang
to see vertex run it does the
compilation on the fly oh can you
increase the font yep I make that a
little bit bigger okay and then if I go
back over here to my browser Turk turn
and listed just I think I have this one
up already click there we go all right
so there's that piece of code and so
we're basically hitting that vertex
endpoint so setting up something a web
server it just takes a couple lines of
code in this case we're responding only
with a piece of static content but if
you want to build something a little bit
more
interesting like a whole traditional
kind of application that specifically
like a browser-based web app for crud
operations like here's an example we
actually set up a router and then you
basically identify the handler and of
course you have the method reference so
in this case basically if you do a get
on this end point it goes to the get all
method if you do a if you do a post on
this end point it goes to the add one
and have to look at the add one endpoint
right it basically updates a specific
data set with the data that came in from
the user that was JSON encoded so in
this case all your rest endpoints are
super easy to set up and this is an
example of just the simple event driven
programming model that you see in vertex
specifically and the nice thing about
that is it's super easy to work with you
can you can do the vertex run as you saw
earlier all right let me hit control C
there but there's even one I have here
is another example where if you want you
can maven clean compile package that
application and so you can also do a
full maven build and that also produces
a fat jar so if i look in target now
you'll see there is this specific jar so
basically the entire vertex system
including the web web HTTP listener and
everything else you need is included
that jar file which is also includes my
business logic and i can just basically
say java dash jar let's just do this
java jar target and in vertex start fat
and then run that and now I've deployed
that application to the browser let's
see what we have here let's okay there
it is her little vertex maven that's
ready yeah which is the size of the jar
so I said his yard let's go here Dan
damn it we can just look at it from this
perspective I'm sorry target yeah in
this case looks like 55 Meg or so for
that five megabytes if I make yet right
exactly look like a fat thing now is we
call it they've always called it fat jar
in the vertex ecosystem member of red X
for a couple years now and it called a
lot of people refer to this now is to
uber jar but the whole idea is that it's
a self-executing jar file what
everything gets rolled into it vertex as
well as the application and that's cool
so even when you see the game server the
sack
running behind that balloon popping
system that's all big as a big fat jar
right that gets deployed out there and
you can basically drag and drop at any
server you want as long as you have Java
there you can run it which is exactly
what we did to make that cloud-based
server work for us as an example that's
pretty impressive because we've even
with all of these capabilities you have
a fat jar which is limb like under 10
megabytes right it can be it's like the
size of a war file right exactly there
is more water so it really depends on
what you pack into your system obviously
can pull in other classes if you want to
it's your pom.xml but in this case we
specific they're just pulling in you
know very minimal resources to make
certain applications work like I can
show you the pom.xml for this one that
actually does crud you can see it has
vertex as a dependency for decks web as
a dependency with an example and that's
about it and you'll see the shade plugin
down here where'd it go I think this one
has it yeah there it is that's the one
that does the packaging into the actual
fat jar concept okay so there's a lot
you can do vertex again it's fully
embeddable into your application you can
add all any kind of a sink reactive kind
of capability to your app pretty easily
and you can build very cool applications
like you see with the balloon popping
that kind of real-time kind of
application wherever users transactions
or impacting every other user so in this
case it's done to our web socket and
it's just simple html5 canvas drawing
you know to get the balloons on there as
well as those different you know
leaderboards the scoreboards but then
you just have access to the entire you
know web web socket transaction if there
are no web sockets available it can use
sake is to basically do fall backs you
know so it'll it'll still actually work
the same way and you from a programmatic
standpoint don't see a difference but
that's the cool thing you just write
meters right there Java code accordingly
I have lots of examples but we don't
have to spend a lot of time on them we
were going to spend a few minutes today
just kind of walk in people through it
here's an example though of that of the
game engine itself you can specifically
see here I mentioned earlier that you
know a balloon pop comes in and one of
the things it does is it goes to the
score server and in this case it doesn't
it should be post so you can see here
does the post event but this one doesn't
seem like a Java code this is actually
groovy that's a good point so you can
actually use
from programming languages and we
decided to actually do this part of it
with groovy so you can actually see
groovy doing the post over to the actual
regular Java app server so that that
game years and verdicts on top of the
JVM what you're using Java and groovy at
the same time yeah simultaneously in
that one application okay sounds cool
yeah and like if you you know the other
interesting one here is like the the
score timer service so this specifically
is going back again everything's a sink
so we we hit that score server but we
don't block any threads right we say hey
we gotta score we gotta score we got to
score and those happen as fast as you're
popping balloons it's doing the
calculations of what score really is
achieved and what achievements you have
and things like that in the drools
engine specifically using a decision
table I don't have that loaded right now
otherwise I could show you that and then
of course this guy's back to saying okay
what is the score that you calculated
and then reporting it back out to those
dashboards as an example alright but
this is all stuff we've been having fun
with here and it seems fairly
complicated that overall game engine all
right there's a lot of logic associated
with making sure all those points are
updated and kind of show you that one
more time yeah it seems that balloon
popping is not trivial it is not trivial
so if I start the game back up you know
you can kind of see I can play it again
yep you can see the actual all the pups
aggregate across all the players you
know being updated right there and you
can see if you noticed you'll see the
actual achievements coming in in real
time to to the client user so if I click
over here Pink teensy splash apprentice
three in a row yeah I'm the purple one
you're the purple team yeah but you can
see how I'm just kind of making some
scores happen there and you can see what
it looks like here I don't let go pull
this them back up again so you can kind
of swatch those changes right there and
what happens as each achievement is
achieved they light up across the
dashboard here again all that's done
through drools the open source rules
engine and then and then of course
verdex's of course is what connects the
connected tissue for the whole
application so we'll be showing that
more on Thursday here dev box is walking
people through more this application as
well as other principles around Verdex
pretty cool so if you're at devoxx you
can watch boys presentation on thursday
and also all
the Vox or sessions are recorded you'll
be able to check that online later so
maybe you'll be able even be able to
play some games exactly and there's so
much fun we I end up playing it more
than I actually should in this case I
don't I only have a hundred twenty six
points I need to get to the 300 point
level to get the next achievement level
maybe I'll make a little bit easier on
myself we'll fix that because you can
actually change the point system here if
we want with with the application in
real time again make that change I'll
add the Golden Snitch idea back in will
make the background blue and then we'll
do that and boom come back over here all
right there we go and so now now the
points are going to fly to the system
there we go and I should get the
achievements for 300 and there yep and
then there's the 501 lit up on the
dashboard alright well thank you oh
thank you but I think of our time I
think everybody must be excited right
now about verdicts and if it's a good
way for doing reactive programming
reactive system so I think everybody
should check and what is the URL of the
projects yeah vertex dot IO I have it
open here so vertex that I oh it's a
place you come in and get started I
don't know if the zoom works there but
you can hopefully see Verdex do is the
place to get started with vertex okay
pretty cool so thank you very much for
everybody then watching us and faker
gambar you meet again at the next videos
yes thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
