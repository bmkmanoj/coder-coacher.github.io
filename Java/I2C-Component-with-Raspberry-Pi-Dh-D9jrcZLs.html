IOT developer challenge this week we are
in a very special place actually we are
here in oracle santa clara where java
have been created so we are very happy
to be here i'm here with your land from
Oracle technology Network and also Yara
from global coup so welcome everybody
and today we are going to talk about I
square C with raspberry pi and Java Sea
embedded and pie for J so we are give
you all the information you need if you
have a Raspberry Pi and you just bought
a nice crisi component you will be able
after this webinar to start playing with
that so before we begin I'm going to
share my screen and I'm going to to talk
a little bit about the IOT developer
challenge so I don't know if everybody
really knows what is happening in the
big opportunity the big chance that you
have to win ticket to the Java one us
with the flight included the hotel and
everything so don't miss this chance of
putting your brain to work and create
something new using Java embedded so
very fast this is a sponsored by Oracle
technology Network so here's another one
last year we did many different
challenges and we have Tory yoland from
Naraku working very hard and Yara and I
from global called helping this very
nice project so you have training
resources if you never a solid tweet
about our videos we we publish at
different videos for you too
to start playing with raspberry Pi java
pie for j and if you follow at java and
the twitter you can have the access or
just go to youtube into the java channel
and you will have the access to this
really nice content and i saw here that
we have people from brazil and the basic
videos we recorded in the English and
Portuguese we also have a space for
downloads and we have a community in the
community oracle if you have any
question or if you need any kind of
support just go to this URL community at
oracle cone guys can you hear me well or
it's not a good quality do you and if
you could answer in the english yet so
we can see here and you hear me well
well
okay stop if you go to the community
oracle com you have the java embedded
and it's very easy to find the IOT
developer track challenge community and
here is the place that you can make
questions and we are going to give the
support for you using this space okay
and also we have this weekly webinar and
today is about I square C last week we
talked at about Gemalto concept board
and Java me for 3g project development
and Rio IOT and we after we make the
webinar one or two days after we publish
a video about the content so even if you
miss the live webinar you are going to
have access to the full content of the
webinars so that's all the training
resources just a minute just make sure
that my mic is in the right volume
you
I me try to because we are using the
camera mine is better this way guys
develop
you
you
yes vice can you hear me better now de
l'armée Bruno okay cool so I was
talking about the training resources
that we work it on so you have many
video classes we have the community
support inside the community oracle
community or forum and we have the
weekly webinar so you can use those
resources and we can give you all the
support that you need if you have a
problem with some component or some bug
that you find or is hatch solve please
just just tell us and we can help you
and the video classes as I told we have
a set of basic video classes about our
Chi Java C Java me and raspberry pi in
English and Portuguese and downloads for
downloads we have a Java botnet project
is in this URL java.net is lash project
/ ho chi and java so here is the place
that you can download everything and so
here is the download area and that's the
the child
i OG challenge so here we have the URL
and the webinar that's the agenda so we
did the gym out last week today we are
doing the i square c and we have the iot
javon raspberry pi next week this one
will be very special because we are also
do from here from nautical santa clara
and we have a very special guest to this
webinar so i recommend you to join this
webinar we are going to show i think
that at least 10 different boards
running java and with a very very crazy
guy from morocco and it will be a
surprise for you and it will be a big
pleasure for us to to make the next one
and in april 15 we have the butte that
the robotics with javon bedded and we
are going to talk about open source
robots and also we are going to talk
about leagu easy 3 running java sea
embedded so if you have a legal you can
just hack your legal robot and put java
to run inside that and 21 we have the
Java ME embedded chips and tricks and
advanced a GPIO with pie for Jay will be
the last one and this one we are going
to try to bring Robert salvage the pie
for jcreator for this webinar so that's
it welcome to echo IOT developer
challenge thanks to Oracle technology
Network for this initiative is another
initiative so let's go to our content
about I square C
here we go raspberry pie with ice Kersey
Java Sea and added and plat for G as I I
used to talk about and if you solve the
basic training about raspberry pi gpio
we can tell with 17 different pins in
our gpio from g17 we have 74 general
users so you can turn on and turn off
the pin and turn on a relay LED or
something else we have one pin for pw m
so you can have a kind of power control
using this pin this pin is not that
popular no we don't see a lot of people
using that nowadays and we have two
different i square c buses so we have
support not just one i square C support
but 2i square see supporting in the GPIO
we have five pins educated to spi and
two pins dedicated to you at
communication the old but gold serial
communication so the parts if you have
the digital it will be 0 or 1 analog
parts we we don't have analog converter
in the Raspberry Pi board so you need an
external one but the inner log part will
give you a value that means some number
that means the voltage that the the
component that we are reading from the
component like if you have a light
sensor most the common light sensor the
LG are lighting the light dependent
resistor you can read the light sensor
you must read sensor use analog part and
if you have a dark environment the
number will be higher and so that's the
idea that the value of the component
will be analog to the voltage
and so you can have four simple readings
like temperature like a light sensor and
you can use in a lab way of reading and
we have the mobilization of the digital
part that is the booze with mobilization
this is used to control the power if you
have any kind of DC motor plug it into a
digital port and you just turn on the
digital port the more the model will be
running in the full power 0 will be
stopped so if you control a mother using
a digital part you don't have how to
control the speed and so that's the
difference between the pwm pwm you can
control how much power you are going to
drive into the model and with two or
more digital ports by combining two or
more digital ports you can start
creating your own communication protocol
so you could use two parts to exchange
data between two birds for example or
you can use two products to exchange
data between the board and there and the
component the sensor that you are using
so here is where I square C starts you
do need to create your own your own
protocol we have three famous
communication protocol for electronic
components and devices the first one is
the UART you watch is the classic serial
communication like the serial code parts
that we use it in the past and you watch
is very reliable with very use it and we
we have industrial implementation with
rs-485 and so but the uart is just about
you can just plug two components to talk
in the you are you can have
ten components using the UART one you
act for each component you want to talk
is one-to-one communication and we have
the SPI the SPI is a serial protocol
communication but it is a bus what what
what does it mean when he is a bus you
can have many components plug it to the
same board using the same wires i square
C is also a bus is up you can have like
a raspberry pi and I square c you just
you you are going to use just two wires
to communicate with your components so
you have your Raspberry Pi you plug two
wires to top with a nasty little mirror
or two wires to top with a humidity
sensor and you are going to share the
same parts of your Raspberry Pi to talk
with many different components that's
the the big advantage of having a bus if
it's not a bus you would spend two wires
for and two pins for each component and
so I square cns bi they are both bus but
I square C is a low-speed interface and
spi is a very high-speed interface so I
square C I will use just to wire two
pins of your board while SP i will use
five at least five pins in your board so
when you have five pins to communicate
with your sensors and components you
have more channels to transfer data so
the throughput will increase with SBI
so I Square see a means in turn
integrate secret it's a technology
invented by phipps in 70 so today we are
here in 2014 Oh making a cat our webinar
to talk about something that was
invented in 70 that's that's the
beautiful part of the working with
hardware some very old technologies
chewing use they are not deprecated and
they are very cool and actually ice
perceive is a moot master CDL computer
bus so you can have a master-slave
architecture so your board will be the
master device and your components will
be the slave device and this this is
recommended for attaching low speed
components and before 2006 you must pay
license to create components using I
square see nowadays you don't need
license anymore so the protocol is open
and free so we are going to use one pin
to transfer the data and another pin
will will will check the clock so that's
very basic protocol is very easy to
debug even if you want to measure using
a some tool like any kind of digital
analyzer so is very easy and very cheap
to buy debugger and to plug the debugger
a debugger devices and see what is
happening inside the lines and this is
the architecture overview so we have
here just two wires and we have here
the power and the ground and we have the
master device in our case it will be the
Raspberry Pi but it can be your
preferred bored bored like a gemalto
board or we go bone or any Shiva plug or
any from other hundred options that you
find in the in the market today and so
you have here one is lave example a
digital analog converter and analog
digital converter is leave and another
is lave component like LCD display and
is a very a very nice one to have the I
square C version so if you are looking
for any kind of LCD display and the best
choice is the I square C one because it
easy to plug and I'm going to demo to
date a LCD display so I square C simple
we don't have too much to do to do to
start playing with I square C basically
you need to enable your I square see
supporting raspberry pi by default it's
it's not enabled by default so we have
three steps to enable the ice press is
supporting your Raspberry Pi the first
one is to set up the slashy TC / modules
you need to install the I square seduced
and you need to remove I square
different Linux blacklist devices so
let's see each of these steps first step
you need to change the / ET c / modules
so you can type sudo nano / ET c /
modules and you need to add two lines
more to this file so that that are the
two lines that you need to add
you need to install the i square c tools
so to do that you just type apt-get
install python as in sm bus and i square
seed to you can do with just one line by
adding ice Percy tools right here and
the last one will be to remove the I
square C from the black list so to do
that you just need to edit this file you
can use nano VI or any other editor
graphical one the raspy black list dot
com and you need to comment the two
lines here spi vcm 2708 and the i square
c bcn 2708 so actually here you are
going to have both buses working after
doing that so you need to restart your
Raspberry Pi and you will be ready to
start playing with your i square c
component and raspberry pi so you just
need to write up and go ahead so this
this is an image from the Angela chi Chi
Seto blog and you this is a gyroscope
and accelerometer sensor very nice and
very cheap one I would like to use this
moment to remember that today just
started the training the massive online
course from Oracle about Java me and you
can buy native fruit heat from the
Oracle and vetted Adafruit kid and you
can join this very nice training online
training and you will have exercises and
you have the expert support and
everything but you are going to use Java
me and bad that which is very nice and
this is part of the components that they
will be present
anything and teaching you how to use
that and in the Angela Chi Chi Seto's
blog you will find out the details about
how to use this one but here we can see
the VCC plug it into the 33 we have the
ground connection and we have the SDA
and the stl scsc a sta and SEL the clock
and the data plug it into your Raspberry
Pi so you must use these pins of your
Raspberry Pi so and after enable
enabling your I spicy support in your
Raspberry Pi Linux restarting and making
the wire up you are right to start
playing with Java Sea and I square C so
today we are going to talk about Java
Sea and bedded and I square C and to use
I square C with Java Sea embedded we
must use the PI for japi it's an
external one you need to download the
pie for Jade ABI jar files and
everything because we don't have not yet
we don't have a standard API for device
access into the Java Sea in bed at eight
so in the future we probably have the
support coming from the Java me space
but the Java Sea embedded we just
launched Java Sea embedded few months
ago and the device access API is was
much more for small devices but not is
not anymore now we we need the icrc
support even for java sea and if you
never play it we buy for j i recommend
you to watch our video
in jeans URL we have everything up 10 10
to 15 minutes video talking about all
the basic around five for J so the base
code for pie for Jay and I square C
support is this one so we need to create
an instance of an i square C device
class this case colored device and we
need to have the bus to take the dye
square C bus instance so in this case we
are going to use I square C factor get
instance and we are going to pass the
best number in our case for raspberry pi
the regular usage we are going to use
the bus number one which means that we
are going to use the GPIO I square C
support if you you can also have another
I square C control manager is the best
number zero but by default it's being
used by the camera from Raspberry Pi so
it's kind of by default busy the best
number zero so the best that you have in
to the GPIO is the bus number one so
once you have the access to the bus you
can you can start talking with your
devices as I told you the I square C is
a bus so each device inside that bus
will have an address I'm except decimal
address and basically you just need to
point the address I square siebers get
device and here you pass the address of
each device so they used to be
identified you will find it in the
documentation of the component that you
just bought and you can start writing
and region data depending on the type of
I square C component you are going to
write or read or
both so like for LCD control you are
going to write the data you want to
present in your LCD display if you have
a sensor you are going to like if you
have a gyroscope plus a salido mirror
sensor you are going to write asking to
the sensor to send our the gyroscope
information or any axis from the
accelerometer and you write the question
and you are ready to read the answer
with the sensor well Valerie and for
read and write you have four different
methods signature so you can use a
buffer offset and like the i/o almost
the same thing when you are using
streaming and IO API from Java so as you
can see here is very very simple to
start playing with i square C and and
java SE embedded with pi 4g so here i
have with me geez adafruit LCD plate so
this is a very nice one component to
start playing because you have the LCD
display and you also have some buttons
and once you have the LCD display and
the buttons you can create your own user
interface basic user interface to your
assistant you don't need to have a very
complex one if you have a simple project
like a robot if you build a robot you
can use the buttons to change the mode
to set up your robot and with this
simple display the robot can give you
the feedback about what the robot is
doing this some sensor value you can use
the display to debug and the another
good thing about LCD display a
comparative touchscreen display or OLED
display is that LCD
play they are very they don't consume a
lot coolant and energy so if you have a
project that you are using batteries LCD
display will be a good choice for you so
let me show you my net means code that
we use to drive this this display so
here we have a very simple main method
class here we have the information the
bus number one as I told you the one
thing that is important is that the bus
number one is to revision revision to
Raspberry Pi revision tube in the if you
have the very first Raspberry Pi board
you must change to the bus number zero
the engineers just change the bus
numbers between the revisions so the
past asked address is here like is the
component that we should talk and we are
creating an LCD instance so we have this
LCD interface and the class that
implements this interface will be the
Adafruit LCD plate so let's go inside
this class and see what is happening
there so here is the constructor and
with the pie for J code so we receive
the bus number and the address of the
device that we are looking to talk to
communicate and here we just have the
instance to communicate with I square C
past number one and in this line we are
getting an instance of I square C device
talking with the LCD component so here
you can write so we have many many
constants here with the address
us to communicate with the different
parts of the LCD display and so is
everything here so here it will make out
the set up for us these come L see this
i square c component is not the basic
one it has many many different features
and each feature you are going to access
using a different hash stir with
different axial decimal register so
that's the reason why we have this class
to help you to play with the LCD
component this project will be available
to be in the java.net download session
and here we have different methods so
let's look at the clear method it will
write the command LCD clear display and
what is this is a XL decimal number that
I give the instruction to ice Percy
saying this I want to clear the display
so when you are starting from scratch
you don't have a class to absolute the
complexity of the ice Percy component
you must look at the component
documentation to check for the number
and what is the meaning of each command
that you are going to send it to your I
square C component so in this case is
very base base command to clear so we
get we can have a LCD return home so it
will make the cursor in the in the first
character character of the line you can
set the position of your cursor and if
you play with any other LCD display and
any other platform of this it will be
familiar for you other else it's not a
hard you just have in this class many
different operations that you can do in
the LCD Adafruit display so here what we
are doing is to using the right method
to print some welcome message in our
screen and as you can see here I forgot
you'd clear I suppose to do this clear
every time I change the message so I
forgot to do it in the king in my
raspberry pi and it's over it's over
hiding the information but no problem
you can see it working i will show you
but here we have a welcome message it
will wait two seconds and it will write
Oracle technology Network wait two
seconds clear display and IOT developer
challenge so what you need to do here
just need to build your project so you
go and build your project and as the
result you will have in the distribution
director your project here with the
library and netbeans will create the
manifest inside your jar file so here we
have the manifest with the libraries
that we need and what is the main class
that that will be executed so once since
we have the manifest / necklace you can
just upload deployed is jar file to your
raspberry board and you can just type
Java last jar the name of your jar file
LCD I square C gotcha and you are ready
to run it and actually you need to do it
using sudo because to access the i
square c bus you need to have the root
privilege to do that so let me show you
in my camera
okay now i'm here again and let's see
oh we have some light here so as i told
you i forgot to put the the the clear
method but you can see here you may see
here some okay here we go freaky here we
go so you can see the information that
is printed on my LCD display welcome and
it's changing ihe developer challenge
and welcome again let's wait for the
welcome and that's it so it's printing
in my in my LCD component and you in
question of 15 minutes you can start
playing with your eyes perceive
component so let's share my screen again
and more information so here is the
place that you have the another bus so
did those two pins here they are from
the past number one the one that is for
developers and these another one is just
it's just a into the revision number two
of the Raspberry Pi the revision number
one they just have one nice quercy bus
and the revision number two they add
another i square seed manager and you
have this those pins here and you don't
have the male the male connector so
direct so if you are looking to use
those pins we need to solder the male
connectors and remember that the planet
choose solder in the back of the board
if you solder the Mayo pins in the front
you are going to have a conflict when
you try to plug the wireless here so
remember that and all you need to do to
use the other I square C bus the bus
number 0 is to turn off the camera
support and use that so if you really
need I was talk with some engineers in
in article and if you have a chance to
see the chatham the very beautiful
project the chest the chest machine
project that plays by itself they have
many different i square c components and
they couldn't use just one bus so they
start using the other bus and they need
you to change the to turn off the camera
support so they make it free that you
use for development
so the other thing is that when you are
doing ice / see you sometimes you are
creating the i square c master device
like when you have when you have the i
square c raspberry pi i square see you
are raspberry pi is the master device
and the LCD is the slave device but
sometimes you can look to create a
prototype of a slave device using
raspberry pi okay you can do it
technically it's possible but you will
need to recompile the linux kernel from
the debian the rasp raspbian because by
default they is lame support is not
enabled so you need to do that and but
it doesn't make a lot of sense having
your Raspberry Pi as I slave device you
can do for a proof of concept but
definitely there is leave device
supposed to be a small one and well
that's another another thing about
master and the slave device let's back
to my slides and
we have the Angela's cocido blog here
I'm going to open just to give you an
idea about the content you will find
inside
so here is the complete blog on how to
use Java Sea embedded and the gyroscope
so if you are looking to the gyroscope
and a salido metered here is the right
place for you to start playing with that
component you have also the instructions
and enabling the ice Christ is
supporting your Raspberry Pi the wider
up as I show you and more information
here and you have the code so here we
can see almost the same thing so the the
bus instance and here get the device
itself so this case is the number 68 and
so the registers that you can start
playing with the components here you
have the access to the accelerometer
data and the gyroscope data so it's a
very complete and nice blog to start
playing with this component but you have
more than hundred different components
that is i square c and you can play with
raspberry pi and if you need to look for
more technical information about the
hardware details sometimes we are java
developers and we have the idea of i
just changed from one one computer to
another computer and everything we work
yes it's true the Java code will be ok
but sometimes you have some types of
architecture in your in one hardware and
is different in another hardware like in
the case of Raspberry Pi you have a
difference between the version 1 and the
version 2 they just add another ice
Percy bus so you need to change your
code is not the Java for it is a nature
a hardware nature the hydrophone so
sometimes you need you really need to go
deep and understand what is inside the
or do you are using the ship that is
inside you're bored so i recommend you
once you start doing complex a project
to having to have a printed version of
the schematics of the world that you are
using so we are going to open for
questions so you can make questions in
the in the shat in the event page sorry
so you can make questions on the event
page and we if you make a kind of
question that I need I need to research
for something sometimes you say I'm
using that component that I never tried
before I can help you but in this case
we are going to open a foreign question
and I will I will find the information
for you but if you have any other
question or problem that you like to
expose we are here to support you
you
questions
yeah I just want to say hello to all my
Brazilian friends hello guys thank you
for joining the hangout and thank you if
you are not Brazilian thank you all so
you are all welcome and
I am Here I am if you want to make some
question about the challenge if you want
to talk about your project if you want
to validate your idea the webinar we
always have time for the technical
content we spend one hour or one hour
and some minutes and the rest we are
here to support you to discuss your
project to analyze if you can do it or
not if we have some experience something
to point you so you can use this this
time for doing that
you
okay and let's try to ask another
important question who here is a part
want to participate in the challenge and
are looking to submit a project just
remember you can win a complete a fool
past you java one including the airplane
tickets the hotel and
okay from a nap too and I to the source
code that i showed today it will be
available once i finish here i'm going
to upload into the java.net let me give
you the URL here java.net projects iog
and java downloads you can go to iog
challenge here we already have the pie
forge a hello world by picture of sorry
we have here in the basic the basic
class we included the LCD i square see
sample but i will update today just with
the LCD project just you two to have for
each webinar we have one download file
without projects that we show during the
webinar and yeah let me cop the link to
you okay what I should
you
you
you
just one minute more
you
ok
so I'm just adding
here we go
oh I just put the link me put some
message
nice so I just put the link in the event
page the Hangout even paid so you can
access it now and start playing up the
Glen me Hayes hello guitar me my old
friend 20 years old friend he is asking
if i square c is indicated to exchange
data between raspberry pi and arduino so
it is but you need to take care because
raspberry pi is 3 volts and Arduino is 5
volts but if you are going to use
Arduino as I slave device you can do it
without burning your raspberry pi gpio
because once Arduino is in his late mode
it will turn off the pool the pullout
resistor so you will be fine so you can
do it definitely i square C is indicated
to do that but the best way to integrate
supposed to be through the USB if you
are going just to plug one or do you
know the USP is the best way because you
have a high-speed communication but if
you are going to make just a fill bites
of communication you will be fine using
nice perceive and if you google about
you will find many different blogs about
how to do this kind of integration many
people were read blog about it thanks
Grammy thanks cannot see Moyes for
making the questions and
we are here for more questions my
friends
okay we have another question from using
the page the question is if I have a GPS
which is better using I square C or spi
most of the GPS modules that I played
before at the most not not not most all
the GPS modules that I play it is not I
square C and is not spi they are you art
so if you have one gps module I never
saw one but if you have one gps with i
square c and spi support and you can
choose i would say to use spi because
it's faster but depending on the volume
of the data reading i square C will be
fine also so the the SPI will take more
wires and is a little bit more complex
but he is faster and I square C is light
in terms of white beans consumption but
this is lower so depending on the type
of the project and depend on the type of
GPS component do you have one that you
bought that is spi and I square C
you
you
to another let's go to another question
from her nap see Moines it's possible to
plug 10 analog sensors on the one
Raspberry Pi board so why not we don't
have analog converters in the Raspberry
Pi so you would need some some extra
component for doing that and you can
plug 10 analog sensors into your
Raspberry Pi board but you need to buy
the conversor the digital analog
converter and most of the confessors the
the converters day they would give you
four or five pins analog pins so you
will need to buy two of them and you can
top with a week and help with the
confessors and talk with your 10 in a
log sensors no problem so the sound is
another one that some ultrasound sensors
they are analog other one they are
digital but I have better experience
with the digital one compare it to the
analog but you can buy very expensive
ultrasound sensors for real professional
projects but the very cheap one that is
in a lot the precision is not that good
but you can do it Hannah
and i'm waiting for the Georgia stable I
answer that your question and I just
asked at you if you will read by a GPS
module that is spi and I square C at the
same time did you have one of these GPS
if you had and you could give me the
name of the module I can I can check for
the module and give you more details
about it because I never saw I used to
play with you our GPS module very well
the GPS you have the Disir 2 and C 3
modules the surf three you can have the
route you can trace the route using the
satellite and you don't need to make
calculations for routes and everything
so let me check ok you bath but George
Stefan is saying that he bought the Java
ME course ok from Adafruit like let's
check online we have time for do that
here in the Adafruit I was very happy
when I got got inside Adafruit website
and I see the Oracle and bedded kid here
we go Oracle Java embedded applications
with raspberry Pi back so the price is
very nice very nice 89 for the sensors
and a hundred and fifty for the sensors
plus the board is very nice price and so
Adafruit is distributing selling them
the dispatch let's check here
ubs
the second one I found it which made GPS
break up okay so this one is also you
can see here TX Rx so it's also you are
so you need to use the uart I think that
that the idea of using the GPS is
because it's a very nice component
having the GPS you are going to play
with you art and the other sensor that
comes with this kid is the the BNP 108
the barometric pressure temperature and
altitude so this woman is I think that
this one is I square C so this one is I
square C so the nice thing about this
kit is that you are going to improve
your knowledge about you art
communication and also I square C
components so
I just answered George stable
oh ok
you
yeah he not to another question from
Hannah to see Moyes thanks again I do
and it will be except a hybrid solution
yes because the only thing is that you
need to run java SE embedded in your
Raspberry Pi and you can use any other
component if you are using Java C or
Java me and bedded in your Raspberry Pi
you can use another board if you want
and you can use any other component we
are going to understand the other
Arduino as an additional component so
definitely you can you can use our
dwindling the hybrid solution yeah
you
hello Philippe be my friend thanks for
joining the the Hangout
Philippe is also playing a lot with
embedded and I'm sure that he will send
us submit a very nice project also
because I know this guy and he is
getting crazy ideas so don't miss the
chance Philippe and we we will be here
together
and i will pay you some beers now it's
not true because the beer is in yellow
one is almost free you can't find
cocktails there all the time and many
parties yeah
but I can pave somewhere else no problem
more questions guys
you
okay so thanks a lot everybody for
joining the the hangout remember that
next week we are going to show crazy
stuff direct from oracle santa clara
with crazy guys crazy birds crazy
projects so don't miss the next one and
i would like to thank you again thanks
your land for giving another support the
local support here here the building is
very big so we really need a guide in
your land was our nice guy today in
oracle santa clara and thanks Oracle
technology Network and yara that is here
also and thank you everybody for coming
see you next Monday bye bye my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
