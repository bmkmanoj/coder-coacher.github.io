this talk thank you for coming can we
switch to the what doesn't work
yeah thank you
all right so welcome to welcome to this
code talk thank you for coming
this is a talk about lambda expression
free your lambdas it's in fact a replay
I already did last year
so if you saw this talk last year it's
mostly the same this year this is a
tutorial session so we will be starting
at the very beginning of lambda
expressions I would not assume that you
have any knowledge about writing lambdas
who never wrote lambda expressions in
Java all right and who if you consider
yourself as a seasoned lambda expression
writer okay about the same amount of
people so we'll build up on things from
side to side and for example to create
patterns that we can't write without and
expression they see this is really the
topic of this talk it is really about
lambdas and functional interfaces and
things like that it is not to talk about
streams and characters so I will not be
covering this topic at all I will use
numbers in collection streams and
cultures by the way they are available
seats at the front so please if you have
an available stick next to you can you
raise your hand take your pick
alright my name is Josie I live in in
the Paris Area I put just some link here
my Twitter account github account I have
two open source projects called stream
duties and character GT that you might
check if you're interested in and I also
have a SlideShare account I'll publish
those lights on my SlideShare account by
tonight and also some content on a
github by the way I'm also a Java
champion and the Java work star music
before we start I'd like to apologize
because from the next two hours you'll
have to learn English speaking with the
French accent
the alternative would be that I speak
French that probably wouldn't work much
okay so if you have questions to
solutions you raise your hand you shout
you make yourself heard so that I can
hear you hear you and see you if you
don't or if you have questions up to the
top whatever you can use this hashtag
and try to watch it monitor it so that
you I can answer you using using Twitter
okay we're going to begin with very
basic stuff first question what is this
code doing this is the easy quiz of the
day right so this is basically a compare
table okay comparator this is this is
Java five code right we could write this
code in 2004 when Java 5 was released
and this is a compiler that basically
compared to people using the last name I
want to sort a list of people I can use
this comparator this is very basic stuff
two questions do you think this code is
readable no it's not that bad right I
wouldn't say it's very readable but kind
of okay we use to this code in fact
would you say that this code is robust
can it crash yes you can try if p1 is
new lore the last name is new
I do not check for any kind of new
pointer exceptions so your pointer
exception can be raised using this kind
of code all right let us make it a
little more complex with this one what
does this could do well basically kind
of does the same thing compares two
people using the last name and if the
last name is the same it compressed the
first name to sort this list of people
and if I ask myself is this code
readable hmm is it is it more readable
than the previous one
quite not it's probably less treatable
why because I have a if in it and we'll
I guess we all know the sonar toolkit
there is this cyclomatic complexity
computed by so now and we have increased
the cyclomatic complexity of this code
so yes readability as as decreased a bit
and also robustness because if you p1 is
new get last name returns a new value of
first name right on the new value this
code will also throw a null pointer
exception which is if I want to make it
robust it will be much more complex and
much less readable because I will have
all this technical code to check for new
stuff inside my application code all
right what is this code doing compare
people using the last name then using
the first name and if the last name and
the first name is the same which can
happen of course compare using the ages
yeah
how about readability hmm not that great
right much much lower I would say that
this is the kind of code was so used to
see in application that we do not really
need to read it line by line we just
have a global look at it and we see we
understand what it does and so so we
understand what it does yeah and it's
not that robust neither and by the way
since we do not read it line by line we
do not see problems that could be could
have sneaked in those code yeah you
check really I will I will fix the code
right oh my god I was comparing the last
name of the first person with the site
with the first thing with of the second
one did you see but did show it again
right since we have some kind of
automatic reading of this code we do not
we give places for sneaky bugs to hide
in and there was a bug in this code that
we maybe somebody
some of you didn't see at first you'd
better have a very good unit test case
to fix this code alright big to see this
bug because you need to have two people
with the same last name and the last
name of the first person has to be lower
than the first thing for the second
person to see this so this is typically
the kind of bug that will make it into
your production code if you're just
sorting lists of students or pupil or
pupils in a classroom it might be okay
but if you are drawing the winner of 1
million price and some kind of loss we
might be in trouble if you do that ok so
the problem with this comparator here I
am really trying to address a very
simple and very classical problem I need
to sort a list of people using the last
name their first name and their age and
every time I add a criteria in in this
in this comparison I increase the
cyclomatic complexity I decrease the
robustness and I have a terrible mess of
a code that is very hard to fix if there
are bugs in it so this is exactly what I
do not want to do and this is what we
are going to address using lambda
expressions and patterns with using
default beta system basically the code
we are going to write is this one which
does the exact same thing as the
previous one the difference being if I
add criteria through my comparator I
will just add method calls so I do not
increase socratic complexity and all the
code that is going to make my competitor
robust that is all the code that will
check for null pointer exception and
stuff is pushed in the API code does not
leak in my application code so it does
not make my application code any any
more complex all right so let us take a
closer look at the comparator basically
what we want to do is to sort the
strings of a list of strings of
character so that we can create a
comparator of string here I'm sorting my
strings using their length instead of
the alphabetical order person the
natural order okay so I can create a
combat so this is the Java
five have to Java 7 way of writing it
and what do I do with this comparator
the in a nutshell what I want to do is
to pass this comparator to salt methods
so I've got two in the JDK arrays dot
sort and Corrections that sort and those
sort method are going to use this
comparator later on what did we do we
just passed the piece of code as a
parameter to a method and this method
here in this case the salt method we'll
be using that code later on and several
times right and why did I use an
instance of an animist class to do that
well just because this is the only way I
have pass code as a parameter in Java 7
if I want to pass code as a parameter in
Java 7 I have to use an instance of
anonymous class I do not have any other
solutions to do that with lambda Azam I
can pass this code precisely as a lambda
expression so lambda is basically a way
to rewrite this comparator how is the
lambda returned now I just need to
consider that I have a block of
parameter to the method of this
comparator here the two strings and a
return statement and the lambda is
bigger as that I just copy/paste the
block of parameter draw this little
ASCII art a row using it their sign and
greater than sign this is just LG about
the old days of computing right and push
the return statement this is the way and
we're going to see many examples of that
this is how we write lambdas in general
the comparator interface becomes in Java
8 what is called a functional interface
what is a functional interface it's an
interface that has only one abstract
method this is the most simple
definition of what a functional
interface is the functional interface
may be annotated with this functional
interface annotation it's not mandatory
it sits
optional you don't have to do it if you
do it the compiler will tell you at
compile time that is in your IDE and
we'll see that if this annotated
interface is indeed functional or not if
you don't do it then the compiler will
tell you if you try to implement this
interface using a lambda hey you can do
that because this is not a functional
interface so it's just something that is
here to help you to helpers it's not
something that is mandatory by the way
since it is not mandatory it is also a
way to take your old Java let us save
five code in jars and implement it using
lambda expression in the Java eight
parts of your application without having
to recombine those so it's also for
backward compatibility reasons demo time
great I love demos but I need my glasses
okay it's the phone big enough yeah if
you if you can't read the code just just
tell me I can yeah you do that while I'm
doing that if you can raise your hand if
you have an empty seat near you because
there are people
is it better yeah is it now okay fine so
this is a list okay once a list and we
are going to use this this new for each
method defined on the interval interface
that allows that takes a long that that
is going to be applied on the list and
here this for each method takes a non de
expression as a parameter and the
question I'm asking myself is how can I
write this lambda expression this lambda
expression - right along the expression
you need to identify what is the
interface you need to implement it has
to be a functional interface and what is
the abstract method of this interface so
this is what I'm going to do for that I
can navigate to the fridge method oh
okay it's a default method to see that
this method takes a consumer as a
parameter I'm going to watch this
consumer interface this is indeed a
functional interface so by definition it
has only one abstract method which is
the accept method here how can i
implement this abstract method using a
lambda well as we saw in the slide I
just need to copy paste the block of
parameter let me do that draw this
little old fashioned hour like ask yacht
and return void so if I just want to
return what I can write it like that
this is a block of code that returns
void so at least it should compile as
long as I say that this T is in fact the
string and indeed this code does compile
the lambda I just wrote using this
method is an implementation of the
consumer interface of course it doesn't
do much so let us try to be smart here
I'm going to print out
this string of character okay that I
call t enough s and if I run this code
okay it just print out the content of
the list by the way I do not have to
write the type of the parameter here
because the compiler is smart enough
since he knows the method I am
implementing it is smart enough to guess
the type of T the compiler knows that
this is in fact a string of character so
you see that it's not that complex to
right-handers let us take another
example with another functional
interface which is the iterable
interface let us write an iterable
string okay let us take a look at this
interval interface this little interface
is not annotated with functional
interface but it has only one abstract
method which returns an iterator does
not take any parameter let us implement
that method using a lambda expression
copy/paste the block of code it's an
empty block of code draw this little
arrow stuff and return an iterator so I
could well return the null value this
code should compile and indeed it does
compile now I should be returning of
course a real iterator I've got a list
of strings here so I can just take the
iterator from this list of string and
this is an implementation of the
iterable interface I can check that just
by passing this iterable to this for
each pattern and print the result like
that it indeed prints out all the
elements of the interface of the other
list we can take one last example with
another interface the executor interface
executor
this executor interface is also a
functional interface it has only one
abstract method once again it's not
annotated with functional interface but
we can still work with it it takes a run
a ball as a parameter so let us take
this block of code and copy paste it
draw this little arrow and it returns
void so I can implement it using this
dump
order and this should compile and indeed
it does now what I need to do is of
course execute this run a ball so I
could write this command ran for
instance to execute this run of all I'm
going to call this executor number
because of course it's not it's
executing the runnable in the current
thread which is not what an executor
should do if I want to create another
executor that can that I can call smart
executor and run this task in another
thread I could use these executors
executors actually matado new or a
single thread executor execute this
command as a parameter so that you can
see all right we can test this code for
that I need a runnable this would be my
task by the way if I check the runnable
interface guess what relays are sewn
functional interface so I can implement
a runnable using a lambda let us do that
what does it take takes no parameter and
doesn't return anything so I should be
able to implement it like that
looks like JavaScript right okay so this
is this is a random compiled
and it would work of course it wouldn't
do much but it would work so what I can
do is appoint for instance just print
out the thread Amina I am in thread read
current read something like that and
then dump executors execute this task
and do it again with my smart executor
if I run this code indeed the first one
was executed in the main thread which is
which is exactly what is expected and
the second one executed in one thread
one which is the thread of my executor
service I need to shut this by hand
because I did not shut down this mod
executable which is of course very wrong
don't use this kind of code in
production just one note if I take this
code here as an iterable and copy-paste
there
I have no if you can see it I have a
compiler
oops I have a compiler error this code
does not compile why because the
compiler has to know at compile time the
type of lambda expression I am writing
so lambda should be either affected to a
field or variable will be sent as a
parameter or be written by by a method I
cannot take a lambda as it is put it
just like that in this code and hope
that it would work for instance if I
just copy paste this code here like that
put it into parenthesis and code like
that I will have a compiler error
because the compiler cannot guess what
is the type of the lambda of just
written I need to put it in a variable
for that
I'm going to swim to this go alright
alright let's continue so writing along
down in a chair is a matter of finding
you what interface what functional
interface I am implementing and in that
interface to identify which method I am
implementing and when I have identified
that it's a matter of taking the block
of parameter understanding what should
be returned and be smart and put the
right code in the body of them so
basically a method lambda is just a
method that I can pass as a parameter in
my code in my application there is
something kind of where that just happen
ah yes this funny syntax is called a
method reference we are going to see
that in a minute that is the for each
method is defined on the iterable
interface this is the code that we just
wrote here right and has been added in
Java 8 so adding a method in an
interface of course implies that all the
implementations of that interface should
be updated for the code to work and of
course it would have meant to refactor
all the collection API and all the
existing implementations of iterable
interval is the root interface of all
the collection yard so so it would have
required to update all the code around
which would not have been possible of
course it would have broken the backward
compatibility of the correction
framework which is not possible so now
go in Java to do this kind of thing so
the way interfaces work if you have an
empty seat near you can you raise your
hand again please comment can have a
seat downtown stay at the back so the
way interfaces work have been modified
in Java 8 and for each method is in fact
a default method what is a default
method it's a regular method added in an
interface along with its implementation
it just had the default
keyword in front of in front of it right
and there's something it's it is just a
plain regular method very very easy to
understand the this default method is a
normal method put in an interface what
is new is that we can now have
implementations in an interface was not
possible up to Java 7 but it is a new
concept of interface it is not a new
concept of method it is just a plain old
regular method as well used to write
down this is how it has been sold to us
when Java 8 was released almost 4 years
ago but it is much much more than that
and and I guess that in a few years from
now people will not be learning that
default method have been introduced for
the backward compatibility bla bla bla
they will learn something else and by
the way we can also put public static
methods in Java 8 in interfaces which is
new and in Java 9 will be able to put
private static methods to so a function
will isn't so now in an interface I can
have abstract methods default methods
and static methods only abstract methods
count to tell if an interfaces is a
functional interface or not default and
static method do not count which is nice
because it means that I will be able to
put abstract methods in function
interface and add a bunch of of default
method which is what I'm going to do
another what are we going to do I'm
going to close this tab
I don't need it anymore
I prepare the two interfaces we are
going to use now
first the my consumer interface which is
a mimic of a consumer interface from the
java.util package that we're going to
talk about in a minute and we are going
to do stuff with it what is a consumer
it has only one method this is the
system dot out dot println we've been
using with the Forex method a few
minutes ago right so I'm going to create
a first consumer consumer string for
instance are eating yeah
yeah this is eating yes okay and if I'm
calling the accept method of this my
consumer interface eating chicken and I
run this code it just displays eating
chicken which is nice I'm going to write
a second consumer drinking right there's
almost the same
drinking I'm going to run it drinking
drinking except coffee okay chicken and
drinking coffee now suppose I will I
want to create another consumer eating
and drinking I want in fact to compose
those two consumers into one just one
and for that I would like to write this
kind of code and then drinking okay of
course this and then method doesn't work
on it and then I need to create it how
can i implement this kind of thought
this is very basic pattern right I won't
just to create a consumer that will be
the combination of the first consumer
and that the chaining of the first
consumer and then the second consumer
what if I check this method and then
what is this method it is a method
called
only eating object here so it's an
instance method of the eating object so
I have on this my consume interface
another method called and then of course
that is going to take something and
return something
what does it take as a parameter it
takes a my consumer and what does it
return them returns another micron Shiva
do that I take my consumer as a
parameter and return my consumer object
if I write it like that this interface
is perfectly legal but of course you
have the problems because I have an
interface that has to abstract methods
it's not a functional interface anymore
so it does not compile I cannot
implement this interface using a lambda
by the way if I add
this functional interface annotation
here you see that this time the the
compiler will be raised on the interface
itself since I have two abstract method
and this interface is not a functional
interface anymore so this adding this
method as an abstract method is not the
way to go but remember I can add default
methods on Maya fractional interface on
any kind of interface by the way so let
us make this interface default this time
I need to provide an implementation and
you see that this code does compile my
interface is functional again and of
course I can implement it using lambda
expressions so now what should I do in
this and then method what I need to
return is a my consumer okay my consumer
is a functional interface so it can be
implemented using a lambda what is this
lambda well just need to apply the exact
same method with it
we applied previously identify the only
abstract method of the my consumer
interface then copy/paste the block of
parameter draw this little funny right
stuff and return okay boy so if I write
it like that it should compile and
indeed it does compile this it this is a
consumer alright so now I need to be a
little smarter what I expect here is to
first consumer the object I am going to
pass to this compost consumer to consume
them with the first consumer the
consumer I am in this consumer and then
the consumer passed as a parameter so
let us do that when I am in this code I
am in an instance of a consumer so I can
call this accept
of T maybe print out something like that
and then and then consume this T object
with the other consumer passed as a
parameter right now if I eating and
drinking eating and drinking accept good
food okay I'm not really drinking good
food but anyway it will just work like
that my default method implemented
invite the chaining of the to consumers
this and other passed as a parameter so
you see that using this kind of default
method allows us to invite opens up all
the way of new patterns that is
composing lambda expressions and this is
what we are going to do until the end of
this of this session let us take another
example with the with another functional
interface from the JDK that I have
mimicked here any available seats
alright so it might predict eight
interface once again it is a mimic of
the predicate interface available on J
in the JDK and we are going to write
some some stuff with it
so my we are going to take for instance
of my predicate of Austria my particular
string you know not new right and it
will just check if this this given
string of character or not and I'm going
to take another one shorter and then all
right it's it will be s that length
length less than ten those are two
predicates and a natural way to combine
predicates to compose predicates is for
instance two to use and meet the other
so not new dot and shorter than ten
should also be a predicate a string that
I'm going to call let's say p1 okay so
once again I am facing the exact same
problem as the the composition of my to
consumers Here I am and method that is
an instance method of the not new object
so it is an instant method into my
predicate interface it cannot be another
abstract method because if it was it
would break the functional interface
stuff so I'm going to make it a default
method and then this and then method
takes a predicate as a parameter and
returns also a predicate let us do that
so return the predicate takes a
predicate as a parameter so if I just
return near here it should at least
compile it does not oh yes sorry this is
just and here so now it should compile
thank you all right so what do I return
and my predicate how do i implement
predicates using a lambda this lambda is
an implementation of the test method
that is here always the same process of
creating this lambda so I'm just going
to copy paste the block of parameter I
need to return a boolean so if I just
return true with a first step to see at
least that could compile indeed it does
and this boolean should be the logical
end of the predicate I am inner using
this test method
and the predicate passed as a parameter
so here is just this test of T and test
we can test this code p1 the test stable
printer n test with
from this code oops
sorry
nine-nine
yes one reason this is a pretty cake
oh yeah right sorry yes that's right
okay thank you
what happens uh okay so this what like
that what happens if I pass no as a
parameter here this is interesting if I
run this code of course oops
I'm going to if I run this code of
course I have a null pointer exception
but the interesting point is where does
this no pointer exception comes from you
see that it comes from inside the lambda
which is here if all there is now this
code is going to throw the null pointer
exception as long as the first test is
true so it means that if I do not call
this code this code is going to run
perfectly well you see so if I create a
predicate with an other that is new I
have a corrupted lambda expression that
is going to that is bound to throw a
null pointer exception somewhere but
this new pointer exception will not be
thrown at the creation of the lambda but
when I will be using this come down in
my application so if I pass this lambda
to some kind of other module in my
application and this standard is used in
ten days from now this null pointer
exception is going to be thrown much
later than the moment where this lambda
is created and this will make an kind of
impossible to fix
but because the the stacktrace I will
have will give me the place where the
lambda is used when the bug is in fact
at the place where the lambda is created
so if I want to prevent this kind of
stuff I need to throw the null pointer
exception at the lambda creation that is
here now if I run this code again
of course the null pointer exception is
thrown when I try to build a lambda and
this is a pattern we really need to use
because we do not want to have
impossible to fix bugs in our
applications this is a an application of
a very old principle in exception and
Lane we chill which is fail fast fail
first if I know that this one is going
to be cluttered I throw a minor point
exception right now by the way this is
what I should have been doing here also
objects
yeah yeah
yeah you mean if I call and then and
then and then and then it will continue
to work no problem and then
yeah lutely you can't you can change
consumers you can chain as many
consumers as you need and you can
compose as many predicates as you need
with and and create and all methods or
this kind of thing yeah well you mean in
Nicole yeah yes but this is this is what
I've written if this is what I need it's
okay you see this is a consumer well
there's nothing you can do to prevent
that from within the intent method
because you don't know okay this is a
consumer I could put that in a variable
and this is just a regular consumers I'm
just calling and then method on the
regular consumer so there is no way
within the Endon method for me to know
that in fact the consumer I I am in is
itself a composition of other consumers
we can also predicate for instance we
can also create other default methods
for instance the p1 the shorter than 10
I could say alright I want I want to
implement the negate operator on the
consumer the this negate operator is
also a default method but this time it
does not take any parameter okay so let
us write it default it returns a my
predicate of T call negate and does not
take any parameter okay so what should I
return now once again this is a
predicate so I copy/paste the block of
parameters here little arrow and this
should return
the negation of the testing of T which I
can write just like it so you see that
default method allowed us to implement
composition and manipulations of
functions as expressions okay so we've
got functional interfaces to write on
that expressions we have default methods
to compose them we also have a static
method that can be used as factories and
we're going to see that on further
examples what what the idea is to give
to our code the better readability
essentially because we are moving some
part of the technical code especially
the the null pointer handling to the API
instead of having them having that code
inside our application code this is this
is what leads to better readability and
also better robustness because we can
check for all the exceptions inside
inside our code and it also gives better
performances I will not be covering that
point but if you're interested in that
there is a very interesting talk by
Brian gates called lambda peek under the
hood available on YouTube we have I
mentioned the several time the my
consumer and my predicate which are in
fact mimics of the consumer and
predicate functional interfaces
available in the GDK in fact i've got
four big categories of functional
interfaces in this Java util function
package the consumer the supplier the
function and the predicate we will see
examples of suppliers and functions for
the examples those are the most basic
implementations of those functional
interface interfaces of consumer take
something does not return anything the
supplier does not take anything and
reach on something the function takes an
object of a given type and returns an
object
and the predicate is a special kind of
function that returns a boolean
I can also well those are more elaborate
example that and I've also have a fifth
lambda expression where functional
interface that fits nicely I think in
this in this set which is the runnable
interface a runnable interface is not
new it has been here from very early
days of the GDK and it's something that
doesn't take anything and does not
return anything things think about the
logger for instance basically a logger
it can be modeled as a rainbow let us go
back to our comparator example we are
going to write a comparator of people
and for that we are going to use a
lambda expression and then sorry
anonymous class and then along the
expression it's demo time again okay we
need to close all this stuff alright
play with comparators so I've got a my
comparator interface which is a mimic of
the real compare to interface all right
I'm going to play with it and I also
have a person class which is a basic bin
with three properties first name last
name and age I'm going to play with that
so let us create my comparator a person
I'm going to call it CMP one new my
competitor yes if I do not support this
person we are going to implement it real
quick right person p1 and person P 2 and
what I want to do is the following I
want to first I want to p1 take the last
name
this is last name here and p2 that get
us name this is last name too
and then I would just want to return the
comparison of last name one with a
lasting two this is my comparison now if
I take a closer look at this code what I
can do here is extract that to a method
right and if I do that I can see they in
fact my comparator here only depends on
this method that is if I want to compare
people using their first name what I
need to do is change its code and the
rest of the code is the same so the
comparator have written in fact depends
on the method well this is nice because
I know that with long down with London's
I can pass methods as parameters so what
I need to do is to transform this method
in a lambda and then I will be able to
create a comparator just by passing risk
lambda as a parameter to some kind of
factory method for instance okay what
does this method do it takes a person
and return a string of characters takes
an object returns an object from another
type the model for therefore that
functional interface which is the model
for that is the function that takes an
object precisely in return another
object of another type so let us write
this function
it takes a person returns a string I'm
going to call it no last name okay it
takes a person P if I found if I have
trouble implementing that I can just
navigate to this and copy paste whatever
I need from this applied method here I'm
going to do it directly takes a person P
and called get last name right now that
I have this functional to transform this
p1 into last name one what I need to do
is call last name and apply it to p1 and
do the same here
last name sorry last name apply for some
p2 here
I do not need this method anymore and
now my code only depends on a kind of
object it's not really an object but let
us call it like that which is this one
and I see that in fact all this code if
I put it in a method yes I can convert
it if I put in a method only depends on
this last name here by the way I'm going
to to make it run the expression all the
IDS can do that extract this and this is
this is let us make it too long the
expression okay it as I have extracted
this code into a static method which is
a factory method that takes a function
and that returns the comparator written
as a lambda expression so this method
called extract Erdem since it is a
factory method and since I am allowed to
put static factor
on interfaces I can put it here
extractor this method returns a my
comparator of T since it is static I
need to declare the type here and I am
going to call it for instance comparing
what's wrong with it yeah
this should be it
so now I can my comparator is created by
calling this factory method my
comparator comparing last name I do not
need this static method here because
I've moved it to the my compiler
interface and this last name is just
this lambda expression so I'm going to
ignite this and remove this and by the
way this time the expression can be
returned as an as a method reference my
IDE can have been doing that person
current count get last name it's just
another syntax for method reference is
just another syntax to write our lambda
expressions and this is the final
pattern to create comparators using
those factory methods and lambda
expressions if I check the code in fact
all the creation of the compiled to
itself using lambda is now in my API
instead of being in my application code
if I want to make this code robust by
checking if last name is nil the first
thing I should be doing of course is
throw another experimental pointer
exception if here by by the way I'm
going to call that extractor all right
and if I want to check that last name
they say this is s1 and this is s2 not
necessary the last name if I want to
check if s1 or s2 is near I can do it
inside my API without having to lower
the readability of my application code
but what what I would like to do now is
go one step further and say alright if
the last name the last name of my two
people are the same then I want to
compare using the first name for
instance then
person yet
first name what is the status of this
new method then compare well obviously
it is called on the comparator this is
okay so it is an instance method of the
my comparator interface I fall back on
the same kind of question as previously
there is the that we saw with my
consumer of all my predicate so what I
can do is create this then compare
method as a default method of the my
comparator interface it is going to take
the same kind of parameter as the
factory method comparing and returns
also my comparator of T so let us do
that default as I said it returns my
comparator of T it is called then
compare and takes a function that takes
two T returns the string Y now what I
need to return them is a comparator the
comparator is a functional interface and
implementation of this method so once
again I'm doing the same thing
copy-paste this block of parameter then
return an integer for instance one at
least it should work and it doesn't now
I need to be a little smarter than that
of course what should I be doing first I
need to compare the people using the
comparator I mean so get the result of
this compared T 1 and T 2
now if CMP is equal to zero then I need
to fall back on the comparator
constructed using the past is a key
extractor and if it's not the case I
just return the value of CM
this code is gone here I need to create
another comparator using the past key
extractor there but I've got this
factory method for that extractor this
is my comparator of T I can call it
other and just return the result of the
comparison using other okay so this is
an implementation a possible
implementation of the combination of two
comparators created in two different key
extractors by the way by the way I also
need to protect myself against the
psychopathic try to call me with an arc
extractor
this one should even be could even be
written with the ternary operator
kind of like the ternary operator it
reminds me my old days of C programming
so it simply is equal to zero what I
returned in the company exactor which is
the comparator compared t 1 and t 2 and
if it's not the case just CMP on this
code
almost
what's wrong with you okay right this is
nice so you see that we almost done with
our program do you remember this large
piece of unreadable crappy Java 7 blah
blah blah code showed you at the
beginning we almost we almost there we
almost there
we're not quite there because what I
would like to do is compare it also
using person yet age and this one does
not compile why because age is an
integer and I wrote my code to take
function that takes a string that
written the string as a parameter so I
need to deep dive into more generic hell
which is something that everybody loves
of course so I'm going to use a treat
for that right
see how can I do it string here and I'm
going to go
never tell anyone you saw me doing that
all right I'm gonna do the same here
encourage you so know what I'm basically
trying to do is okay this is not a
string this is any any kind of object of
type you so it will work now because
because this this code does compile but
the static that the factory method does
not compile because on this you object I
need is compared to method on it and
this compare to method in fact is
defined on the comparable interface so
you has to extend comparable and if you
want to make it correctly its comparable
super you some kind of reason welcome to
the generics paradise okay so if I if I
do it like that now it would work and
code will compile because integer is a
comparable object and string is and now
my comparator can be I could go even
even one step further like this by
telling okay now that I have this
comparator in fact I want to sort my my
students in the other way around just by
calling the reversed on this on this
comparator so reverse once again I think
you've got the trick now it's also a
default method of my compiler interface
so let us write it and you see that it's
going to be very easy in fact default
takes my compiler of T returns ROI or my
compart of T this is the reversed method
does not take any parameter what is
return is a comparator so once again
implemented using a lambda and it
returns the the opposite of the result
of the comparison of t1 and t2 this
compare
you want to I can I have two tricks to
achieve that either I put a minus here
and it will reverse the comparison or if
I do not want to put the minus here I
can just compare t2 and t1 to achieve
the same result sure yep - you don't do
both because if you do both it will not
work of course obviously but you can
choose that I'm pretty sure that some of
you are thinking is I think that if I
put the - it will be faster than if I
okay I don't know it's really up to you
yeah
I could also treat other factory method
on this comparator stuff for instance my
comparator string
CMP - and I want to create my competitor
because
zero compared with your fancies to zero
they say this is a this is a static
method can I create it yes I can model
and I'm going to return the comparator
string this one is to and return the
comparison of s1 with model for instance
return sorry no so it doesn't make sense
I'm messing up with a let us suppose
yeah this is a string so let let us
suppose that we just want to compare
those strings using the natural order to
change sorry
so for the confusion I'm going to change
the example okay because the string is
already a common of a comparable object
so I can just use the natural order back
and this is going to be something like
that it's one that compared to and by
the way I can do it for any kind of
object that is comparable you extends
comparable
I'm sorry yeah
we're done
well you asked to exam sorry you asked
to extends comparable because what I'm
doing is using this compare to method
which is precisely defined on the
comparable interface strain implements
comparable it was the same problem as
the as the previous one here when I went
from the string to the to you if I do
not say that you extends comparable that
you fault back to object and I do not
have this compared to never one object
this is why I can't use the comparative
method here I'm saying that you extends
comparable and this comparable method
which is by the way functional interface
has the compareto method so it's another
way of creating factory methods on the
comparator interface yeah we can we can
- we can take a very quick look on the
comparator interface from the GDK eight
it has the compareto method as usual and
after that five hundred lines more than
five hundred lines of default and static
method to create comparators using five
methods and combine a combination of
them
and okay so we saw how to use default
method to combine and to compose
predicates and comparator so how to use
factory method to create instances of
lambda expressions without having any
kind of complex stuff leaking in a coder
let us go one step further by the way
I've been using method references in my
code I could show you other examples of
that because we wrote lambdas that were
in fact method references this is a
method reference I have this magic
shortcut in Eclipse control 1 and if a
lambda is a method reference you select
it control 1 and it will give you the
possibility to directly make it make it
a method reference this is also a
measure reference and guess what this
one is too
oh well this one is to my reference
which is here right the next one is not
okay so there are four types of method
reference I've put them in this in this
table
static bound instance unbound instance
and constructor will see constructor in
a minute and I also gave you examples of
how to pass from a lambda to a method
reference in order for cases beside the
slides will be variable slideshare I
guess you all know this book this is
called the Gang of Four it has a bunch
of wonderful patterns in it we're not
going to talk about all those patterns
but what I would like to show you is
just a hint on how to implement some of
those patterns using lambda expressions
default methods and factory methods in
very efficient way that is begin with
the factory pattern I love this one the
factory
close this so I've created a class that
is a factory it doesn't do much for the
moment is it the one I want to use I'm
going to use this this little class so
what is the factory well I do I want to
create a factory
I have several several other objects in
my in my model package here a shape a
shape object which is just an abstract
shape there's nothing in it the circle
class that extends shape with two
constructor that takes one that is empty
and another one that takes a color and
also a square and a triangle class to
use how should I be using a factory
object this is my factory if I want to
create a factory of circle so called
factory basically what I expect from
this factory of circle I don't know how
to create it but what I expect this from
this factory to be able to call a method
suppose a get method that is going to
return so they say this is the basic
pattern of how to use a factory now if I
take a look at this code if I take a
look at this code from the from the
lambda perspective this get method here
doesn't take any parameter and does
return an object so if you remember the
four categories of lambda expression I
have this is a supplier it doesn't take
anything creates an object so it means
that my factory here is in fact not
necessary a class could be an interface
that extends
supplier of tea and supply of cheese
very nice because it has a get method
that does not take anything that and
that creates something so if I want to
create an implementation of that Factory
so we the same I just take a block of
parameters and what should I return well
a new circle
so basically this is a factory from the
Gulf implemented using lambdas in July
and by the way this is also a
constructor method reference that I came
that I can write in this way what could
I do with this factory well I could for
instance say ok so a factory
give me five circles in list
five circles
what is this get method it's not the
same as the get method that does not
take any argument it's a method defined
on the instance of the factory so once
again this is a default method okay so I
can create here a default method you
treat on the list of T it takes an
integer let us make it written your list
just to have it compile this is a list
and this is in your list and that's it
at least it compile now what should I be
doing in this create five circles and
put them in a list I could create a
follow-up but I am using Java 8 so I've
got this nice in stream object then can
create a stream of n integers for me I
can map the stream to object take the
index return and you saw new sorry
return a new instance of what this
Factory can create that is called a
stopgap method could put this here right
and put the result list
and just return that for loops are so
Java 8
Java 7 sorry okay so this is just one
line to to to to create this thing and
if I run this code with factories
five circles for each system that out
printer n code and get all my five
circles created using this default
method now I have another constructor is
my in my circle which is a circle that
takes a color as a parameter so suppose
I want to what I would like to do now is
to create for instance red red circles
red circles factory doesn't take
anything and you so call this is the
create way to code just copy paste this
code five this is five red circle run
this code and then if I run this code I
have first five normal circles and then
five red circles so from from a factory
I can add as many default method as I as
I need to create more stuff to add
functionalities to my to my factory
which is nice what is not that nice is
the way this code is written here
because in fact what I what I'm doing
here is it's putting inside the supplier
parameter that I would like to pass as a
parameter to another method in fact I
would not not I'm not too happy with
this code I better write it like that
I prefer write it like that Factory and
say okay I passed the constructor as a
parameter new so-called of color and
then pass the color also as a parameter
okay this is what I would like to do
Factory and pass it for instance or
factory method to the to the factory
class itself so this create method here
with a static method of the factory
class we've been doing that to return
the factory the factory it takes what is
this it takes a car as a parameter and
return this code zero so this is a
function takes an object return an
object of a node type create takes a
function we are going to make it with
this is a factory circle right so I'm
going to write it like that it should be
easier
it takes a color as a parameter and the
circle my circle and this is in fact my
constructor and take a color as a
parameter and it should be I'm going to
return there here and it should it
should return and this should return the
factory that is something that doesn't
take any argument and returns a factory
of circle so for that I need to in fact
take my constructor and apply the color
to that function here what I did is a
very important portent operation I took
a function and made it the supplier by
fixing the parameter of that function
right and this is the second fundamental
operation in functional programming the
first one is composition and the second
one is partial application what I've
done here is a partial application on
function to lower the number of
parameters that function take dates
since this function take takes only one
parameter blowing it give me a supplier
and this
exactly what I did so now my factory can
be returned I that it's still working by
the way okay which is great and since
this is also a method reference I can
write it like that and it gives me a
very clean pattern because if I if I
compare the two patterns here I've got
this circled column column new on both
on both sides even if it does not
represent the same thing this is some
kind of trap with method references is
that if you do not know the type of a
method reference you cannot really know
what is this method reference exactly
you see here I've got a method reference
that is the supplier and here this is
the same method reference the same
string of characters for the reference
but it's a function it's not the same
type and it does not do the same thing
right if I control click on this new
here it will take me to the empty
constructor of the circle doesn't take
any parameter written something this is
a supplier and if I check this other
method reference here if I control click
on this new object here a new code here
it takes me to the constructor that
takes a parameter because the type of
this method reference is not the same
okay how do I know that it's not the
same because this create method here
takes a function and not to survive this
is whatever the trick is so be careful
with those metal references
okay I think we're done with the factory
that's on ya the next pattern I would
like to show you is the registry and
under builder pattern the register
button is a very nice pattern
yeah demo time once again so this time
what I want to do is to create a
registry fact a factory that will create
instances of objects with providing some
kind of key to say alright what I want
is a circle what I want is a triangle
what I want is a square something like
that if I if I do this kind of thing I
probably end up writing this kind of
code switch key if my key is a circle
that I know what I want to do is to
return I'm returning a factory right new
circle if what I'm getting is a triangle
I want to return a factory triangle it's
this one and if I get a square or I want
to return
he's a square
it should be a shape if I want the under
default right the default and if I don't
have anything what I want to do is to
throw a new illegal argument exception
there's nothing
that's one beer factory of shape
Meishan this one
okay
so this is something okay and I'm going
to yeah so here I've got so this is this
one so here I want to create my shape
factory ship back to your shape shape
factor in equals new shape factory right
and if I call shape factory so create
circle each returns up yes I got to draw
over the shape here it's not a right
shape the shape are created okay so this
is my my my circle factory factory
and I want to cast that into a factory
of circle since what I get is in fact a
factory machine
right
happy we did
okay like that yes I've got this funny
warning so let us get rid of this with
this kind of magic hack provided by the
GDK suppress warning unchecked yes I
know what I'm doing okay so this is this
is basically the registry pattern as we
all saw it in our application might be
not in this exact form but basically
this is this is what what we what we can
do you see that this registry pattern
well can can be created on a way we
creat the factory in the previous
example which is which is basically this
one by the way if I want to create a
single home for instance I want to
return all the way the same triangle
here if I'm with this with this factory
I am returning a new triangle every time
I'm calling this Factory
but if I want to make it a single tone I
could
just create a triangle as a private this
oh this is not static so I can do it
like that triangle equals new triangle
and with the strake return always the
same triangle with my supplier this
would be an implementation of the
singleton pattern as a singleton pattern
might not be the best pattern of the
world but you can still implement it
using using this kind of a blonde
expression what is not that great with
this way of writing things is that what
is not as great that grid is that if I
want to add them stuff to my to my to my
registry I need to modify this code
recompile it recompile all my life my
application and everywhere I I need to
do I'm using this registry we rewrite my
code everywhere so did this is not very
how could I say that very very dynamic
way of funding registries what I what
most of the time people do to fix that
is to use a bingo pattern okay I've got
to builder here which is the class this
builder pattern works in two steps first
step I add elements to my registry and
then second step I use my registry as it
is by calling the big method and using
this Jai factory we can just yeah
I'm going to put this one here
so I can how can I use this builder
pattern but so many builders where where
is minor thanks here
right a builder so it's a bit of what
it's a bit of shape new bidder
okay so in a first step I'm going to add
a so called I'm the factory of circle
which is so called you and the same for
triangle
Thank You clips do zero later later
don't there's another triangle and the
same four square
just like that and now that my builder
is done I just called the big stuff the
build method on it to create my shell
Factory and from that chip factory I
will be able to create my factories and
use my factories as I mean this is by
the way a pattern that has been used in
industry maybe I itself if I check the
stream interface I've got a builder a
member interface that extends consumer
in which I can add elements to it I add
elements to that builder once this is
done I just got the Builder method on
that builder to get to create the stream
with all the elements I have added to
the bidder the problem is that once I
have called the build method I cannot
call them the add method anymore so this
object has to remember state ok I am in
the build mode I think it amounts to my
builder and then I have created the
object I was building so I'm out of the
build mode and it's somebody caused the
add object again I should raise an
exception or something like that for an
exception to tell the people a this this
builder is done you cannot add any more
elements to it so if I if I come back to
my pattern I've got in fact the exact
same problem in this pattern is that
once I have called this bill method here
I need to create some kind of internal
mechanism to make sure that nobody is
going to add any more object to this
builder and this may be quite complex
first you need to to write this code
which is not that simple
and second you need to think that other
people can can access using reflection
to your internal registry other threads
could be doing the same also so you need
to handle all these kind of cases if you
do not want to have any bugs in your
application they say this is not that
great now how can we
make this make this pattern better
precisely using numbers first what we
can see is that this shape factory here
as only in fact one method to implement
here and when you have a class that has
only one method to implement you should
have something in your mind telling you
oh maybe I could make it an interface
and implement that using the lambda
because most of the time it's possible
I'm going to call this shape Factory
need to rename it legacy legacy shape
Factory and I'm going to create another
shape factory as an interface
and I'm just keeping the same method
here thank you
are you like that
you can see that this code is still
still compiling by the way yes because
it's now built on sheer factory
it keeps please
what is he doing doesn't want to import
refactoring
trusting okay this is do it by him
oh yes is some public sorry okay and
this bit that bill is going to return
the ship factory yes okay so my shape
factor is now is now and now I need to
face and I'm going to implement it using
a lumber now what is this admitted going
to do well it will have to put this in
some kind of registry so let us create
that map this is the natural way of
doing it's a map of stranger and factory
of T registry when you wash map ok and
what I'm going to do is just add this
registry put yes key and now when I'm
building this stuff what I need to
return is a shape factory
what is this shape factory it's an
interface that is functional so it can
be implemented using lambda how can i
implement it implemented using a lambda
just copy paste the block of parameter
and from that key I need to get the
factory that is here because this sorry
this implementation returns a factory
and the factories in the map so do this
kind of thing registry but get
troubles with the generic stuff man
excuse me
make it what it's me to try to the final
okay so in fact this bill method is just
I'm going to to make it like that you
see I'm going to copy paste this code
repeat here because in fact this code is
a method reference it's just a get
method of my register and this this is
what it is in fact to Bill do it Chester
it's just a registry and when I create
the stuff I'm just giving it to this map
but I'm still not quite happy with the
code because here I have some code that
is going to call add multiple times and
to cook that can be interrupted that can
be made multi-threaded that can subject
to reflection it's not it's not that
great but if I check what does this code
do in fact and I'm going to use the same
trick I use to show you how the
comparator was made if I extract this
code to this to a method or what I see
is that in fact it's a piece of code
that takes a builder as a parameter and
does not return anything so in a sense
what is this piece of code take
something does not return anything
it's itself a lambda expression that is
a consumer right so in fact all this
code can be returned as a consumer let's
do that it's a consumer of what the
consumer vinda okay consumer of builder
of shape let's call it consumer for the
moment it takes a builder as a parameter
I'm just going to write it below like
that and does this here I can get rid of
this method I do not need it anymore
and now the nice stuff is I do not need
that bit anymore I do not need a builder
in
my application code to initialize a
builder and you have created the model
of initialization and this is a very
very general pattern in fact the process
of finishing an object using a builder
is basically a consumer so you can write
this consumer pass this consumer this
extracted stuff passed this consumer to
a factoring method of our builder
interface builder create pass this
consumer as a parameter and now what I
expect to have as a returned object is a
bigger object that is both created and
initialized with the consumer I have
provided ok so what is this method
obviously it's a static method on my
builder interface public static or did I
call it create texture consumer as a
parameter returns a builder okay with of
T I need to tell the acidity create and
take the consumer of builder of T as a
parameter and this is my initializer
let us return you to see if we got it
right I think so all right so now in
this static method what I had to have is
create this builder new bidder
okay and pass this bitter as a parameter
to the initializer we just passed like
that and return this builder okay so you
see that now I mean I'm in a better
shape than previously because I cannot
interrupt the process between the
construction of the object and its
initialization so it's not possible to
interact it anymore but I can go even
even further because now I'm just
calling this create factor in the other
so this build method here is not used
anymore I can just get rid of it okay
and what I see here is that I have only
one method in my video object well if I
have only one method that probably means
that one I mean one instance method if I
have only one method in my video object
probably means that I can make it an
interface and make this method abstract
that I'm going to comment out this code
make this method abstract and make my
glitter an interface now of course this
registry here cannot be an instance
failure of an interface I cannot create
this builder like that anymore because
it's another object but this is a lambda
so I can implement it just using an
implementation
of this abstract method here so let us
do that I just copy paste always the
same principle I just copy paste block
of parameter and what should I be doing
with that doing registry dot put key and
factory this registry cannot be created
as a field but it can be created as the
local variable alright so first I create
my registry then I create my builder
third step I initialize my builder using
a consumer and then I return it and this
piece of code here is in fact a method
reference I'm going to keep that so if I
really want to make my code completely
unreadable I can just write it like that
okay
okay okay so you see that using this
kind of code I can go really very
further with only very simple principles
that is try to get to to to understand
where the lambdas are when I have a
class with only one method have in mind
that I can implement that class well I
can make an interface with that class
and implement it with a lambda and you
see that here I'm a very better shape
much better shape than than I used to be
in the previous example okay in the
first step I had the creation of an
object in a class the registry was a
field of that class remember here this
was a field of that class anybody could
have access using reflection to the feet
of that class meaning that could that I
could correct my code with reflection or
concurrency or thing like that now my
registry is completely hidden it's a
local variable in a static interface so
nobody can see it even using reflection
I do not have to use a concurrent - map
here because this code will be executed
just by one single thread you can have a
local variable shared I'm afraid this is
not possible so this code is both much
more robust much less error-prone than
the previous one it might not be that
simple - right I agree but it's still
very
right and I think I'm done with it
yeah
all right
so this is my confusions my confusion
you see that lambdas expression alumni
expressions have been presented as a
nicer way to write instances of
anonymous classes and default methods
have been presented also as as a way to
modify existing interfaces without
changing classes this was useful to know
when Java it was new this is not the
case anymore time a nine is there by the
way and in several years from now nobody
will remember what it was before it
what will stay I think is that we have a
new model of function in Java which is
called a functional interface with two
possibilities composition given by
default method partial applications
which is the second fundamental
operation in functional programming and
also factory methods to create easily
lambda expression using using parameters
so this is really a new way of creating
applications and implementing patterns
and I think it's a very nice addition to
our applications and an API this is what
I wanted to tell you today thank you for
your attention
and I think we have some time for
questions do we yeah yeah yeah if you
should just google my account on
SlideShare you'll find it
yes I can push my code record in Mario
github accounts okay do some maybe do
some cleaning referred any other
questions yes please sorry you have to
specify the type yes now it's optional
when you write your lambda extra it's
really a matter of readability if you
think that Jo code is more readable by
specifying the code if it helps you just
do it there's no difference in the way
the code is compiled and the performance
of the code executed so it's just a
matter it's the same for lambdas versus
method references if you're more
comfortable with lambda just just keep
you along the new code and as time goes
by you'll probably become used to to
method references I'd like to write you
a video using them but the compiled code
is the same so there's no difference in
performance between metal reference in
London questions yeah there is an
excellent book by written by Maurice
naphthalene the bad lambdas on stream
there I do not know of any book
especially on lambdas only on lambdas
they usually cover lambdas the new
methods on the collection framework
streams and characters and I think the
the one written by Morrison after is
excellent it's available in the library
and there's also Java in action yeah
you cannot switch on a class name the
switch the switch only takes primitive
time integers enumerations and strings
you cannot provide a class in a switch
statement so you have to provide a key
which may be the class name or any kind
of label that would represent the class
there are other ways to implement this
pattern you can also implement it using
your using a numeration for instance
first get get the animator set values
value that you that you need and then
call an instance method and that
enumerated value that will give you the
right Factory no it's not the only way
to do it but this one the one I should
have I think is the the most classical
way of implementing it yeah
yep
I'm not sure quite get your question
sorry yeah
yeah
yeah usually when you're using a
dependency injection framework you can
also provide factory methods to create
your objects whether it's in spring or
in CDI for instance
so just by annotating the right pieces
of code around so if you so you can see
do that and the yes leverage leverage
lambda but the dependency injection
framework will will create proxies on
objects so if you're using lambdas in
them Yolanda's will be kind of cluttered
with all those proxies and you will lose
most of the most of the good things you
will have when using just plain lambda
basically lambdas is not implemented as
an object inside the JVM which if she
were calling the two strings or equals
of the object methods on a lambda which
which is still possible because it will
compile then you are you are losing all
the the optimization the JVM will be
able to set up for you in a way when
you're just using plain lambda so if
you're using plain lambdas just just use
them as is do not do any funny stuff
with them yeah
I'd never I did not heard of any I don't
I don't think it has I can't be exactly
sure that there is room for improvement
the wait lambdas have been implemented
in the JDM there is room for improvement
in the future I am Not sure there are
they were major modification on that
field any other questions okay thank you
for your attention
