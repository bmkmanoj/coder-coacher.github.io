bought something with you yeah like I
mentioned it must be a time I was
playing around a little bit with a
raspberry pi and some LEDs connected to
the GPIO pins maybe somebody can notice
in the camera because I mr. March fix
down and you got survive yeah yeah so
you can see it the first step was of
course to get the lights on somehow this
job of course there's a great library
for its p for j so first step was just
hope it's no yes just gets lights on
somehow then I saw babe it's a kind of
beautiful madly deeply' useless I need
to some input devices fight and then the
first one was to the tune just a moment
and I a starter a WebSocket server on
the Raspberry Pi and the first thing I
did was then writing a client on my what
was it like knock sir android device key
this right so I mean I just touch to
connect first of course so it's
connected with a good night when I
touched some way all the screen then Z
your corresponding LED on the matrix is
yeah moving on it's a touch busy logic
visualization yeah yeah it's nice yeah
and then next of also most wanted to
display some text so extent it is that I
can ah some strings to it very nice
which is not lacking hey gray and i
bought some other little toy
motion then I was wondering was do I
what good i do with a week motion the
first person maybe I can just get use my
LED matrix just have to start clients
with each term running on my notebook
the Reid motion does not work yet on the
last verified already unfortunately yeah
but will it in her future uh I'm not
sure that they set sometimes you you
find something on the phone when they
say yeah maybe so yup today of Linux
yeah yeah yeah it is it works all night
excites you mind waiting system as um to
sew and what I just did so when I point
somewhere all the device lens are
corresponding early years again cool
okay you can see it the address was just
a little bit playing around that's no
big sense of journal device as making
some of hands and you could feel the
touch yeah so if you what kind of server
do you run on the on the PI to do the
communication it's a library a java
library very simple to use or forgot the
name just it single bit so it's simply
awesome I it's a WebSocket server that
you're going on oh yeah but it's not
something like Nettie or jetty and
objectives at Lauren unless it's a
simple job application which is you busy
to using the library oh ok let's just
start it because I was also playing
around with them with jetty on the on
the pie not yet and I tried it and it's
it works it's a WebSocket server it was
ok but this seems to be faster so it's
because you have the pie is really snow
wrap it so yeah that's a bunch i have no
over here to be causal necks or around
it oh I have one more thing let me see
where it is ah yeah yeah it's this
that's the bigger bigger bought XM and
that was the first job effects
implementations are running on this
thing but it was javafx to with jdk 7
and
it worked but it was only a better state
so there was no really final release for
that and I was thinking to use this one
with the JDK 8 and hive mq as a MQTT
broker and it worked but i have to say
that this is just it has a 1 gigahertz
processor but it's kind of slow and
directly compared compared to the
BeagleBone black which is hardware wise
similar to the bigger bought XM the
mosquito which is also MQTT broker but
this is implemented in see it's a much
faster than the height mq running on
java but i think this is just because of
the resources because this thing is not
really powerful the plan is to use the
old road with a quad-core and use MQTT
there and with the hive mq because
hyphen q support web socket so you can
do MQTT over web socket which might be
really interesting so i will try to
figure that out what would I don't like
about the pious that you can't use great
because it takes half years what about
maven but in fact I use maven for it
Henry so deployed plugin which are
directly cookies do a complete charge
who is a raspberry pi wow it's nice well
that's really nice if somebody is
interested in the call to my guitar name
is the same as much which I handle its
ass linters s.l.i.m tes so we can look
up how that sounds good because it's
yeah that's interesting oh well in that
discussion now jose herrera he told me
at j focus that he uses he showed me how
to use netbeans eight with this remote
what I never use it so I can just I say
I think it was remote jdk or something
you can directly deploy if I'm you can
debug running code on the pie directly
and then in netbeans I never tried it he
showed it to me but I didn't find the
time to try it right now but that also
seem to be very interesting because D
buying the stuff in ide run the it
directly on the device that that's
really nice
and he showed it to me and it was
awesome because that's the problem right
you compile it on the desktop copy the
jaha started got some problems okay then
you start how to figure out the problems
and with this you can run it in the IDE
and see all the outputs and but it runs
on the device it's something that remote
jdk or remote JRE something like that
you can define in netbeans eight very
nice I just in the meantime I built a
new version of my demo I just said to
deploy to my I make six so what else
great that's a limit Iran's location who
this yeah the ev3 yeah what's about it I
run because I was infected with this
last year java one yeah when I saw
Stephen showing his the Duke running on
on Leo on the layoffs and I thought okay
when I was home directly ordered the
Mindstorms ev3 and we had some
discussions in the family because when
it arrived the kids came up oh great
it's legal let's play with it a bit be
careful get BP careful so we created the
robot and my wife told me it was a
little bit strange because you played
around with the robot and the kids are
not allowed to touch it said oh was it
that left sorry yes i am i installed
Leo's on the Mindstorms ev3 and I have a
tiny Wi-Fi plug here so I just brought a
little co2 to rotate this thing so my
idea was to create a something for java
one but yeah it was just in better state
so not ready yet you can run java on
that device and i think steven has a
really nice demo with the running the
what is the segway Segway code or the
segment algorithm in java on the on this
device and it's self-calibrating the
position so really nice I yeah i'm
planning to do the same but I didn't
find even the time to order some more
Lego blocks to Buddha try so yeah but
that's the reason why I
have it on the desk and down here I have
the package it's directly under my desk
because I would really like to do
something with the with the Mindstorms
thing and my idea is to and i'm not sure
if it if it's possible I would like to
somehow communicate with that device and
use the servos here for some interaction
and I have no no real use case and what
it's just lying here to remind me that I
have to work with it yeah so my son is
so keen on seeing the the NAO robot I
just told him that there is a guy coming
and he has this little robot because we
watched this on youtube user yeah it's
it's okay yes I mean that's the reason
why they are back because he's so keen
on seeing that thing it's a real robot
and he knew it from videos and so he was
when is the guy coming with the robot
yeah he's coming so patients steven is
here he's sleeping Ashley powder later
on we'll take them out of the backpack
and I'll say hi come on i'm a wholesome
okay okay now the kids are so keen on it
so because i'm so kini yeah i love that
so the other barons stuff is so amazing
what they are doing and unfortunately
that they had a nice idea at j focus
when they tried to make the now doing
the introduction to the conference and
he was standing in front of the on the
stage and then talking and then they
start with okay now let's do the
moonwalk or something from michael
jackson and then you would like to start
yeah t-shirt you fall over and then a
guy in the bag sandy stand up fix it and
then you see some nice pictures where
someone from the side make some images
where you see the big
guy in the background behind the boat
that was really nice it's yeah
originally he was supposed to be off
stage but they couldn't get the internet
and the Wi-Fi working so he had a cable
going from his laptop the nose yes head
and that's why the robot fell over yeah
that's what I thought as the balance off
when it has something attached to the
head yeah I lost it was really a shame
because I love this this thing it looks
so great and it it's really nice when it
moves and in the morning we watched a
video they have a nice introduction
video where they have to nows talking to
each other and then some people moved
along and touch it and say oh hi how you
doing and then he's falling apart and
falling on his face and said oh I'm fine
no problem and then I thought okay is it
able to stand up again and he's able to
stand up by himself and then that's
really amazing there's all the first
time or the d'box kino two years ago
yeah they were dancing also be cool it's
it's amazing technology and
unfortunately I was trying to sign up
for the developer account there but then
you can buy just the the upper part of
the robot that was the two years ago or
three years i'm not sure but i let you
get the fall river even the upper part
was around six thousand euros of that
okay it's to expect it sit for the
developer program i think it's a on the
robots 3,000 euros yes don't know my
friend for consumers it's 16 or they
dropped it to 8,000 now oh because in
the beginning it was around 16,000 year
olds they dropped the price well but
it's really awesome what you can do with
it I think they have a new generation
coming up with some minor tweaks but
okay great it's really good stuff so I
think I showed everything I have here on
my embedded devices i'm just looking
around have had more but i think that's
it oh I have one more day as I
appreciate the shout out sorry then Jose
Jose Pereyra appreciates the shout out
yet to and here's a link yeah cool yeah
I'll find that as well yeah it's really
it's really nice he showed it to me and
I was really impressed I didn't know
that so it's really good so one other
thing in thought waves that was 14
minutes behind so at the Gemalto concept
board which is also really nice device
it's I was trying to get one and was not
able to but then one of my colleagues
undress I'm array he won that at the
Java champions breakfast at javaone and
I was not there have you got the gemalto
board working it yeah i'm not naughty I
I had it but now it's in the bag so so
I'm when I got that because on this is
running Java ME embedded 3 dot 4
unfortunately not 8 they announced that
there will be a new version not of this
board but they have a new chip which is
running the Qualcomm chip that are going
to support java me8 on the HS 5 or not
no as far as I know no I'm but i'm not
sure i just read it on Terrence blog and
but with this board the nice thing is
that you have this Centurion chip set
here and this is also has a 3g modern so
you can put your sim card in here and
then you have a computer which is
compatible to the Arduino so I can put
other inner shields on here I have gpios
all that stuff that is on Arduino and I
can code it on on Java ME and Java ME
embedded 3 dot 4 is much better than
Java me3 dot 0 which was I think the
last version that son was working on
because when i started with Java ME the
first time it was like okay you try to
do something oh it's not there okay try
another one it's not for example
stringbuilder there's no string builder
so oh okay what else yeah try something
else oh not in the API hmm so you start
to look at the API description and see
oh it's very limited
and now the phone is ringing but someone
else will pick it up so I connected some
things to this so the heartbeat sensor
and temperature sensor and then let the
board send the data through yet sneak me
out they kept off the league hey hello
relievers machine here click my off I
saw was its then yeah okay okay so yeah
but like i said this Gemalto board you
can use this as a standalone version so
that means you can this is it's really
big usually you just have this this chip
here and that's all you've got but on
this device they really put out all the
pins that are available on this port and
you can coat it in java you have an API
to access the GPI gpio ports and the
other ports that are available you have
some switches that you can push and some
USB ports and you have 3G 3G connection
that is nice but to be honest Java ME
was really when you come from the pie
with se8 embedded and you go to m.e
three or four and better then it's
really a step back you see oh man that's
really different and I tried some things
and it worked but then I moved on to
other devices so this is because I was
really looking for Java ME eight
embedded but this is not available on
that device unfortunately but i'm
looking to forward to the next version
of their they will get something new i
just saw that they announced that they
will have this qualcomm chipset with
Java ME eight so this is just another
boy all I have one more I have one more
yeah I have also this one this is
running java me8 embedded this is the st
32 f
for discovery bought from
stmicroelectronics and this is running
java me8 embedded and also played around
the desk with that with that thing and
this is a very nice but it's small it's
just 16 euros so 16 really cheap okay
it's not very fast but it doesn't have
to be I think it's an arm and cortex m3
I think with the 100 118 megahertz
something like that so it's a very low
power device but on this you have an an
accelerometer so that means if you move
it you can just you can go to the
sensors and collect the data so this is
a nice port unfortunately when I played
around with it it was very it's a few
months ago so only the first version of
Java ME eight Developer Preview it was
some kind of in stable and for me the
biggest drawback with Java ME embedded
at the moment is that it's only
available from windows so on the Mac
it's really you have to start off your
virtual machine and then install windows
and then you have problems that the USD
ports and serial virtual serial ports
and that stuff so that makes it hard to
develop if you are not a Windows
developer but in principle it's it's
really nice because it's very low power
and powerful enough right you have a lot
of ports I don't know how many but it's
it must be around 60 or something we
have pins all over the place here and
there so it's really ok it's a bias as
the telephone killed our stream the
telephone will start ringing or stream
died how can this happen baby voice over
IP oh damn it lifestream crush us and we
love it yeah it's it's it's bad it's the
the internet connection is really bad
alright so i think i showed that already
buddy that's that's take two ok where r
street recording thanks for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
