from Oracle technology Network and my
guest today except for the B that is
flying around there so I'm sorry about
that so my guest today is Gabrielle
moreira hi Gabrielle are so Gabrielle
you are um so working on machine
learning today but early yeah but so you
didn't start that way right yeah so tell
us a little bit like what I mean what
what did you do before and yeah I
started programming about 14 my my first
program was actually Excel conditions
and then I I get passionate about that
and start studying I graduated cone
computer science and I use it to be a
regular software engineering working
with mobile development web development
dotmed java using oracle pl/sql and then
in the moment of my career i decided to
to let it go a fashion show to work with
machine learning data analytics okay
yeah and so you you worked also for
University first I mean is that the
first job well no I always work at only
industry but I tried to use my academic
background sure to make make things
smarter ok so after after my graduation
I started true to two disciplines on a
master course and I saw that that would
be the divider that I wanted to go to
learn more smarter premiums machine
learning data mining that kind of stuff
so what did you do what kind of training
or how did you transition yeah yeah I
started with these distances like
academic disciplines three or four years
ago I i met the MOOCs so Coursera eight
ish EDX and there's a lot of parent
courses on machine learning data mining
pattern analytics the name knowledge I I
have today was acquired by books by
articles and mainly by books because
they they kind of direct you to to the
best practice so Damien can you can deep
using papers and then I started to to
look for opportunities to apply that
knowledge on all energy they are not so
common in Brazil projects that really
requires a machine learning model and I
work also at santee with my colleague
humour so that has already been
interviewed and then we we we work on
projects and project products and
projects involving that kind of problem
ok and so what would you recommend for
someone who wanted to do transition I
mean I don't know what what was really
like the triggered where you said oh I
really want to do machine learning is it
is it really what you expected in other
words many programmers get you a point
that they are they don't want more to
develop fruits they want actual to go
further to segregate intelligence in the
business so if you have you are
passionate about data data engineering
and you want to extract Anna leaks from
it I recommend you to to look some for
some MOOCs like machine learning at
Coursera from Andrew ng it's a vest
they're famous look at Python and Scala
that are the main languages that are are
playing in data science huge read books
follow people that working on that here
in TDC we have four tracks dedicated to
big data data science machine learning
and those sequel and really get in touch
with people that are working on that
area okay yeah this is really good so a
good reason to attend the conference
right okay is to actually to meet all
those speakers on the topic that's a
good idea yeah yeah actually I work with
recommender systems
so squirming users tops off winters and
recommend content you can recommend
products girlfriends books music all the
top services like Netflix like Spotify
are using this kind of technology we
have a very very large space to really
improve conversions improved
advertisements using this kind of
technology excellent thank you so much
for joining us and discussing I guess
your career path very interesting thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
