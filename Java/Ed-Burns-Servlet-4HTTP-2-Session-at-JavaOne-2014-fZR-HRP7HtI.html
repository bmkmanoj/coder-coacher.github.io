of videos of to support java 1 2014
basically we'll be interviewing some of
the key folks speaking at javaone this
year my name is reza roman i am a brat
lead for java one specifically for the
server side track i have with me today
ed brands hopefully most of you know who
had burns is already his he is basically
a veteran of Sun and Oracle he's been
involved in a number of important
projects I remember back in the early
days and on tomcat as well but he's been
involved with JSF for a very long time
and really it has been the guy moving
the JSF spec forward and not bringing it
where it is today so today first of all
ed thank you very much for joining us I
movie absolutely so we won't be talking
about jsf today but we will talk about
GSF sometime in the future most
certainly today what I want to talk to
you about is your session on servlet for
and HTTP two point oh I understand
you're cool speculating that no I'm
moving us beyond GSF and the coastal
eating that with shane watch em right
i'm very happy to do that wishing why
because he's been a veteran of servlet
for a very long time so i think it's a
good combination now that Rajiv who was
the former spec lead is fully engaged in
some of our exciting Oracle product
development efforts he was unable to
have the time to do the job on sir what
so he offered me to come in as coast
beckley and i was very happy to accept
that excellent so I guess tell us a bit
about your session and a bit what serve
look for and a bit about HTTP 2.0 if you
will indeed the most important thing
know about the session is the time it's
scheduled for Monday at twelve-thirty in
the cyril magnin 23 room of the parc 55
hotel schedule
subject to change but I put that out
there right now shuwa and I are going to
be talking about this brand new jsr
effort we're trying to get started we're
still in the process of even getting it
through the Oracle process to file the
jsr we have announced our intent to file
it and that's you know will be just
giving an update so I can go through and
give you some of the topics we're going
to talk about or if you like you could
have some more interactive Q&amp;amp;A in this
session how would you like to do it a
Q&amp;amp;A won't be possible for the session
per se so I definitely liked you to talk
about I guess if you will start with
HTTP to point to a place and tell us
what that's all about and how you think
that HTTP 2.0 is going to be surfaced in
servlet for right so that's a question
that's open to discussion right now
we're still you know we haven't even
started expert group discussions but
that you can imagine a range of various
options on this the first is a very
minimal option where we just basically
say because HGB to is backward
compatible with the prior versions we
really could do as little as just
specify that it must be supported and
then shove it all off as an
implementation task on the other end of
the spectrum we could do something very
broad and expose a lot of the
application level features of HTTP to to
the servlet API I think in reality we're
going to go somewhere in the middle I
think in order to bring the maximum
value to the users we're going to go
towards the extreme of exposing a lot of
stuff however i'm very happy to report
that Greg Wilkins is going to be joining
our effort again and he is actually on
the HD be working group at the IETF and
so he's already got HTTP support and
speedy support and Jenny so his
experience is going to be really
invaluable now an expert group sort of
pre discussions
had so far I've sensed that he's had a
more conservative approach to wanting to
not exposed to me features and so we'll
see how that goes you know it's going to
go it's we're just starting out
personally for me if we could expose
something of server push and something
of the stream prioritization and those
would be two really big wins and that's
what I'm expecting expecting we'll talk
about a job one oh so cute could you
give us an elevator pitch for what HTTP
2.0 is and why it's important for
developers okay well these are the
big-ticket features of HTTP two and
these are just the ones you'd see if you
were to read any of the introductory
articles about it the request response
multiplexing which basically allows you
to have multiple independent requests
sharing the same TCP connection and this
is all enabled because HTTP two
dispenses with text as the encoding it's
now using a binary encoding scheme that
also enables things like header
compression so it gives you a big
performance boost but once you say okay
we're not going to be using crl fcr LF
as a delimiter we're just going to be
having a proper binary framing protocol
then you get the ability to enter leave
messages both up from the browser to the
server and back down from the server to
the browser so that's you know the big
feature is that it's now switch to
binary right so that enables the request
response multiplexing it also enables
stream prioritization where user agents
can say i would like to attach a
priority number to this particular
stream and then you can have you know
different streams get different
priorities and that's something that is
advisory only right so that's an
application-level feature that we need
to allow people that are building on top
of sir what to take advantage of because
the you know
we're not going to do anything with the
prior is a shin we're going to give you
the capability to take action based on
the prioritization no go ahead no no
please PLEASE selfish I'm sorry mom so
once you've got those the binary framing
and the stream prioritization then
another feature is as I mentioned
earlier the server push this is
something that we have to differentiate
from WebSocket WebSocket also is the
two-way communication type thing so it's
not trying to duplicate what's in
WebSocket rather the main rationale for
this HTTP cue server push is to allow on
the server if it has up here I knowledge
of the resources that will go along with
the HTML page it could send what's
called push promises to the browser and
therefore the browser can get all of the
resources and the page in one go rather
than having to parse the page figure out
what's needed and then issued the
requests so in my other role as jsf co
spec lead i think that would be a
possibly useful option to pursue because
web frameworks such as jsf by definition
have the Opera our knowledge of what are
the associated resources with the page
so it's going to give framework authors
a great ability to increase performance
if we do that right I'm hoping we can do
that it's not so um me personally I have
a great deal of faith in you I know the
jsf has been an extremely we need to
driven effort for a long time I also
know that you have taken advantage of
adopted jsr in the past I assume for
servlet for you will also be looking to
take advantage of servlet of adopted ASR
in terms of getting convenient broad
community input for this very important
spec so now so you're on board of
confidence now let's not be too hasty
it's still very early days I want to set
expectations and announce the dumb you
know
the best effort we can on this and
regarding adopted jsr it certainly can
be a helpful program and we intend to
use it but the enthusiasm has to be
tempered by the fact that everyone
working on adopted eres are things are
kind of doing it in the spare time so
it's definitely an effort where you get
out of it what you put into it both on
the jug side and on the spec lean side
as well so I found that the most mileage
can be had from adopted jsr when you
have very small well defined tasks that
either can be done almost atomically in
a work session or have such little
context that they can be worked on and
put down and work done and put down with
very low amount of friction so if we can
find such tasks in the servlet work then
we'll be able to take advantage of it
but if not you know it's going to really
fall back onto the expert group members
of course the expert group is always in
the driving seat you know dr. jsr is
simply a good way of getting people
involved that are not necessarily if you
will experts in that particular
technology okay it's a great to hear
that you have plans and you're trying to
incorporate a top VCS are in a to serve
look for anything better note that we
have another talk Heather Ventura has
asked me to sit in on talk I believe
you're also on the list NAT talk is
tuesday at 11 is that right yes tuesday
11 a.m. and that's in the Powell 12 room
also in the parc 55 hotel for java one
about a dr j sr not indeed i am and i
look forward to that session so before
we sign off today ed and we will be
looking to interview with you again in
the future is there anything else you'd
like to say to the community um well
let's keep in mind a couple things
people may have seen the zero turn
around developer survey that went around
and talked about different web
frameworks and there was a number that
was kind of hidden in that report the
most recent version that
that indicated that even when you have
lots of web frameworks to choose from
there's still a sizeable number of
people that just use the servlet API
directly in their code either with
filters or servlets and you know we've
added features in server 30 and so but
31 that are very compelling and I'd like
to see if we can get some more use of
those so even though this talk on Java
one is focusing on servlet 4.0 I am
going to spend some time re emphasizing
the async support that we had inside of
a 30 and the non-blocking i/o support on
top of a sink that we added in server 31
because these are features that really
can change the game for how you do stuff
particularly when you have the
responsive manifesto I'm sorry the
reactive manifesto talking about the
need to have reactivity a reactive
programming from the outermost levers of
the API all the way down to the database
for example I think that that's possible
to do that with servlet with the async
features but it's not exactly obvious
because the challenge with adding new
features to expect like servlet is asked
to be done in a way that doesn't break
anything before and therefore it's not
obvious exactly what's the entry point
to the new feature so I'm going to get
the word out about that excellent at I
really appreciate it thank you very much
for your time pleasure as usual okay
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
