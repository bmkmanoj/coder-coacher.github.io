technology Network we're here on the
floor of Mobile World Congress and I've
got Manfred khoob a who's with gemalto
yes that's correct nice to be used media
and you've got something really cool to
show us right oh yeah mean so we're
showing m2m based solutions here some
really exciting technology for Java
developers because it's really entering
Java so in the m2m world you always have
like a sim card right ok so we got a sim
card here on the sim cards there's a
Java card then we have cellular modules
like this one very tiny also based on on
Java technology this for instance is
driven by Java ME and we also have a
cloud-based application enablement
platform which is also running java
absolutely nice so you go from tiny to
huge all on Java so what are we looking
at here so what we're doing here is
actually through the power of Java we're
enabling medical devices to really
quickly be mobilized and connect to the
cellular network so using a Java module
like this we thought and we actually got
together with partners from the
continued health alliance and thought
how can we make it easy to well connect
medical devices to the cloud in a
standards-based interoperable fashion
because we want to avoid all those silos
that you see today and really promote
interoperability this is why we got
together with a couple of other
companies from the continued health
alliance and the M health ecosystem like
Oracle for instance orange medical
device manufacturers like a and D
lineman and the GSMA over here at the
GSM able and also orange is providing
the cellular connectivity for this
solution so we thought
how can we really easily connect these
medical devices to the cloud and what
we've done is we use one of our
development kits so very exciting for
developers attached this development kit
with a java-based module to the medical
device so what we're doing we're getting
the proprietary data from the device and
here on the Java module we're actually
performing a conversion like a
translation of this proprietary data
into a continuous standards-based form
it's really entering job and such really
easy for developers to get started with
developing m2m applications so on the
module we provide Java API is in the
Java platform to deploy your own
applications and really build on top of
your vertical specific applications like
this M health demo we're on our dat dev
kits we've got the SIM card here we've
got a Java module GSM antenna GPS if you
want to use it and yeah what we did here
when you when you take a measurement the
measurement gets sent to the cloud from
this device and also on the cloud we
provide like a java based application
enablement platform which also makes it
really easy for developers to deploy
their own m2m applications through api's
and it's also really quick to get a fast
start so our developers they built this
demo in like about a week or less than a
week probably and also this company used
our AP eyes on the platform to come up
with this nice solution nice user
interface where the measurements taken
from the devices can be visualized and
also for them it took them more less
than a week right so it's it's really
quick and easy to get a start with m2m
solution development through the power
of Java and our API it's a really easy
way to get started with
cellular m2m development through java
because we package all those interfaces
all the different hardware protocols
like cereal USB SPI what have you make
it really easily accessible through java
so we support a lot of j srs on the on
there in terms of security for instance
and really well accessing all the
hardware so developers can really very
easily get a quick start to developing
great m2m applications through the
flexibility of java earlier Wow Manfred
this is really cool thank you very much
thanks everybody oh thank you this is
Tori wheel with the Oracle technology
Network you can find more information
about it at OTN thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
