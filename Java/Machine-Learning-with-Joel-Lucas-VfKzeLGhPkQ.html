Brazil my name is your employee and i'm
here with Joey Lucas joelle hi so Joelle
you are a data scientist and you work
for a company that is called tell target
right so so so what is a data scientist
besides actually data scientists try to
get insights from the inner so usually
have lots of data like big data that's
the part of we work with processing lots
of data and we also get some to get some
insights have to have some notions of
ice today of Statistics mathematics and
processing this data with tools adapted
tools for big data so you you you do the
algorithm that will actually analyze
those data is that what you were to
process the data and also to analyze and
get inside so there are actually two
parts first have to prepare this data
source and hard work to get this data
way for finding some insights okay so
and you have to think about like what
you're looking for how yeah okay you
have some like we have some what
questions you want to get from the data
so have to think before maybe a little
bit of business as well to try to find a
decent size from the able to have to to
find the questions before analyzing the
data so we talk a lot about machine
learning but so what does it mean what
is machine learning well machine
learning is when you you like to teach
that the computer you show them some
data and then a computer tries to find
these patterns actually machine learning
is all about to find patterns and we
there's a category called a supervisor
learning that we teach the algorithm
some some pattern and then after we give
the gift algorithm real real life
problems and then the algorithm will try
to find answers based on this pest and
the previous data data we
training and we talk also about deep
learning so what is the difference
between like machine learning deep
learning deep learning is a special
category of the machine learning
actually very sophisticated we use it
usually use neural networks and have to
train for a long time the network's
actually in this demo I will show with
maybe teach for a day or something each
author I'm showing the text showing here
we trainer the data we talk about a date
for training so a lot of work done
before like classifying you have to
prepare the data and then train the data
in the things a lot of time from the
front of machine to to to get the result
that you need yes so you have an example
yeah and let me show you presented that
at the keynote this morning actually
this example we here before here in the
terminal we charted some models we train
it before this one take a day for each
input file these files are from text of
Brazilian utters the actual date is a
lot of work done by English text so
there is a implementation of Alex graves
which is a who is a very very known
person works with deep learning and we
extended his implementation for the
Portuguese language so we had to treat
the Portuguese grandma and special
characters we have in Portuguese so
after having this extension we train at
the neural network for a day exact
forage for each one of the three water's
here are the three authors let me show
and then basically this application will
we taught the network with this with
text from each water and then now the
machine will tried the algorithm you try
to to
generated text from each one of them
trying to reproduce this type of writing
so for example German do is just a very
non Brazilian writer here's the text we
generated actually we had a very small
input for training so here you have some
words in Portuguese single or which have
the coma points so dots so you had the
deck structure of the Portuguese
language a Portuguese phrase and then
let's try to generate another one this
one very this is like text so it's
another kind of another style of writing
so it's like phrases not poems like
Ramon mm-hmm let me show for an episode
which may be similar with the moon with
some like a poem so have his writing
style here let's generate again another
one just to show that is generating
rendering yeah so which API Java API are
you using to you use it deep learning
for J which are very powerful API for
deploy and there are lots of common user
ratings for deep learning and and you
also have a presentation about like
other AP is that you can use for for
machine learning so what are those I
will be talking about my house which is
a wider API actually did for learning
for j is just for deep learning my house
is spread of all kinds of problems for
problems of machine learning we have our
teens for classification clustering
frequent part button settings and
collaborative filtering which is use it
for recommender systems so how to have a
a great stack of algorithms and also
also it's the community can contribute
to my house and enhance the algorithms
or even implement another one there is
new and nice thing about mahou there
most of its algorithms can run on the
top of Hadoop so you can run big data
and distribute the computation among
lots of machines using a hadoop on the
top of out losing out on the top of
Hadoop okay and so and you're any other
application or Java language that you
API is that you use for them yeah
basically in my how to we have math
libraries in my heart as well okay so we
can use we don't need actually to user
you can use just the math operations
linear algebra for example in other
problems not not even not only in
machine learning you can use a
manageable operation in another daily
life problem and the use of my house so
my house is very very spread very known
now in the java community for machine
learning okay well thank you do it I let
you go to your session thank you thank
you for stopping by thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
