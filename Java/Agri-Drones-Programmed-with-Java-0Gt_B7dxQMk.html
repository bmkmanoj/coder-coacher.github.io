Network and I'm here today at devoxx
Belgium with Ava Ventura and site and
Timon Ventura hello hi welcome thank you
so you are working on the drone right
for agriculture so tell us what is the
project about the drone is part of a
bigger concept called precision
agriculture and precision agriculture is
a theory or practice where the farm
farmer no longer manages its entire
field but it manages on specific
treatment sounds so bad spots on the
field and you can use precision
agriculture to treat them differently
but I need it and maybe put some more
fertilizer or less fertilizer on the
rest if they have a disease in a third
certain area they can only treat the
infected areas instead of the entire
field so it's much better for the
produce much better for the environment
and much better for the wallet of the
farmer eventually and there are cheaper
too yes yes so ever how what kind of
training do they receive - well the
training is actually really small it's
just a tool that they can use in the
tractor the the big things they use on
the on the field and the only thing they
have to do is well put the the media
inside of it and they can read it on
their computer but the first point is
that to convince them that it's useful
for them because they're not really fond
of all this technology they don't like
computers
no no farmers are not about computing
they can stay away from a computer they
are happy
yeah and become the the but the tractors
are I mean half computers today yes yes
so they can drive themselves right and
and this is the part they like they like
to see what they are doing and I like to
see so for example we use sensor
technology to display the amount of
plants the density of the plants that
are beneath them and they really liked
to see a runtime how their crop are
doing so they actually like computers
but I don't know they like them and they
don't want to spend hours on them of
course that's the main part yeah so
Simon tell us how is this whole thing
working I mean you have what a computer
on your tractor and so I mean what kind
of device do you need and what kind of
technology
well most computers currently are
equipped with a communicate
communication system for ISOBUS and you
can plug all kinds of devices on this
ISO bus and it will get transported
through the tractor so you can use for
example one GPS device to also lock the
sensor measurements to the cupola to the
location and then you can link all the
data together what we are doing is we
have a fire management system on the
desktop of the farmer and it connects to
the to the analysis system which is
running at the adviser and then we
connect it to the ISOBUS that's running
on the tractor so we are connecting all
the devices and so we can get all the
data that's very interesting for the
adviser we transported via the PC the
management system of the farmer to the
adviser and then the adviser can do all
kinds of complicated calculations and
give its precision advice back to the
farmer and the farmer can put it on a
USB stick put it again in his computer
or via Wi-Fi and then you can
automatically execute the advice from
from the advisor so this is basically
what we are doing we are connecting
everything that's already already
present and you're just using regular
computers USB I mean it there is nothing
except for the drone that is a little
bit different yeah and sometimes we use
for example the drone Howard wrong we
have equipped with a Raspberry Pi so we
can put a GPS on it and we also connect
a sensor which is measuring the amount
of green that's beneath the draw and so
we we connect the measurements to the
GPS we log it and then when the drone is
again within the network range we can
pull all the data off and do some
analysis with it so do you use Java on
the drone I mean what kind of languages
do you use them yeah
we use well the we use Java on the
Raspberry Pi as well we use it to
control the the movements of the drum we
use the otha or Agra senses Java
obviously we also created a very small
testing program which runs on your
laptop so we can also manually control
the drone on the field and this is also
an application it's a Java FX
application actually so that's job as
well so when you say java is it Java SE
ME embedded which version its standard
as e
and on the desktop as well it's se so
it's ofse and JavaFX we use we swing so
what kind of results have you seen
because I mean we talk also a lot about
global warming is that helping gathering
data what what is the feedback from from
people who have used it while we're
still in experimenting in the face so
it's just testing on on the fields that
from farmers we know right now and well
it's really nice to see that it works
and what you can all do with it that's
really nice but if if it's it's a good
device and if it works well it certainly
can help because you can it can help
reduce the amount of water you use on
your crop or yeah and with illnesses
then you you can really specific and use
specific medicine for the plants and
stuff like that so it's yeah it
certainly can help it's mainly about
gathering data and the data we are
gathering now will help us in a few
years when science is further in in
doing analysis on what's best for the
plants and they can use all the data we
accumulate now in a structured way to to
get a head start and to accelerate there
so it's it it is an open source project
or yes yes so how can people contribute
to it or or even like use the service I
mean how do you promote they can go to a
website agressions dot EU or Agra Sens
doc java.net because we are on java.net
as well and they can just their contact
details there and they can send us a
mail
we work something out so they can
contribute code to the project or they
can actually all farmers can actually
yeah yeah volunteer to test some
students have helped developing so it's
really nice yeah they use it in their
study so we already have contributions
from Czech Republic from Australia from
Canada and Brazil so yeah really nice
yes really great work thank you so much
for coming to us and presenting this
project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
