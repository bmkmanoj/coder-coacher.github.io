the Java zone conference my name is
Steven Chen I'm doing interviews for the
Oracle technology Network i'm joined by
clara word how are you doing I'm good so
I was here how's your job as an
experience been so far you know yeah
it's my first time here workshop and
your talk and is this your first time in
Oslo this is my first time in Oslo
embarrassingly enough FS I grew up
closer to Oslo than to Stockholm where I
now lay beside wow ok because this I
think this is maybe my second time in in
Oslo because I can did I come here for
for the user group may be ok wait we're
not we're not remembering but my first
time at the Java zone conference but
this is a pretty cool event they've like
an awesome pavilion here and lots of
beer going around beer and an awesome
speaker event lined up so it's it's a
lot of fun so we're going to chat a
little bit about profiling and you had
it you an interesting angle on this I
think yeah so I work with profiling
professionally with the the Mission
Control to love the flight recorder data
from the JVM and then recently I got
this so it's a oh yeah in a striker
which company is that from were you
supposed to say that I don't know ok I
know yeah the unspecified fitness
tracker by so I don't mind it yeah yeah
ok so and then you you had an analogy
between fitness trackers and profiling
yeah we in my talk that I gave way and
talked about a bit about overhead and
also about the accuracy of data so i was
thinking what this would look like with
less or more overhead and what you get
when you it's a sort of you have to sort
of choose between the two a bit for more
overhead you can get really really
accurate data but maybe you don't want
that you just want it accurate enough so
i was picturing
something that would give more accurate
data than this because this is yeah so
that how does that monitor you at
monitors like it as an accelerometer in
it probably yeah so it monitor is your
activity yes does it doesn't monitor
heartbeat not this version but there are
any version do ya okay so good so
possibly heartbeat but so so I used to I
used to work like one of those fitness
trackers for a while just for kicks
although I I hate having things on my
wrists which is why I don't anymore but
so I was I was one of the most active
people in the world I think I
statistically broke all their metrics
because every time I would hop on my
motorcycle the vibrations from the
engine which show up as steps so in a
given day I could do like thirty
thousand steps I was really good so I
guess that would be an example of poor
poor data accuracy yeah I guess yeah
perhaps yeah so I was trying to picture
what would be actually be the
contraption that would measure your
steps and it would be I guess some sort
of exoskeleton thingy that you put on
your legs and it will actually measure
your movement I could get stride length
too so you could actually figure out
with your taking long steps or short
steps or possibly even calculate the
amount of energy calories you're burning
it precisely by your muscle your muscle
movements yeah yeah but it will totally
affect what you actually do though i buy
one of those working we were can you
pick one of those up the exoskeleton
heart rate walkie monitor well if you
get extra power from it that would be
nice otherwise I'm not so sure if you
really want the XX okay what would be
the opposite what would be the most
minimalistic tracker yeah I thought
about that as well i'm sure this is not
as minimalistic as they would go again
the ones that you put on your belt
something they are more you would be
more okay with that yeah we'll see my
wrist but i think i think what i want is
you know you know how they have the
technology to like tech people like you
inject yeah our buddy text I'd want to
inject an accelerometer into my um yeah
that would be nice into various spots
you can actually have one at different
locations so you could actually track
your movement on different limbs and
yeah yeah I come like those motion
capture and case where they put you in a
yeah I mean if they have the technology
like really tiny accelerometers now as
well you could probably create one small
enough that you could inject it have a
little battery built in which would last
for maybe like 5 10 years so you'd only
have to get an operation once in a while
to get a new one put in yeah you would
need an accelerometer a battery in some
way to get the data out of it so yeah I
don't know how will you do that oh yeah
you could do something okay I get the
feeling that's not going to be a
best-seller as well most people probably
don't want to get body modification to
simply tell how many steps they walk oh
so something in the middle I think in
the middle is probably more appropriate
so it seems like industries converging
on either wristbands or watches for a
way of people tracking their their
motion so how does what does that tell
us for profilers what's the happy medium
for profilers well and what I thought
about here is that I have two things on
my wrist now because this thing doesn't
have a watch yeah which gives it's more
battery life but so I have the watch as
well and I guess for profiling it might
mean that you would want to put
everything in one system and not so this
would be like profiling with flight
recorder and also doing logging the same
time that's kind of an efficient yep
yeah having two things or reading two
different things at least so yeah so so
speaking of flight recorder so I was
chatting with with one of
speakers here about um little little nes
thing you were playing earlier yeah so
that was very difficult to optimize
because while I was profiling the
behavior i was using a remote debugging
session a remote profiler it also
changed the characteristics of the
application and I think that's typical
of a lot of profilers where they the
instrumentation itself introduces
overhead and such that you skew the
results you're getting and therefore you
can't actually tune code especially for
micro benchmark type stuff yeah so one
of the guys here actually he's like Oh
flight recorder that would be a really
good application because it's lower
overhead for profiling than most other
profiling tools where you could actually
get better data for doing the Micro
Micro tuning I think it would work so
you wanna help me should try yeah sure
okay so that but my goal is um I had to
overclock the Raspberry Pi to get 60
frames per second so I'm running it at
one point one five gigahertz but if I
can get it down to a reasonable speed
without overclocking it would actually
help with long-term reliability because
when you overclock it it produces a lot
more heat and it's a confined case so it
it gets up to like 65 Celsius which I
guess is it felt pretty hopped not too
bad but that the threshold for those
devices I think they get up to 85 and
then they stop malfunctioning so I have
a 20 Celsius barrier but the hotter you
run the more likely it is to fail yeah
okay so maybe we can improve on that
make sure using flight recorder cool
okay so that's a good analogy I think we
learned something about profilers
anything else you want to talk about our
mention oh no no no okay so thanks very
much for joining us for interviews at
the Java zone conference this is a last
interview for today but we're resuming
tomorrow after my talk
so we have another three or four
interviews lined up you can watch the
recordings at night hacking calm i'm
going to post them all in the java
youtube channel and feel free to
interact with us by tweeting to hashtag
night hacking so thanks a lot clara and
have a good evening drink lots of beer I
