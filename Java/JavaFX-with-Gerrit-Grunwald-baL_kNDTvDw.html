technology Network we're here the floor
of DevOps UK talking to members of the
Java community I have the honor of
talking to Garrett Grunwald hello
Garrett hi Tori
Garrett is a senior software engineer
he's a Java champion he's also a jug
leader he's very active in the community
and he's an expert on Java effects
correct yes I think so
ok so I just wanted to ask you some
questions about to have effects and I'm
gonna hopefully give you an easy one
that's coming up in Twitter about a week
or so ago somebody said why should I use
Java effects what can I do in it that I
can't do in swing well to be honest I
did a lot of swing and first of all I
can say you can do all that stuff that
you can do in Java fix you can do in
swing it depends on the amount of time
you would like to spend so if you have
10 years of time you wouldn't swing if
you just have a couple of months doing
the JavaFX it's just more easy you can
do many more up-to-date things you can
use animations transitions effects and
all that stuff easily in Java effects
that was not very easy to do in swing
and if you take a look at today's
applications like the mobile ones you
see all that effects and transitions
even if you don't be aware that they are
there if you take a close look you see
everything's using effects animations
and that stuff and so if you would like
to have software that looks up-to-date
you should really use Java FX if you own
a Java platform of course and if I'm a
swing user now the transition the Java
effects is it hard it depends on the
project so we did that at canoe for the
last year and it was a big project and
lucky for us was that the customer
really separated the logic from the UI
in swing which makes it very easy to
port the stuff over to JavaFX because
you just have to write a new UI layer in
Java effects but I also know from a lot
of former swing projects that developers
tend to be to combine logic and you are
in swing which makes it to be honest
makes it hard to convert to JavaFX
because then you have to strip out all
the logic and create a new UI and sew it
but it's possible so and the the
migration is it's not that hard but like
I said if it's mixed logic and UI then
it takes longer if it's separated you
are good to go so it can get a little
gnarly as they yeah yeah exactly
so tell me you're on the JavaFX extras
project you created that and tell me
about that well the the Java fix extras
project was what was not invented by me
I think it was invented by Steven chin
and other guys in the past it was at
JavaFX 1 dot x times and when they
oracle moved to Java FX 2 they they
asked me if I would like to report my
spring stuff to Java FX and I started
porting it to the AF extras project in
the meantime I stopped committing in
that project because I figured out after
a year that all the stuff that I did
porting my swing stuff to Java FX was
not really the right way to go so it was
I learned how to do it better and and so
I stopped moving it to the next version
because the first we started with the
version 2 for Java FX 2 and then they
moved to Java FX 8 and I didn't port my
stuff to Java FX 8 instead I created my
own project where I can play around with
things because I like to play around
with different opportunities and check
if that works and and I found it was not
a good idea to put all my my try an
error thing into in 2jf extras so that's
the reason why I separated it from that
and now people which is interesting take
stuff from my extra project and ported
it back to Jeff extras so Tommy Eugene
link for example he saw my ready menu
and then he said ok that might be a good
thing in AF extras but then in a clean
way so that you can reuse it everywhere
because I create that stuff for demos so
sometimes I don't care if it's really
good it has to work right and they make
sure that it it's really good and it
looks good and so this is that's the way
I'm involved in Jeff extras at the
moment not that much but I really I
really like the project it's it's a good
good chance for developers get their job
X related things out in the wild right
and let the community play around with
it so it sounds like the JavaFX
community is pretty active yeah it's
it's it might not be that big right so
it's it's growing and it's of course
there's a hard core of developers it's
ya know not only yeah it's a lot of
people involved but I think the problem
is that Java on the desktop in general
it's dead for years people say I know
there is a market for Java even on the
desktop because at canoe we would work
with that customers and I know there are
many customers that have existing swing
applications and move to Java FX it's
not that hyped anymore right so that
makes it hard for people to get in touch
because they don't know is there a
community so I'm where to look for SOI
we just have to continue spreading the
word that it's still active and then
it's there is a use case for Java
effects on desktop so there's an active
community on java.net right yes
connected and so it sounds like there's
a bunch of widgets being created yes
yeah and also from from Oracle itself
from Jonathan Giles for example he's
because he's working for Oracle in the
controlled steams it's firm hard to
commit to projects like Jeff extra so he
he spend off its own open source project
called controls effects and he makes
sure that it has the same quality as the
Java standard Java external API widgets
which which makes it a really really
useful library for for projects that are
related to job effects they have nice
really nice widgets in there so it's
it's that's a really good project I can
just say if you don't know it take a
look at controls ethics really nice
excellent so thank you for coming by and
talking about Java well thanks for
having me and we'll see you at travel
one dozen to figure out what color our
hair will be right yeah all right all
right whatever technology network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
