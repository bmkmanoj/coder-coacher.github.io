technology Network we're here live at
devoxx speaking to members of the java
community I have Simon Ritter with me
hey Simon how are you I'm doing very
well thank you tell me your title or
what you're going by these days I
suppose I you could call me the head of
Java evangelism and Oracle at the moment
ok excellent so tell me a little bit
about your role because it's changed a
bit yes yes I've basically taken over
running the evangelism team so I'm now
responsible for all of the activities
that we do around getting java in front
of the community getting java in front
of developers really educating
developers and all the great things that
we're doing around java at the moment
excellent so all the great speakers the
cool demos that stuff so tell me what
you guys have been doing here this week
yeah we've been having a really great
week we started off on tuesday we ran
the lambda hands-on labs at in the
morning and that was absolutely packed
so we had a great audience and its
really interesting for me to see how
people are beginning to get the ideas
behind lambda expressions because it is
actually a big change in terms of
language because we're moving away from
just a purely imperative way of
programming an object-oriented
programming to more functional approach
and so for people have used Java for a
long time it is a bit of a mind shift
but once you get it you go oh yeah this
is like a real a hard moment and you
suddenly go yeah this is really powerful
and I can do lots of things with this so
it was really good to see that so that
was tuesday morning tuesday afternoon we
ran the Internet of Things University
and we had various demonstrations that
we were showing different devices again
with Java and all of these things I'm
really getting it so that people could
understand that Java is the common
feature among these things and the fact
that you can take your skills as a Java
programmer you don't have to worry about
the fact you may be an enterprise Java
programmer it's still Java the language
so then you can approach embedded
devices you can say okay I want to do
this I want to collect this data very
similar kind of ideas maybe a little bit
different in terms the api's but it
very small learning curve compared to
coming to a completely different
language so that was very good in terms
of getting people up to speed on that
kind of thing and then yesterday what do
we do yesterday don't today Wednesday
isn't it I cry yesterday we had the
keynote this morning that was very good
really interesting to see the
presentations from brian on lambdas
again so he was getting the message
across and this afternoon i did the the
raspberry pi carputer session which
carputer what's a carputer so i put a
Raspberry Pi in my car so that i can
read data from the car I can talk to the
car and then I can display things on the
screen and you can see what's happening
in real time and you can interact with
it with a touchscreen help using Java
that sounds fun it is yes it's been a
lot of fun actually putting that
together so and I was really impressed
because I thought it might have been a
niche appeal in terms of the audience
but the room was was at least eighty
percent full I'd say a lot of people
there which was and I thought we had a
good time yeah it's been a good
conference so far a great conference and
a good time for java I think maybe it
gathers yes with with java ee 7 having
been launched recently and java SE 8
coming out in march next year java is
continuing to evolve yeah where it is
very dry new sweet spot as it were right
well great lots good stuff going on a
job recliner excellent so I did Thank
You Simon thanks for coming by thank you
and I'm sure we'll see you on the in the
internet somewhere right on your car
puter all right this is story wheel with
the Oracle technology Network
