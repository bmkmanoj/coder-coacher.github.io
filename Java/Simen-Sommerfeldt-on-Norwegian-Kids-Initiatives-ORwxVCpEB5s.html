interview at the Java zone conference
i'm joined by simon Sommerfeld and you
do kids initiatives here in norway yes
tell me a bit more about the
organization and what you guys do yeah
he started because I was sitting on a
advisory board for a local university
and I was listening to the different
professor telling that people who came
to study they knew absolutely no coding
at all so I was thinking oh Jesus what
is the world coming to I mean when I was
yeah this technology age you'd expect
more kids to be going in with quite a
lot of programming experience but I
guess that wasn't the case no because
they they get iphones they get ipads and
we had commodore 64s you know so we had
to do you had to start coding to do
anything but with this polish user
interfaces they don't get the idea that
they can even create something ya know
well ok slight tangent but it used to be
that programming system started with the
terminal like they they don't come up
and they'd actually prompt you to write
code whereas now they do the opposite
developing your own applications is so
strongly discouraged that they warn you
against installing things which aren't
official app store exactly applications
it's like they're actually trying even
iphones and ipads our perfect example of
devices which you can't program on
themselves they're not can be stopped
computers you can program using the
computer itself to create new programs
iphones and ipads you can't you have to
have a different computer to program for
those devices and it's difficult yeah at
least bouquet this yeah yeah well anyway
I gathered some friends and proposed
that we made a local club to teach kids
coding I think because I was on the
board of the New which in computing
society so I propose that we made a club
here in Oslo where we taught children
coding to alleviate that pain you know
but the thing is that spread like white
fire so after three days I mean this
spread on Twitter right
and the computer press and after three
days we had people wanted to start local
clubs in the other major cities and
after five weeks you had a kickoff at
one of the major companies we had a
minister from the government coming and
giving won't talk we had a grand 20
people streaming to 250 people at home
and in three other major cities three
people sitting in groups and about 20
people watching streaming so after five
weeks from nothing to this that was two
and a half years ago that's pretty
amazing yeah and I think that I just
sort of pulled this fiction I was the
one who accidentally just did it and I
got a good friend of mine who's also
working as a lobbyist on behalf of the
computer industry and him and I running
the organization together and we base
ourselves on open-source principles
really in a way because we have to give
a lot of we have to lift up people who
do good things and you can't really get
a position until you really commit
something or do something really useful
and then you prove yourself and you can
get power because the democracy doesn't
really work in a voluntary organization
like that you have to get people who are
really committed and then you can give
them Fame and I pray approval and give
them power and I think we now have had
about two and a half thousand zone up so
it's kind of like a meritocracy the more
right in a way effort you put in the
more the more you're involved yeah and
we have a lot of dealings with schools
will help to teach children in classes
and we had taken the error code we were
allowed to copy and translate that and
became a partner Oh co.org and last year
we had 25,000 children in different
schools in Norway doing it and think
that's a great introduction yeah yeah
Lily so one thing we were chatting about
which i think is a an interesting topic
is how to get more like girls more woman
involved encoding the it's a big problem
in the guests also in the US as in
Norway that the we don't have enough
women in the business and I think it's
them we have found out the best way of
getting more girls is to how women as
role models to have the mass construct
instructors in the cold clubs because
there's so much which is communicated
between a grown woman who this girl see
is a successful woman you see yeah that
can be a career for me yes he has
confidence she has she has done a lot of
fun stuff I want to be like her and
exacting a positive role model right and
I think that that perhaps is the biggest
success factors to get more more girls
and then slowly get them more into
education and when the earth what's your
usual ratio of like kids women girls to
boys and your own children's workshops
it's quite depressing I guess that
probably comes from also the parents
really and then what they see today the
children oh yeah maybe they're more
likely to bring their sons rather than
their daughters for some regretfully
yeah but we had some really great
success with the last year's co.org a
deal's was with Elsa and Anna you know
from the frost these three princesses
and we had the one time there was this
girl geek dinner club who made the
invite more girl ish and it attracted a
lot of good much more girls and and the
boys like the task they like the
exercises to they lie to Anna they liked
Elsa and that helped yes I think you
have to also acknowledge that girls want
to do different things they there at
mixing yeah hmm yeah I think well so I
helped out with a lot of kids workshops
in the Bay Area
so I read Gupta opened up a dev aux for
kids bay area chapter and I've been one
of the main instructors and I think in
the bay area there's usually a pretty
good ratio of girls to boys in our Wow
in our workshops but that's that's
probably also its it tends to be the bay
area tends to be more liberal and a lot
of parents focus on empowering their
their kids equally for we don't
workplace purposes so I think it's not
it's not obvious in the workplace today
about because there's a big inequality
between a number of men versus women
coders but in the kids workshops it's
it's pretty much 50-50 on them that's
cool lot of our stuff that's good kudos
to you oh it's nothing we did it just
it's just the culture in the area but no
I think it makes a big difference having
woman instructors so I'm a bunch of the
a bunch of the students who went to
workshops have actually turned into
instructors hmm so expose yeah you know
it's basically like you know young girls
high school hmm teaching other kids in
program I think that also sets a good
role model kuzma see kids see folks who
are similar and a bit older a little
older you know like they're like they're
seniors hmm but still you know
themselves young we do that as well
because in this school I can't
really can't get teachers you can teach
children so we get students from from
higher levels yes young ones yeah it's
brilliant I think that's a great way of
doing it as well I think the only way
really really getting the gender
equality working is to get it into
schools because then everybody can be
exposed to it and everybody can
experience there the sense of
accomplishment the the the field is
great they get creative they get
rewarded and they want to do it more you
know that's how I started coding yeah I
was playing around and I think that's
really the key yeah that's it's
surprising how many folks who were
self-taught on on programming
yeah-hoo-hoo in some way start off with
like video gaming yeah
which they're ordering around in mud or
computer is because you do things you
like and then you realize oh wait I can
I can do that I can take that's moving
way and the sound exactly and then you
and then you end up doing like you know
yeah enterprise Java yeah yeah yeah our
major goal is to get coding into schools
that's our foremost goal I think it's
perhaps easier in Norway than in the US
since you have distributed the schooling
programs are interested but I i think
it's since i have set curriculum it's a
little bit more difficult yeah in the
u.s. yeah I think so but I mean if you
look at the different countries who are
used to be poor than as an art board
unless you know in Europe like England
they started from all levels of school
yeah teach editing yeah that's really
Linda starting I think estonia and now
that the oil prices have dropped in our
way people are certainly getting more
interested they understand that we need
what why the next generation in a
digital world there's something about
allowing the children to create
something and not just be stupid
consumers oh maybe you should start
teaching and they're absolutely adores
on them I think I had a major uptake now
actually and that in the local elections
the local labour party they contacted us
and they made that as one of their
promises if they came to power they
would have every child in preschool
should be taught coding well and then
the Conservatives contacted us and one
minister said that he would allow on a
national level schools 20 schools in
Norway to have
coding and then we felt wow they're
actually using this in election
campaigns now we're onto something yeah
that just happened this something most
parties can probably agree on yeah so
that was a sort of a major victory so to
spare that they're made them something
political out of it now that's really
cool so I hope they don't forget it when
the election passes so it's really
exciting to hear about what you're doing
with with kids programs here in Norway
thanks for having me yeah I hope that
wish you the best of success thank you
same to you on the bay area yeah yeah
and for folks watching us online you can
watch all of the livestream two
interviews at night hacking com interact
with us ask us questions by retweeting
hashtag night hacking and look forward
to the rest of the interviews today
we're going to have another interview
each hour with another amazing guest
wing gum like Simon so thanks very much
thanks having me hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
