Oracle technology Network we're here
live on the floor of Jay focus and we're
talking to members of the java community
I've got Cecilia Borg with me hi Cecilia
hi entering and I know you're part of
the Stockholm team here tell me what you
do I'm a product manager I work with
mainly open udk but a couple of the
other Java releases as well okay I hear
there's some kind of SC release coming
up oh my god job aid we've been working
our butts off and we're so relieved it's
finally coming out yeah i hear there's a
release candidate out out now right yes
excellent 128 wow so tell me about se8
evolutionary revolutionary what would
you say revolutionary in the sense that
the OpenJDK community actually
contributed so much into it nice yeah
looking at the major feature lambda
touching everything in the whole
platform and actually the OpenJDK
community has been involved on mailing
lists on thousands of emails going back
and forth wow so this really truly is an
open source project that's huge and
people from all over the world are
involved right yes so for example Brian
gets they contacted me about someone
contributing and he said we should
encourage this guy this guy he asked me
to track us down track him down and it's
actually turned out to be a high school
student in Tokyo wow that's excellent so
anybody can really get involved right
anybody can get them all okay so I'm a
little intimidated I mean it sounds like
a huge huge project where would I get
started and so anyone could sign up for
mailing list say I'm just looking at
that and that was the guy in Japan that
bitter Fox guy did but if you're unsure
there's a community initiative called
adduct OpenJDK it started in the london
java community group and they're
actually helping contributors that want
to contribute to the Java platform but
that are not yet part of the OpenJDK
community
excellent so what's the URL where do I
go to get started I would Google adopt
OpenJDK ok Google adopt OpenJDK take a
look and there's a lot you can do in an
open source project that doesn't
necessarily involve writing code right
yeah sure yeah it's very helpful for
people to look at features to try them
out give their opinion about yes I would
never really use this or it would really
be helpful if blah would work daily all
feedback as contribution right exactly
nice so tell me what you're working
whats after eight what have you done for
us lately what's your team looking at
now yeah beyond eight and then looking
at Java nine right now and having a lot
of things coming up mainly with OpenJDK
we're trying to improve the
infrastructure so now you know we
already have an open wiki we have an
open bug system and a lot of those
infrastructures things are so important
for people to actually contribute that's
what we're working on now excellent good
well I just want to thank you for
dropping by no great stuff and I'm very
excited about eight take a look at the
release candidate now now's a good time
to give your feedback thank you thank
you so much all right bye bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
