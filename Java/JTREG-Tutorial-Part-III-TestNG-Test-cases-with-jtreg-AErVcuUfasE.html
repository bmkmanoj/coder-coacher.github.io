Jeter's Casas with the JT rag my name is
below general idea I am working in Java
platforms group as a principle number of
technical staff at Oracle here is a
disclaimer in this video tutorial I am
going to explain how testing the test
cases are supported in JT rec for the
convenience of explaining i have named
the test cases as taipei tests and type
b tests i will give you a short demo and
there is a reference pages that contains
the link to learn more about today right
let me start with testing g supporting
JT right test ng supports test indeed as
in two ways for the convenience i have
named them as type A and type II type a
test cases are a group of Destin GE
tests organized in its standard package
hierarchy a standard package hierarchy
may contain just one test case or many
test cases type of be test cases is
single test ng test which can be freely
intermixed with other types of jet
earache tests let me now move over to
show you how Taipei tests are supported
in JT Reich first write a test case
using testing g in a normal way and then
add a line test ng dotted dales equal to
directory names in test dot properties
file or test dot root file where
directories day one and dear to
represent the package root directory
related to test root directory test dot
properties file if present should be at
package root directory i will give you
example in the next slide
individual test case may include JT reg
information tags such as at tests or at
summary however individual test case
must not include JT reg action tags such
as at run or at compile in this diagram
example 53 dot Java and example 54 dot
Java are type a tests organized in test
ACC dot swing package test dot
properties file present in accessible
directory here accessible is a package
root directory containing the package
tests dot ACC dot swing test load
properties file may contain test ng
dotted is equal to dot saying that
current to directory contains the test
ng tests or test dot root file contain
testing g is equal to slash demo 3 /
accessible example of taipei tests note
that there is no JT reg specific tags in
the test source file this has only
artifacts related to test ng example 2
is same as example one exception is test
annotations are added to method level
instead of class level specifying
libraries in type a tests ad lib
daughter deals equal to directory
containing the libraries to the test dot
properties file if the path starts with
a slash the path is evaluated from the
directory containing test dot root file
else the path is evaluated from the
directory containing test dot properties
file let me move over to show you how
type p tests are supported in GT right
again write a test case using testing g
add JT ragtags example a test tag to the
test source file something it is similar
to other JT reg tests then use at run
test ng tag instead of at run main
action tag however a main method is not
required in the test case example of
type is tests observe in the test case
at test and at run tests ng action tags
and also observe test ng artifacts and
also notice that the test case do not
have a main method specifying libraries
in type B tests use at library tag in
the test source file it is same as any
other JT reg tests if the path starts
with / the path is evaluated from the
directory containing test dot root file
else the path is evaluated from the
directory related to the test case now
let me move over to demo here demo 3
directory contains testing g tests let
us look at demo 3 directory CD demo 3 it
has example 61 o Jawa example 62 your
tower and example 63 dot java those are
typos be tests and demoed 3 also contain
directly accessible and also another
directory containing libraries let me go
to accessible directory accessible
directory contains test not property
foil and also test directory so test dot
properties file has pressed properties
test ng dati variable and library lipid
or tails variable CD tests ACC swing
directory contains type of B tests these
type II tests are organized under
package test dot ACC swing directory and
package root directory is accessible let
me go back let me go back and execute
the tests ok and JT rec- were posed some
re- automated and i want to execute all
the tests n concurrency mold ok entity
rake as usual create a jetty work and JT
report directory and also executed six
test cases all tests are passed and the
report is written to JT report directory
let me delete jetty work and JT report
directory star clear the screen CD demo
three and let me go to accessible and
edit or let me remove test dot
properties file that's dot RM test
properties now let me go back and
execute the test again take earache
minus verbose summary automated
concurrency equal to our toe notice that
in this case only three test cases are
executed and all three are passed solely
type B tests are executed type Etta's
are not executed because JD rec could
not find the location of test ng test
cases that is because we have removed
test out properties file now instead of
restoring test or properties file let me
edit test dot root file and add test dot
ng variable and libel lipid or tails
variable and let me execute the test
again Yeti reg- verbose summary minus a
concurrency equal to a toe in this case
again all test cases have been executed
in summary testing g dot adele's and
library variable can be specified in
either tested or root file or test or
properties file that is located in
package root directory let me no more
over to main presentation let me no more
over to references pages
there are a lot of information about JT
wreck available on openjdk door java.net
website code tool project has sources
for JT wreck which one can clone play
around and then in contribute to JT reg
all the emails sent to a JT wreck dave-o
alias has been archived and is available
on mail dot OpenJDK tour java.net
website and there is a OpenJDK wiki page
that has some additional information
about rhetoric including slides for this
tutorial if anyone have any questions
about dev about JT reg development
related issues and email to JT reg dash
dau a taupe Angelica java.net alias in
addition to that JT Reich bundles afaik
use and tag specifications more
information about data rate can be
obtained using JT reg- online help or by
simply typing JT rec space minus help
this is end of part 3 of GT rec tutorial
part 4 covers how to contribute to
OpenJDK tests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
