Network and I'm here today interviewing
javaone speakers and today I have Aaron
Aaron hi oh you're on for you I'm good
so I mean you've been that a jabbing at
sun or cole and on Java for four years
and you've recently left a company so
tell us what's going on yeah i was when
i joined sun microsystems in 1999 Wow
sometime so so I've been with son Oracle
for like what almost fourteen plus years
what have been 50 in this March but I
left auricle in October of last year and
John red hat at Red Hat I'm the director
for developer advocacy and I Drive the
developer outreach efforts were all of
jboss middleware so anything that you
hear from the jboss technologies is sort
of what I Drive I left the company but I
did not leave any of my friends behind
they're all with me not at red hat but
yeah there's still very much good
friends like just like you okay so Java
one I mean what are you talking about at
javaone yeah java one is going to be a
very different experience because when i
attended for the very first java one
which was in 99 and I but ended all of
those since then so this is going to be
my son 15 something like that javaone so
everton did all of those but those were
all in the capacity of being the host
company so I mean I was the track lead
for bike past several years I've been
participating in the process of paper
selection I've been keynoting for seven
six seven years so it was a very
different experience this time as an
outsider like you know what I was going
to be but guess what you know it's very
pleasant actually at Oracle you know it
I know it you know I've done that many
times we reach out to the community Java
champions joven rock stars become very
special treatment some sort of privilege
to be in that community so definitely
very excited you know very much looking
forward to make javaone a success first
of all
from my side I am giving a talk which is
on real world Hawaii seven deployments
now Red Hat has a open source
application server that is wild fly that
while fly is java ee 7 compatible and we
have seen Laura our customers using java
ee 7 deployments on wild fly in real
life deployments so I thought this is
one plus year now java ee 7 is live so
we will talk about some of the customer
deployments what are the do's and the
don'ts and the design patterns and i'll
be using jsf or the using jax-rs or they
using html5 those are the design
patterns from real life that i would
like to discuss in that talk to some
three or four use cases around that then
the other talk is about java ee 7
tutorial that's going to cover the
broader landscape you know NetBeans
IntelliJ Eclipse their pros and cons
glassfish and while fly both of those
application servers then talk about java
ee 7 development deployment scenarios in
open shape cloudbees or if any other
pass vendor is able to support it by
that time sort of provide latest
bleeding edge update on java ee 7 and
then the last tutorial i am giving is
they works for kids for parents now day
works for kids is an initiative where we
teach technology to kids at an early age
with a lot of emphasis on fun typically
when we do the workshop it's not the
kids just the kids basically but it's
the parents who are standing back and go
this is a good experience what can we do
to help so this workshop to our tutorial
which is gonna be is basically sharing
all of our experience from the trenches
and we have delivered no 50 plus
workshops so far in past about a couple
of years so definitely looking forward
to share that experience on what parents
can do you know not just technology
parents now java one so I'm expecting a
lot more technology parents but really a
lot more non-technology parents can do
together promote technology to their
kids because there may be a selfish we
want to make the funnel bigger for
technology talking more people over
there so yeah I think it's a positive
leave us a little bit of detail so
so it's for parents so it's for sipping
for kids or how old are the kids yeah so
the kids range literally anywhere from
six years old to high school so anywhere
we've seen elementary to high school
kids but because this is at javaone so
this is going to be this to our tutorial
is going to be at government for the
parents and then the saturday before
javaone we will do a separate event
which we can talk separately which is
focus on the kids so these two separate
things up and what else are you excited
about so you will be a java champion and
there are many activities for java
champions but what else do you think is
interesting a java one yeah i think the
java community in general is right add
the aboriginal keeping point but for the
past like three years after sun oracle
acquisition it was lot of you know bro
haha about oh how java community is
going to survive what's going to happen
oracle has really turned around the
community shown the progress and with
jdk 8 release java ee 7 release netbeans
8 release things seem to be moving in a
positive direction so for me
particularly what i'm looking forward to
is this is the first java one where lots
of positive announcements are going to
be there you know how we're going to do
with java ee a at red hat we looking at
how we can do several jsr we can
contribute over there make java ee he
still no success even going forward so
i'm definitely looking forward to my
engagement as i said earlier first time
as a non host attendee so that will be
my first time as an attendee and hey
hopefully get guess what i will actually
get a java one bag because employee now
and an extra t-shirt to maybe I got many
features though okay thank you so much i
ran for talking to us today thank you
