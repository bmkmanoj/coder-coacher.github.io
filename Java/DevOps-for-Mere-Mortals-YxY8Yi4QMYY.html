hiking at swamp up my name is Jerome PI
from Oracle technology Network and right
now I have as a guest Jack and Alan hi
guys so so tell us what you do and who
you work for
so I work for Yahoo as a senior
principal engineer Issy senior principal
engineer I write lots of J and I lots of
Java and I repackage other people's
builds so I deal with our build systems
and with lots of our legacy software my
name is Jack Weaver I'm a tech lead at
sava systems so I oversee a group of
five engineers we build SAS multi-tenant
software companies new it software
development so there's been a lot of
growth at that organization both in
DevOps maturity testing kind of raising
the bar in terms of quality and I've
been trying to you know help bring that
that change about so I used to work with
Allen at Yahoo and that's that's how we
know each other yeah I have about 150
employees total maybe 25 or so in actual
development and then there's three
products and on my product I've got the
five engineers of the five developers
and myself so a team of six and we do it
all
awesome so really like a big company and
then a very small start-up type of
company so both of you actually did a
talk today about the DevOps for me
immoral and so so what was the the topic
really the main topic so the idea was
was after Jacqueline to a start-up we
started talking about how you know all
the cool tools we have a yahoo for doing
DevOps and how we missed them all
dramatically yeah basically when I when
I first joined at sada it was it was
quite a shock
the the existing engineers had never
really been through automation or you
know heavy levels of testing or process
that kind of takes a commit and just
goes and deploys it out they'd never
seen any of that before and when I got
there
I mean I came from a dev tools team at
Yahoo working with Allen and I it was it
was shock okay so you know the idea was
well you know build small start in terms
of what is the highest ROI for your team
everything we do in software is an
economic activity and I can't invest a
lot of time in building you know massive
systems like Yahoo has but I still need
that DevOps experience I still have to
push code I still got to run fast how do
I do that and there's a lot of lessons
learned when you go through that kind of
experience coming from a big in an
organization like Yahoo and then being
put into a really small company with no
experience and still having to raise
those quality standards get to
production faster deploy code faster
follow best practices and it's been
quite a ride we've matured a lot to look
at when I first started where we're now
phenomenal I couldn't be more proud I
have great engineers I love my team it's
it's been a heck of a ride yeah so from
so what are some of them I would say
like the practices that both of you
agreed on like I mean whatever is
applicable or what is them if you want
another way of looking at it what would
be like the the core practices that you
want to have like no mado I mean whether
you're working in a big company or a
small company so the automatic CI was
one of the core practices and the whole
goal here was I've been to this
conference before and I realized all the
big companies are here saying this is
how we do it but if you're a small
company there wasn't anything for you to
take home and use because I've got 60 80
engineers doing build tools he's got
none and so we wanted to show something
where you can take all the same core
principles of commit to production
without humans involved automatic
deployments and say you know what any
person any single small start-up
engineer can do this it's not just
something the big companies can do but
you can do it too with the tools that
are provided yeah and and you know when
you come to an organization that hasn't
really seen or experienced a lot of this
before you start on the small things and
you
and you would all away and you work on
them and you turn people that might not
have seen it or might not have believed
in process before you turn them into
believers so you start small you say
okay we're going to focus on tests we're
going to focus on unit tests okay now
we're going to hook up a CI system and
we're just going to build we're not even
going to publish your package or
anything like that we're just going to
build it okay and make sure it passes
and then you build on that you say okay
well now it makes sense for us actually
publish our artifacts because we need
something to be able to push out we're
tired of doing deployments from dev
laptops and so now you start publishing
we use artifactory we push our artifacts
out there and then after you've got that
in place now you can automate your
deployment because now your CI machines
can actually pull the artifacts from
artifactory that have already been
through some level of QA and testing and
push them out into your environment so
so the trick
you know if there's kind of a couple
takeaways one sort of universal
practices unit testing functional
testing packaging versioning tagging
deploying those are the basic things
you've done at Yahoo still done it a
really small company and and two for the
small companies that are really
challenged in terms of getting to that
that environment the best level or the
best advice I could possibly give is you
start small and you convince those
around you about the ROI because
everything we do is in economic activity
we have to pay for that time so you have
to convince your bosses and your
superiors that it's worth it you have to
be able to show how it speeds
development open how you save time and
when they start seeing it as an ROI as
an investment it's you start converting
people they become believers so one more
thing to remember is although it may not
seem like it yahoo is also new at this
we started the automatic commit to
production within the past five years
probably the past three our automatic
deployment goals have all been pushed
for the past couple of years it's not
like we've been doing this for the past
ten years I've been there but it's been
probably past three to five years that
we really started focusing on let's
automate this stuff let's get it out
let's get everyone doing things the same
way let's get everyone doing code
reviews so it's actually as new to us as
it is to many of these startups although
it may not seem like it so this is
really good the analogy this one
so what are some of the tools that you
use I mean ow do you have like different
tools because of the size of the company
or I mean or what is affordable for the
smallest size oh so that's one of the
most interesting points so I use
artifactory hosted internally he uses
artifactory software as a service it's
actually the same tool just one person
maintains it instead of my team of
people yahoo actually had we used
Jenkins heavily we decided that wasn't
cutting it we built an internal system
called screwdriver it went screwdriver
v2 it went to v3
now they've open-source to this
screwdriver dot CD which other people
use if that's what they want to use we
use github internally once again we host
github they use private github
kubernetes Google cloud we have internal
private clouds that's one of the things
we don't leverage open source for but in
summaries we do use some public cloud
providers
yeah and ultimately the interesting kind
of differences is you know with Yahoo
there's larger risk if a system goes
down you know they lose hundreds of
thousands of dollars an hour we're not
quite at that level so the economics are
are not in our favor to build up big
internal systems that might be more
reliable than the public cloud ones the
economics aren't there it doesn't make
sense right we're small again you know
one or two customers were not big yet as
time goes on the economics will shift
and we will change from an organization
that relies a lot in terms of the public
cloud SAS tooling it's a little bit more
private cloud - maybe some internal run
systems as we get real big right and so
what you see is going back to sort of
ROI and economics and the way of
thinking about development and DevOps is
you're going to place your effort and
your time and your chips if you will
you're going to place your money and the
things that are the biggest payoff and
initially we can we can stomach that
level of risk with public cloud at some
point we're not going to be able to and
when we do we might shift more in terms
of Yahoo model and actually have larger
systems that are internal and that we
might have staffed up teams to run them
but you know today when you're just
getting started the economics don't make
sense so you know we use we use Travis
CI but you know
the see is out there circle or semaphore
drone I've looked and evaluated a lot of
them they're all really good use github
private so not quite the big large
hosted github that that Yahoo has we
have artifactory sass it's real cheap
you know 85 bucks a month and you know
we get our own artifactory just like
yahoo has and then we have a couple of
other services we use so there's a
static analysis tool called coda see
that actually on pull requests it can
review your code and try to catch errors
and bugs that helps put a little bit of
guardrails in place in terms of quality
lint checks things like that and then of
course we're a big google google cloud
shop so the whole stacks on GCP we have
kubernetes on container engine a few
different GCE instances in terms of VMS
but it's all SAS you know so there is
some risk there if those guys go down we
go down with them but again the
economics the adult point in terms of
taking the Yahoo model yet because we're
just so small well at the same time
recently we switched to when we go down
we serve from public cloud as a failfish
so it's interesting that you can
leverage both sides that you can run
your private cloud but then you can also
say hey you know what when my datacenter
goes down I can serve static assets out
of a public cloud for BCP backups or for
spikes so the in the data environment I
always share about the change of
cultures right that you need of course I
mean we all are trained to do equity no
we have our ways of doing things so do
you have like any advice on on how to
change that culture and how to introduce
DevOps if if a team is not doing it
today so the biggest culture shock we
went through at Yahoo was eliminating
the QA department that was a shock now
to change the culture the best way to
change an engineers mind is to show them
makes his life easier if I have to spend
three hours goofing off waiting for a
build my life is miserable if I can cut
that three hours down to one I'm much
happier so if you show them things that
give them return on investment to where
they're it's easier to do
it's easier to build there's less to
monkey with it's easier to figure out
why it's broken they're going to
transparently just change because it's
easier
yeah culture is a tough one I I think
the biggest takeaways you have is at
least coming from a small perspective
you know I'm a new employee there I come
with a pretty good amount of good
experience and best practices you know
taking a lot from Yahoo you have to find
individuals that are either on the fence
right or they're hard line against you
one or the other and they're both useful
individuals to find because if you find
the hard-liners you can single them out
you can sit them down you can overtime
work on them and when those guys who are
usually the loud you know auntie
whatever it is okay auntie DevOps
anything it once they start to change it
changes other individuals around them
right so you take the loud ones out you
can do that you're off to a good start
and then the guys that are on the fence
you know they're usually easier to
convince the at the end of the day you
know money talks and if you can sit down
you can actually show how it is in ROI
how there's a return on that investment
right and you can show how it's saving
your time and it's allowing you to catch
bugs sooner so now we need to release
faster produce more higher quality code
if you can show those things you'll find
a lot of the business professionals that
aren't necessarily day-to-day engineers
are all of a sudden in promoting what
you want to do and when you convince
them it can it can actually fall down
but the culture is a tough one you you
have to kind of you know slowly but
methodically it target people and try to
convince them and I think of it like
turning a big battleship you know
culture doesn't change on a dime and so
you make the proper changes and slowly
over time you start to change the
direction of another company I'd say an
oil tanker but the crispy barnacles the
old guys have been there for 10 years
the way you change them and you make
their life easier
and you make it easier by showing them
how they should be faster by them doing
less any other takeaway that Thanks from
your experience or from your
presentation that you would like to
chair in to say oh did we cover
everything
I mean that there's quite a bit there I
you know I think at the end of the day
you you do what makes sense right I
there is no black and white in this
there's universal practices that are
pretty well established follow those
beyond that you're going to do what
makes sense for your organization and
you know always have the internalized
the fact that programming is an economic
activity and and whether you're spending
time working on DevOps and building like
CI pipelines or you know infrastructure
is code and kind of grabbing old
machines that were you know snowflakes
and turning them into machines that are
that are configured and described in
code right that takes time so pick the
small things you know and do what makes
sense I have to say that differently
pick the biggest gnarliest ugliest thing
you can find in the organization and
fight with it for five years until you
win I had an issue with the operating
system we're running and well I could
five and a half years later we're not
running out of operating system anymore
and when it's time to move to the next
one we're moving a little bit faster
than the last time but it's a lot easier
this time
that's so much like a big corporation
dog I can relate hey thank you guys
thank you so much for spending the time
and talking to us so thank you for
sharing your knowledge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
