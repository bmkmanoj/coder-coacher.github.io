embedded world 2014 in Nuremberg Germany
and we are in the Oracle booth and one
of the partners were featuring here this
year his free scale and with free scale
here to show us what they're exhibiting
at the show is Avinash Naidu he's an
engineering manager for a segment
solutions lab from freescale hi Avinash
hey James thank you so here I'm here an
embedded world and I'm showcasing the
fee scale one box platform this platform
is an open hardware and software
platform enable body
Freescale Oracle and arm this platform
is open hardware software which means
the next it runs java SE and the
communication between they touch nose
and the gateway platform system over the
arms and senior rappers that provide
security so in a typical IOT application
you have h notes for example here we
have a smart flux we have a smart
thermostat and they have a smart meter
and of course all of them are enabled
with rescale hardware's these smart
notes for communicating our multiple
protocols for example the smart lock is
talking ZigBee one dot go to the gateway
the smart thermostat is communicating
with Wi-Fi to the Gateway and the smart
meter there is talking ZigBee to dato
and sup gigahertz back to the gateways
so as you notice this loss of data being
generated from the text gateway and this
gateway since it runs Java SE provides
local processing and analytics it also
has also is running at the Java
OAP to provide local processing of
events and then as needed to a push to
the clock or servicing of events the
platform in its heart runs Linux from
freescale which is optimized with all
the BBS P drivers it has the Java SE
platform voted by Oracle and of course
communication as I mentioned before
happens with the arm sense in your
server
to the edge knows it's provides the
security wrapper layer and about that of
course we have the applications that we
want to enable third parties to build
the secure servers services delivery
platform in this particular demo we are
reading from the H nodes and your in
particular you see that we are reading
you're reading a lot of data readings
from the meter from smart meters and
based on the events and based on the
local processing trigger that happens
the data is passed back to the Oracle
server for more big data processing but
we already know I can show you on the
screen that I can read the meter here
and meter shows me that it is on and it
also shows me what's the community power
being used and the instant instantaneous
power being used of course all these
solutions are enabled by our free scale
edge nodes so in summary rescale has
provides solutions all the way from the
tiniest edge of the internet of things
like use edge notes all the way through
hierarchy of gateways that go all the
way to the core of the network so this
solution provides developers with a
scaleable solution with a secured
solution because it runs Java SE and it
also runs the coop wrappers and it
provides the development tools that are
needed like the Linux SDK we provide for
this hardware optimized platform and
based on the application and the
processing needed the hierarchy of
gateways are provided by free scale
solutions for people to develop
applications for the smart health smart
home smart cities and of course all the
way to the cover of the network
applications thank you thank you have a
nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
