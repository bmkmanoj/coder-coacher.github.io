and building open GFX this is using the
latest be 78 build 78 of JDK 8 and it's
on Mac OS now there's a couple steps in
here that are a little bit different
than what's inside the wiki but by and
large we follow the steps in the wiki as
explained and everything should work
just fine so the first thing that we're
gonna do is we're just going to make the
directory that's going to contain our
open GFX code so we'll go ahead and CD
into that and then what we're going to
do is we're gonna follow the next step
here and clone from master so let me
grab that and we are going to clone it
and now I've got master I can follow the
next step CD into master and from here
what we're going to need to do is we're
going to need to create this artifacts
SDK tarty Lib ext directory now the
reason we need to create that is because
Java effects open GFX is split into two
parts there's a closed part in an open
part because we haven't finished open
sourcing all of the code necessary in
order to build everything in open-source
so as a result what we're going to need
to do is put the JFX RT dot jar that
contains the closed pieces into
artifacts SDK RT Lib ext and then we can
just build the rest of the open source
pieces as they are now we could take the
JFX RT jar and strip out all the open
pieces from it and just put the closed
bits in here but actually we don't end
up doing that we just take a complete
Jeff xrt jar from the latest weekly
build copy it into Libby XT and off we
go
so in order to do that now that we've
created the directory we need to do the
next step with just a copy it now on Mac
all the java virtual machines are placed
into library java java virtual machines
if I look here I've got a few of them
I'm just going to grab the latest one
which for me is my build 78 go to
contents home Jerry Lib to fxrt live ext
J fxrt jar and I'm going to copy that
into artifacts sdk live EXT okay so now
I have my binary stub in there now
there's one more step that I'm going to
do which is not documented and this is a
new a new step that you're going to need
to take there's a couple different ways
to do it the essential problem is that J
fxrt chart now is on the boot class path
of JDK 8 and what that means is that
whenever you run any Java program
including ant that copy of GFX RTR that
is in JDK 8 is the first thing on the
class path before the binary stub in
artifacts SDK RT Lib ext before any code
that you're actually compiling or
linking with right now and because it's
first and because it has all of the
existing Java effects sometimes you end
up with a different method there then
say a method in a class that you've
modified and then when you're trying to
compile you'll find that your met your
new method is never getting called and
that's because at runtime the wrong
class is the one that's being loaded the
class from the weekly JDK 8 build as
opposed to the one that you've just
built and in fact you will find in the
wiki instructions that we specify that
this may be a problem down here here's
the command line needed to run open GFX
after you've built ok you have to
specify that you want to add your jar
your your jfx our tdedora UI controls
jar or whatever it is that you've built
into the boot class path ahead of the
rest of the JDK and that way your
classes get picked up now it turns out
that this is still a problem at compile
time not just build time so there's a
couple ways to solve it want us to
specify what the boot class path is at
the time that you build with ant but the
way that I'm going to do it is to assume
that the JDK is only installed for the
pleasure of me building and not actually
running anything so what I'm going to do
is just move GFX r2 jar out of the JDK
is JRE
lib ext directory and then manually
include it if I need it into the class
path when I'm running an application so
what I'm going to do
just sudo move library Java Java Virtual
Machines jk8 builds and the eight
contents home Jerry Eve lived ext GFX
are thr I'm just gonna move that into
our home directory and then I don't have
to worry about it okay now we're set up
right almost I've found that on Mac for
some reason my java home needs to be
specified at the time that I build or in
a bash Parsi some other location I need
to specify the environment variable job
a home because otherwise on my system
sometimes that bill gets confused and it
picks up the wrong version of Java for
building different parts of the platform
and it gets upset I don't understand why
that is now I'm trying to fix these sort
of problems in our new Gradle build so
we don't have this problem but for right
now what I found is that the best way to
go is to just include build 78 contents
home as my java home and then I can just
type ant that's a problem because I'm in
the wrong place I forgot an entire step
one should follow directions so the next
thing that I am going to do now that I
have put things in the right places
is that I need to clone the RT directory
so let's go ahead and clone it
now that's been cloned I can CD into it
as the instructions say I can just run
ant and now we're going to wait a couple
of minutes while it builds
now we see that we've had a problem
actually there is this step that I
forgot because it's not in the sequence
of steps here in the recipe and the
problem is right here a little later
down on the wiki it says that you'd need
the following files downloaded and
placed an open GFX master Lib so these
files are antler and version 3.13 now
the best place to go download these is
from WWE antler 3 org slash download and
you can just go find antler 3.1.3 tar.gz
will download that and then what I'm
gonna go do is go into my downloads
there it's been downloaded so we can
just untie it see the into antler lib
and here we'll find the jars that we
need so I'm just going to copy these
jars into our open jfx oh yeah I would
copy them but first I have to make the
directory open GFX master Lib and now I
can copy handler files there now if
you're you know lazy could probably just
copy all these jars over it wouldn't
hurt it's just that you only need three
of them so I'll just copy over the three
that I need I don't have the extra
copies laying around but it probably
doesn't make any difference whatsoever
now that those things have been copied
over I can head back over to my open GFX
master RT and now let's try building
again it should be quite happy begin our
two minute wait and there we go the
thing finished building and just a
little bit over two minutes so those are
the steps that it takes in order to get
it to build on mac OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
