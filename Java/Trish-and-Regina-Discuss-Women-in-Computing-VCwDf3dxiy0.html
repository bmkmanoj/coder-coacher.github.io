Network and I'm here today at devoxx
devoxx Belgium and talking to Trisha and
Regina hi hi and so we're going to talk
about women speakers no because at
two-minute yo no question so how many
speakers or how many women are devoxx
this year do you guys know I don't know
the proportion by he was saying about 5%
are women attendees of attendees and
there's 15 female speakers of I don't
know how many don't talk there are 180
180 so let's just under ten percent but
it's not counting the three female
ignite speakers in the 15 so oh well so
you had a session about like trying to
figure out a way to get more women
speakers so how did that go in general I
think it went really well I mean it was
purposefully aimed at including men and
women in the session to try and drum up
lots of ideas so Tasha has a specific
problem for trying to get more women
speakers to to various DevOps
conferences and she wanted to know what
she could do to try and solve this
problem things like do we do some
affirmative action type things do we ask
people to say you know I'm a woman
therefore please consider me more
carefully or whatever which obviously
people probably know my view is we
shouldn't really be doing that but we
had a long discussion about how we can
encourage novice speakers overall and
where they can get started how we
overcome this bootstrapping problem when
when you apply to a conference at devoxx
or I'm on the program committee for q
con London or these other things when we
consider your application we have to
know whether you're a decent speaker so
you need to be able to say well I have
experience here I've spoken about this
you can look at this video here and how
do you get the experience if you don't
have enough experience to get the
experience so we talked a lot about this
bootstrapping problem we talked about
using user groups is a really good way
we use as user groups for start can run
like speaker
sessions really lightweight things you
can get started really easily by just
doing like maybe introducing the the jug
session for the evening just do a couple
of minutes of hi this is me and these
are the talks we're going to have then
move on to things like lightning talks
then maybe present your own thing and
then once you start getting more
comfortable then maybe get those videoed
and you can submit those as part of your
conference yes prop your CFP so we we
kind of addressed this bootstrapping
problem more probably than how'd is a
conference specifically few women speak
yeah how do we make sure that the
women's speakers as women speak of
proposals get treated fairly and they
believe they do get treated fairly it's
just that I've seen as as a member of a
program committee you just don't get
enough of them so it's not a case of how
do you treat them it's a case of trying
to get more of them right and there is
also a lot of men who have also or
speaking a lot and so therefore it's bad
for everybody to start yeah yeah another
rock star speaker to get into any
conference to get noticed and so there
were some guys that said I but I want to
be a speaker but I don't know how to get
started and somebody suggested also like
a lot of us have to scrum teams okay do
the scrum demo at the end do a small
presentation at your work site and then
it will be only your colleagues so you
know them and it's safe although for
some people that's the biggest problem
that there's are a lot of people there
that you know so they shouldn't say for
to speak in a foreign country where
nobody knows them but it's also one of
the suggestions was was that started
your local company with your scrum
meeting and do the demo
so what else well word maybe some of the
odd comments that came out last night or
things that you were surprised about how
did you learn anything surprise you know
I was pleasantly surprised that there's
a lot of guys saying hey but i have the
same problem yeah i thought the support
from the guys is very good the guys had
some very positive comments about how
how people could get started generally
they had the census of problems so i
really liked that kind of collaborative
approach of this is a problem that
affects everyone not just women how do
we overcome the fact that there are
seems to be a small minority of people
who happen to be white men who are
comfortable with that what do we do for
everyone else and so I thought it was
nice to have the guys on side so saying
we have the same sort of problems but
here are some solutions we could try
particularly some of the user group
leaders were like well we try this and
we did that yeah that's what the I like
the Carioca style thing that you get
five slides and you have to yeah power
bonus area 51 karaoke you get five
slides you don't know the topic you had
five minutes to check them out and you
do a presentation right and I like that
because it that that evens the playing
field so even expert speakers and novice
speakers are they're not prepared so
it's kind of it's fun it's not like the
amount of preparation you put in it's
just practice I like that idea and
anything oh and so there was also a
discussion about do we need a general
session about how to get started right
right so how can you just boot strap
yourself right so Martin and I want to
run a virtual Java user group session on
to kind of help novice speakers or help
people who might be wanting to apply to
conferences there's a bunch of stuff we
can do I've been thinking since I was on
the DevOps UK program committee I
thought about writing some blog posts
around what we look for in CFPs I'd like
to do some more stuff around what the
Duchess France group was going doing
around
helping people write the cfps helping
people practice their talks and so I
think there's a lot more a lot more we
can do as a community to help people
break this bootstrapping thing
particularly I think Martine and I and I
want to do a vdrug session on that stuff
definitely right or even panels right I
mean oh right the virtual meetup could
actually lose panels and dance also
somebody just suggested that conferences
tell what they are looking for right
like we are looking for this amount of
introductory talks and we're looking for
this amount of advanced talks and these
are the topics were really interested in
so people know what kind of paper they
should send in because then people are
more like I can tell something about
that right this is definitely this
perception that you have to be an expert
in something in order to be able to
speak and in my experience that's just
not true when we're running the manga
user group and the Java user group the
most demanded and topic for the manga
user group is introduction to MongoDB
and the Mongo user group has been going
for 10 months and we've run that session
three times already so these
introductory level talks are extremely
valuable for for normal developers
they're like oh I feel like I might
missed the boat on this technology can
you give me a quick intro to how it
works and almost anyone can give an
introductory talk in an hour you don't
have to do as much preparation or be as
much of an expert so is there an
opportunity to just like share talks and
have other people like take the same
talk for example oh yeah I mean that's a
really interesting idea i mean in
organizations like Mongo then we do have
slide decks which we can share between
us but I never thought about doing that
within say a user groups so that's also
a Linda rising does that with her talks
right she is a accomplished speaker but
she says at the end if you want to give
this talk somewhere else you're free to
use my material so that's why we had our
talk at def Fox UK about failures change
it was her presentation we just adapting
it to a play for two people so we do
that for java 8 launch for example as
well
right yes oh yeah why not sure
introductory I think that's a good idea
for new speakers because then they don't
have to worry about creating a slide
deck and creating the content and
worrying about how they present things
and how they how they practice things it
takes a lot of the burden away from
novice speakers right anything else any
year that it was interesting last night
almost definitely just having the
conversation is interesting yeah I think
so yeah we had a number of takeaways but
I think for me as a user group leader I
felt like I could be doing more in the
user group to help break that barrier
between because once you've been
presenting like I have for a few years
then I think that becomes a big barrier
between where you are and where your
user group members are and I think they
feel like this is a massive step when
it's not it's really just here you have
to help them just one of those things
also wasn't takeaway was like do flow
speaking so take sorry I don't they take
a novice big a weekly speaker with you
and do a coke presentation to pare pare
presenting representing so they don't
have to the pressure of being there by
themselves and that's something we have
been doing the dishes in the Netherlands
have taken several people to conferences
and then later they do the talk
themselves I don't have to yeah not
again the same talk so what about the
Duchess tell us like we're where are you
what are you doing right now all kinds
of things it's all over the world so I'm
not familiar with what everybody's doing
thank you this I don't have to arrange
it in the Midlands we're like working on
the site which is down some technical
problems and they work for kids as well
we're doing def extricates we've been
doing three in the Netherlands this year
and we've I've been to the one at
javaone
and so for next year there's some more
going as well and I've been doing
dinners and some technicals so what do
you do with the dinners then that would
be interesting to me I think with the
Dennis we just say okay we have a dinner
at that time with that location who
wants to come and there's like 10 of us
and we just talk about work right how
much it which is actually good fun
because most of the women are by
themselves at a place with only guys
right so they're like okay how do I do
this how what is happening do you have
the same problem it's the same with the
bus station at a Jaffa one there was one
woman who was really unhappy with her
work situation and I gave her some hints
and she was like I I think I like my job
again that's great so that's also what
happens at the dana says some people get
job opportunities out of them so it's
just networking but how do you find the
women to come to the dinner so for
example in Seville I've only been there
a year and there are only really three
women technical people who come to the
jugs or the mugs and that's me and two
friends of ours how do you find the
women if they're not kind of begin with
we when we are conferences we tell
people about it so if you see women we
asked them have you heard about those
shoes this is what we do and we have a
mailing list so every time we send a big
mailing out to everybody we know and we
invite them all on they say hey that's
the day come in if you joined want to
join us send us a line so we know so we
can reserve for enough seats and that's
how we do it so having a website with
help that would help that's easier to
announce things because sometimes we get
people from Germany or France or Belgium
coming as well it's not that far go if
you're in the area so like if I was in
the area I got dropped I couldn't drop
by if you want to yet cool cool well
thank you both of you thank you
but something
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
