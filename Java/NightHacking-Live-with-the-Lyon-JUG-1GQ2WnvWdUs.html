at night hacking today we're at the Leon
jug in France and we have a bunch of
folks here who are interested to learn
about where tonight we're going to talk
about javafx and spring technologies so
just to explain to folks how the stream
works so you go to night hacking com
which is the site for the tour and on
there there's a live video feed whenever
it's streaming live also you can
participate in the social chat we have
to chat up on screen here in the room so
if anybody sends out messages on the
social stream via Facebook and Twitter
then we get them locally and we can
respond to them by talking into the
camera or by typing back on a social
stream and to start with the the format
for this will be will do introductions
so for the user group members to kind of
introduce yourselves what you're working
on then we'll do the a short
presentation on javafx and spring
technologies and then let you guys do
some hacking and it's informal so at any
time you can ask questions or interrupt
me both in the room here and also on the
street all right so let's get started on
me on the camera and grab the microphone
in front of you on the table where all
rights your closest hello I'm just
talking I'm charge the bag novel I'm
working in at s dizzy s III which is a
French group and I'm doing Java and web
technologies go
I'm not to bring up and I'm well
currently between jobs and I'm
especially working ja ja van je je je
technology hopefully next time which
which version of je ariela that's
probably more recent Lester than last
time Kosta j2ee more yes that was your
last job but hopefully next one will be
a little very good hi I'm Alex yes now
i'm a member of the drug team and I'm
developing coding in java is praying
great and so stuff and a fan of Java EE
and the jboss application sale ok very
nice I'm gamma ray i'm a software
architect and i'm working for
pharmaceutical and industry well my
laboratories a well with a leader in a
homeopathic medical ins nah thank you hi
i am recent relationally developer in
java and i'm working wheels are giving
you see you ok same company hello I'm by
scary cause I'm doing some consulting
for sir a company called so hot mainly
on mobile technologies I do a lot of
poor point world my a day on I'm really
happy to be here tonight to to do some
lucky dice ok yeah no PowerPoint hacking
although I did do a little bit of that
at the start of the presentation but
that's not much fun ok hello I'm Alex
Toma and I'm walking in a startup called
wind machine
in nyali oh we are doing some java 7 and
some rest webservice web services and
the client using swing so we are
switching to java fix so we are very
interested in the conference tonight oh
hello one-pan yen yen I walks it's the
same company as HC so I'm doing sir
abdul am cooking java SE us spring swing
and and you are stretching to savage as
a virus as well so that's why I'm here
today I like to add to learn choice and
anything else yeah and before we go on
like we need a good shot of the jug flag
banner so what's the what's the meaning
of the mascot the logo so druggie on the
domestic oh nothing else I know it's not
the best so see the osita is the is the
guy jig is riding the Leon the lion is
the mascot of Phil you ok so nice one
day we will we'll have a better one but
this is all for the moment yes it's
colorful very local ok let's look at the
speaker Nick see friends of friends each
I should I should get a close up of your
your conference yeah see you guys all go
to mix it yeah yeah
see by the end of the night all convince
you to go to like I wanted to what
photos hello um java geographer i
developed with the some technology
around the java like spring web services
cassandra and other things in the in the
world of java so I'm here to know I'm an
testing about Java eats so okay yeah
welcome hi I'm Simon colonia iwata I
work a madman solution as a software
architect especially working on porting
a legacy application to to new
technology like java chat IE ok foie
gras
hi I'm Fabrice booty I work in energy
company I develop in Java and Java EE
cool hi I'm mark hope I'm what for CGI
and yeah at the moment it's a technology
using java java j2ee sorry with struts
and a lot of layers on top of it so yeah
christina lee effects layer of that and
i love and just a computer enthusiasts
call the general alright so thanks
everybody for doing introductions I know
usually usually the presenter comes and
they're supposed to be the only one who
gets put in front of the camera babe
today I turned it on you guys um okay
but now the camera gets back on me I
guess I have to so with somebody with
somebody mine's helping me with focusing
and anybody good with cameras so this is
the focus focus knob and this is the
zoom
alright cool so and we've already we've
already got some folks on the stream
interacting with us so this is Jim Weber
he's my co-author on the pro javafx book
and he's he's lives in indiana so he's
in the in the US but he's interacting
over the stream because i think it's
it's probably morning it's probably
morning for you Jim right I just let us
know what time it is over there in
Indiana and is this somebody in the room
very nice ok so we verified that it
works the stream works successfully all
right so um I can also broadcast my
desktop let me see if that's working
yeah ok desktop broadcasting is working
and what I'll do first is all show a
short presentation and then we could
discuss so if you guys have any
questions or things while I'm doing the
presentation just stop me and ask grab
the mic so folks can hear you online and
also if anyone's watching the stream
it's hard to see the stream at while the
presentations up so let me know if
anybody on the stream asks questions ok
and this one has to be set for okay
individual window take off that
to get that
All Right see the presentation even says
your user group name that's how that's
how that's how much effort I put into
this all right it's another picture of
the tour and you actually saw my
motorcycle today so you can prove that
I'm not just riding trains those are
some of the people who i'm who i'm
meeting so I've already done interviews
with everybody on the first and halfway
through the second row Antonio is
tomorrow so I'm going to beat up them in
Paris and also visit the power Caesar
group and evening and then on to Belgium
alright so first a little bit about job
effects to us this is the you know
nothing about javafx 20 kind of level
setting slide so basically it's a it's a
rich client platform so you run your
running java on the desktop computer it
takes advantage of a new 3d hardware
accelerated pipeline called prism so you
get full advantage of hard work cell
eration for 2d and 3d operations also
has a big set of a large library of
controls and also integrates with web
technologies you can put web content
right inside of javafx using webview and
also if you're coming from a legacy
technology like sling or SWT then you
can put javafx inside of your
application using the JFX pain or the
SWT pay okay so that's the quick what
job FX's alright so how do you get java
effects so you download Java 7 and
that's it there's no stuff too so yeah
easy
every Java 7 openjdk for only the java
SE 7 from a writer so okay good question
so and for folks on the stream who might
not have been able to hear that the
question was is it any java effects or
is it only the javafx from oracle so
right now only part of javafx is open
source so it's only the Oracle Java
which has javafx in it in February
they'll have the entire javafx code base
open source and then you'll be able to
get it in the hope and jdk builds so not
yet but soon it'll be and hope in jdk
once it gets fully open sourced into the
question does eat work on nynex no yes
yes say that's why he's there that's why
we've got the tux hanging out there so
in the when it was first released to
only worked on windows and they quickly
put out a developer preview for
macintosh and that release was about six
months later and then about 9 months and
the linux release came out and so now
it's supported on all the same platforms
where Java runs and it's part of Java 7
so you download Java 7 you get javafx if
you download Jerry you get the runtime
if you download the jdk you get all the
tool ok so how many of you have Java 7 I
write Java effects ok very good cuz
you'll get that one we're hacking
7 update 6 I think I think what well it
was I goes an update 62 anyway it's been
it for a while well long enough I
stopped putting the number of my slots
yeah same version so on he latest
version of Java then you have Java facts
you're done okay so how do you develop
javafx so you can develop on IntelliJ
you can develop on a clip so you can
also develop on NetBeans tdg I guess the
questions is there single turun IntelliJ
and so seen builder I'll mention this in
a sex scene builder is a visual GUI
building tool for java effects and it
has some integration with netbeans where
if you double click on your f xml file
it will open that and seen filter
directly but it also is an independent
tool so it works with Eclipse and
IntelliJ so you can use seen builder
with any of these IDs but as far as I
know Eclipse and IntelliJ don't have
their own GUI builder tools thank you
taka and I wouldn't also works on that
too I'm told it works on that all right
so yeah seen builder so this is what
seemed builder looks like but this is a
hacking session so I have to we can't
look at slots I have to show you this
right so let me quickly show you seemed
older
okay so let's create a new project oops
that's wrong I'm going to use the javafx
f XML template instead okay let's call
this the beyond jug we need a Lyon jug
logo let's go to your website
okay and we have how about this guy is
there a bigger version on the right side
you said no all right well we'll take it
we'll take it ah yeah okay so now we got
our meal and jug project so there's the
seat the template gave us three files it
gave us actually I want the projects it
gave us Lyon jug Java which is the main
class sampled at FX ml which is our our
XML file that scene builder generates
you can edit this directly and it looks
well it's not that interesting but it
looks like XML so anchor pain is one of
the job FX layouts and then you have a
couple a button on a label as a default
template and the last one is the
controller file and the controller file
you can interact with the XML so this
gets the label and then provide some
methods which you can call from the from
the f xml so if you open this in seen
builder you can see it and just for fun
let's add in the Lyon jug logo ok so the
left side here has all the controls it's
a good way to find out about the JavaFX
controls that are available and we'll
just add the image from desktop desktop
there
so you can see it's pretty quick too and
will create a little guy which will spin
this spinning all right so there's our
thing and seen builder now it's updated
the xml file so if we look at this again
you can see now it has well an image
hero to the file which we have on our
desktop obviously you probably would
want to do a better job with making this
in your code rather than a relative path
up to your desktop but it should run now
and look right the only showed
so how's our house our online stream
doing anybody talking about us there's
about a few experts Oh Jim Jim's talking
okay so my guess as to why this isn't
working as a funky relative path because
um the path location is different from
the code directory and from where you
run it and it was just doing dot dots
all the way up the tree which is not a
good idea so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to UM fix this let's see so just
for just to make it work let's do was it
users I think that's the right path
oh not the right now you're almost not
the enfili shit ah alright maybe we just
do it the right way where's our logo
take that and put it inside of our
project director Leon joke alright so
really what you want is you probably
want to let it as a resource from a
relative path like this all right and
then we can just do that now let's try
it again
okay there we go all right and then we
have a button here which it just print
something out now so let's make it spin
the logo quickly and i'll show you
javafx animations all right so leone
joke main application oh this I should
have showed this so that's a javafx
application it's not very interesting
you just extend the application class
implement the main method and call
launch and then in the launch method you
actually build up your scene graph but
in this case we're loading from FX ml so
it's kind of boilerplate you just called
the FX ml loader static routines all
right but anyway the controller's a
little more interesting so the
controller this is what we did before
but that's boring what we want to do is
grab the logo image view is the visual
representation of an image and Java fix
and let's spend him using a rotation
rotate transition maybe all right we're
gonna use a builder builders are kind of
like um has anyone used groovy before
groovy builders same idea but it lets
you chain message together so you can
use standard constructors and setters
what builders are a little bit nicer
sometimes so we'll spin him how many
times maybe five times and how long
should we make it take
no that's really slow five seconds
and we had to apply this to the node so
tell it which noted applies to logo and
the last thing you do is call builds
this returns a rotation transition which
is the type of the Builder and then
we're going to immediately play the
animation okay the last thing is we we
are referring to logo but we haven't
actually fixed the ID so the way you can
do ideas as you can go to seem older and
do it here and you see it integrates
with netbeans so it picks up the ID or
you can go in the code and do directly
there as well but all it added to the
code was this FX ID colon equals logo so
pretty simple all right let's run them
again
you
alright anything alright so it's really
easy single there's a nice way to
bootstrap and get developed get
developing quickly but you can do all
this from straight Java code while you
don't need to you seen builder alright
so a little bit more about deploying
javafx applications so if you're
familiar with swing or WT or eclipse
closest framework j faces you basically
be probably be deploying as an applet or
web start and app applets art goodish I
mean they they get you in the browser
but the end user has to have the right
version of Java installed AFF Java 7
they have to have the right plug in and
if they don't have both of those you can
try to redirect them and tell them to
download or install the right thing but
it doesn't always work maybe they have a
good crop to version of Java or maybe
there's another problem with our local
machine he has a fit enough of Britain
season this it works on of it hey work
z-man hitam deserve it yeah but you can
reenact boy so it's not that's what I'm
saying is there's um anyway so yeah good
so web starts better because it gets rid
of one requirement you don't eat the
plugin and usually webstart works on
those people's computers if they have
like a fairly modern java version it'll
ask them it'll either ask them Willy
their launch or it'll ask them to
upgrade their version of Java if they
don't have the version they need to
launch your application so that
generally works but if you've done a lot
of client development you know Web Start
has its own boards and issues okay so
then the best option is actually to use
the new packaging support and the
packaging support is really nice the the
new NetBeans beta has support for this
like it's seven
and basically all you do is it spits out
an executable for your platform so if
you're on Mac it'll give you a dmg file
if you're on Windows it gives you an exe
on Linux it gives you a package and
there's no requirement to have Java
installed it bundles Java with your
application so this is probably the best
option for distributing applications to
folks because it gets rid of the
requirement for them to even have java
on their computers to them it just looks
like any other native application okay
so that's how you deploy javafx
applications oh and there's also one app
in the App Store have you guys do Mac
users have this yet not yet so ensemble
is the first Mac application that's been
deployed to the App Store and you can
actually um all right some running
ensemble it's a good way to test out
javafx and i actually downloaded this
off the app store let's go ahead so if
you if you if you go online now and you
search for it you can actually download
it you can rate it only 10 ratings we
need to art so you guys all have
homework if you have a Mac or you know a
friend as a Mac tell them to rate
ensemble and bump up the number for
fricking this week a half well we'll get
we'll get a big spike for France and the
number of ratings but it's a really nice
way to learn about the different javafx
controls all the different charts canvas
is a new element where you can do
immediate mode rendering so particle
systems or other graphics reunions get a
direct access to painting
concurrency a lot of controls tables
trees split pains graphical effects so I
was using animations as well that was
the first category 3d graphics I went
all the javadocs online here so the API
documentation then well it's not working
right now but there go the API
documentation here is actually rendered
in the javafx web view so I mentioned
job effects you can integrate HTML
content so there's a new control where
you can integrate it and you can have
bi-directional communications and you
notice they synced up the UI here with
this and even when you click on
something here it updates the UI about
where you are in the current navigation
when it works which enjoying the disease
which you use ice the question is which
at which engine does it use and it uses
webkit so the webview is based on webkit
they essentially made some modifications
to have it run on top of the JavaFX
runtime and for certain stuff you
actually get better performance in
javafx because it's on a new 3d render
pipeline than you do in a normal browser
so for certain operations I've actually
have benchmarks showing that the JavaFX
webviews faster okay so ensemble app
store I said I promise I talked about
spring so one of the things which i have
a blog series on is using java FEC's
together with the spring framework you
can use it on the back ends as a web
service that your application talks to
you can also use Java EE you can use PHP
Perl
what services rest services yeah
whatever you'd like and you can also use
it on the but with the reason it springs
interesting is I also played around
using on the front end as a dependency
injection engine so I have a example if
I can find it okay there's our leone jug
let's see where do I put this
crow javafx too I think I put in the
media chapter here media so this is all
the source code for the jet pro javafx
book and you can actually read all this
download all this for free online
alright so we have a bunch of video
players let's open a random one video
player one okay so this this shows you
how easy it is to use the javafx media
classes and I have a modified versions
project which uses the spring somewhere
alright we're going to skip this because
let's just let's just go to the bigger
demo because I think that's more
interesting and this actually this one's
on github so I don't have to search my
hard drive
show those this one okay so if you go to
my github account will be using github
tonight for our projects so i'll create
a new repo see we have the alps jug
projects from last night and a bunch of
the guys start uploading the projects
which they did yesterday and will create
a new profile from leon jug here as well
see you guys can upgrade upload stuff
but here's a small javafx spring project
and let me send up to your own social
stream here is the URL for the h autofix
it's all set up via maven so you can
quickly you can quickly set up on your
computers without a lot of work let's
see if i have a checked out already
clone github okay so it looks like i
have it somewhere
javafx spring okay found it alright
let's open this
JavaFX spring
Oh
Oh javafx dash spring here we go okay so
I two projects here one for the client
and one for the server both using spring
framework all right so here is the
server side and basically we've got
service configuration so this is the
configuration for the transaction matter
the database in the cache manager the
actual service so this has all the
methods to get customers by ID for
update customer injuries and the API
which has the rest myth is we're going
to call from javafx so getting a
customer by ID pulling back a list of
customers and also updating customers so
these are all the methods we need to
manipulate the data and the last one is
the actual customer object so this one
of the nice things about using Java on
this client and the server is the same
class we're using here for customer we
can basically copy directly and use on
the client as well so in your model
communication you don't need to have
separate objects for your clients in the
server since it's all java code if you
use another technology which is not java
on either the client or the server then
it means you have to create your own
stub objects on either side okay so
let's start this guy
run and well running a server okay I
guess we need a server servers how about
glassfish glassfish anyone yeah
glassfish now I glassfish there so i
guess i guess they're expecting me to
have to know where class fishes on my
computer all right how about this one
random glassfish instance on my computer
sure
run using this random cluster server is
this is a good test for how good the
tools are because um I'm kind of winging
it so the fact that anything's working
at all is amazing java DB locations
don't set correctly okay but it's still
kind of started I wonder if we actually
got it to start a mile yeah okay it
didn't work as the DB so I guess we
should pick a proper TV location
mm-hmm now I think where's where's my
config might be on the web in okay
here's my web.xml config glassfish web
that XML
looks like it created this file as well
so somewhere in this project I think oh
yeah my DB my DD config for this project
I think I used an embedded database so
shouldnt actually need to go to an
external database so i think it should
be fine so I think the problem is it
might actually be running if we check
the proper euro so let's switch the
client for a sec and then I'll show you
the clients where the client access is
it
alright so here's the same customer
object on the server just with the
annotations removed so exactly the same
class and the client class has a
controller and a model and the model is
what access is the rest so this is the
URL it's going to hit and we can test
this in the browser okay so definitely
not happy
also do
any others
alright just for kicks let's add a
tomcat server as well
I don't want to deal with home cover it
now
right
all right well I can debug this later
let me just let me just check one more
thing before we before we give up on
this example server I think this is
where I did the database convict oh I
think this is
okay so it's it's sets using a vetted h2
database
Oh
alright so I think it's probably an
issue with my glassfish config so I'll
fiddle with that full bit later and see
if I can get up and running alright so
let's skip to this is probably a good
time to switch to hacking so rather than
you guys watching me hack you guys could
do the hacking and then I can I can fix
the example and show it to you part way
through the hacking session so so this
is our Oracle disclaimer so don't don't
make any buying decisions don't don't
don't make any company decisions based
on things I said because I'm not a
product manager alright so how do you
guys want to do the hacking session does
everyone have a laptop for ok and I'll
create a github accounts for you guys to
upload projects to but what project
themes do you want to do so we can do
projects with seen builder might be a
good way to get started maybe make
applications using something related to
the user group and also you can try out
using spring together with javafx
technologies as well and i'll i'll show
you an example and have some have the
code we bout to show for that so anyone
have any project ideas now
windows and eat real right we are trying
to transform the hour our login window
to the same window that with a larger
size so let's close the window but make
it change its size possible okay so you
wanna you wanna have the wagon window
panel to change its size yeah once you
login to be full screen with well not
okay so you to take care about the login
but maybe the interaction are there any
whiteboard markers yeah you must show
the window you know okay alright so if
you guys want to try create like a small
sample project to do that then I can
help you okay and then maybe somebody I
can upload the source code to our are
spinning juggy and then you guys can
extend and enhance that anyone else have
an interesting project they won't try
theft
okay so let me get the example working
and i'll upload the codes to get hub
repo and set that up first here we go
all right now folks online can see the
whole room all right back to the main be
okay Peter's trying to help me out
glassfish look for local host 48 48 52
min thanks Peter
mm-hmm database
Oh context root
yay it's working the context context
route was set incorrectly all right so
let me let me let me swap back
to my desktop all right so let me let me
quickly finish out the example I was
going to show because now it'll actually
work well should work this guy system
scope dependency Wow
phils source
I see it's a maven project so it's so
it's confused about stuff anyway that's
fine so the one thing the one thing we
need to change is the server URL what
was it it was server because the context
root is different
okay three and then I think maven will
build this properly even if
even if not dance is confused
method in it
ballot lifecycle goal I guess runs not
it deploy install oh I remember this is
funky so if you want to run a client
project on Nathan you have to do there's
instructions here compile exec Java so
bhaven havens not the most client
friendly framework all right what's our
next are an exception curd felt execute
exec maven plugin customer app error
exists in the bytecode clean
all right we'll do a clean compile that
should fix it it must have been a
compiled on old version of Java effects
all right so now we got our working
spring application with the login now
fortunately i did this long enough ago i
forgot the logins but we have little
links here to login as an employer
manager okay and there's the login page
which so this is an example of the table
control and you can drag and drop the
columns and I believe as a manager we
can actually edit the data by adding a
new customer so what's with somebody in
the group's name on type your name as a
customer how you spell you face in ag
and all right
and let's let's kill off Andre sorry
Andre oops okay we don't have permission
to delete him so I must have logged in
as an employee not a manager okay all
right now let's let's restart the app
again no compile now just exec so to
restart the app this time we're going to
want it as a manager and we're going to
make sure it persisted oh actually I
think I'm doing an embedded database
okay well it might not persist because
I'm doing embedded database oh it did
okay so yeah I think it persists to a
file yeah so htu embedded database and I
set it to a file so it actually
persisted so it's not in memory that's
good now Andre is dead no exception and
some of the things to highlight about
how this actually works are so we're
using rest easy on the backend for the
web services and then using all those
the beans okay so if you remember on the
back ends we have this with all of these
calls which get called set up all the
rest easy web services for doing updates
and adding customers and deleting
customers and then the front ends
there's a model and then these have
matching methods which invoke the web
service using the rest easy API so add
customer remove and then load which
fetches back a list of customers and the
way security works here as i'm using
spring security so that remove is
secured for the manager role only so if
you try to execute this from the as a
client it'll throw an exception and
catch the exception on uses
usages so I catch the exception and then
if I get an access denied then I show
the error dialog so that's why Tegan our
dialogue if you're actually doing this
in a production application this really
isn't good enough you'd want to catch on
both the you want to check permissions
on both the server and the client the
server because that's actually going to
be secure and the client because that
means you don't have to go out to the
server and you can give immediate
feedback without making a server round
trip and the security permission is in
this project are just temporarily
defines right inside of the spring
configuration which is where's my spring
config
somewhere because you do games yeah at
work where is that I can't see it Oh
down what I said SS you Rayna will
secede oh you know you play client other
sources other sources oh here it is okay
thank you alright so this is the
security context not very secure enough
but you see you can imagine a manager
would have a password like that the
re-up you are the list you actually know
about security in my opinion in my
experience okay and all right let me do
what I said I would do earlier fans take
the Leon jug project and upload it for
you guys before my battery dies okay
they on jug okay we got a github so the
quick github project here
new repo projects what a deal well night
a key initialize the project use Java
ignore file okay so now we have a new
repo repo for the meal chug hacking
oh so Russell is complaining now seen
builder on linux and mona says there is
all right and then Peter was helping me
out with getting this working it looks
like looks like Peter likes the UM the
spring the spring demo I'm going to
interview Peter on the way back through
London Peter pilgrim so you guys can
watch that when him and I hacking in in
London all right and let me clone this
quickly and then submit my stuff they
own jug clone and jug to
okay you going there
ok now we got lots and lots of files no
build noticed
manifest is fine nepean project is fine
but not the private bits and all right
rest of it as an initial project for the
young Chuck
all right ends we have code okay so you
want to give this to try on their
computers and see if they can stick it
down and run this oh yeah so my
computers at six percent so it's it's
going to momentarily died and I you can
see I have like AC plugs there and AC
plugs here and everywhere so I think I'm
no it's not but actually we can use this
I have an adapter and I can borrow your
plug okay there that means we can
survive a little bit longer power with
it was the demo takes an android java
effects on android what yeah okay so so
I think regardless of what your question
really is the answer is I can't tell you
or I can't I can't talk about Android
but what are you trying to what are you
trying to ask you want to know if if
javafx will be movie and we went on
Android alright so um this is you know
obviously not an Oracle official
statement but given we're open sourcing
the whole javafx stack you should ask
the same question to the next Google
person who presents here and say now
that javafx is open source why don't you
support it on Android because I mean it
should be fairly easy i mean the codes
open
I was going to make another comment that
we probably get me in trouble and giving
subpoenas I should say that yeah so yeah
I don't yeah being subpoenaed is not fun
I've I shoulda got allege the guys told
me about their experiences being in
court that's not not very much fun
alright so let me let me ask this about
they for the folks who are online on the
stream so would you would you prefer if
we kept the stream live and you can
continue to kind of watch what we're
doing and and chat online or do you
prefer if i if i end the stream now
since we finished most of the
presentation of the demos and the cool
stuff so this is mostly going to be like
hacking in the room and i know there's a
slight delay on the stream so we'll give
folks a chance to response but let me
know whether you'd like to keep the
stream live or i should just close it
out
to go here
so anyone anyone get the github example
working yes yeah alright cool so what
times what time do we want to and what's
the plan it's aight well 2035 now I
didn't love the night ok I mean I'm I'm
obviously though but dude I'm straight
till the train yeah no time on the
motorbike okay Peter's going to go cook
dinner alright so nobody nobody's
jumping up and down and saying they want
us to keep the stream live so i'm gonna
i'm going to thank everybody for
watching the live stream and if you're
available tomorrow come watch antonio
song house cuz i said i don't come and
the the pass chop user group tomorrow
thanks everyone and wave goodbye to the
all right outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
