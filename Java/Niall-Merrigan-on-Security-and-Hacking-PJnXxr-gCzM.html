the or dev conference my name is Steven
Chen I work for the Oracle technology
Network doing injured live interviews
here all week at or dev and i'm joined
by niall how are you doing now great
it's a just finished a talk here so yeah
so speaking of your talk so I I heard
there's an interesting story about how
you how you became a torrid of speaker
funny should I ask back in Oh dev day
down in Poland I was demonstrating a
couple of different Wi-Fi attacks that
you do and Emily who is one of the major
our organizers here with our dev
happened to log into the art of
corporate database using my Wi-Fi which
meant I got a copy of her username and
password so post my talk I wander up to
this very nice french lady and I hand
over a little post it and she opens this
and she goes with a very French I won't
say ooh la la but she went and it was a
copy of using and password and she goes
well how did you do that and I said it's
in a talk I've done I would love to show
you a tour adapt and she goes okay so if
you're please don't try and hack our dev
if you want to try and get here it's not
recommended but it was made for a very
interesting introduction to the to the
conference for them yeah now that's not
a great that's a great story to start
your talk as well I'm sure I did it I
when I was doing the security day
yesterday I said that was how I let off
and let people know that this is that
simple and this is what you can do with
it so so I think one of the interesting
things we were chatting a bit i think
one of the interesting things for
especially software developer types no
understand is just how vulnerable they
are to security tax in their home in
their workplace yeah it's it's like
we've seen lately there's the huge
amount of breaches I've been going back
and forth like the most kind of
high-profile in the latest in a lot in
kind of latest memory would be the
Ashley Madison case where a lot of very
personal data was laying late or leaks
out of the web causing a lot of personal
pain even though the developers had done
some work with the be crafting of
passwords and done that bit right the
problem was the other confidential
information
was leaks and this we we forget
sometimes as developers how much
information we control and it may not be
just our software that's at risk it
could be our infrastructure it could be
some small little door that's open and
then all of a sudden people are let in
it takes very little to elevate you from
very having this very little access to
God and in a couple of minutes yeah we
mostly hear about the cases where people
realize that there was a security breach
fish in place but lots of different
security tax don't even make it easy to
find out that you've been breached well
yeah you know that everyone's been there
and saying oh you know if I find a
sequel injection attack which is this
still the number one type of attack on
the web right now that they say well
we're going to drop the tables that
makes no sense to an attacker because
the reason is your data costs money and
it's come in made money so once I have
this information i can sell it so why
would you bother deleting this stuff
unless you're just doing it to so that
no one else will have it but most people
try and maintain access because then
they can leverage the company use it for
blackmail or cellular data to other
people with more nefarious how to choose
towards life cool so you also you have
some devices here as well always i have
got me show off and yeah this this is
the one the little here this is a Wi-Fi
pineapple it's a hundred-dollar rogue
access point and this is what we caught
emily with so what this does is you can
plug it in it's got a little internet
port here power and USB and these two
antennas what they do is they broadcast
a are they accept all SSID requests
traditionally how your your home reader
works is you will send out a request for
your home reuters name and it will say
I'm that reader you can connect to me
your devices will do the handshake but
when you have open networks there's no
handshake to happen now what this device
does is if your device will say okay is
airport network here and it will say yes
and in your device will connect because
it's looking for Wi-Fi yep and again
tell the difference in this and your
home network or the airport never
because they're all both open because
the way Wi-Fi works is you can have
multiple net
points all broadcast in the same SSID
and then your device will connect them
because it thinks it's a larger network
on the other side we've got thing that
what it called dogma the newer devices
don't broadcast what they're looking for
they wait for you to broadcast to them
so what we do is we harvest all the
ascites that we know and start
broadcasting them back out in hoping to
attract you to come in now there are
different ways of getting all this
information you can go to wiggle net
download a list of the top 1000 SIDS or
as I demonstrate to a lot of my talks is
when I first landed in an airport I open
up my phone I check what the airport
Wi-Fi is there's the most common Wi-Fi
points in the general area because
people will be going in and out and
those who are landing from foreign
places will generally want to pick up
their their email or anything like that
first once they have that open airport
and everywhere hooked in then don't find
this yeah and we went back to you and
once I have you I'm your man in the
middle here so I can snip your data I
can change it in flight or I can just
block you or not I just annoy you so we
as a demo today we turn this on just
when it's down here and like as we were
passing by you know you get 20 people 30
people devices just quickly hopping on
and even though the broadband is layer
sorry the Wi-Fi code is praised all over
the walls yeah they're worse people's
devices we're still connecting to this
nice it's for a hundred dollars is letha
and if you look at the size of it it's
about the size of two packs of
cigarettes you can leave this under a
desk and yeah so you also have a battery
for this you know I have a battery pack
so that like if you look on side by side
there you know you leave this stuck
under you can put it in a backpack
anybody right down beside your desk or
whatever yeah those people wouldn't even
identify what that was no the black it's
a black box Fox yeah it's just a black
box it is very easy to do it and like
when I when I show this off and just
people get so kind of terrified as to
what we can actually do it and I'm using
the small little aerials yeah I've got
boosters for this and I've got like
large Orioles for more range so you
don't know where you're being caught
from so if you want to take any away
from this don't have your devices
automatically connect to open networks
in on the iphone i think it's
automatically turn off
uh are asked me before getting into a
network so that's the kind of one thing
I tell people not to do are to do make
sure that your device always request
yeah because it's kind of like the old
kind of public safety announcement you
know where your children are it's 9pm
you know just you know what your phone
is connecting to so that's how it goes
so if a couple of other things though I
Weber on the network thing I'll show you
this one and this is the land tap or
what's known as a throwing star land tab
pro yeah so why is it why is it called a
throwing star because the original
edition this came on a throwing star
that was shaped circuit board and you
had to celebrate yourself together but
this is the pro edition meaning it's
nicely put in a box and what this does
is you put your Ethernet in here your
other agents in here and that passes
through and then we can read data out
and it doesn't inject frames into the
network stream which means you can't be
detected so where you put this is behind
printers because you'll be able to pull
corporate documents off it because as
they're being sent to the printer you
pull it out nice yeah and it's the thing
the only only way to find these things
is they downgrade the network to a
hundred mix from one gigabit but yeah
it's it's not obvious pretty that's
pretty difficult and I bet you could
design a gigabit version of this yes of
course and that's the thing and this is
like a ten dollars yeah and if you're on
you know it's so subtle you put it like
because it's on this end it's completely
black you put it you put it behind a
tape it up yeah and then I'm to him I
leave and leave a sticker required by IT
department and I'm serious people will
ignore it and this is one honey and I
want to kind of emphasize it is actually
not simple but so what would you what
would you hook up to this to
automatically documents off like you
could do that you can plug them together
in a track or you could actually connect
to this remotely yes and I'm holding is
off of that from the printer yeah or use
a raspberry pi or do anything you want
fall ARM processors yes I just uses
reverse shell or you know you can use
some of like Pony Express or other you
can use and believe it or not there are
phones that are hooked up and can use it
for this so you can imagine finding a
phone attached to this and then all the
at that stage you start seeing the
Mission Impossible logo and you go right
back and out don't want to do it so it's
a very these are too kind of simple
Wi-Fi devices that you can use so yeah
but I mean especially in a conference
setting the the Wi-Fi one would be very
easy to pick up a lot of different
signals and minute we demo we demo this
at a clients and what we did was we
didn't tell them what was going to
happen we just said we're going to demo
some Wi-Fi attacks to you we're going to
demo some other things and so what we
did was we walked in we put this on the
table in front of them said nothing and
everyone just connected to the laptop
nothing more everyone ignored it thought
it was just a little reader and then we
asked them to open up their phones yeah
on iPads and we had everyone in the room
we had everyone in the room all their
internet access was coming through us
nice I know and what we did was we every
time they try to get to a page if we had
changed the dns they would say this is
not the page you're looking for you know
are you sure this is where you're
supposed to go on people just like yes
and yeah I go yes okay we are concerned
typing in their passwords into random
web page yes it well I make a joke you
know the easiest way to get someone's
password is asked for them I mean and or
give them offer than the internet when
they really wanted and say can you put
in your Facebook password here and
they'll do it you know it's really
trivial I think a lot of people are
conditioned to bypass those dialogues
because when you connect to like Hotel
network or hmm what they'll do is
they'll um it'll inject their own pages
for authentication which then throws in
a series of um missed misconfigurations
on all your web pages and other things
are all asking are you sure you want to
connect it's a the terminology is known
as a captive portal and it's used by
luckys a hotel's coffee shops and we
most find it when all of a sudden this
dialog pops up saying your securities
out a date or something and then you
load an insecure page title expert in
general folks are conditioned just to
click through it now yeah rather than
actually paying attention to the
security warning oh the you would be so
surprised when
like as you say people are conditioned
because they will donate their password
if you ask them to put in what looks
like a relatively nice looking page and
we'll put in their username and password
and you copy it enough you go because
that's why I'm very worried when I when
they ask me to like our page to get
access to the Internet sorry but if you
if you are worried about that type of
attack enable two-factor authentication
on all your devices because if it anyone
are all these accounts see if anyone
tries to log in using this using your
account details they will then you will
be given a SMS and you'll know you'll
potentially be breached he'll also don't
use the same password for the same for
multiple services using some sort of
password manager where you can pass one
password LastPass whatever suits your
actual needs but don't use the same
because cross-pollination is a very
large yeah so once i get one of your
passwords are gonna try it in your bank
account they're gonna try near corporate
network yeah if you use it in multiple
places then even if what they breached
was maybe like a relatively Bob's flower
shop yeah they get an email apart the
energy healer Facebook bound him and
then once you get access to gmail
probably you can mine for other
passwords and other confidential well
yeah that's a really good point because
the mat Honan hack yeah which is a hack
that was a social engineering hacked on
backwards what they did was they got the
at Matt account on Twitter and they
hacked his account by first hacking his
hacking amazon so what they did is they
ranked amazon said we want to put a new
card on they put the new card on next
date is had we forgot our amazon
password okay they said oh okay well can
you give me the last four digits of a
credit card on your account which they
had just had it so they got that they
log in they see the last four digits of
the first credit card which itunes
require to allow you to log in so they
logged into his itunes account then
which was a secondary account for his
gmail account so they reset his gmail
password and then they reset his twitter
password because they had access to
gmail that's how they got in they did
for step one single mistake because as
matt put it the four digits that protect
my itunes account were the four digits
that amazon allow
to show in plain text and that is where
multiple security failures and they
knock on and it's considered one of the
kind of most is a cross-pollination or
what examples of a hack done yeah that's
fairly clever to figure out how
different services require different
security or expose different bits of
personal information you can piece them
together and a little will like a little
Rube Goldberg machine in sure that's a
really good a really good way of showing
it but what what I think what the major
factor here was that they had a single
problem to solve yeah they had to try
and get the admin account so what they
did is they went well I want to reset
the password where is that I look and it
goes it goes to gmail so then I say okay
if I try and reset your gmail account it
goes to me calm so I now need to break
into itunes and if I want to break into
itunes what information do I need I need
this Amazon are needed for dujour HSN
Greta carpet any find that and that was
how they did it so that was that this is
the other problem to developers face
which is the biggest security issue they
face they define a security perimeter
around the tanker only has to defeat
that so if you're trying to define and
you're trying to go what happens if this
what happens if this the hacker is only
just going well I've only got to beat
this single piece and I'm in and then if
I get to another problem I have another
problem to fix and I have a different
tool for that so that is the absolute
why it is so difficult to write secure
software or security perimeters around
your software because you've got to
think in so many different ways to do
about it and that's why you should be
using the offense of tools that be that
hackers use against your systems to say
that SS heroes system CD like almost
white hack white white hat hackers to
yeah and I know some software testing
our audience is not familiar with the
term white hat black hat and gray hat
white had a day hack for good black hat
maliciously and gray had shoes on the
day so it is a I i I've been suggesting
one of my talks here at heard of was how
to use offensive tools in the defensive
manner and if you can add this into your
build steps it's a really good way to
even just give evidence that there is a
problem yeah ok so now I can I getting
out of my employer and say I have a
business justification well three get up
here and there is a good use for those
as well they've they're a fantastic
portable access point where you're at
when you're out of hotel see yeah yeah
you know if you need it they're good you
know call and I think I think you had
one last Oh a couple their device I've
to I have two other ones one is this is
the USB key logger it's very small as
you can see it's about the length of my
pinky this is very dangerous you plug
this in the back it records all your
keystrokes I did this one of my
colleagues and I showed him how to did
it because what we did was we install
the second mouse behind his keyboard
yeah you know the typical april fools
day and we just a wireless mouse weed
with jiggle his nose and he got really
upset and was trying to figure out
what's going on it's okay i got this and
i went behind his keyboard did a quick
switch plug this in walked away and i
took shorten the little receiver he was
like that's good came back after lunch
he logged in to things I when he went to
the bathroom I quickly unplugged
everything put it back and I'm a nice
night I have another post no but his
password and his face went how did you
do that that's clever you actually got
it in and out undetected yes but it's
it's it's a pure social engineering you
look like you're supposed to be there
you're doing someone a favor the first
time round you pulled a joke there
that's all we're expecting to see and
you just did the quick flick and this
you're using this with a wireless
keyboard so you plug the wireless dongle
yeah wireless dongle will plug in and
then it because this acts as a
pass-through yeah they there's a special
key combination when you press it well
then show it up as a disk drive another
when you have that in and you can call
it you can copy all the past it's awful
and it shows all the spelling mistakes
he made and etc so it was a it was a
good joke he appreciated it and saw it
nice and then finally I've got what are
two standard issue USB keys or tomorrow
most people they are pretty plain
vanilla but yeah but I assume you're you
don't have to you have two of them for a
reason I have two of them reason because
I boat look the same this one is a USB
device standard for gig USB 2 yeah okay
you get this a lot of conference you get
this off little piece this one is a
keyboard
yep it is what is known as a rubber
ducky and because if it looks like a
duck and quacks like a duck it's
probably a duck but in this case it
ain't what what's inside here is a small
micro processor with 128 megs of flash
memory and it identified itself to
windows or any device as a keyboard and
then starts typing ah so you rise ducky
script which is just a very quick like
scripting language to allow you to type
7,000 keystrokes as a minute and you can
for example get it to download something
off the web wrong things and it'll just
you can it'll for example open up the
windows notepad down bring it down to
the screen start typing some PowerShell
execute that in PowerShell and then to
stop and then disappear and do this in
less than a couple of seconds Wow and
what happens is your you put this on a
ladies in the car park as a red team mr.
tactic and people will plug it in it
will do something they'll go I don't
know what happens it'll install an ftp
service install this page or it'll try
and download some yeah so it's like a
portable virus gateway it's a portable
kind of very tight fast typer and but it
but it's it's like it's 20 bucks yeah
for this and it's exceptionally like as
you can think if you hold both of these
the only difference is actually the
weight you'll feel that's a little bit
lighter well that's an easy problem to
solve too yeah that's it does nothing
but that's that's all it is and they are
that there are another tactic to get in
and they are all Hanko you so in that
case probably the the common scenario
would be to get somebody to put it into
their computer no or would it be more
common to try to normally what we do we
suggest is disabled USB on USB drives on
all workstations if you don't need them
sneakernet is not a good way of doing
things but if you have to have it have a
kind of sanitation machine either a
machine that's often at work does
something you plug it in and something
breaks it doesn't matter you can what
torch it should you should it's off sec
but the thing is people are curious they
want to return devices to people excited
that's what happens it's I I try not to
sound like we should all be very
paranoid we should
be nice trusting but there are things if
it looks a bit odd if it looks too good
to be true you know we had our old adage
on the Internet if it sounds too good to
be true is probably not true and it was
definitely on the internet you know yep
yep and these are all good examples of
things which aren't too good to be true
I know like all the networks yeah the
wire be drives and their finalist is
there's another last one which I haven't
got with me it says known as the evil
USB when you plug it in it sends a
voltage down your card on nukes the
board Wow it loads from the USB it loads
BSB to takes all the voltages as a
voltage from your computer till time-
masseter and boom wipes yep it's a
destructive tool it's now that is we're
very much into James Bond
double-oh-seven I don't know this stage
for that yeah so alright so I really
appreciate the short interview niall
thank you very much very enlightening
ends because you showed up on our live
streaming you actually you have to
deserve this more than anyone else this
is the the night hacker program awesome
so you get one of the exclusive laptop
stickers that's awesome i actually would
this will be the first job of sticker on
a very microsoft guy hi please don't
fire me thanks guys all right call
thanks a lot and i hope you have a safe
flight back thanks man appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
