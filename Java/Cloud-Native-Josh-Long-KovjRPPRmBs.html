Elise works when we were to figure out
so welcome back to a night hiking live
stream from a dark 2015 I'm sorry Alice
and I'm here with Josh long and we want
to talk about cloud native bow ties love
native bow ties maybe best kind yeah
best kind of the hip kai the J hip blue
tie jetblue bow ties like Oh getting
already like a nod my tongue so yeah but
blue boat I say like 20 times no I can't
about okay to j hipster right yeah j hip
ster yeah this is matt rables bow tie so
he gave it to you know i hit a hitter
he's highly available so he had a second
well he's a highly available bow tie ah
ok yeah to two instances right exactly
so I'm using his is this like a micro
service bow tie so like a very fast
delivery yeah well it's it achieves
results people like i normally am I wear
that spring t-shirt yeah and then people
say oh there's a guy with the Sphinx
here but you get an entirely different
set of attention it's entirely different
kind of attention when you're wearing a
blue bow tie yeah I think I'm gonna do
this more often I if I'd only known how
cool this list I think you will be get
known then as the man with the blue bow
tie like no that's when we now is the
the guys with the Brazilian flag and
yeah Stewart is the man with the left
code and but Bruno Bruno's heisel I I
didn't recognize him when I saw him
without the Cape without leave without
the flag yeah that's a house like all
with you oh so I was I saw in Brazil was
like hey who are you eat depth talk to
me like like he knew me I was like oh
green flag I yeah okay hi I love that
guy I know that we have people in this
community that I like him you know I
love it it's good and that's why we're
I've been spending all my time talking
to the people here especially asked me
that about to ask you about talks yes
because you're here for the hallway trek
yeah basically yeah it's all the great
content in between the talks you know
ever or sometimes during but only during
a select few of course yes because every
one of them is epically already met a
lot of interesting people yeah
and and it's just all diamonds all about
people we already know right i mean you
know how this thing is it's you go to
del x and you you think i'm gonna learn
this isn't isn't this and of course your
entire network of friends and families
here you know so there's mark hazel a
hero and a good friend yeah if you make
a plan and you just like out the window
I just screw this it's not gonna happen
yeah yeah and thankfully the videos are
online yeah so there's no that's why
people you know the content is online
and there's lots of good content online
but there's a value to being in the same
room with all these amazing people right
that's what I love about something like
a box it just pays for itself ok you can
watch the videos later online so yeah
every talk is at YouTube like like hours
after us finish here so it should be
really really good and that's what I
love I love optimizing for that too if
you know your talks can be recorded me I
I tend to go and do live code I do it
pretty quickly yeah I run through a lot
of concepts they can always go back if
they need to but I'd much rather they
lose them with concepts and with code
and like you know they'll get it they
can understand the rough picture and
then they can go back to the details
yeah because you know it's recorded and
that's a you can deliver better so your
actual special pet project technique
technology whatever is like
microservices yeah I will so I give a
talk on a it's called the beautiful
micro service and it's and it's this
idea that we have all these users
developing developing applications and
they're moving to this micro service
model and a lot of people talk about
this sort of these are red herrings they
say oh I went to micro services because
it's better for runtime scale well yeah
but don't do that that's not the first
reason to go to microservices most
people are gonna hit well you know
there's a there's some benefits of some
tangential benefits to micro services
but most people are not going to hit
those benefits first they're going to
hit the I have a project that's too big
to be able to deliver small batches of
changes into production yeah the agility
if bottleneck and that's going to hit
them long before the run time scale it
problem hits them you know you'd have to
get to pretty big scale to need to have
that functional decomposition right so
yeah you get get more protiviti from
development cycles yeah
smaller services smaller bits and pieces
though more predictable random continues
delivery I don't want to wait for huge
stabilization periods so I give this
talk about okay you've decided you want
to go faster uh and then what falls
naturally from that is ok you want to
move to Microsoft's mahler batches right
yeah and unless undifferentiated heavy
lifting right if you want if you're
gonna do it you want to automate as much
as possible so that you don't have this
20-page wiki yeah document showing you
what you need to do to set up a new
service you know you know you know that
is a I know go to organizations it's
like oh how do I build a new service go
to sharepoint and follow this 50 page
you'll be done next week and I was like
oh it's scared it dis incentivizes
people to move you know yeah so spring
cloud is a codification of all the
patterns that you're going to need to be
able to solve this distributed systems
problem that you've invited into your
world are doing microservices and yeah
it's a little bit more painful but the
benefit is agility and so I wanted to
show people okay well here's how you do
that here's how actually companies like
Netflix are doing it right they you yeah
spring cloud right and they know they
have the R&amp;amp;D budget the brains and the
end they had the time to build most of
this stuff and they still use spring
cloud because it easier and more
conization growth of the bill benefits
right yeah i'm at development on
benefits right it's the companies like
Netflix it's not like they don't have
the money it's just they're trying to
they're trying to get go faster you know
yeah period time is more valuable than
money yeah yeah uh so yeah it's been
that was fun i'm interesting i think
spring is gonna be pretty big one day
I've got a feeling you know I am growing
scoring yeah just watch the spaceman
I've seen you love other people giving
talks on on this spring boot thing yeah
you know yes yes it's like a slug
vibrant picking up speed again so well
yeah yeah it's gonna be the big like the
competition between E and Springer first
like getting everyone further I don't
know if what that we don't have a
conversation between spring and IV I
don't even think about that see that the
thing that I've loved about what's
happened in the last several years is
that we've all sort of converged on this
this spring booth thing right yeah and
there's been this sort of amazing grass
roots community effort
to sort of move it forward so one of my
one of my heroes and good friends isn't
a guy named Guertin who of course brooks
on the netbeans right and so one of the
cool things that out there is like
there's a plugin for netbeans you know
that lets you do the auto completion on
metadata for properties you don't you
know strictly speaking you don't need it
but it's one of the nice things that
ninety you can plug in yeah and there's
a common runtime spi that spring who
provides but it's in netbeans and it was
there for like a year already it works
in our Eclipse distribution called
spring tools of it which is open source
and it worked in IntelliJ the
professional version yeah but was in
netbeans almost a year ago more than
here you go I mean that's just so that I
think is sort of the the interesting
thing about this it's been I did a talk
at Oracle I did I talked with Oracle's
ANBU note the other Bruno borges brew
brothers yeah great guy as well nope man
yeah we did a yeah his dog determinate
the dog yeah I love that dog that is the
coolest little creature oh what a
beautiful soul that dog is but anyway we
did a talk at javaone on clout you know
building apps for the cloud and of
course his was his the it was cloud
springwood apps or something that
building springwood apps for the cloud
yeah and it was like okay I did the
introduction to spring boot and he was
the one who sponsored the talk he wanted
to have he invited me ok to do a spring
boot talk right and he wanted to do
spring boot on Oracle cloud and of
course I did Clara foundry you know but
uh well that's fine right but the way we
both seem there's a value there you know
the whole room every of there was using
a spring boot yeah so it's gonna be big
just have to give it some more time more
boat more bowtie smuggle toys more cloud
native amo boaters will solve the
problem there's a problem just it's just
at this point it's about actually I some
of the things I've been doing one of the
things that has been so great about this
uh there is I see Bruno one of the
things that's been great about this uh
this adventure is just to having the
time to sit there and integrate you know
write code with other people that you've
got these like ideas of these threads
their spawning different Twitter
conversations or whatever it's like hey
you want to sit together and let's knock
out a pull request you know and you get
this great i love that you can just see
here the hacker garden is the coolest
thing ever you know oh you you get
things
in the garden well I did my own hat
gardens all over the place actually I've
been it quick the burger joint next door
to the theater here because they have
good Wi-Fi and it's quiet type just say
come to my office and we'll work you
know I love it you can't do that yeah on
you know your own we're all busy but
it's very hard to say no to somebody if
you've allocated a time to sit there and
be directive if you get them
face-to-face and that's now yeah let's
do it and they wanted to as well you
know it's just the time present
themselves you know yeah so it's been
good I love you for joining the
conference Oh always this is my i'm

it'll be epic here what about you how
you enjoying the show very much so it's
really great pleasure to be here as
always so I'm coming here for like a I

it's like it feels like forever somehow
yes so I know I still like the the the
community and it's the vibes going on
here it's like it's so energetic he's
entertaining yes better than coffee and
I don't say that lightly I don't say it
lightly step 7 the aforementioned Stefan
the different GV de box in the open box
yeah yeah yeah he gave me the t-shirt
from the Java plus days yeah that's nice
it's like grabbing it like a yeah that's
super cool electable it is a collectible
I don't have I live in San Francisco so
I have a home that's about mmm a little
bit a little bit bigger in this water
