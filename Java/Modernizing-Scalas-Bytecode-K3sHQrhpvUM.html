first JVM language summit I've been
watching virtually for a number of years
and that's good to be here and enjoy it
in person and also be talking about
using some of the product of all that
work that have been watching for the
last couple years you know work on the
Scala compiler I'm from light Bend so is
Adrienne over there where on the
compiler team so today we'd be talking a
little bit about the upcoming release of
scholar to dot 12 what the themes of
that release are what the new features
are for an improvement software our
users and for ourselves as implementers
we're then going to drill into a couple
aspects of that how the encoding of
scarlet rates has improved because of
the use of Java rate features how we've
been able to use invoke dynamic in our
implementation and expose that also to
our users to experiment with and finally
how our lamber encoding looks now I'm
happy to take any questions as we go as
well so if something's needs explaining
on the scholar side of things or
anything please feel free to shout out
so the main purpose of scholar 212 is to
upgrade our platform which is to drop
support for java 6 in Java 7 and require
Java 8 the reason that we've done it in
this way rather than just offering
targets for 6 in the target / 8 is some
sort of tied up with the binary
compatibility story of scholar a little
bit a major releases are not binary
compatible with previous major releases
so the open source ecosystem kind of
regenerates itself each skull and major
release these things happen about every
two years because of that we didn't want
to introduce an extra fragmentation
point where the open source authors had
to produce versions 46 and 48 that one
fragmentation point of the scholar major
version
we thought was enough and you know based
on the adoption rate that we've seen and
that you guys have seen for Java right
we think that the time is right for this
upgrade after doing so we're able to
exploit the new features in the JVM and
we can improve interrupting ways that
people will expect now that they're used
to Java rate itself and the API is that
are produced in the Java standard
library and by other authors who are
targeting jar buried aside from that
platform upgrade we've also been doing
some internal renovations cleaning up
some technical debt so we've brought
online and you code generator in the
back end which has a new implementation
of our ahead of time optimizer non goals
have been sweeping language changes and
features and also sweeping library
changes it's been our goal to make the
transition from scholar 211 to 212 as
seamless as possible given that some
people may need to still be supporting
scholar 211 for some time when they
restricted to all the java versions for
one reason or another so let's dive into
traits so a quick description of what
traits are in scholar so just like in
java a scholar class may extend only one
class and but it can extend many traits
a trait may contain injury and scholar
anything that a class can so in addition
to abstract and concrete method
definitions that can contain
initialization statements properties it
could contain method bodies before the
equivalent was allowed in Java itself
traits that can't have constructor
parameters that's sort of the main
distinction between the trait in a and a
class so in 211 compilation of a trait
gave rise some trait t gave rise to an
interface t this included abstract
accesses for any fields which were
required by the trait but can't be
implemented in the trade obviously it
can give rise to
a class t dollar class known as the
trade implementation class this
contained the method bodies that was the
only place we could put them prior to
Java rate and they were static methods
within the implicate implementation
class the first actual class that
inherited from the trait was required to
implement the abstract interface methods
in this trait by forwarding to those
static methods in the implementation
class furthermore they had to provide
any storage that was required so fields
in the the concrete excesses that so
that the generic code up in the trade
itself can access those properties of
the trade so just a quick view of how
that looks here said here's a trait with
a concrete method and a mutable proper
TV and that's compiled to this interface
the train implementation class and this
for every sub class that implements it
it does the additional work to provide
the field and the excesses for the field
and provide the implementation of food
which forwards to the corresponding
method in the trait implementation class
so in Java right obviously we're allowed
to put method bodies in interfaces so we
wanted to take advantage of this to
clean up this sort of crafty encoding
the field and coatings unchanged because
we don't have any new capabilities
around around that from the platform but
we said Lou let's leave the trait method
bodies where it stands in the interface
in the same way that Java default
methods are encoded the trait
constructor can also stay in the
interface as a static method so that
drops the need for the trait
implementation class and furthermore
it'll be nice if we can I meet the need
to write this little forward a method in
the every subclass of the trade
so in the happy case that works pretty
well we just have a trait I've left the
the properties out of the example this
time because they're unchanged you know
we emit an interface we leave the method
where it is and the class does nothing
unfortunately that's not always going to
work for us because scholar traits can
extend Java classes so in this example
here we have a trait T which extends c
and overrides a method from see now this
is this is a fiction that the JVM knows
nothing about because a the interface t
obviously is only on the vm so if we
just took this naive approach to to our
encoding this deed foo is going to call
the wrong method because virtual
dispatch in the JVM is going to look up
look up the superclass chain first
before it constructed any defaults it
doesn't know that from the scholar the
scott scholars linearization of the
super types that the trait proceeds the
the Clark the trait team precedes the
Class C and thus the method in see the
method in the trait t should be
preferred according to scholars rules so
what do we do well we can just go back
to our old trick of adding forwarded to
any such class so Class D here we can
detect that the JVM rules differ from
scholars rules ok we'll have to add the
class in what we chosen to do is only
add this in the case where there's a
disagreement so it's sort of not the
common case that that traits are
extending classes and it's unfortunately
it's common enough that it's not
something that we think we can sort of
deprecated or remove from the language
itself you might see that this is also a
new binary compatibility so where we've
statically made this this choice you
know the world can change due to
separate compilation in general the
encoding of traits is very fragile from
a binary compatibility point of view
now changes here in Scala 212 help in a
couple use cases but the overall case
means that changes to a trait typically
requires recompilation of job changes
two subclasses that mix in that trade so
in this trait folder we just saw we have
two to forward to a particular
implementation of food you know super
interface so how do we go about that
well we could use the same mechanism
were using in super causing classes to
call a method and apparent then use
invoke special and that's sort of the
path that we started down first problem
is that in fact special only allows you
to call a particular named parent of the
current class trade forwarders need the
flexibility to call an arbitrary
ancestor this is sort of a Java language
restriction which you can argue is
leaked into the JVM spec but it's there
so we have to live with it so what can
we do well sledgehammer approach here is
why don't we just add redundant parents
even though the user only extended T and
T extended you in the bytecode we can
just say that that their class extends
tea and you and then for implements tea
and you and that gives us access to any
any ancestor to target these super calls
so yeah the parent of my parent is my
parent my first attempt that this was a
just fairly quick the big sledgehammer I
said well let's just name all transitive
ancestors as as parents of every class
and see what happens what could possibly
go wrong startup time just ballooned it
was a bit bit of a surprise I can see
where it was happening eventually I got
a low enough level till sorry you might
be able to read that but this is in the
the class file parser in the the vm
filling in the V tables of looking at
the the same super interfaces over and
over and over again as it's going up up
the chain it's clear that that idea was
a non-starter there's a variation on the
theme though where we where we do this
conditionally just for cases where we
actually need that ability to target
something neither of those is a solution
that we've we've settled on them for
reasons that would we'll get into now so
in addition to these super calls that
the compiler has to synthesize to
maintain scholars view on videos ation
the user is of just like in in Java
allowed to write super calls explicitly
typicals in classes and scholar followed
the same language restrictions as those
in in Java you can only call your
director can only call super and meaning
your direct parent class however in you
are allowed to took all arbitrary trait
parents because in the past in 211 these
were just static methods so you know our
language could could bind to any of them
without restrictions from the JVM so
that's sort of i think the history of
that permissiveness allows some sort of
an irregularity in the language between
super cool street classes and super
calls through through parent of ancestor
traits
okay so you know here's the basic idea
they eat the user can in trait you call
super to your foo and we'll compile that
into a superfood meaning in an invoke
special now it's a bug in the compiler
that should be in the minus then so what
we found though is some a little bit
late in the game that invoke special
actually doesn't want it doesn't do what
we wanted to do even for invoked special
that we're using in in scarlet 11 we
discovered a bug where we do come into a
mismatch between AB you and dispatching
the VMS so here's a quick example of
that again we've got a case where a
trait is extending a class which tends
to be where we run into these corner
cases the trade t is extending a class C
is extending B and T and B also extends
a and it's got scholars linearization
rules mean that the order that you have
yours your parents is significant that
the last one wins so here
we're trying to implement this call to
super of tea with invoke special what
we're trying to get a call to is method
a right because that's the super that's
the the binding that we see of method M
as seen from trait t but what actually
happens in the vm is we get be because
in folk special is actually doing a
virtual dispatch you know too bad for us
we didn't look at that carefully enough
back in the day but so that's a latent
bug that we've got in the compiler so
we've got this tool i know our super
calls are encoded wrong and great
specials not quite the right thing for
it what can we do so we looked into
using indeed because you know we can do
that now we could call exactly the
method that we want by reflecting on it
you know in a bootstrap method using
unruh flexpay all the problem is this
requires elevated permissions we're
trying to admit this in the subclass but
we need the permissions of the class
that we're naming as as the target of
this super call so without sort of set
accessible and look up trusted we can't
do this what we've settled on is the old
approach of just adding static accessor
methods unfortunately we need to do this
for every non private method in a trait
because when we can pilot rate we don't
know who's going to call super from
below obviously we don't have the power
to add those retrospectively to
third-party java classes or third-party
jabber interfaith fit by java classes
that are coming from either classes or
interfaces so the plan is to introduce a
language restriction to to tell people
that they're not able to emit such a
super call so
despite that sort of hiccup and yeah
miss step along the way we've we've
still come to a pretty good solution we
think or an improvement over the status
quo so in 211 people will look at their
stack traces and see this sort of crafty
t dot class and call going through this
forward a method in the in the subclass
itself and now we just the method the
method body stays where it is and stack
traces are more natural and readable to
people the code is staying in the class
where it was so reflective tools that
are looking for annotations and in
closing classes and these sorts of
things are more likely to work well in
this new world and we got around this
problem as I said with them with
emitting static accesses we may consider
something more any based in the future
that sort of fell a plan but you know
there are other alternatives as well
maybe we should we should put our
current scheme behind indie so we can
change it kind of in a minor release
this is but we're a bit too close to the
release to sort of take too many risks
like that so static access as it is okay
so we couldn't use indy for that what
can we use it for you know we're on Java
right now right so first little side
note is that we added support for in the
type checker for polymorphic signature
this is actually done in you know minor
release of Skyward 2 dot 11 so just by
having an expected type of int here you
know we get the right method descriptor
for this polymorphic invocation of
method handle don't invoke and got a
to-do item to add the same thing for the
newly spect polymorphic signature stuff
in invar handles for the job and I'm
scholar has symbol literals and you know
quote foo is a shorthand for a call to
Scarlett symbol with the string foo now
these are interned in in this apply
method of Scarlett symbol and in
addition to interning any class that has
the symbol literals in them will cash
them currently in a static in that class
so if they're defined within a loop the
literals only only looked up the once
and then every other iteration through
that loop is is picked up from the
static in the field now private
aesthetics are not supported in
interfaces in in Java 8 so we sort of
had a choice here should we just public
publicize that static fields that we're
using as a cash or can begin to fly it
and this is sort of a perfect
application for one of these linked time
constants that John was referring to and
the implementation is is as you would
expect it's very straightforward to use
in D for that use case that's sort of
the first little toe in the water that
we we have with indirect dynamic
Scuttler also has structural calls so
this district lares that c is some value
of any type which has a close method
avoid close method and this is compiled
into reflective calls with again a
static cash in in the host class to keep
recently used reflection artifacts
around so the lookups not done time and
time again again for the same reason
when we don't have private static fields
at our disposal in interfaces where
we're trying to leave trait bodies now
so we use exactly the same trick and we
just put the cash behind a constant cool
site in an invite dynamic bootstrap we
did actually prototype using Dino link
which i think is the next talk today to
you know outsource the job of
maintaining this cache of reflection
artifacts it's a pretty good fit however
our structural call
part of the compiler has some special
cases for dealing with some fictional
methods that our compiler sees you know
we have a plus method on string for
example so you know future work here is
to augment dyna link to understand these
you know handful of fictional methods
and then outsource that job and actually
get a getaway reduce the the special
support in the compiler just down to
have emitting a single in decor so we've
had a couple use cases here where we're
emitting invoked dynamic we sort of got
sick of special casing each of these use
cases in a compiler backends so we we
created an ast encoding for arbitrary
Indy calls scholar has a compile-time
macro system as well which can expand
any application into arbitrary AST so
you put those two things together and
you have like a undocumented
experimental full of caveats means to
actually have lively library level
support for 4 in D so we played around
with a few examples of this and we'll
just show you what's possible so just a
quick cheat sheet about Skylar macros
it's an experimental feature introduced
in Scala 210 it's experimental to 11
it's experimental into 12 it's stable
enough and used relatively widely but
it's experimental because to make a
macro API for a typed rich language like
Scala there's a huge surface area to let
people manipulate and interact with your
trees and symbols and types and you know
they're still research into finding a
more minimal way to expose that API so
client code of a macro looks feels type
checks like a regular method call
arguments in particular a type checked
before the macro is expanded there's no
way that you can sort of subvert typical
type checking order by having access to
untyped arguments the macro author
writes a pair of methods a macro
declaration which is the type signature
and implementation method which is the
AST transform the standard lib we have a
couple macros we have string formatting
that sort of you know statically checks
that you've got the the right number of
the right number of the right format
specifiers and those sorts of things and
we've also got to support macro waters a
special macro fork was equating that
lets you in bed snippets of Scala code
and if that expands into the code which
would produce the trees for that
particular syntactic structure and the
Kwazii quote macro is also possible to
use for pattern matching on trees as
well that's one of our kind of ideas on
how to make a smaller API for people to
use if they're just dealing with Kwazii
quotes we don't necessarily have to
support the the whole the whole tree API
directly so that's all you need to know
about scholar macros so let's have a
look an example of this let's say we'd
like this kind of code to work we want
to compile some reg ex and then make
some calls on it but next time we come
through here we don't really want to pay
the cost to recompile this reg ex
because it's just based on a literal
string and furthermore if if we have
some invalid regex syntax let's let's
tell the user about that at compile time
so how can we implement that we can
write a macro so down the bottom we have
the macro declaration so to the user
that just looks like a regular type
signature and that's telling the
compiler that this is the method bit
edgy call reflectively during type
checking here's the guts of the macro it
has one argument tree which you can
pattern match on determined that it's
it's a literal string we can compile the
pattern at compile at compile time check
that it's valid report an error position
that right with the right spot in the
string for them and omit our encoding of
indy passing through the constant bid
straightener argument
in this particular case if they didn't
pass a constant here we can just leave
everything until runtime and compile the
non constant argument and this this is
an example of using the Kwazii quote
macro to create a tree within a within a
macro implementation the bootstrap
method here but it couldn't be simpler
it's just a simple compile time constant
calling pattern compile and yeah so
that's a kind of a neat way to implement
these compile time constants you know
John wrote this long post to the mailing
list to a better week ago that that has
a bunch of great ideas on how that might
come into to java or yeah my idea is
just to encourage anyone who's wants to
prototype of that stuff you know aside
from the the bytecode waving approach
scholars macro system might also offer a
good vehicle for exploration and then
just thinking about the use cases where
this can be of some benefit to the
community you know perhaps we can make a
scalar macro library that lets people
abstract over the differences between
Java 8 and 9 so they call for example
you know compare and set and this link
time will say what platform are we on ok
we're on 8 let's use unsafe ok bro 9
let's use of our handle because you know
the cadence of schuyler releases mean
but it might be a while before we can
target and require 9 so this maybe gives
us a way to let people take advantage of
nine before that point so just to take
the idea a tiny bit further you can
imagine if you wrote too many of these
macros they start to get very
boilerplate e you're really just
checking that you've got some constant
some of your arguments are constants and
then forwarding those as bootstrap
methods down to the to some affording
there's arguments to some bootstrap
method and your bed strap method is just
running some little snippet of code so
what if your bid strap method
an interpreter and you can pass the pass
it the program to interpret from a
generic macro so you know let's say that
we've got some partially evaluate macro
which knows that you know construction
of constant of immutable lists here with
constant arguments is something that we
can lift out and do it link time you can
conceivably imagine that this macro can
generically take its argument here and
convert that into an invite dynamic call
and the open question is how you encode
this program you know the new constants
that kind of were on this this the ideas
list for John's might give you a
structured way to do it I'm sure there's
plenty of unstructured ways to do it as
well that would probably work today
there's actually a lot of research being
done in our neck of the woods into the
ideas of staging so you know if you're
interested in seeing how staging has
been thought about in the scala world
here's a couple of papers I think this
injured integration with link time
evaluation gives a new flavor to it so
it'll be interesting to see if this and
further research goes on into that okay
final topic is just a quick talk about
two lambdas you know high level is not
too much to talk about here because
you're familiar with how lambdas are
encoded in Java 7 you know anonymous
inner classes of the function types that
sort of existed by by default in
libraries or run a bull and so on in the
standard library and in eight the same
types are used but with invoke dynamic
to defer spinning up these classes so
what we've done is the same at a high
level but we had a couple implementation
challenges along the way so I thought
I'd just share those with you
so our first design principle was to say
let's use lambda meta factory okay just
for starters it's satisfied our laziness
we didn't have to write our own meta
factory and second it it gave us the
best chance we thought of sort of like
buying into any future performance
improvements in hot spot which perhaps
intrinsic lied something by knowing the
behavior of this particular bootstrap
but what can let what what what was
lambda meta factory unable to do for us
well the first sort of minor annoyance
is that there's no way to customize the
the two-string for the generated class
so this represents a regression in in
scalar functions you know we we used to
override to string to say function and
now we get lambda 1 2 3 4 5 6 second
Lander meta factory is able to do type
adaptation if the signature of the
method that you're of the functional
interface method differs in small ways
from the lambda implementation method it
will insert boxes and unboxes and and
casts as needed it turns out that these
were not sufficient for for our purposes
so in Scala unboxing of a null is a zero
java at CERN nullpointerexception that
sort of stemmed back to scholars
integration of the primitive types into
the unified type system where we have
object any we have object any in eval
and the primitives under here so
yeah when once we once we hand over to
land to land a meta factory we have no
no further say in the in the output in
addition to primitive scholar has value
classes Valley classes are rapid types
like let's say meter where the compiler
will arrays meter to its wrapped type
and functions that involve value classes
as either their arguments or return
types also generate code which which
land a meta factory has no idea how to
box in on books so this solution to this
wasn't too hard we just had to say if if
our Lander implanted implantation method
will be adaptable by lambda meta factory
fine handed over directly otherwise the
compiler will just generate an adapter
ahead of time and you said us instead
you know again we did that selectively
to try to keep call stacks a bit a bit
smaller I slammed a heavy coat the kind
of high enough as it is and another
special case here is that forward return
type since gawa can can be unified with
functions from orbit from a generic
function type that's not possible in
Java today yeah so these are just
examples of the behaviors of scholar
functions and boxing and unboxing of
void and and primitives which we've had
to maintain by generating these little
adapters so we live with a new two
string we're just going to tell users
that that's how life is you know they
won't they want to did different one
anyway they want to show the code to see
where it is with a line number and you
cannot please everyone so that's that's
where we will sit we selectively use
these new adapter methods as the land to
target
further small challenge was with
scholars specialized functions so
scholars got specialization which is
sort of you know trying to solve the
same problems as some ne5 generics in
valhalla um it's all done ahead of time
in Scala which has the obvious problems
of you know too many combinations of
special of specialized variants and so
on so but we do have specialized
function types so a function type from
int to int doesn't incur boxing if the
caller to that is non generic code
specialization is implemented by having
a bunch of specialized sub interfaces of
the generic interface just sort of due
to an implementation quirk of the
specialization phase of our compiler the
wrong method is left abstract for it to
be directly used as a functional
interface so we just had to write a
bunch of Java code to make adapter
functional interfaces for these ones to
react the primitive to primitive methods
that's not something that's any thought
of anyone but our own last challenge
here is serialization chatting to Brian
about this and he shared all the same
pain so Java Sea treats cereal
serializable functional interfaces as
the exception rather than the norm and
only generates a serialization code both
in the serialization code in the lander
itself and the corresponding D
serialization code in the host class
selectively if the functional interface
extends serializable scholar lambdas are
then implement function n our
serializable always so we have we have
sort of a different set of a different
starting point therefore our design
process in Java there's a bug open that
says if you have too many serializable
Landers in your class you just
method size too big exception because
when you're generating code because the
deserialized lambda has specific code
for each and every Lander in the current
class so we didn't want to sort of run
into that problem so what we do use
instead is in generic lambda
deserializer so the body of lambda
deserializer conceptually just forwards
to generic code which calls lambda meta
factory you know in user space and this
is then backed by a cache specific to
that call site so we're not doing the
same work over and over again cash is
kind of hidden away behind the invite
dynamic call site in the Java sea's
version of this to host add cash this we
use in D again to have a static field
but hidden away behind a particular cool
site there is a trade-off the behavior
of scholar and scholar and java
serialization deserialization actually
of lambdas is slightly different Java is
a little bit more restrictive on
deserializing something where the types
of the parameters have have change or
the signature changes have happened
scholar isn't able to fail fast because
of the fact that this generic lambda
serializer doesn't need really the
current state of the lambda
implementation method in the lambda host
class but it's it's no worse than it
wasn't scollard 211 where we didn't make
strong guarantees about serialization
and deserialization with different
versions of code we've had a couple
other little issues Scala has a feature
called lazy valves which sort of
encapsulate sort of double check
blocking pattern as a language construct
synchronizing on the enclosing class
suddenly now be within with lambda
lambda being hosted in the
implementation method in the host class
of the lambda rather than in an
anonymous class that's fun
we've got a different lock scope that's
a tough one the only real solution we
have here is to have a mode of the
compiler which just doesn't use lamb to
meta factory in case someone hits a
deadlock and they're trying to diagnose
it but this is nothing particularly
saying we can we can do here other than
just educate and document and give
people some tools you know LA Kings hard
hidden locking is arguably a very bad
idea it's baked into the language and
it's convenient but there's a price to
that convenience this for the same
reason that method body the body of the
lander is now in the host class there
are subtle differences to the amount of
code that was being captured when you
instantiate to lambda do you need a
reference to the outer class to call a
non-static method in there so in earlier
versions of our Lander encoding we we
did have this problem where suddenly the
lambda would become you know too big
because it's holding on to more than it
needs or equivalently who become not
serializable because it was holding on
to an enclosing class which is not
serializable fortunately this was
largely solvable we already had some
analysis that tries to make lambda
implementation methods static we just
had to extend this to transitively say
if it's if it's if there's a chain of
things which don't refer to anything
except other lambda implementation
methods we can make a chain of them
static so long story short we've we've
managed to set a restore our our old
benchmark of what things are
serializable and how big they are as far
as we know so far we've going into
release candidate phase very soon and we
may have some more surprises but that's
what it's for
so what's next 212 rc1 is coming out
about the end of the month after that
point we're going to start working on
Java 9 support we're collecting
requirements at the moment there's going
to be a little bit of work they're both
for jigsaw for some subtle changes in
the vm dimitris some just found out
about we're also going to be investing
in benchmarking performance of the
compiler and library you know we want to
try to cherry-pick as much of the
insights that that Dimitri is finding in
his research and see if we can find any
ways possible to to deliver those four
people are using the current current
version of the Scala compiler so with
that I'll wrap up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
