at the JCC 15th anniversary party the
calendar
a lot of testing and debugging stuff is
now you know pretty damn solid yes that
now is rock solid yeah yeah you were
there for the very first estou of the
untwist and that actually worked and
that actually has been working just fine
ever since well so so the the untangling
part works really well the part that
doesn't work really well is the
detecting so we
we currently do detection by looking at
at the compass to see whether when they
twist around the problem is that there
are lots of things that can confuse the
compass so if you if you've got a
compass and you flip it on its side you
flip it back again it can do what looks
like a
360 spin and even you know the modern
you know high-tech MEMS compasses will
do that yeah so if it gets caught by the
wrong kind of wave it will think it's
got a twist when it's really just just
flick got flopped over by a wave so
we've got a got a twist detector that is
somewhat unreliable
yeah so we've we've been we actually
just just just this morning I was in
this marathon meeting to go through all
of the all of the issues and it was like
are we clear to ship you know is it is
it sort of time to call a general
availability that meeting was liquid are
calm
yeah if only if only there there there
it probably max out your credit card you
know that that much machined titanium
doesn't come cheap
yeah the you know you know you know so
so you know everybody has like little
you know 15 pin connectors you know they
cost a nickel it fries you know ours
cost like 20 to 30 bucks but you know
they're they're they're wet may double
in salt water and they'll survive you
know you know you can plug them in
submerged in salt water they they work
correctly and they'll keep working for
years which is you know it's just as
crazy material stuff yep yep it's the
auricle job embedded vm it's been as
solid as Iraq
yeah yeah at the time we were you know
when double was first done it was all
about you know televisions and VCRs and
such I mean this is like that was in
like 1991 1992 quite a ways ago and you
know this is sort of the same thing
except it's wrapped in titanium in salt
water well we started off as this little
little project at Sun sort of the end of
1990 very beginning of 91 to kind of
look into sort of things that were
interesting and you know sort of
happened on this this whole embedded
world there's this whole universe of
places where people were using computers
that
outside the the regular computer
industry so we spend a lot of time
looking at that people who were building
that really primitive cell phones
elevators electric locomotives oh it was
awful I mean the way that people were
programming those things if you were
really really really lucky it might have
been see most often it was assembly code
and the you know there's always they had
all these issues with like the
reliability debug ability of their
software everything took an immense
amount of labor to create which put a
real cap on the sophistication of the
software that they could build Plus
which you know even minor changes to
their system and they'd have to rewrite
everything you know
you know light light like they they
always wanted to change their minds
about the cpu but if you've handwritten
a bunch of assembly code and you change
the CPU and these people were starting
to connect to networks or at least think
about connecting to networks and I spend
a lot of time in in 91 talking to people
in some of these companies we're
starting to do networking and they were
sort of inventing their own ways to do
networking and and it was really this
this sort of tragic comedy because they
were they were doing things that that
people had tried like 20 or 30 years ago
and they just didn't work and it's like
it's okay to be doing new interesting
things that might fail but if somebody's
already done the experiment and it's
known to fail don't don't do it again
yeah yeah and you know it was a really
interesting period because we were sort
of cross fertilizing between different
the reminisce trees in you know and then
they and in that time period computers
and and like ordinary humans didn't mix
right there were no you know the desktop
publishing was a very rare thing you
know people still use typewriters and
now they hardly remember what they are
yeah well no there's this yeah but it's
more to like not blow out your ear
tendons but
I mean it's the flat square ones that
will kill you well I thought it was
pretty wonderful I mean in the in the
early days you know one of the things I
believe did really strongly was all this
all the sort of verbage about eater
operability interoperability and you
know you can talk about it but as soon
as you start getting sort of like like
major industry players like IBM and
Microsoft Oracle participating in
something like that you can't just do it
as like a bunch of friends chatting it's
got to be a little more discipline
you've got to have you know you've got
to have records you've got to have you
know some it's a level playing field
some way for people to know that you're
actually playing fair right it's
you know it's the difference between you
know playing playing soccer with rules
and just going out there and whacking
people free phones right and and having
having a structure so that the people a
new we rule really cared about
interoperability and working for
everybody and that there's kind of a
level playing field that nobody had an
advantage
yeah and you know a lot of it was
because the a lot of the companies that
we had partnerships with just didn't
trust us and you know I think we were
actually pretty trustworthy but you know
they they have to have some kind of
framework to bound that belief and there
were there were some people that never
believed that we were trustworthy
despite the JCP yeah well right but you
know folks like that you'll never make
happy yeah brought them to the table and
gave the food fight a place to happen
gave the the disagreements and
nervousness a place to air you know
there's been a lot of turbulence in the
JCP but you know given that that almost
by definition when you have a community
that that has a large component that our
our big industrial concerns all of them
are dedicated to the death of each other
they're not going to be happy and
friendly yeah everybody has a conflict
of interest right
so so conflict is kind of the name of
the game and and the JCP is really a
framework for managing conflict
everybody together I mean it's you know
the you know the the only real party
that really fell out of it was with
Microsoft Apple was never really in it
they were kind of weird but then then
that Apple is not a get along to the
company but you know the fact that
companies like IBM and Oracle who you
know at some CEO to CEO level profoundly
hate each other and they're still able
to work together
I'm so happy to be a Java user it really
makes my life easier as the whole write
once run anywhere thing I'm pretty much
stretching to the limit well and you
know I know this this control system for
this waverider you know I run it I run
exactly the same software embedded in
the Waverider on my laptop for debugging
in the cloud to run simulations and it
all works and the fact that I can go
from from one VM to another one CPU
architecture through to another you know
I run exactly the same code on on arm
and x86 continuously I am personally
almost completely unaware at a
professional level with the distinction
between our
and x86 well well if you could where
we're actually doing a new embedded
board or hoping to do a new embedded
board and you know one of the things
that's difficult about the about they
are moral but you can't just buy an ARM
processor and soldered onto a board and
you pretty much have to buy a complete
package unit because if you go to
Qualcomm or in or Nvidia and say hi I'd
like to buy you know a hundred Tegra
chips they will laugh at you you know
they just aren't enough digits in the
order and and so we have to buy embedded
boards with them on them for us it's a
struggle to find the right embedded
board that we could adapt and it's the
good that so the world gets somewhat
messy
yeah well we have a current one that's
got a TI OMAP 6000 series processor on
and it's it's it's a pretty ancient arm
and we need it at the very least we need
a much more modern processor
and if there was a mips board with the
right characteristics that would work
for me I mean the one of the things
about the MIPS universe is that the the
things that's kept them alive is the
sort of embedded harsh environment world
right they do a lot of like automotive
work yeah so might actually be a good
choice for us but we're just starting to
look yeah III think I'm fully equipped
well thanks and thanks for doing all
your night acting tours and keep the
motorcycle polished alrighty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
