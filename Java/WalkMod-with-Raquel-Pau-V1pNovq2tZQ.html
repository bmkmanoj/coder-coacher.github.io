technology Network we're here talking to
members of the community at devoxx UK I
have a cow cow with me hi it's too light
to talk to you so tell me what you do
yes I involved in an open source project
called one mode whose aim is having a
configuration file with all a project
called conventions and apply them
automatically so instead of tests
checking what are those source files
that you rate some rules it updates the
source code to apply these conventions
in fact we support three kinds of
conventions formatting rules naming
rules and also best practices so we are
addressed to those developers that over
and over again repeat the same best
practices like a note I think some
classes fails methods to support a given
framework or something like that and in
in a way completely automatically so all
the important parameters in the same
project can apply these conventions and
the review process is faster than never
Wow so do you do it through an IDE or do
you run it through the application how
does it work yes is a command line tool
like maven or aunt and now we have also
a package to execute well not from maven
but I recommend to execute them from the
command line because the maven
configuration is also used by a
continuous integration software and then
it's not the best place to execute one
mode because it changes your source code
and nobody puts the changes you know Oh
interesting so what's the feedback that
you've gotten from the community in
terms of your two very positive now in
fact we are currently using one not
inside our own project and it's
beautiful city hold developers have
interested and surprised it that this
relation exists now well so if I want to
get more information about walkman where
do I go where you have a web page and
also we have a form tool to give support
to the whole community and everybody can
participate and collaborate with us to
improve for features and also extend
what are the current supported
conventions excellent well thank you for
dropping by it's good to talk to you
you're welcome thank you very much this
