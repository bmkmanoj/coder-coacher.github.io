community process program management
office and we are here at devoxx UK i'm
interviewing federico and cellist eno
from switzerland private developers from
lugano and i wanted to thank you guys
for coming and being interviewed enjoyed
meeting you this week so I wanted to ask
you a few questions about your
experience here at devoxx UK yeah it's
your first time attending yeah lastly
and it was a lot of fun we really
enjoyed a lot and we had a lot of
sessions very interesting very technical
and we learned a lot of things and this
week we also we also know a lot of
interesting people java champion and yes
we worked together shoulder to shoulder
with with people really talented people
i mean and so it was amazing and what we
are some of your favorite activities at
the conference this week Oh beside the I
was home conferences then for sure we
spent a lot of time here at the aqha
garden session with the unrest and it
was very very interesting we learned a
lot of things hands-on labs with Java 8
in lambdas and that was great it was
really that was our focus to to work on
to practice the new java stream and your
streaming API n lambda features that are
recently added in July yes a success
yeah yeah I I watched you yesterday you
were here yesterday as well as today in
the hacker garden we had several
activities organized for the developers
we had some JCP and Java related topics
like he said we have we had Java 8 date
and time ap
I the lambdas and stream collections as
well as we had some OpenJDK activity
this morning data grids je cache Java EE
as well as we had the spec lead from
Switzerland Credit Suisse money and
currency API so we had a really nice mix
of projects and I saw you yesterday you
were working on the Java 8 activities
with roll Irma and Richard Warburton and
you want to share any more about what
you learned what you took away from it a
lot and the nice part is that you do
that theoretical part looking to the
session you see something it's
interesting and then you can come here
would try it directly and since in
something new you don't know it very
well you have the opportunity to ask the
people that have done it or that know it
very well that we think writing books on
that and that's a unique chance you get
complete the session with the practical
experience that's that's really
interesting for us for a conference like
this yes it was really amazing because
of the because of the people who
attended these these sessions so we work
together and and we shared our knowledge
a little knowledge with people that
helped a lot to increase this knowledge
and yes I was really yes I think that is
one of the benefits of the hacker garden
is contributing to the open source
project but it's also learning hands-on
and applying some of the knowledge that
you're gaining at the conference and
having that opportunity yeah you should
organize a cave gardener up during each
conference technical conference I think
for sure a lot of people will appreciate
yes I agree actually this we've done
this a couple of times with Andre and
it's something that I'm really
passionate about and I enjoy watching
the developers learn and be happy as I
saw your face yesterday I took your
picture so this would be a great
opportunity for you to share that
enthusiasm with the rest of the
community so you mentioned other
conferences so are you planning to
attend javaone this year in San
Francisco in September not directly I
don't think so no I will there are other
colleagues that
we go there and so we will add some
spaces of the others but yes other
conferences for sure we are interested
in other news is always in the Java and
Aria and now also JavaScript becoming
quite pretty interesting we are also
interested okay I think you mentioned
one of your colleagues is going to
attend gem one this year yeah so like
they're having a code garden which is
the same idea at javaone this year so
you can let your colleague know that
we're doing that so the code garden is
going to be three days near the demo
grounds at javaone in San Francisco
it'll be monday tuesday and wednesday
right now we're looking at noon to five
PM so we'll be organizing some java
related projects and topics there JCP
and Jace are related as well as other
types of things that are related so we
can get that some of the project leaves
expertise and bring in some of the
developers and really share that
knowledge in a hands-on way to have the
collaboration and learning happening as
well as the contributions to the
projects so i think it's going to be an
exciting opportunity yeah we recommend
we recommend to your colleagues then i
look forward to seeing you at the next
conference enjoyed meeting you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
