part of the otn advocacy team and I run
the Java champion program and i'm joined
today with the java champion Johan Voss
welcome thank you for joining me thanks
for having me and here today just
talking to the various Java champions
here at devoxx and trying to get a
better idea of what you do and how you
contribute to the community so you know
what is your day job I'm a co-founder
and CTO of a gluon I'm city over the
cloud products that could ruin and with
blue one we work on Java on mobile so we
bring the java the java that everybody
knows we bring that to mobile devices
iOS and Android devices so we try to
make sure that if you create a java
application once for a desktop for
example that the same application can be
used on iOS and Android so we provide
tools that allows you to create a native
Android or iOS application based on your
single Java code base and we also make
sure that you can communicate with
back-end systems and enterprise systems
from this java application so the dream
of java white ones run anywhere we try
to realize that on mobile devices so
that those nine ten million java
developers can use their favorite
language on all the devices that's
that's impressive and then what do you
do you know again a lot of the Java
Champions one of the core things is that
they give back to the java community
what what do you do they give back to
the java community well one of the
important things in this industry is
that all those java developers need to
need to be aware of what is possible
they need to know the latest
possibilities and and you need also
their feedback so on one hand you need
to listen to orders what do those
developers really want to do with with
Java and you also want to tell them what
is possible and i think that with with
with mobile is this is a good example
because i heard many developers over the
past years that that we're impressed
before you could do on mobile and that
we are frustrated because Java didn't
run on mobile so there was a clear
demand from the Java developers hey we
want to do cool things as well but i am
not an objective c or Swift developer so
how can I get my stuff in Iowa's devices
or mobile phones in general so that is
something that we heard a lot at Java
conferences and also at the user groups
and now that this is possible we we go
to those conferences and we talk to the
to the user groups and we show how you
how it is easy today to have Java and to
create mobile applications so we we try
to listen to the request from developers
and then we try we see how can we answer
them and how can we fill in the gaps
well thank you so much for all that you
do for the java community and do you
have any talks coming up for devoxx or
have you given them all yeah if I talk
tomorrow where I will give the the
state's update on a job on mobile what's
currently possible what are the plans
for the future and how can you link it
with your java enterprise application or
with your cloud system if you want to
extend your cloud functionality to to
mobile devices then you should come to
this talk all right well great and it
sounds like a great topic and just a PSA
if your speaker and you want to get beer
come to a talk with you lond thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
