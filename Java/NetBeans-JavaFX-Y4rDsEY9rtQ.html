here with me Gale and Paul Anderson from
Anderson sufferer group doing trainings
and staff role around
programming languages NetBeans Java FX
so couple of things so and today they
are here for telling you about a like
Java FAQs on top of NetBeans and how all
this works and how you can make really
great apps with this so um welcome thank
you thanks for having us here this is
our first time the dev ox and it's
everything that that they said it was so
we're having a good time
that's good great okay so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna show you like
Sven said we've been very busy with our
clients helping them move to Java FX
from swing and also we've been helping
people with the NetBeans platform to as
an infrastructure for UI designs so the
program that that we have here okay
I mean maybe you can bring that up yeah
let me figure out whether they it's
always about this it's not appearing
like yay I found it okay so there you go
you're on alright okay now this is a
little UI that we designed that shows
and teaches people how to use Java
effects effectively and it's it's
basically the program that monitors
blood pressure readings and we have the
readings and a table and we also have
some very nice Java FX charts and
everything you see here is out of the
out of the package so Gale can interact
with it she can click on some buttons
and when she does add you you see the
charts immediately upgrade and update
themselves and we're using a lot of
really nice binding and listening
techniques to make this all happen she
can also go in and select a reading and
we apply some drop shadows and give some
nice user interactions to to the user if
you look at the bar chart down below
which is updating the maximum minimum
and average values as Gail clicks on the
buttons you can see the number of
readings changes yeah she does that she
is changing each time she clicks on the
buttons and we thought we'd just show
you how easy it is in Java effects to to
update something like that it's actually
one line of code
so let's go to the code right now and
we'll show you how we're doing that is
this like a you know talk about binding
stuff here at devoxx the same technology
or so yeah we just gave our talk and we
talked a lot about using JavaFX and
using different binding strategies
different also about observable lists
and how they can be
you can attach listeners to them and use
them and how everything can be
interconnected and and the importance of
you of having JavaFX properties in your
model data so great yeah so yeah so
let's go ahead and scroll down to that
statement there we can show you how
we're doing the title this is a
standalone JavaFX program everything's
out of the box there it is right there I
think it's on line 296 and what we're
doing is we're taking the title property
of the bar charts title and we're using
a binding expression here which uses a
library binding Slotkin cat that will
concatenate those strings together and
then we go out and we get the size of
the bindings systolic reading which is a
numeric binding and then we convert it
with the fluent API out string method to
a string and then we can create a string
that updates the title property so in
this one statement with a bind anytime
the length of the series for the
systolic reading is changing either
going up or down this the stat charts
title property is immediately updated
with one line of code so as you see that
okay and then I think I'm going to show
them how to add a reading and some of
the bindings we use to control some of
these buttons here so when once when you
select something it puts the readings in
here and when you deselect it it clears
them out and it puts the date to the
current date and time well my computer
thinks that it's 3:00 a.m. because it's
on calendar
I wonder I'm sleeping yeah but I'm gonna
add reading now and when I do that
you'll see that that this changes so I'm
gonna go into the current date and time
frame and add something on the 23rd that
would be in there and now you see the
add button has become enabled because
all these fields are filled in if I get
rid of this the add button goes away
so again that's binding an easy buying
statement yes that's okay and now you
see this meetings title that we showed
you the binding before showing 17
readings now yeah okay so so let's show
you how we're doing that again it's one
line of code spread over separate lines
of course but still
and so gales gonna scroll down there now
and there it is okay it's aligned to 27
what we're doing is we're taking the
disabled property in the add button
control and JavaFX
and we're calling the bind api and then
what we're doing is we're looking to see
with the fluent API is if any of the
text properties for the three blood
pressure readings are empty see those
letters are the calls to the is empty
and then the ORS are saying you know are
they is this empty or this empty or this
empty and then we also have a property
that we maintain in the program that
says it's okay to add or not okay to add
and that one statement handles the
enabling and disabling of the add button
without writing any listeners without
writing any callback codes or anything
and this is the part of Java effects
that that we really like because not
only is it easy to make the UI's design
the UI's but it also helps you make them
work correctly okay and and i just
wanted to say a couple words about how
this is structured and that is that we
use FX and mal to define the UI and we
used gluons scene builder to to build it
which is a standalone program that you
can get and
but you can go to it from the F XML in
in the NetBeans IDE
and and that helps keep the as you know
as it keeps the the view separate from
the controller and the model so I I
think we want to show you so using a lot
we we kind of use it by standard and
that helps also when you go to if you
want to use the NetBeans platform that's
really help structure your job FX code
if you're using so that's what I want to
show you guys so I don't know if you
want to talk while I'm doing this
because up to close yeah and yeah and a
note on that you know this the the scene
builder tool from blue on is is really
great our our clients are using it
because when you when you when you use
the tool to drag-and-drop and it
generates the F XML code then you as the
Java developer don't have to write as
much Java code because it gets rid of
the tedious boilerplate of creating
creating controls and then calling
setters to configure them because you
can do that all in a declarative way in
F XML okay so what we what we've got now
is another version of our program in the
NetBeans platform and now we've got each
one of the the chart the charts and the
table and the controls are all in
separate windows so what we've done now
is we've added we've enhanced the UI so
that you know as he has even more
capabilities for example Gale could take
one of the windows here and float it and
as you that's a great thing to do in
this situation since our screen is a
little bit yeah and I couldn't so so
floating is puppies I think yes it is
okay and it's wonderful because a lot of
times a lot of our clients are really
interested in visualizing data and
that's what they like about Java effects
so you notice that with that gales got
this window floated in the NetBeans
platform but as as the windows changing
with the new range of blood pressure
data all the other windows are changing
too so yeah you know it all it all works
great and of course you know there's a
redesign of this that's required because
the other program was standalone
but it works out pretty well oh and then
but their use of the traffic's
components and the mxml was just like
the same so in this example we we
divided each separate window into its
own module and that meant that we took
the F XML code and we chopped it up so
the parts that were the line chart so
let's just look at this one for example
this only has the line chart code well
in the buttons so it's very short and
that's really nice because it's it's own
separate module and and it really helps
maintain a an application battery so you
how they like a very large FX the mofo
for the whole application we saw first
yeah I think that's like a split it up
into a couple of different right okay so
could you have been going for a separate
F XML files for the basic application as
well yeah I think you can do that by
with includes yeah so the transformation
process would be even easier than you
know the NetBeans platform encourages
you to you know ma July's your
application so it all just fits in
really well yeah as well yeah so shall
we show them just a little bit of
animation okay yeah yeah babies always
get you know it's like really visual
candy for ya so why don't you read doc
that back and you know if if one I don't
know if this will show up out here if
you delete a reading but one of the nice
things you can do in FX if you delete
that reading right yeah yeah move that
down to one of the nice things you can
do in Java effects is you could put up
statuses for people when she clicks on
the okay button yeah over on the left
there you could see something and then
and then you fade it out and and this is
very very easy to do in Java effects
with a fade transitions and and it helps
a lot of people with the UI to see
something instead of it just being you
know eliminated immediately the other
thing that that we could
just doing because you know JavaFX house
a reputation for spinning circles was we
decided that we might well why couldn't
we do this right this has no redeeming
qualities whatsoever except it sure
looks cool and it's very easy to and
this is so easy to do in Java effects
because it's a rotate transition and all
we're doing is applying it to the parent
of the scene graph that you see that
that's showing the line chart and then
we just tell it to rotate you know
around a z-axis and and and it's really
cool so there's a lot of effort and a
lot and a lot of interest in Java FX and
the NetBeans platform to build really
sophisticated you eyes like these so did
you ever encounter any problems with
integration with Java effects and swing
so NetBeans a swing application so you
have to use the integration of Java X
and swing right so you there's a
specialized component in Java FX called
Java FX jfx panel that allows you to
integrate Java FX content into a swing
container and so we use that for each
one of these windows and you also have
to make sure that you do any updates to
your Java FX scene graph on the Java FX
application thread and there's ways to
do that swing has swing utilities that
invoke later that swing users are used
to using Java FX has it's also a
platform dot run later that you do same
thing yeah so there's I think there's a
hidden secret property to make both the
threads while there is a hidden secret
property to make both threads the same
and we have used it it does work okay
but it's it's at the current time it's
non-standard so we tend out since we're
into the training teaching week we do it
the standard way but as far as I know
there's no problems with they switch it
off by default to just just in case
anything we have might happen they will
be on by default it will be bad so right
I agree
just give it a shot if you would like to
those things ok great so low alert okay
from there on the platform perspective
from javac so great to have you here
thank you thank you very much man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
