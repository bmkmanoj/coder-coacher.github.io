technology Network and I'm here at
devoxx today interviewing Garrett green
vault and with my host my co-host Jim
Weaver so Garrett tell us a little bit
what you what do you do so yeah I'm
working for can do engineering and
Switzerland as a software developer I'm
mainly interested in doing graphics
stuff like these gauges that are shown
in my talks and everything visual is
something that I'm interested in running
on Java of course so and Java fix
especially I also did some swing
development in the past and html5
development but most of the times it's
related to custom controls that's what
I'm doing mainly so how much have I
effects to you used today one hundred
percent all the time wow this is a
flower yeah it's really I do a lot of
drug effects because it's you know I
came from swing and I felt all the pain
it was really painful so then I was
searching for something new i tried
html5 with canvas and JavaScript and I
liked it a lot but in the end it doesn't
work for me and then two years ago
Oracle came up with javafx based on Java
and they convinced me to try it out and
now I'm completely infected so I try to
evangelize everybody use Java fix its
it's great so I'm a desktop guy no
server side development for me so you
had a you had a little presentation
yesterday can you tell a little bit with
what it was yeah it was also something
that is new from Oregon now javafx on
embedded devices and they showed it at
javaone and I saw that stuff and it's I
talked to the guys if I would like to do
that what should I buy and they tell me
yeah you should buy the BeagleBoard and
some special LCD display and I bought
all that stuff and try to keep it
running which took some time but now
it's it's running and I show it on
conferences to show the people what is
possible with javafx on embedded devices
because most of the people don't get it
javafx it's all these fancy hinky blinky
stuff on the desktop so why do you need
it on a device like this of this size
but it makes sense if you have this
displays for example the Oracle showed
some of these displays here in front of
the of the rooms where you can for
example get your calendar or your
schedule something like that or you can
you know the displaced from airports or
train stations and for stuff like this
which is running on Windows CE right now
with big machines you can use hardware
which is just 35 bucks like the
Raspberry Pi and do something like that
which is really good for the industry
right and you can use their existing
Java developers doing that stuff so
that's a big advantage I think I know
you have a tight time frame you're going
at you're running into a session I just
I did want to convey my appreciation for
the session that the you and I code you
created and delivered yesterday it was
actually a three-hour University says it
was a lot of fun and so and you you
presented some of the UI control work
that you did you also presented lambdas
lambda expression yeah and how we could
use lambda expressions to simplify the
events one
when we get into javafx 8 as well as the
BeagleBoard now what's your session
today going to be about today I just
have a quickie which means 15 minutes
and i will talk about custom controls in
general so just it's really 15 minutes
and i will tell a story about one custom
control that are implemented in swing
html5 and java and we'll show them
compared to each other and just to make
let the people know that everything is
possible here Gerrit Cole leads the job
FX community with me and and the reason
why it works so well is as you can tell
here it is so enthusiastic about javafx
and I I feel like one of the reasons why
and garrett's express this is that we
just like to have fun as developers with
javafx it's becoming fun again and so
that's one of the things that he had a
track spirit to it and why he so
yesterday Jim said it's in the right
mood speaks just to want to have fun
right and that's exactly what it is and
then we broke out into the cyndi
lauper's yeah I think we should let
Garrett good with session yes yes thank
you so much for having me sometimes fun
okay thank you for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
