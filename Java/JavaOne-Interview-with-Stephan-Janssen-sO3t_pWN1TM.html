interviewing different Java on speakers
the Java one conference is in san
francisco from September 22nd through 20
ember 26th and today I have with me
stephanie onsen who is the founder of
the dev ox conference and also the
creator of parlays which is a Java video
and slide sharing website so tell me a
little bit more about what you're going
to be doing at javaone Stefan Stefan
well last year we need to talk about
parlays and where we were standing at
that at that time which was a flex air
based environment and we especially
focused a bit on the jax-rs and the
history because it was running on
glassfish and a fool you know java ee
environments what we've done since then
is that we've moved or basically
redeveloped both the client and the
server and more importantly we've moved
away from flash to a full html5
experience and and we also moved the
architecture to an a full amazon cloud
instance so that's what that was rather
a big architectural shift and you
accomplish this just in the in the past
year with a relatively small team yeah
but a small team but you know our team
that we really got some rock star
developer sonar TN yeah like um yeah you
have or Decker's who is going to be
joining you in san francisco right
exactly i mean he basically learned like
puppet and chef and that whole amazon
the ruby ish type of environment in a
couple of weeks well he's washing up
presentations on an easy stuff for him
yeah he's you seen the best talk about
what they did in in to our one-hour
chunks that's that's enough right well
it looks like oh yeah oh yeah there was
a good talk about Patrick Dubois on chef
and so on so he is like he's eating our
own dog food basically I mean he's
learning a lot from all the talks that
we have over 3000 dogs on that part what
are we shows people the UM the UI
parlays which we've been talking about
yeah so the nice thing is
because it's now html5 it just works on
the ipad so you can just go with your
ipads and and start enjoying these dogs
what's really cool which is a feature
that been developed is scrubbing so you
can really go through a talk and look at
the slides before you actually go into
the talk so that already allows you to
you know skip maybe certain things that
you already know you can also just
quickly read on the description and see
what it's about or just go deeper into
the facts and start searching on tags
then if you go to the top let's take
this one from dev box last year and
what's really nice which I use a lot is
that well first of all you already see
the big block so like here you can see
it's a big demo so as a developer you
off you just want to see the demo parts
but there's also a possibility to
already slide out the talk and just
actually have a quick glance over the
slides and then you say oh what's this
so you can click on that one it takes
you immediately to that slide and then
we can let hardly talk about laying that
part nice hi so what's also very cool
that people like is that you can now
also watch talks fast start working so i
can say like talk fast i hope you do
after this session you'll see a lot
namespaces in that under the name Jack
and what's the color still doable right
it's early and study come listen she
does a bit faster funny meme I don't
know some of those things will not be
named out to be yeah yeah come on you
can still kind of doesn't understand
yeah you really can't and it's a
lifesaver I mean that way you can what
you told maybe no off the time or over
in 30 minutes instead of one hour so
that's yeah that's a new feature too so
you've been actually been adding things
to your web based version usually people
dumb down the UI to to move things to
HTML yeah yeah and the nice thing is as
well as the comments that's starting to
really pick up because it's right in
your face I'm now logged in with my
tweets handle so i can add comments so
like this one from her johnson got quite
a bit of feedback you have it's the talk
with the most collins so people can
really interact with each other yeah he
says he's a controversial guy oh yeah he
definitely is and another nice feature
i go to j focus today have all the talks
there as well what we actually support
is not only a embedding a talk but in
bedding the food channel so I know
matches is probably listening so if you
go to to his side of 2013 you will get
the same basically layout and
functionality from what I've just shown
you on the homepage but now basically
white labels on much of his website see
Sharon taste didn't slip you something
too yes but he's actually he's a good
guy he's in a he's in chat and he helps
support me for my night hacking tour
last year in the Nordic region yeah
exactly so that's actually one of his
top see he gave at devoxx UK so you know
it's all cross-pollination going
backwards and forwards but what's nice
now is that yeah the full talk is
embedded in his website so you don't
really even see that there's parlays
behind it so people stay on his websites
which which is a good thing so that's
that's really something that makes me
you know really happy what we are really
working on these days and I'm hoping to
get a really a very good working version
of that by Java one which is a you know
in a couple of weeks we're doing
Sprint's of two weeks so every two weeks
we're deploying bug fixes and new
features is the possibility to do
mashups with YouTube so you can already
do this which is already very stable you
can have like you upload a talk so this
is a demo have some tags Java 1 2013 I
select my channel like tests and select
a PDF like this and then it's uploading
we're using PHP for the moments and
that's one of the new things we are
doing is that we migrating from PHP to
know GS so that way we can continue in
Java scripts because we have built up
quite a bit of JavaScript Oh over the
year over the last year now so that will
become even more stable that we have it
all in one language main screen but this
talk has been now been uploaded we've
extracted the text for search you can
now go to that presentation
and this is basically what SlideShare
does you know you have you have the
different slides you have your preview
just like this and what's renau really
nice because I've uploaded this dog I
have a bit more possibilities well we
also have analytics which is new so
we've added integration with Google
Analytics but this is this is more
interesting is the timeline editing
actually you and Ben and heart are
working on this as I as I actually speak
is the possibility to actually now add
YouTube or Vimeo to an existing slide
deck so I think if i add because that's
actually still cash so let me make sure
I have to write on it and see if that
works I have some two videos of YouTube
in my cash here and which which you can
find on youtube you can just play that
and it has a nice intro video so what
you can do is actually take that video
and put it on the timeline put it all
the way to the left and if I now hide
this you will laugh see that i have this
youtube video with the slides I can just
play this night yeah and if you to
purchase nicely and it's been lagging
and yeah there is it not a place like a
huge loss can be paralyzed for well
we're streaming from youtube so that's
not really us it's really using the
player and you saw it was actually
switching to the next slide so what
would be fun and this is still
experimental but what would be fun is
that I could actually go in here like
maybe here and then say split it and now
I'm actually editing the YouTube video
in our timeline so if i go back i have
another video from youtube which i would
like now to the compliments so i put
this back next to this one and now if I
move this away I actually have a mash-up
of to youtube videos so that will go
back here it's playing and then it goes
to the next slide and it now shows me
nice nice nice nice that gives me
goosebumps look my hair is go like oh
this is yeah this is really nice so this
is basically you know we all say if
slideshare and youtube will have a baby
it will be named parlays so it's really
combination of the best of both worlds
and you're going to talk more about this
infrastructure at your job one session
yes the bill we will talk a bit about
the infrastructure but more about also
the JavaScript these days I call it
voodoo scripts I mean if you look what
these guys are doing and what you need
to do to make it all work together it's
not JavaScript anymore you need to do
some voodoo so yeah that's that's the
idea cool so um what else are you gonna
be what else have you been doing
recently I heard about your new
programme de box for kids yeah that's
that's really something i'm really also
very passionate about it was basically
my son who pushed me forward with this
and he's actually the guy here in the
red pants here yeah they've got a nice
diesel now robot in front of them yeah
tech toys to play with yeah tasha and
daniel that they're really stepping up
in this whole initiative and moving it
even further than then I was envisioning
it is that it's becoming an annual event
so we're doing a one-day event for
children between 10 and 14 years where
they're basically tasting a bit of
engineering IT but even electronics oh
so this year I'll be giving a one-hour
Arduino session which is based on the
experience of dev box for netherlands
that works for kids netherlands roy van
rain did an arduino session there and
the children really grasped that very
fast i mean they really know how yeah
they just play with that they take it
they listen and they start moving it
forward so so what we're going to do
this here is that we're going to do
green foots now as well so green foot we
will have now programming will have lego
mindstorms the latest ones will have
arduino syrah hi ladies leave a three
run job on them yeah I know they were
released last weekend I believe so so
yeah that we're doing that the sixth of
October honest
day for the Flemish children the 12th of
October we're doing it in the mood for
the French children also on the twelfth
we are doing the same event in Denmark
in Argus we're doing one in the
Netherlands in den här the one is
happening in Canada there's once
scheduled in France in Switzerland so
you know it's really going global and
it's basically the the big kids that
come to dev Oaks that they got to get
inspired and a lot of them have children
so they're starting so well we should do
the same thing and like even Mexico was
thinking of doing one so it's kinda
that's that's really really cool and i
can relate having i am young technology
technology leaning daughter at home yeah
but it's like somebody saying here on
the on the chat box is that at school
they really don't get inspired using
these type of things and i think it's
it's at freely at that age between 10
and 14 that children will think about
their career and you know i mean like a
really astonishing fact is that twenty
five percent of the children were girls
so if we can inspire these girls at that
age then that's the right moment to do
so and they might actually that might
maybe increase a bit that the number of
girls IVC and IT and I know it's a very
small drop we only had 70 so 70 children
in Belgium but if you start adding up
all the other day box for kids
initiatives we're getting close to 500
children I top of my head but you know
it's it rapidly adds up right so cold
it's a small circle yolks are interested
in the box for kids where can they find
more information about the M it just
contact us if they search on Google
devoxx for kids they will find a website
in MELAS they can tweet to me directly
or whatever and do more initiatives we
have it doesn't even have to be named 10
Fox for kids as long as you do something
for kids so like now I've heard that
g'kaan is doing G call for kids go to
which is a you know a big conference is
doing go to for juniors or something I
believe also for children so it looks
like people are getting inspired by
like catching on you started a new
technology trend well you know I don't
think I'm the only person doing this and
there's so many people who want to move
this forward so yeah let's list let's do
it no alright cool so thanks a lot for
the short interview and I look forward
to seeing you and San Francisco in a few
weeks likewise oh thanks for the
opportunity for the demo Stefan and the
see you in San Francisco at the BBQ i
believe it's saturday right yep yep
we're going to have some nice real
brazilian cha area by our our buddy and
fellow jag leader Bruno Souza move
looking forward to that still alright
see you there and thanks everyone you're
