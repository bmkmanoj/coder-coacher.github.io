employee from Oracle technology Network
and I'm here today with Lea Lea Chilton
hello thank you for having me here thank
you for being interviewed sure soli you
are an expert on architecture and how to
scale it and how to move from the micro
services infrastructure to know from a
regular infrastructure to the my
questions service-based architectures
yeah I spent seven years at amazon and I
help them move to a server space
architecture and I and I've spent a lot
of time talking about German space
architectures and helping companies
including New Relic moving to server
space architectures okay so so we talk a
lot about microservices so what is your
I mean what do you think about it or how
how do you think developers should think
about microservices that's a great
question i think there's a lot of hype
around microservices right now and i
think the the important thing that i
like developers to think about is
services are great and i helped in a lot
of places but don't just buy into the
make services small make them as small
as possible and therefore your code will
be simpler because what happens is as
you build just your services arbitrarily
small you end up with so many of them
that complexity of the interconnections
becomes actually your biggest problem
but what I advocate instead is to find
the right boundaries where you build
your service your service boundaries and
and plan for them and some of your
services are going to be quite large
some of them are going to be quite small
size isn't the issue is to make sure
that the services are built and designed
at the right proper boundaries and
that's the really important thing okay
so when you how do you decide on those
boundaries I'm sure how do you bundle
together on one service yeah let's
there's some really good guidelines you
want to decide where your service
boundaries are and and basically what I
like to think of is is is you want to
group specific functionality together
you want to co-locate services they use
the same data
in the same services you want to to
reduce traffic between services as much
as possible so you want to make sure
that your services are designed in such
a way that that they're there
intelligently self-contained yet and
that the dependencies they have our
natural dependencies and there's a
there's a set of steps to you can go
through I talked about in my book that
will help you walk through that process
so and do you look at at the updates I
mean how you will update those modules
and that's that's how you would you
should put this prioritization of what
you put in 10 service I think the really
v I want the steps basically oh yeah so
the I think that the real important
thing is is to make sure your your data
is self contained in system and then
make sure your team is designed around
being able to support that sir okay so
one of the things I talk about is you
know your team and by a team i'm talking
about a set of developers of around four
to six people it is a small team not the
large idea of a team but it's your small
team each service should be owned by a
single team and that single team should
have complete and total ownership and
responsibility for all aspects of that
service a team can can support multiple
services but a single service should be
sized appropriately so that only one
team is necessary to manage it the
ownership is really what's important
there and that ended you that allows you
to build the ladies at the service
boundary that the service owners are
responsible for and their job is to make
sure those essays are maintained and
once you have to find SL ladies at your
service boundaries then users and other
services that need their service know
what they can depend on what they can't
depend on and that allows them to meet
their wrestle aids to their consumers as
well so by having well-designed
well-defined boundaries self-consistent
dana and strong team ownership you're
able to to to build your system a lot
better ok and so what about scalability
so how do you scale I mean
so do you then great so how do you go
about it so you can scale that you you
make scaling to the decisions at the
individual service level okay and so it
shouldn't matter where your service is
located other than for whatever other
practical networking reasons you need
within your application but you want to
make sure that you can you build it in
such a way that it can naturally
horizontally scale so keep your data
contained within for a given service
within a single data store that is is
itself scalable to the level that you
need it to be the service instances
themselves that should be completely
stateless other than for caching or
anything else is needed so you can
horizontally scale as easily as possible
you should to build all your services
that way or as many of them as you can
yeah one of the questions I get asked a
lot of us scaling is how do i scale how
do I build a scalable data store for all
of my data and what I find a lot of
people do is they lump all their data
into a single thing and they say I have
all this data and and because this has
to be self consistent all of it has to
be self consistent I can't use eventual
consistency have to use a strong
consistently model because of these
three use cases and what I tell people
is now think about your data separate
out the data that really requires a
strong consistency model it really
requires your tight integration separate
that out everything else can be
eventually consistent can be stored into
a different sort of data store and what
most applications will find is that you
know ninety ninety-five percent of their
data doesn't have the strong consistency
requirements that some of the data has
so take a small amount of data that is
the needs of strong consistency use an
appropriate data store for that that's
that has maybe as not as quite as good
of a scalability model but it's a lot
smaller data store so it should be
easier in general to scale that service
because it's doing a lot less in general
but the vast majority of data which
doesn't have to have a strong
consistency then though
there's a whole bunch of options
available for you for for scaling that
data store that doesn't require you to
to UM to maintain strong consistency and
so by making that separation you're able
to scale a lot better okay anything else
you want to say before I say read the
book yeah now I think the big thing
about about scaling that I'd like to to
talk a lot about is availability because
the place where you run into scalability
problems shows up primarily as an
available or the issue so think about
availability understand your
availability needs for your application
and the second thing is risk management
and that is understand where your
vulnerabilities are no you know know
what areas of your application are
well-constructed not well constructed
understand where you need to put your
effort in understand the risk of
spending effort here versus here under
your application and that will help
improve your availability and ultimately
your scalability okay so that's the book
the book to read for like scalability
and I actually textured in architecture
thank you so much thank you thank you
for bein talking to us so I appreciate
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
