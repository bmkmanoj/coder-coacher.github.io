technology Network and we're here at the
developers conference or TDC and South
Paulo and I'm with venezia singer I
Venezia's hello Tori how are you doing
I'm fine having a lot of fun with the
conference yeah I could tell you're
losing your voice a little bit losing my
voice it's a good sign haha yeah so tell
me about what you're doing what your
track is here at TDC we are presenting
Arduino with a home automation and
robotics projects so we have J home
automation which is a complete open
source platform for home automation
based on Java Enterprise Edition right
and that's a Dukes Choice Award winner
last year yes yes congratulations thank
you we are proud about it and we are
happy to have this this this award and
with j home you can automatically open
source hardware and open source software
and a lot of Java inside the project
right so tell me you've got all sorts of
things back here just tell me about one
or two of them so we have here J home
automation running in this computer we
can use it as simple web interface to
turn on and turn off the light but we
have a sound sensor interface so I can
also use a violin to turn on and turn
off the lights so I'm going to play
different notes
so you can practice violin and turn on
and off lights at the same time yeah you
can have light effects if you are doing
it wrong you can have a red light
flashing Wow so it just it's infinite
the ways you could apply this right yes
is all about clear TVG it's all about
having fun and learning different things
that is not common in corporate
applications so it's very good to study
ejbs turning on and turning off lights
instead of doing database application
because you will be more motivated to do
that by this way okay so you see
something in the physical world that
shows you that your code is right that's
it excellent so tell me how are you
making the future with java so we are
working hard for extending java for
physical computing and integrating
physical computing cisco stuff with java
and with social networks like Twitter so
you can use Twitter to drive your house
should turn on turn off the lights up
inside your house so we are trying to
work with three things physical
computing Java and social networks so
that's the idea of the project using
robots and domotics and we are also
using Java to teach kids to how to teach
you how to program and write software
since they are 30 years old or something
right young children we have to train
the next generation of Java developers
right yes and they are doing a very good
job in kind of scary yeah kind of story
right yeah so thank you very much Vinnie
Vinicius we look forward to your
exciting demos at javaone San Francisco
and Java one Latin America coming up in
December Thank you Thank You Tory for
coming to TDC it's a big pleasure to
have you here again we are almost like a
family because we travel a lot together
yes thank you very much bye bye this is
Tori wheel with the orc
