are at devoxx my name is Jana noiret and
I'm from Oracle technology Network and
today and right now I have Josie Palma
Josie we don't need to introduce because
he is so famous now an expert in java
java SE 8ee soon but so tell us what you
do anything in order the technology that
you tell me with such an introduction I
guess I did you an IV I could just see
say say to the people saying that I I i
participated conferences I give talks
about java SE eight lambda stream
collectors things like that i also write
articles for otn and java magazine among
other things and let you mostly focused
on java SE yes yes yeah so right now I'm
also involved in the development of CDI
in Java EE out of the expert group but
currently we are working under the hood
we are about to release a new version of
the specification and things are really
moving currently in the Java EE space so
it's better to wait that things are
stabilized to talk more about it i think
the sect of the talk i did yesterday
morning it's more about collections
right the connection framework
absolutely it's a in fact the starting
point is nearly a joke made on twitter
by a short marks who is very famous and
it's currently writing code for the for
the jdk in the collection framework is
an oracle employee and it tweeted about
a year ago with with this doctor
deprecated twitter account should we
duplicate linked list there were many
there were many answers to that some not
very serious but some very serious from
ken Fogle from Richard Warburton Richard
said
i Richard I rejection in the audience so
with you within live without thinking
more than a minute the answer is yes
okay on Twitter you have is not a small
amount of words to make an answer
because this was a fast answer but but
but yes I mean this question in fact is
it tremely interesting and to answer it
but my point in this is in this
university talk was to to tell people
okay if you want to answer this question
fully you need to answer many other
questions you need to consider
algorithms implementations because
arraylist and linked lists are two
implementations of the same interface
you need to consider how are the CPU
organized from the microelectronics
point of view levels of cache and stuff
like that and you need to at the end of
the day when when you once we have
you've done all this you can be sure
about the answer so you need to apply
benchmarks to measure the performance of
both implementations this is this is
what it is about so so it's a in fact
this question is interesting because you
have to consider many many things you
have to consider many aspects and you
have to seriously work on many many
aspects of the problem to really have an
interesting answer so do we have the
answer then we have yes there is an
answer and definitely when you don't
know you should always choose a released
by default which is not obvious that you
have to consider that the correction
framework has been developed 16 years
ago and what was true 16 years ago is
not true anymore today because the CPU
have changed all right 15 years ago cpu
didn't have all these levels of cache
didn't have all this multi-core
architecture so things have changed much
at that time there were many
use cases where the linked list was more
performant could outperform arraylist
but due to point to chasing to cache
misses things like that that comes from
the new one you not that near but from
the new architecture of the micro
microchips now they are really start out
from legalized in almost all the cases
almost all the cases so they are one or
two use cases that have been mentioned
by a short where yes you could you
should use linked list instead of a
realist but they are very too there are
really two very precise suitcases and
Oliver all of the other use cases go for
the ArrayList this should be your
default implementation when you want to
use lists in your application okay so
you you talked about the linked list but
you also talked about other part of the
collection framework right like the hash
yeah the second map in German ein we
will have a new patterns to create
pre-filled lists sets and maps written
by swat much by the way they were all
going to be extremely useful and i
wanted to make this kind of a joke hey
if the problem in the performance of
linked list is the point of cheesy sits
pointer come from objects what about
implementing lists and sets without
objects and of course in Java 8 when you
don't want to to to to work with objects
you can work with lambdas so can you
implement lists and sets when lambdas it
turns out that you can by using tricks
sometimes dirty tricks that you should
not be using in your applications
clearly but it's also a good occasion to
show people that in fact you can
implement many add-ons even well-known
pattern for the gov the Gang of Four
using lambdas and this this is what
basically this is basically what I did I
use the template method pattern and
implemented it with the lambda
functional interface lambdas and default
methods and it works very well and its
really very performant really it
outperforms even the arraylist on on
simple cases but it has drawbacks and
because of those drawbacks it's my it
might be not such a good idea to use
this this way of writing things in the
case of the list under set in the
general case of that of the template
method really don't have any problem to
implement that with London's but in the
in the use case I showed yesterday all
right you you can you can watch them you
can use them but carefully be careful
what you're doing with that yeah okay so
the the talk will be recorded so there
anybody can buddy it could be already
available on YouTube the the slide is
yeah the the slides are my slide share
count the the code is on my github
account so everything is shared as usual
and you Twitter account is yes I usually
use my Twitter account to advertise this
so if you follow me on Twitter just a
perm are you will have the links to all
these resources absolutely cool okay
thank you so much thank you so much
thank you given thank you bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
