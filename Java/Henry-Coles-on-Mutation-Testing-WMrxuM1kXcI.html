on so it's actually back from the 70s
she thought about how you can test the
quality of a test suite so these days
most people do things like peer review
or using code coverage or from doing TDD
so they sort of assume that sort of this
I have been a good test and I've got
high coverage or someone's checked it
for me it looks like that s looks good
or about the test for us it must be good
turns out when you sort going to look at
these things that matter maybe maybe
you're being a little bit overconfident
so there's a techniques and 70s actually
will tell you particular band so whether
or not your tests are good it's actually
really really simple idea what you do is
you deliberately introduce a book into
your code yeah run the test suite
manager at the texture yes it's test
suite fails then you've caught bug it's
a good test suite if it doesn't fail
then something might be wrong yeah that
makes sense but how do you introduce
bugs into the coat what you could it
yourself and if I do to that so /
there's sometimes oh sometimes not
that's until so well so you've got you
know a million line program trying to
introduce you know book synaptic see
Tess you can find them well you're not
to get very far and think back to all
theoretically however you do it and
whether if you can put a book in just
like that then if you have a test suite
that takes 10 seconds to run and let's
face it most test Suites take much
longer than that yeah I've had test
suites which have taken hours to days
hope you're not unit test suite sir so
you need test mean most people try to
keep them under five minutes for a
really large code base of the other
sorts of testing they go on top of that
and take much longer but you know
testing them you talking seconds or
minutes oh boy hopefully but much he
want to put you know you've got a large
code base to try and actually put a lot
of and being for bugs in there to
actually really know whether or not you
you could do it you'd find them you know
tens or hundreds of thousands of bugs
multiplied by the time your test suite
looking at hours weeks days to turn out
the code base so this was the technique
seemed very interesting it was
academically interesting it was studied
for forty-odd years but just not
practical but not practical and one of
the reasons being that the performance
other reasons as well but maybe I've
time discussed just now so a few years
ago I got interested in this as a bit
ball
to be honest so it's an interesting
problem and start having a play around
we sort of think about it that's the
problems aren't really unsurmountable
app easily open source put it called pi
test which for you know sometimes they
like Joe two-time if you go through you
know that the brute force method be
looking about two days to analyze joder
time based on aliens let this test we
don't there aren't of mutants pi test
does it in about three minutes which is
pretty good it's a visible improvement
to think and because it's in because
it's practical because I'm usable people
start to use it so I've now found that
all over the world the place is now
mutation testing their code it's
becoming would say popular it's still
quite a niche thing well yeah I mean but
probably for organizations and
businesses which really need to know
that their test suites are high quality
or actually catching meaningful by the
sins I think you'd be hard-pressed to
find a business or developer says it's
not important there Tess it was high
quality when okay the consequence might
be different Soviet maybe it depends on
what the ramifications are if your tests
are not telling you what you want get
mean as the on absolute scale I think
some people are much more right to
believe that their test suites that need
to be hot to the high quality but now if
your business goes bust you'll probably
personally quite upset even if you
haven't killed anybody so because of the
cost is that much lower doesn't really
matter so they've got you know hyper for
guys like soon the Large Hadron Collider
using pi tests and yeah Larry that would
have a high risk of failure but if I
then have catch manufactures people in
tractor sales banks in this every
commented a software so you the
permission to use it is relatively low
and so why not use it yeah yeah let's
call so we were looking at this earlier
but it looks like you have a project
website at PI test p I test that was it
ordered all cats without or again it's
an open source project it's open source
yet so he chokes can just download the
give it a try absolutely so it's a
integrates is almost everything got made
into plugging grades I log in the Sam
plugin not that many people use it hits
integrations so now plug in check it got
its integrates with most of the sort
jumping and after how hard is that the
like set it up and integrate it with
random prize
if a bit with Gradle its way often have
to do nothing at all I was that aims to
be 0 comma fig it might not work for you
busy a config but if you have to put
something at the palm then yes like any
of them maven plugin cool okay sounds
exciting so I'm looking forward to
hearing more about the project thanks
for the very short interview thank you
four hooks watching the live stream you
can watch their recordings at night
hacking calm and then interact with us
by tweeting to hashtag night hacking so
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
