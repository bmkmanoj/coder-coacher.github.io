Network and I'm here today at devoxx
interviewing Jim Weaver and Garrett grin
valid hi hi hello so we're here today to
talk about the I IOT community yeah so
Jim what are we doing in the IOT
community well what's not a new stuff
well you and I and Garrett are actually
leading the IOT community net page site
and and so maybe you could tell me some
of the things that are some of the new
cool things that are happening on that
site well it's okay so what I really
like about this page is that it's it's a
lot of things of what what the community
is doing so every showed a lot of blogs
for example and it's fascinating to see
all the projects I mean it's
mind-boggling actually to see the
diversity of projects of boards of
technologies that people are using and
also using Java so yeah so now you just
put an entry on there and in a news and
announcements entry on that page what
was that about so we did hear a hacker
fest uh-huh and for two days and we did
so the haka fest was with a panel that
finishes and yeah I Center put together
and it's a set of boards it's a lot of
Raspberry Pi boards with Arduino and
they also have the panel where all the
sensors are accessible so the hackers
come get trained in the morning and then
they built their own application in a
couple of hours or if they're really
beginners in several hours but we give
them like two days to create something
why did it happen happen to you it
happened here the first two days of the
university days and it's it's just
wonderful to see people create projects
and
at the end of the two days they do a
presentation and so we recorded some of
the presentations and we have everything
online afterwards now one of the reasons
why we have this site is to promote this
idea of Internet of Things among the
development community because it's
something that's coming in the industry
now you know as they say by 2020 every
person on earth it'll be like seven
billion people on the earth or more than
that but every one of us will have an
average of about six devices so the
development community now is mostly
focused on enterprise development and
you know web front-ends things like that
but also very heavy server-side
development and that's changing now
because of the proliferation of devices
you know these things are getting
smarter or they're in our pockets
they're they're measuring our footsteps
and blood pressure and things like that
and assisting us with every everyday
activities and if there are six or seven
per person then that becomes this this
really it could be an unmanageable
quantity of devices or if we prepare
correctly prepare developers correctly
to be able to program these devices and
and put structures in place that monitor
and control them then we can have a very
productive world of development one that
is you know that is powered by Java on
these devices so we have all the
underlying security and the AP is that
that Java already has and and that
leverages Java developers expertise on
these devices now one of the leading
edge developers in in Java in the
embedded space especially like with
raspberry PI's the the small $35 board
that developed for for helping people
get up to speed on on embedded
development is Garrett Greenville he's
been doing a lot of a lot of development
for fun on the Raspberry Pi and I wanted
to ask you Garrett what what kinds of
things have you been doing well you know
I started I was here last year right yes
you're here Exxon that embedded devices
yes enemy time a lot of things happened
and I try to use a lot of raspberry PI's
in my house and just everything that is
possible to connect to it and it's a lot
of fun but you know after finding myself
having five raspberry PI's somewhere in
my house I thought that's not the right
approach and now I started in sensor
networking so that means i would like to
use the PI as some kind of name of the
server right that only collects all the
data from the sensors and then I can and
store it somewhere in the database and
then I can talk to that pie and get the
data with a desktop application or
whatever it is and the final plan is to
get opened orphan involved as use that
to synchronize the sensor data with
desktop development stuff or with the
server side so I am in the beginning
right now but the idea is to take all
these pies back from my house and just
replace them with tiny sensors and hook
up many sensors and just use one pie and
collect all the data because you don't
need 700 megahertz just to measure
temperature and it's just over the
talking okay so that that's at the
moment that's my idea and there I have
many more ideas with wearable devices
you can do so many things I'm playing
around the bigger bone black where you
can run java 8 on with half load the
cubieboard to which also say belong to
run the JDK 8 a half load so you can do
a lot of things it's it's amazing and
for me it's like you know over the last
10 years the server side who was
prepared very well and now it's time for
the embedded side to catch up with it
and combine all the things in one make
Java world right so suddenly everything
comes together now with Java ME embedded
so it's a
yeah rent you one offer absolutely agree
I really agree with that anything else
or how can well ya on that I ochi
community dot in that page we have an
aggregation of blogs on the right side
and so as the community is blogging I
would like to know I would like people
to send me an email james weaver at
oracle com so let me know what the URL
of the iot blogging that you that you it
that you do is like the RSS feed for
that and so that we can add that to the
blog aggregation it's a really exciting
set of blogs that were aggregating and
so every day there's lots of new
material about IOT and about you know
new Kickstarter projects and things like
that and by going through that you just
gained more and more of an excitement
about new iot kinds of things that
people are exploring and it becomes
evident that this thing is just really
taking off and and the developers are
going to really be pushed in that
direction so you know let's let's jump
on it wonderful thank you so much for
talking to us Thanks thank you thank you
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
