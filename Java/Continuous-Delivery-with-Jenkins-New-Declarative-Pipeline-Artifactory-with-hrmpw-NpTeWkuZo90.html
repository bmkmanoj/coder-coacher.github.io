Ian employee from Oracle technology
Network and we are here at the J Fox amp
up in Napa and my guess right now is a
Patrick wolf Patrick hi hello how's it
going
very good so um so what do you do I am
the director of product management
cloudBees focused on the Jenkins open
source product and the the new pipeline
features that we're building in for that
so I'm here but for here today to talk
about how to use Jenkins pipeline with
artifactory okay so you would talk yeah
so you talk is about Jenkins so what
what's what you talked about I presented
earlier this morning about how to use
wellhow Jenkins is growing and used for
more and more teams for doing continuous
delivery as well as just continuous
integration especially with the the
Jenkins pipeline and our new declarative
syntax for that to quickly and easily
build a continuous delivery pipeline to
create war files for your java programs
and then build containers off of top of
that and deploy those out to artifactory
so you also talk about a blue ocean so
what is that so blue ocean is something
we've been developing in concert with
pipeline as a new interface for Jenkins
Jenkins is an old product that's been
around for 11 years so the UI is a
little dated it's it's functional but
it's just not very modernized so blue
ocean is our first attempt to modernize
the Jenkins user interface focus
specifically on pipelines and the
visualization and creation of continuous
delivery pipelines to make it much
easier for the new breed of users coming
in that haven't dealt with Jenkins
before they could be new to continuous
delivery and just kind of democratize
the whole continuous delivery process
and building that on on top of Jenkins
so it's a lot about like files and files
format is that right
what pipeline is is about creating the
files in building that and blue ocean is
about just visual
as in the process of all the stages that
goes through from the time a commit
comes in to it's built to where it gets
stored in artifactory and then
eventually gets deployed either to one
of the cloud providers or gets stored in
and bin tray for consumption by someone
else to be to be the final end point for
that so blue ocean shows you that
end-to-end workflow for how where your
code is and how it got there so any nd
special tips that you have like when
people use a Jensen than the blue ocean
I just to keep it simple as much as
possible first don't try to get too
complex because you know don't boil the
ocean as much as you can and just get
out there and you know play around with
it and participate in the Jenkins
community as much as possible it's a
community of 150,000 installations
across the world and the more people
that contribute to emails and IRC and
and and just commit code back the better
the products going to be okay so and
yeah anything else you want to share
about DevOps and that you had in your
comes in a in your presentation um
nothing I can think of really off top my
head more than just the you know it's
great to be here at Swamp up I think
this is a great event and definitely
finding a lot of interesting people to
talk to about DevOps while we're here so
it's been a very focused conference and
I'm really happy to see that well thank
you for taking the time and talking to
us so thank you graduate thanks for
having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
