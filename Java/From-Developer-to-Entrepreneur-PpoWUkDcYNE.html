yes it's working I think we're alive
yeah also recording it's recording
yes so hi everyone this is Bruno Sosa
also known as the Brazilian Java man and
I'm here at night hacking at devoxx
where we are interviewing very very cool
people to discuss about all kinds of
things around Java technology so I think
you should be paying attention there's a
live stream and also all this these
programs are being recorded
yes and I'm here with betterback Bremen
are you saying it well very well I don't
share it in Dutch one time
okay that's Bremen Oh Bremen okay Bremen
yes very good
okay so Beth Bremen from the NL jug
chick you're right yes yes oh and we're
gonna discuss here a little bit you know
you've you've been doing first of all
you just came out from J fall
yes it's an amazing conference that you
guys did yeah how was it I was amazing
we we moved to new venue last week and
we had 1500 attendees we're fully packed
and it was very good to do the
conference a new venue it's just like
like deaf Fox we are in a cinema mm-hmm
and in the cinema we we have even a lot
of room the the biggest room is even
bigger than the big room here mm-hmm
but it was very very good I should say
ask some some of the guy some of the
guys we were seated tweets
well yes mostly they are in Dutch not
all of them but I'm looking back to a
very very good conference and we are
close to their folks as not just because
we are competitors but you are equal to
each other we we serve we serve a lot of
people and definitely have a lot of
people and the international speakers
can come to j4 in the weekend ago the
Amsterdam and then they go to death of
that's pretty cool so I invite you to
come next year also to Jeff yes where I
talk about this how I'll be there but
the important thing is yes Jai fall and
we're here Dave walks in Belgian and
it's it's very very good you have to be
in a conference with lots of other
people we can talk with you speak
needs new people why participate in
events is important for a developer to
increase their career to improve their
career improve their career well I think
it's it's important for for them if you
if you are a developer Java developer
you are a serious Java developer I think
you should improve your career why well
if you want to make even better codes if
you want to make amazing projects if you
want to say to your to your business
manager let's change this or not change
that then you have to be feeded why a
lot of lot of content and so on that's
why conferences are a good place for
right and so and so do you think that
that's that's the place where we can
actually learn new stuff or we just come
here to have a new idea what's important
for us to study watch what do you think
is the best way I think I think I think
maybe even both way some of the
developers coming to here just as to say
well I'm going to one big conference to
pick up the new new stuff and I say well
if that's done I know enough and I can
implement it you know why you know the
other way is also to to learn a lot of
things to teach and then not to teach
but to learn the things and say well ok
let's say microservices know then you
here in the conference you are a lot of
stuff around to micro-services ok if you
think that's huge
good team to implement it in our company
they could say well yeah to read the
book or go to course or or whatever or
as consultants to come in to help them
write the way to what you do it perfect
now but you have been you know you are a
job developer you've you start your
career as a job developer and then in
developer as a developer ok and then but
then you move it into creating your own
company and then you become an
interpreter yeah and you know was that a
hard move to you know from from
developer to intrapreneur no I think now
it was a smooth one was a move line ok
I think that
I'm still a techie guy because now at
this moment I'm not writing any goat
anymore right but I'm still and also
going to the conference's and not just
for network you know just to hear what's
all about what's new stuff what's cool
stuff and that sort of things uh-huh
when it was developers I was already
interested in all all kind of new
technologies and that's why I wasn't
going already to it all the conference's
know then you are in the conference you
think are crying mm-hmm let's do that
the other end I was one of the developer
was also able to communicate because
some developments on Wow yes developers
and developers right and say well maybe
you can also help other developers to to
make a step forward in their career
that's what I like so that's was my move
little bit too to management mm-hmm and
also in my company whether I was working
for I will say well I want to have the
Java community because then I was asking
to setup a java unit I want to move the
app unity the F community more to give
more impulse and sort of things that's
why I was connecting to today no Jack
mhm and also feared energic
I started now a company as part of
bigger company as luminous luminous in
the Dallas luminous Rotterdam and that's
also be because of the conference
because the energy AK one of the members
of tenet Jeff bought was big
intrapreneur of luminous yeah that's the
way it worked and now yes I'm an
entrepreneur and I want to run a company
but still what is to make you a better
developer I still be busy with with all
the stuff you see on conferences right
our people in luminous are a lot of
speaking of conferences and a lot of
going to conferences mm-hmm just to to
get all the stuff and also to spread the
word mm-hmm because I think that's also
important right so focus yeah oh so
you're going to conferences to learn
more to talk about your technology
should talk about your product and then
you know how do how do you focus on our
on what's really important for your
company discuss all the things you see
uncompress all the everything you read
on the internet because not only cause
of reads on the reading in that read
books and that sort of things you say
okay that's new stuff will buddy the
next height or not they should like
microsoft's wall it's it's a hype at
this moment mmm-hmm so everybody wants
to talk about it wants to know something
about it and also what I will do is I
will say to my to my work as a civil
just read it find something about it and
also PDF a little a lot of discussions
inside the company about this the whole
theme and then make it even better or
say well it's not good and that will
produce some new talks which also were
giving to the outside world right micro
services so what is suggestion that you
give you know for a developer that wants
to start its own startup or wants to
start its own business or you know once
you become an interpreter like you did
you know is there any special skill that
they should be learning just by just
being a developer being a wonderful
coder that's that's enough what it's not
do you suggest you know for if you're if
if I wanted to do this step and become
entrepreneur if you I think it's if you
have a dream make you say I want to do
that mmm-hmm and if there's a company or
say build a product then go for it I
think that's it that's it if you have a
dream of it and you put focus on it then
you can alot then you come can come a
level a lot of steps further even think
that's the most important thing you say
I want to do that and you can do it a
lot of people saying yes I'm developer
mmm-hmm yeah I'm developer and then go
to home and I say sitting on the bank in
the evening watching television yeah
yeah yeah I really wanted we a guy like
him uh-huh
and then then they stopped if you want
to be like the guy like him then go it
and try it because
devoxx okay follow that way the way like
Stefan is now here it's not just because
he's sitting on the bank and only
watching television uh-huh
then the conference is not coming you
have to do something about it right I
think that's the most important thing go
for it so keep doing keep doing if you
like and I think it's the same with you
you have also vision or not yeah I agree
with you I think that's that we need to
take steps right it's uh I like to say
that that a good idea it's worthless a
lot of people come to me and say oh you
know I have this good idea but I can't
tell anyone because a secret and I say
but idea just an idea is worthless
unless you go and you make it happen
right you have to work on it you have to
put the time you have to put you know to
do all the work or otherwise who knows
what it's a good idea or not that's why
how why a lot of good of these are not
coming out right a lot of a lot of good
a lot of good ideas just die in
someone's mind right yeah yeah I think I
think I've a very good solution for that
in that and I say you go in the bank and
I said well now I'm not sit on the bank
go for it then right put it on put it on
out the source put it on on the internet
and ask all the people if that's a great
idea
if it is a great idea then you will have
no people like it and will help you to
make the next step right I think that's
the way to do it that's the way to
become from developer one entrepreneur
and that's a good way for you to come to
a conference right at the confident can
talk with other people see if they like
the idea maybe can actually present on
you wanna talk yes that idea that you
have and makes me go forward also yes a
lot of people say well talking on the
conference is scary and I don't like
that yeah but even the big speakers here
I'm presenting a upstairs one time was
the first time one time was the first
train and I did at the focus and say I
want to tell this to the audience well
then do that no you will become come to
the next step I think that's why it
works excellent ok guys so that's bet
and giving you some ideas and some
for how to improve your career and I
think that's the thing we got to do we
got to keep improving all the time right
yes and just tweet me you see the
Twitter handle maybe I can help you to
help to make to the next step perfect or
algebra also because it's also good to
intrapreneur also yeah so so I think I
think our career is our responsibility
yes if we don't take care of it no one
will know ok so thanks a lot for
watching night hacking directly from dev
Vox and keep keep keep watching because
there's lots of very very good people
and good discussions going on here
