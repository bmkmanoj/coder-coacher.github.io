events and jug potency thanks for having
me here's Ben you're welcome
so I just I just drove it this morning
from yesterday still cliff dark yeah and
we're playing around an hour of us we're
gonna see if we get some cool stuff work
you know so I'll do a short presentation
bits and pieces with your delicates
presentation talk about the narrow red
light and then we'll hang play around 17
games you pull stuff and it's later on
off post the presentation on to Johnny
YouTube channel on the night packing
side good okay so first introductions
yeah
hi I'm Cody
oh thanks for the hope you enjoyed it hi
my name is quesadilla I'm a Java down
so this Thomas wickedest me too about
this session so I thought I will learn
what is happening here something a bit
interesting for me to learn about this
program Thanks my name is Thomas
was about casino you ever sleep in space
we should say thank you for your sponges
so we finally managed to to get the
other end of the ring okay so you guys
also for being with my packing stream we
get presents so take that like a sticker
and you also get another president as
well except quick some quick
announcements and then so this is the
Java manic which just came out recently
the march/april issue has stepped on
lenses and a swarm and
all I could stuff Carolina the editor is
looking for writers so if you guys want
to be a Java minute author let me know
you don't have to be an expert you just
have to be willing to put the time in to
learn something and write a short
article and there's a IOT developer
challenge going on so you can win one of
nine trips to Java one plus some
expenses if you create a application
with the Raspberry Pi and C owns the
roxbury piloting system well he needs
some good motivation for doing more
using it well will you go away one more
Raspberry Pi
oh cool somebody maybe the whoever has
the coolest robot projects by a plus
later and yeah so you can enter the
contest and you know with the price of
the Java one and then you can join me in
San Francisco so I'm the content share
for Java one San Francisco and call for
papers is open that's another way to get
a free ticket so you submit again you
talk about a minute yeah yeah yeah yes
there are many to go through them yeah
okay so it's easy these sort papers get
selected
also registrations open and we're having
a discount until May 2nd of $600 off the
usual price if you're considering going
this is the best time to get a ticket
because you can actually get reasonable
hotels once open world registration
opens and all the hotels start going and
you're going to be quite happy okay so
that's enough
advertisements let's switch to the my
other computer okay so first a little
bit about the Narula so this is um on
borrowing slides from the dev ops for
kids okay devops for kids is a program
for teaching kids technology and one of
the workshops which Daniel created is
workshop using it now rubba and I
translated the deck to English with some
help from Nicolas from all the barn
robotics and this is a good exercise to
go through so I'll just learn the robot
so the lab basically goes you want to
get the robot to you
yes you want to get the robot to pick up
a ball kind of interact with you and ask
for it and then walk around the room and
place the ball in a in a certain
location so these these might not look
like much but these little bouncy balls
are the perfect size for fitting in
those little three finger grip so if you
want to use these for that project or a
different project those are those are
quite good for them for gripping and
then something else that now can do is
he can follow now Marcus so you can
visually identify pieces of paper which
have this little this little circle on
them so you know you can use one of
these now marks put it somewhere there
room and then he'll come look around I
think they try to walk towards the now
marks so that's something else we can
play around with okay a little bit about
the now robot so the now robots is I
believe 2026 motors or something his
body
oh okay so you click them twice he gets
loose now so you know he has arms which
are fully articulated they can move and
rotate as well so you could make him
pick stuff up as well his hands have
pincers
so there's simply like open closed you
can't individually move the fingers head
has two cameras a forward facing camera
and a down facing camera they added the
down facing camera for out for playing
soccer we do balls or things it's easier
to just have him know what's there
rather keep looking down one of the
things this guy does is they get your
some international
robotic soccer event and this is now the
standard unit used for the competition
on the ears our speakers there's a
microphone as well so we can listen to
you right here
the head is tactile so when he touch
different parts of the head you can do
different things
I think in choreographed you can program
that like buttons for the front the back
in the rear front middle and rear
he is Wi-Fi of course because how we're
talking to him legs
are you think that they are a little bit
more flexible one of the things we'll
find out is he hopes his legs both turn
together at the pivot joint here so when
you want to like have one leg reach out
and do something the other leg turns so
that's why he looks a little funny when
he walks people didn't want the
animation because his legs are not at
the pelvis they're not good initially
articulated but other than that dude
legs are quite flexible as well and you
move this music and have them moving
around
he has sonar on his chest so these
things will actually pick up distance to
objects so you can have a walk and a
stop when he gets close to an object or
good bat see our slides with his foot oh
well their sensors does he have sonar
microphones cameras infrared oh yes so
his eyes are infrared transmitters and
receivers chest button if joy yeah so
that's everybody Oh bumpers on the feet
so he bumps into something with his feet
hello
stop
okay what about our buddy now there's
two ways for us Java devs to program him
the way which I've given you guys to
start with is using choreographed
software which is a visual programming
software and it's it's quite convenient
and easy to get started with if you've
never done for me before you basically
drop boxes wire them up with lines and
then press play so I'll show that
quickly you can also program him
directly
using any number of programming
languages including Java to do that you
need some extra software to access the
Revit directly and then you're using the
now cheat library so you look at the SDK
Doc's
for partnering like that so while you
guys are hacking on getting stuff work
in him I'll put together some Java
programs so you can try it as well
I have them for the older version I
remember if I have to upgrade them for
this version oh okay and now this
mission so this was what we asked the
kids for to do in the workshop but I
think for this we'll just you know you
guys can do your own project you don't
have to follow this template but it
might give you some ideas on things you
can do so the goal was to have him walk
towards you and stop in front of you I
believe the magical box for that is
motion tracker where he kind of looks
for something and walks towards it asks
you to give him the ball and ask you
where to put the ball so that's there's
a choice where you can ask you a
question and then based on your response
do different things since he has
text-to-speech and also he can do pickup
basic voice commands looks around
identifies the place you identified so
that was playing now marks so you can
put one of these in the room somewhere
have him try to
towards it goes there and places the
ball down so you know that's just how we
can walk in them put down the ball so
we're not actually gonna go through the
lab but let me switch to choreograph and
show you some stuff this is the basic
choreographic interface I have the
camera turned on right now although I
don't actually have the camera that's
weird
hey get one okay there we go now you can
see you can see exactly what he sees by
default I turn this off for now and you
can't see it because it's hidden on the
top right by default he does something
called um now like autonomous light so
when he first turned on he was kind of
moving and looking around if he presses
a little heart button he goes to an
autonomous life mode now he's gonna
start looking around if he sees a face
he'll actually try to follow it yes you
can see the camera he's kind of trying
to dart around and watch faces when he
loses track of a face then we'll just
kind of look around randomly and he also
when he's standing up he'll actually
like crab-walk left and right to kind of
follow people so to see that we have to
make him stand up no why don't you well
we're just going to search
stand okay that's how you use drag and
drop boxes then you wire them up so
whatever you wire up to start will play
when the you press the play button up
here
whatever you wire to end when that
executes the end that'll stop the entire
program that's kind of optional ish so
this should make them stand there's a
bunch of pre-programmed animations the
standard animation will get him to stand
from any position if he's lying on his
back or his front or sitting or whatever
he'll well just he knows how to head be
the stand and now he is doing on top of
this like wall wall standing so if we
can get his attention
yeah okay
come over here so you see what I'm
trying to follow my face um but the
autonomous lighting stuff is really
annoying and it gets his motors hot so
we're just gonna turn it off no more
autonomous life okay do this this
position in the new software this is his
favorite sitting position while he's
waiting for stuff to happen it's not
quite as stable as the you know sitting
on the table with his hands on his
elbows knees but it is faster to get to
a standing position from there so this
is fine as well just don't shake the
table too much or he'll fall backwards
yeah look at those guys now it's bad
enough that one camera pointed at me too
okay so there's lots of stuff you can do
I'm not gonna go through all the
different things but let's just pick up
they've one can't dance Tai Chi Chuan
and also show something else you can do
so notice I haven't actually hooked it
up with a line yet so you can hook it up
so it'll play right after he stands and
then I'll play this but if you don't
hook it up you can still execute it by
double-clicking olara so first he's
gonna stand because that stuff tough to
start and then if we double-click the
arrow here then we can force him to
execute that box and nervous following
images
forgiving it sometimes
I'm gonna take this cable out sometimes
when you're doing complex animations
it's better to deke able him
all right everybody run applause so
that's that's kind of the basics of
burning the narrow but you know you can
obviously do more complicated stuff you
can do stuff in in parallel as well so
if you want to execute two things
simultaneously just from one output
connected to two different boxes like
them this is this is obviously not a
good thing but you could tell them to do
Tai Chi and sit down at the same time oh
yeah from this output it'll do both
those in parallel and sometimes boxes
have multiple outputs might see the sit
down has one which says success except
you mouse over the outputs you can see
what the output is the second one here
is failure so on both stand up and sit
down
it'll try three times to to get in the
standing or sitting position and we
can't do it after three tries then it
will go to the the failure block and
execute whatever you have in the failure
block and a bunch of the commands have
multiple outputs most of them have a
single input and I guess there's two
ways to configure boxes what is the
wrench so here's you know for standing
up the fault is three tries you can
change it and the other one is you can
double click on boxes and see what's
inside of it
in most cases just using the wrench is
good enough but you can open boxes if
you want to inside them and you can
create your own boxes by grabbing a
bunch of things and then saying
converter box and that gives you
a little grouping which has everything
to be selected inside the box okay see
you guys ready for packing okay yeah
okay so what are they do is I'm going to
cut the video because there's no point
doing videos watching you sit around
them bang in our computers and when
we're ready to do projects I'll turn
back on the video all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
