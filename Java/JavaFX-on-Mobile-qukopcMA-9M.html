user group so we're a user group
dedicated to doing different job effects
technologies you can see our website on
the screen here we have lots of sponsors
who are helping us out so our room here
physically is provided by the Java user
group is the Oracle conference center
and then we have got some new books from
what would what's the core job a book
Pearson just sent us some new books
Pearson Education books and training
videos we also get some website hosting
from lai node and Jey frog pays our
meetup cost whenever i bug Shlomi which
hasn't been in quite a while so lots of
folks helping out and this is our first
time doing a new format of event so we
have johan Voss who is joining us from
Antwerp well actually not Antwerp where
do you live in it's movin movin Leuven
Belgium to talk to us about Java FX
running on different mobile platforms so
we have a bunch of folks in the room
here in Redwood Shores eating pizza and
hanging out we have Johan and Leuven and
we have a live stream running where
anybody can join us remotely if you're
on the live stream tweet out to hashtag
night hacking and then I'll put those
questions up on screen okay so welcome
Johan thanks for thanks for joining us
in the wee hours in the morning what
time is it over there now 38 a.m. Wow
so you're uh you're a real trooper I
would well I would still be up at 2:38
yeah but we know that the 3:30 when the
presentation stops probably not well no
I've been known to stay up till 5:00 or
6:00 a.m. so but probably not this is
morning for you right you woke up super
early for us it's it I have decided to
wear this morning yes okay so tell us a
little bit about the topic what do you
got to show us today
so we'll talk about job with ExxonMobil
you probably heard this before it's been
announced in 2007 8 9 10 11 12 13 but
this time it's not talking about it it's
showing how to do it so there's real
code it's working on Android it's
working on iOS so there's no reason why
we shouldn't show code for having jobs
like some oh wow cool want me to put
this high-tech yeah now here it's your
presentation man take it away okay yeah
well so it's um 240 in the mean time so
send some things every five minutes so
that I'm stay awake do you see the
presentation yep we can see the
presentation okay so first of all Java
on the wrong didn't actually be
something new because Java started on
the client and maybe you remember this
this device it's the star seven which
was the original device hardware device
that was used by the the green team at
the Sun and I think this is 1992 or so
that they wanted they wanted to create a
new device for doing lots of network
stuff and home automation video on
demand and so I didn't needed
programming language wait and that's
Java they became than Java so Java
actually started on the client it's not
that we're doing something new now we
are back to where Java starlets so
initially job was targeting set of boxes
and video-on-demand systems but back in
1990 X where X is between one and five
the the market was pretty immature so
the business models were not very clear
yet and the cable providers were not
eager to to release control and to allow
other applications to run on their
devices so that was a tough market for
Java to get into and then market racin
came around and they said well if it's
not if this is not the right market and
maybe the internet which was starting in
the boom by then is the right market and
it turned out that it was easy to create
applets that to run in a sandbox and
housing until then static websites so
the dynamic nature that was added by by
Java was was huge and such a vertical as
mainly with with applets says client
applications on the Internet
then there was the the era of the
browser Wars and there were security
concerns so that part of the market
shrink as well but in the meantime it
turned out that the job was excellent on
the back end and so the j2ee
api is where created and third-party
frameworks like hibernate and spring
were used heavily also very important is
that IDs were created for Java which
allowed users to to make it much to make
it much easier to develop applications
in Java the server part was also more
mature than for example video on-demand
or set-top boxes so that was a more
interesting and lucrative market for
Java developers the environments were
very were very well known and customers
could host their java applications on
their own servers so they were not
dependent on telcos or third parties
anymore
so that was a very good opportunity for
for Java it was not very closely
intended for but
twelve it created lots of Java
developers and lots of edit value' so in
the meantime while most of the
developers were switching to Java on the
server what happened to the client well
on the desktop people were still using a
swing but then on the mobile and PDA you
had quite a lot of choices so you could
have a virtual machine the KVM or the
caesium I probably missed some acronyms
so kayvyun was really smart CVM was
kayvyun was really small CVM was a bit
bigger they it CDC Co DC or that
connected device configuration and
connected limited device configuration
on top of that the number of profiles
with PPD a foundation profile and then
peach iron or a micro file which if you
put this in a four dimensional matrix
which leaves the developer with a high
number of potential and configurations
and the result is that the client was
very fragmented and not very attractive
for Java developers tool to work on a
client and on top of that there was also
no easy way to deploy your applications
to to end consumers and that especially
that was very pity for Java developers
and I really wanted to have Java on
mobile in the very beginning but it was
extremely hard
if you finally managed to write an
application to distribute it then and
then JavaFX was announced by some 20
2007 and it was actually the clients
that so that was Java on the client but
then we rebooted started from scratch
again so what happened in the meantime
also with the fragmentation
they were ddd the hardware became much
much better of course and there was also
more more attention for the graphical
layer so with cheap use appearing in
smartphones and so at the high level API
very much cleaner
so in Java effects which builds just on
top of Java you have just a Java io
package and you don't have to write a
different input/output threat because
you're one with B and or because you're
using Java X micro Edition dot IO so
it's just you write in Java so it was a
clear conversion between SE and ME the
deployment also changed dramatically
where it used to be extremely difficult
to to get your applications on mobile
devices
the popularity of app stores so the the
Apple App Store and the Google Play
Store made it very easy for developers
to create an application and to
distribute it to to millions
so the telco operator does not control
anymore whether your application can be
installed on a phone or not it's now
Google or Apple and yeah you're still
they are still a party controlling it
but with all those apps that are created
out there that's not a bottleneck
anymore so there is a jump effect but so
what happened to mobile in in 2009 when
javascript was released there was a
mobile component and for those of you
who remember it there was a mobile phone
I think I can probably if you see my
screen now you can see this phone yep
and I just took it off the dust because
I haven't used it for many years but
this was the Java FX enabled phone which
means that it was pre-installed with a
Java FX and that's that made it pretty
pretty unique yeah that's a classic
unfortunately it didn't became the the
big success as as I hoped for but
I still I'm still glad that I have it
might be very valuable in 200 years from
now so so wanting to be the first
working with Java on mobile I I bought
two such phones and then in October
support from mobile was dropped
officially and it was I think it made
sense at that time when Oracle announced
we're gonna rewrite Java FX so that
we're it's going to be fully Java based
and not script anymore and we're gonna
focus on desktop first so we drop
support for mobile yeah okay that make
sense but then we were hoping of course
for mobile to to to be reintroduced so
jar 1 2012 I hope that this is gonna be
the chat one where they gonna announce
mobile again and I hope the same in a
chat 1 2013 but it didn't happen
and then that meeting in 2013 we had a
meeting with you it was four guys and we
decided to kick off Java at exports
where were we going to work together
with Oracle and create the Java FX as
the case and run them on mobile because
when the official support for mobile
must work they were still code being
developed so it was not released but the
code for iOS and Android was was created
along with the code for for desktop and
that made it much easier for for for the
community to call it as we will explain
later
so it's important to realize that this
is not just the next attempt of getting
job on mobile time is to really now for
having Java on mobile for a number of
reasons so first of all devices are
getting much more powerful and their
standardization you have basically two
or three platforms Android and iOS maybe
Windows if you count them and if you
support those you have a 99 X percent of
the market also there's a growing number
of mobile devices and at this moment
there are already more
business transactions that are
originating from a mobile device then
transactions coming from a desktop
system and on mobile devices people are
rather using apps native apps and not
web components so native applications on
mobile devices is really extremely
variable and its value is increasing so
the time is really now to jump on that
train and the app store maintenance go
got an apple make it's pretty easy to
distribute in your applications now I I
created a screenshot of a something on
Google Trends and the red line and the
blue line represents something different
the red line is the evolution of search
popularity of swing and the blue line is
the evolution of search popularity of
Java
so if you see swing is still very
popular no doubt about that and and it's
been great but if we zoom in into the
last year you see that now finally it's
a blue East Java Vexin ready swing this
year the turnaround has been the the
switch has been made so you're starting
early this year
JavaFX became more popular in the
industry then the swing was so it's
really swing it's still important it
will stay important for a long time but
JavaFX is now gaining traction to the
industry so you might not always notice
that because Java effects is often used
inside companies that don't they don't
tweet or blog much about it but the
uptake over the last year is is amazing
and so it's it's fully the time is
really now to work on Java effects and
as we said before mobile is going to be
so important so that combination job of
Exxon Mobile is I think a huge
opportunity so then what what did we do
with a job of exports ok blame me for
the name
I heard nobody likes it
but I'm also not allowed to change it
because everybody well many people know
it by now but job of export was actually
sort of a an answer to Jim Weaver you
know Jim Weaver author of poor job at X
1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 and his tweet handle is
Java as expert and so I thought it would
be fun to name this poor tech job of
export which actually explains the name
now Java of export is using the code in
the open GFX repository so well probably
all attendees know that's the code for
Java of X is maintained even in an open
airy process being maintained by Oracle
and mainly contributed in by Oracle
engineers but it's called open G of X
and that repository contains all the all
the shared code and also the Android and
iOS specific code isn't there it wasn't
perfect yet but we had to apply I some
changes some Android and iOS specific
changes and that was not as hard as I
assumed because the court was already in
subsequent shade so it turned out to be
relative easy after that we could
release the Java FX as the case for
mobile so we have a Java VEX SDK for iOS
and for Android and from that moment on
it was possible for all developers to
create applications and build Android
applications and and build iOS
applications from your java application
but it was pretty it was not that easy
to do start with a simple java
application and create an Android or an
iOS application from it because the
number of steps that are required in
order to package your application and
upload it to the App Store so we created
to create a plugin that made that
packaging and deployment much much
easier and we will show that in a minute
but let's explain it a bit so both for
Android and iOS there are a number of
steps that are required before your
application your java source code is an
native iOS application or a native
android application and the tf-x mobile
cradle plugin
that's also part of you have export uses
those it will perform those steps for
you it will it depends on the low-level
tools and it will convert your Java FX
application into a native application so
on Android using the Android SDK which
is provided by by Google and the Android
SDK contains lots of tools for
converting Java byte code into the
Orphic bytecode shrink it bundle the
resources set ask for permission and so
so that's what the Android SDK is doing
and you don't have to call this yourself
because the CFX mobile plug-in will do
this for you on iOS we use the hope of
the M a ot to translate your Java text
application and bundle it with the
javac' Mobile SDK and some additional
tools that we require and as a result we
can have a native iOS application so
robe of M is providing the the Java for
iOS compiler so you write Java source
code and with the hope of M äôt you
can convert the Java source code into
native iOS code so what we had to do and
on top of that exporting the native
functionality of Java VEX to native iOS
our functionality but again
you don't have to worry about this as
the Quebec mobile plug-in is taking care
of this it's not only so for everything
that I discussed was open source and
spare time and fun but then I realized
that I spent lots of time on it and
there were many questions from
individual developers but also from
companies small and big companies and
it's it's hard to get taken seriously if
you do everything just in your spare
time and if there's barely commercial
support for it
I think Java effects on mobile can be
such a huge market player so that we
decided to create a company on it gloom
is specifically targeting Java on the
client especially on mobile and gluon
provides commercial support and services
and products I think it's important to
to mention this ecosystem because it's a
the open source needs the commercial
world and the other way around it's hard
to have an open source product that has
no commercial support because companies
want to to get as a lace they want to be
able to to call someone with questions
and they're willing to pay for that and
on the other hand a commercial company
in this area uses open source much more
than then then then they often I realize
so in short I think gluon needs Java of
exports and you have exports need a
gluon so at this moment most of the
development in Java export is done by by
gluon so we invest a lot on it but we
also become better of it because we have
customers that are saying yeah this
looks fine on mobile but you don't have
for example this component yet and then
they actually pay
the development of Java exports
indirectly so I think this this
ecosystem is very important and I think
it's we are the right balance between
doing as much as possible in the open
source and still providing commercial
support and I really hope to see other
companies playing in that area as well
because they're definitely the markets
so gluon has some free tools for example
a scene builder not sure you heard that
but or is not distributing symbol the
binaries anymore but glue is we also
distribute the Java vex as the case for
for mobile and we created a few ID
plugins and we're working on other ones
so that's all free and you can download
them from our site apart from that we
have some commercial tools so with charm
which is a client library which makes it
possible to create user interfaces that
use the material design concept and we
have glue on cloud which is the bridge
between your java graphics application
and legacy cloud systems where we deal
with data persistence and
synchronization for example so that was
the theory so i said a few times that
it's easy now for developers to create
applications java vex applications on
mobile so I think we will show it now so
how would you get started I will show
some links in the very last slide but
the easiest way is to use NetBeans or
IntelliJ and use the gluon plug-in which
we'll call the GFX mobile Gradle plugin
otherwise you can download one of the
samples and start qualifying it but for
now I will use and lesbian so I will
share the screen
you can see my netbeans now I suppose
yep it's working okay thanks for keeping
me awake
yeah we're for you oh one question so we
had a question of the room if we could
get the slides after the talk yeah
absolutely yes after the talk before I
go to bed I will share a slice yeah
you're not allowed to go to bed until
you share the slides okay sure
dedication so first of all we have
NetBeans
we use I use NetBeans for my development
but I know that the IntelliJ clicking
works the same way but I'm an addition
so I prefer to use this and not the most
with NetBeans you have a bunch of
plugins so one of the plugins that you
have is the gluon plugin so we go to
available plugins we search for glue
yeah actually I have it but I
uninstalled it too to show how to start
from scratch
and you see that the gluon plug-in is in
the list of available plugins you click
on install and you agree with the
license and it's so this is an
open-source applicant you can use it to
create commercial applications no
problem with that
so now we have this a plug-in and we can
go to we can create a new project if you
go to new project you will see that the
Java category now has a basic gluon
application so we create a basic loan
application we call it for example
company X jerk clear one application we
want to support Android iOS and desktop
so we click on finish and the
application is now being created for us
across modern applications
so this is the application that we
created and you see that the plug-in
created a number of packages most
important the source and resources that
are shared for all platforms it also
created androids sources resource
desktop sources resource iOS Java
resource and you can use those for doing
platform specific things and I highly
recommend not doing any platform
specific functionality we try to provide
as much platform independent
functionality as possible and we're
extending that in another component
which is charm down OSS which contains
an abstraction on over device specific
functionality like getting the location
and so so that is already an open-source
component that that provides some
platform specific functionality so that
you don't need to duplicate that effort
now if we go to the single source file
in the application you see that this is
a Java FX standard application there's
nothing mobile specific in here actually
we can run it because it's a simple Java
next application and we run it on
desktop and then you see the hello world
I hope that fits nice
on the big screen over there yeah
variable on the big screen
yeah you know that user interface
development is it's something that I
don't master very well good enough I've
excellent clicks at gluon to to fix that
now the the Gradle at the authority we
created this project with the netbeans
plugin and it uses T GFX mobile Gradle
plug-in to create some additional tasks
so Grail is being getting more and more
popular it's also the number one tool
for Android so we decided to standardize
on cradle as well before I
show the code on all the devices let's
have a look at the build of Gradle file
that's automatically created by this uh
plugin the most important line is this
one apply plug-in or Java of exports
jbaxter mobile by doing so and we we
will get all the tasks that will create
the iOS installs and the Android
installs so yeah actually I first should
have launched the iOS Talk Talk because
it it takes a while but if you go to the
project and you go to tasks you will see
that for example we have here group I Oh
s where it can be compared and then we
have a launch cook where we have for
example launched iPhone simulator if we
click on it and the first time this is
going to take a while what is happening
now is so the plug-in has a section on
us
actually this is all all to create it
you don't have to change it but for
advanced usage you can change it but
what will happen now under the hood is
that the robot VM ahead of time
compiling is now used to compile all the
classes not only this Java class but
also the depending classes which are the
TF X or T so the Java FX runtime classes
but not only that also the whole Java
runtime is also compiled because your
application is bundled with the Java
Runtime and also the Java Runtime into a
native iOS application we know why Apple
does not allow dynamic code execution so
on device so we have to recompile and
bundle everything in advance so in this
is the iOS simulator that it shows up
now and that shows exactly the same
application as the one that you saw on
desktop so there's in your application
there is nothing I was specific
also there is no additional tools
required the only thing is you need to
have Xcode so it's it's working on Mac
only I heard there are some workarounds
for this but the problem compared is is
gonna require Xcode so that is I think
how how it works for iOS in a simulator
you can also launch it on a real device
but I don't have an iOS device I would
be very happy to receive one but you can
if you plug in the device over USB you
can run the application on that device
as well and if you just want to create
the IPA you can do that as well and then
upload it to the App Store for Android I
fortunately do have an Android device
and so I can show how to do the Android
version on the on the device so one of
the tasks that being created is the
Android install task if we click on this
we will now use some of the Android SDK
tools it's under the hood it's again the
plug-in that's doing this and it will
compile our classes bundle it with the
JFX or T runtime and with the native
libraries make sure that the manifest is
right that the permissions are right and
then install it on the on the device so
I'll switch to presentation mode and
show how it works on the device with
work first let's see how it creates its
here so there are a number of forces we
probably here my fan getting crazy
but at this moment so the apk has been
created and it's finally installed on
device and if we have a look at this
device hope you can see it a little bit
you see here an application it's hard to
see you so you have to believe me
sv FX joke bloom app and it also shows
this I assume you didn't make your own
logo for your company right your heart I
didn't get it but for me because my
finish making too much noise
I said you probably didn't make your own
logo for your company right I I did it'd
be a little help from a GUI design but
most most most of its I don't myself so
for the people who don't know me they
know that I'm well I'm just kidding
so that's how the hello world works on
Android and on the iOS and with with
this demo I try to show how how easy it
is so everything is generated by plugins
its convention over configuration so if
you want to make it if you want to use
the advanced functionality you can still
do and then you have to code a bit but
this application is actually very easy
and it runs out of the box on I was an
Android it's not the the nicest
application so typically people would
say yeah ok that works for hello world
but not for another application now it
does work for other applications and I
can show that I have another application
here which is particle comments you can
download this application yourself
because it's available I will
immediately go to the the website if you
go to be triplets the org gluon OSS
samples
you see so you sample the area huh
sorry do you want to share it's stinging
me
you got it yep it's working now
so big bucket of orc - gluon OSS -
samples shows at this moment one sample
so that slope blue or SS contains
everything that's from proven and that's
open source so you can download the
sample and run it on your iOS device or
Android device the same way as I did the
hello world in growing OSS we also have
singular and turndown so I briefly
touched turn down which is a component
that has abstract device functionality
for Android and iOS devices and you know
we're very happy to see community
contributions to to charm down already
so I think this is this is really the
way that it works this is a community
effort it's cool
so hey Jose they're coding he was also
on Twitter saying some stuff as well
yeah it's he's he's mr. calm down so the
comments application that you can
download I have it here locally and it's
it's also it's a simple Java vex
application so this is now using glisten
the gluon client library that allows you
to do material design and it makes
things much nicer so same principles we
can run it on Android and we can run it
on iOS and I will run it on a iOS yeah
why not just I'm gonna stop it come on
Klein because it makes a big noise on
the fan punch iPhone same so I will
actually I will launch two versions of
comments one on the iOS simulator and
one on the desktop and the test up one
should should be very easy so you see
this is this is an application that that
looks a bit nicer than hello world and
it uses the glisten library to create
this material design concepts so this is
a just some distributed commenting
system but it's all on the client so
there's no server involved we use a
gluon cloud here to synchronize this
list to the backend and everything is an
observable list here so if if one client
asks something to another to the list
it's going to be synchronized to the
other clients as well so that actually
shows I think two things one it is
possible to create applications in Java
FX a random a mobile that look much more
like native applications then for
example a web page a second it's also
possible to have to merge a tool to have
enterprise functionality in your native
applications so it's it's not just a
hello world and inclined stuff it's
really data data persistence and so this
is also possible on this job of X
applications so you see now the I could
actually also show with on the iOS
serving on on an Android device but to
be honest the N word emulator is not
very functional so when we still have
issues running to our of X applications
on the Android emulator good enough
Android devices or very fast and we use
android devices for development so if I
another comment and another comment on
one device you see that it's being added
on the other device as well so this is
the simulator iPhone simulator if you
have a real device and if you believe me
it's working on the Android at this
moment like this it's going to be
synchronized so this is a this is a bit
more code than just our world but it's
uh yeah it's I think it shows that that
if people ask is this ready for
production now I think yes and there are
commercial customers that are that were
working it to create channel X
applications on mobile devices so I
think this looks I've seen worse Android
applications and iOS applications so
we're still enhancing it but this is
just to show that I think we are ready
all the pieces of the puzzle are there
it's just yeah it's it's not just a
matter of getting more traction having
more developers using it more feedback
and and I think it's very promising so
if you very briefly want to see how we
did the e-commerce application i really
suggest you go to the download page and
look at the sample read the
documentation and i will point you to
the documentation in a minute as well
but basically we have with increasing we
have the mobile application so which
which is just java application but then
specifically targeting mobile the
Galatian functionality is mainly styling
and a few new controls and that phase
the material design effect and we're
using a FX ml here here and we're using
the afterburn the mobile afterburner
framework so afterburner is a framework
created by adam bean who is really a
guru in the
enterprise world and he created
afterburner which is a fairly simple
injection framework and we're using a
mobile version of this injection
framework to to to have a separation
between the presenter and the so the
model view and the presenter so you see
we can do injection here and it's it all
works on mobile devices I have no
question for you Johan your so Keith was
wondering if there's any limitations on
the job at X api's for what you can
accomplish on mobile does it support the
full API or there's anything that you
can't do what you could do on desktop
yeah there are a few if you guys are not
ported yet media is not not yet ported
we had some interest from it and so if
there's enough interest we will we will
do it
3d is only partly ported but I think all
controls for example should work all the
out container size should work printing
API is not supported but not supported
does not mean that it's not possible
it's just probably not enough interest
so not yet not yet
ported over and tested but technically
there's no there's no reason why not
everything from the Java API should be
able to work there's a huge limitation
at the moment though and that is that
while it is possible to use lambdas as
you can see in this oh by the way this
is how you add this this nice floating
button you can use lambdas because they
will be converted to inner classes by
which were lambda
and that's a real pity but that's
because we currently run on top of Dalek
which does not provide the streams API
it's probably something that can get
fixed but at this moment if you create
Java fix applications for more well
don't use don't use the streams API for
now but for example injection that's
something that that you can that you can
use so I was showing this floating
action button which is which is a
Christian component I forgot to mention
that so the nice material design effects
that you so they're all available for
free as well
the only thing is we also have them we
sell licenses for them so if you have a
license key and you can get one in the
bloom of store you won't get the next
screen so if you remember if I start up
this application you might remember that
you saw this this screen where it said
this is working with goo and charm
developer preview if you have a family
license key you won't see this this one
and on mobile your developers won't see
this as well but so so so that's again
if you don't care about this pop up
that's fine it's a very it's free to use
if you want this pop up not to appear in
your commercial application you have to
buy a license so again this is I think
the the synergy between the in the
ecosystem between open-source support
and still making making business out of
it so this is these components or
material design style items and and
controls and there's no they're using DT
of X controls under the hood there's no
limitation on which to have effect
controls that could be used this is a so
kids question yep
kids happy he's a happy customer
happy future customer okay that's
excellent
so I think a language did I had to wrap
up at 3:30 so I wanted to before I
forget it to show some links to where
you can get more information the job of
exports dot org which contains the
overview on the SDKs and overview on how
to get started is it a job of export dot
org so gluon is it plural hq.com which
is the commercial entity now one gluon
is at this moment heavily investing in
Java if export it's not the there's no
there's nothing that gluon does that
another company
can't do except that we have excellent
people working late already
but everything that we do related to
charvaks on mobile
so the charvaks api that's all part of
the open source efforts so all the
controls did you have an X controls that
that that are part of the Java vex 8
api's they are all in a Java of exports
so blown has some additional services
like the material design API sand icons
and controls and the ground support but
everything there's nothing that you need
from us if you want to develop it
yourself of course I'm very happy to
provide services and the tools but I
hope that I can make it clear that
there's a nice distinction between the
open source and commercial efforts so
the samples and everything that's open
source from Glu is a big puppet in a
gluon OSS and you can send me a mail at
you all set blue is good calm or follow
me follow me on twitter with universe
being my last act
and I think that concludes the
presentation I'm happy to answer
questions while I'm awake though cool
so any other questions for you hon you
have to say hi to him Alex come on
you're you're working on article with
him so at least Johan oh yeah
nice to see the progress that you're
making and very good feedback from you
actually I have a lot of feedback
already I didn't share with you yet
that's that that that is how it works
that's how we how we can make a progress
it's what I really I'm really sure that
Java the mobile is gonna has lots of
opportunities the feedback from the
early adopters people that are using it
has been crucial for if I look at where
we stand now compared to a year ago for
example it's a it's amazing and that's
because people are using it and people
are providing feed feedback so Alex for
example try to get it working behind the
company firewall with a proxy and some
other things that we didn't and
currently yet and the JFX mobile plug-in
was not capable of working behind the
proxy so we changed that then we made
the new version available and I'm happy
to make a most changes together working
phew yeah that was great thank you for
the fix welcome okay so we got we've got
one question for you from I was ignoring
for Eric but he he's been on Twitter at
the whole time watching and playing
along so Eric's wondering where he gets
the IntelliJ plug-in if you yeah let me
go through the esses versus myself we
have we have documentation section
I'm not going so it's a doc doc gloom on
hq.com
and now the intelligible looking is only
being released
for one week I think but there should be
there should be information everything
the storm okay yeah so if you go to dogs
that clue 1sq calm and then you you
click on charm and then you see ID
plugins the gluon plugin for IntelliJ
then it shows how you can get the
plug-in so you can get it from a jet
grace or you can install it directly
from IntelliJ so I hope that that works
we have a I think we had a blog post
about it out it is open if you want oh
we we we often post new things in the
new section from a gluon yeah near this
so there's the information for for
IntelliJ it's I think pretty well
documented we tested it with a few users
but again if you have issues let us know
we want to make this as good as we can
ok cool
any other questions in the room for
Johan we're gonna let him get back to
sleep maybe alright so thanks thanks
very much for the great presentation
Johan yes very welcome you probably
can't hear it but there's lots of
applause here in the room for you oh
yeah I had my headset but I really want
to thank you because I'm honored to to
be able to speak in the Silicon Valley
JavaFX you as a book which which has
been yeah a pioneer in the JavaFX so
very glad to
that you invited me very good and you
can you can join our meetings to online
all of our meetings are live streams
okay so thanks very much I'm going to
cut the recording here and the live
stream so thanks for those of you who
are joining us on the on the live stream
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
