at devoxx today my name is europani and
I work for Oracle technology Network and
today and Sebastian hi so so tell me
what do you do oh I'm working on spring
farmers in spring food and especially on
the reactive
so
so
yeah sure so during your university talk
to me obviously we have more time so we
could explain the different operators
and what the flux model in flux reactor
API offers but here will directly diving
to create example with a real
application so here we're definitely
taking a bottom of the reactive treaty
augmentation of the reactor because the
flow of data were dealing with it's it's
done non-working factions with also back
for sure support so it means that we're
not taking more data that we can handle
and when we have those data pipelines
that support this pipeline we can apply
operations
so in that example for example we can
show a a gator clients which is the
circular chat rooms or many open-source
projects so we're using here the API
Peter to fetch for example or get the
latest messages that were posted to get
a group and we're doing that using a web
client which is an HIV client so here we
can see that we are creating the HTTP
request we are creating that requested
once it's created we are using that
request to with a client to send that
request to the gear API and we're
expecting flecks of get ur msgs so what
with JSON objects which is in fact an
array of objects and we will get those
in a reactive in fashion if you realize
those and we'll get an actual flux of
those so this gives us a reactive
pipeline the messages were interested in
and one once we have that we can compose
and we can use that inter occupation
here we'd like to use that in our
service so here we'll definitely get the
latest messages using that client
service and the same thing for the
streaming counterpart of that API to get
the messages published in the latest so
that's where this is itself used in a
web controller so his web controller is
actually serving request to a regular
browser and we can show that right here
so we've got a controller sort of as a
REST API that the chat messages the
latest runs and here here's the street
so in that case we're serving actual
chasing data but here we can see that
work with chosen a different media type
because the textile industry we detect
which is then which is sort of service
and events so as we can see here we've
got both flux as return types so it
means that that flux that pipeline of
data can be seen as some kind of a
civilized
which is
because I as its own flavor different
operations so we're definitely it's good
to leave the choice reactivity I to do
poppers so here to finish the example if
we look at the application here if we
look at chat messages
trying to fetch the messages you can see
that it sexual Jason data as expected
fetch like any regular rest rest service
and if we're going to this time show
showing the latest messages we can see
that the browser that data web page so
we're definitely still using that chat
messages the end point but we've also
created connection to the chat stream
endpoint which is waiting for that
pending connection and waiting for new
data as we can see here we were still
waiting for you messages here I've got
the Gator client we can post a message
so there are many ways to issue
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
