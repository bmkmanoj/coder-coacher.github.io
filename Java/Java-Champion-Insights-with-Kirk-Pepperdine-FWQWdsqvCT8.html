OT an advocacy team and I managed the
Java champion program and I'm pleased to
be joined with one of our Java champions
Kirk Pepperdine thanks for joining me
here at devoxx my pleasure always fun to
be at devoxx it's a nice end of annual
event for me how many years have you
been here or how many events i would say
have been probably to at least 10 of the
15 dev ox's oh wow I missed a couple
because of one reason or another but
yeah I generally somehow find a way to
make my way to Antwerp very cool is my
first time so I'm learning lots oh yeah
it's it's an interesting venue and it
really hasn't changed in while it it
hasn't changed really it just it just
gets more crowded that's a good problem
for a conference well yes I think so
yeah so um we're here and I wanted to
gather some Java champions to kind of
help illuminate and show the world you
know what you all do you know you're a
lot of luminaries and experts but it's
not just that it's also what you get
back to the community so I just want to
ask a couple questions if that's all
right sure so first question is what do
you do for your day job that's a good
question ah I I guess I've been lucky
that I don't really have a day job okay
if you haven't noticed so but I end up
actually just looking at lots of random
bits of data from a lots of different
systems from a lots of people who are
you know i'm happy to say are willing to
give me money for looking at lots of
bits of data from lots of different
systems and basically do diagnostics for
performance Diagnostics for them and i
run a performance workshop performance
training workshop it's I would you know
the original performance training
workshop we wrote this with Jack shirazi
many many years ago and of course for me
it's a constant chore to keep well not
sure it's a little harsh but but you
know it's certainly not the same course
that we started with its we keep I keep
evolving it pretty much between every
just about between every single either
you know delivery i'll deliver and then
immediately something will happen we
learn something we see something new or
interesting or fun and we say ah ok that
fits here this is no longer applicable
so out that goes new material goes in
and you know and yeah that's pretty much
what I do for a day job ok and you know
also along with being a luminary and an
expert in your field part of being a
java champion is also giving back to the
java community and helping it grow so um
you know in lightness to what what do
you do I'm sure there's a lots but what
are the couple the key I've over the
years i think have migrated from a bunch
of different things i was writing a lot
for you know some time for different
publications for different things blogs
web site you know all the typical things
that we do and i end up you know
speaking at a lot of jugs and you know
just sharing information about
performance tuning and things that are
happening in the job world and at jugs
and and conferences and and speaking and
things like that and we started to jake
reach so i'm one of these one of the
founding founders of jay crete we
generally give credit to heinz for
mostly for the for the for the whole
event but there's another person
involved there's a jaan co-star so Heinz
and I talked about it originally but it
really took John as I say it was the
catalyst to actually make it all really
come together and happen and then we and
then we've had a lot of other people
involved also that are java champions
and you know we thought we thought ok so
you know what do we want well we looked
at what brew cycle was doing and he said
that's fun
that's like geeks getting together
talking about really geeky stuff and
then having some fun together also like
doing going on excursions and things
like that and so you know Hines wanted
to do and create me so it finds great
place there's all kinds of great
excursions you can have there and you
know we have you know we have our own
little jokes about the whole thing it's
an unconference you know we have our
meetings our swim ups we don't have
stand up so we have to swim out recipe
I've told Steven I'm very jealous of
that well done yeah yeah so and and it's
it's you know but more to the serious
point we had some goals like we wanted
to bring together technical experts but
we wanted to bring together other people
or maybe we were not technical experts
and just expose them to the technical
experts so that we can have some sorts
of exchanges and things like that and we
also have wanted to do other things
other than just geeky things and and we
wanted to create an environment where
families were welcome and it was sort of
family friendly and we wanted to give
opportunities for people to actually
feel comfortable speaking in front of
groups and things like that hang and you
know we had all these other altruistic
goals about the whole thing may be
sparking open source projects or you
know just all of the things that happens
when you get people together and they
start thinking about you know hey we can
do that and i would say that we've been
fairly successful we've had a number of
people become java champions because of
Jake Reed okay because they've gone out
afterwards and they've done the things
that basically helps them to qualify for
the program right we've had a lot of
people well you know you know one of the
criteria I guess would be that they
would be known and so that they've gone
out and they've spoken at their jugs or
started jugs or or you know done a
number of different things like that so
we would like to think that we actually
gave them you know maybe not the
motivation but maybe the confidence to
actually go off and do things like that
we've been trying to attract more women
to the conference
and you know there could be a double
motive there because you know it's creat
summer beach but you know but really but
you know but really I think it's really
to say to provide I guess then with a
safe environment where they can actually
progress their career if they want to
and basically say yeah you can do these
things also on it and I think we've had
some success in that regard also because
we have now more female Java champions
because of Jake Reed so so yeah it's so
really just giving them you know safe
place where they can have opportunities
to to be themselves I guess and so that
I mean that's I guess in the last number
of years it's been what I would consider
to be our biggest give back to the
conference for us it's a complete
uncommercial thing we don't charge so we
have to limit the numbers which means we
have to go by invitation and you know
we've tried to make that as fair and as
nice as poss as we possibly can but it's
a difficult thing to do but it's for us
it's non-commercial we have been offered
commercial opportunities from the whole
thing and we just flatly said no
allowing to do it right so this is a
community thing for the community and
most primarily for Europeans but is it
turns out we have people coming from
everywhere to the you know we were
trying to discriminate based on
geographical location but it we aren't
it darn it it it didn't work and those
pesky Americans snuck in and well which
is really good I get more now yeah we
could well Steven chin started coming
over and bringing all kinds of equipment
along with them and yeah it was really
and then we started running what we call
it Jake Reed for kids like that marks
the kids and stuff like that and that's
actually turned out to be really really
amazing the the you know so creats an
island and to get there you pretty much
have to swim more boat or fly or okay
you know find some way to get on the
island and we've had people from all
over Greece showing up going like okay
how do we do this how do we get our kids
more involved wow you know so
we're flying in from Athens you know
professors teachers things like that to
say okay how can we do this so it was
you know so we consider that to be
somewhat of a success also if I can be
so bold to make that claim yes I think
you know even that so I think that's
been another part of the community work
that I do and you know there's and then
there's probably some controversial
things that I end up doing which is if
we can speak candidly about it is
basically just monitor and look at the
health of openjdk and and you know try
to move that forward see if we can get
more participation from other companies
and try to get processes and things open
so that you know other country companies
are actually able to to contribute to to
the project and of course that comes
with a its own sets of difficulties also
I know so and you know there's plenty of
room for bike shedding and all kinds of
fun stuff like that I learned that word
from your guys's group yes did you bike
chain you probably don't yeah exactly
yeah yeah sometimes it gets a little fun
but a little rougher than you might like
but you know I think Colin all most of
us are at least it just about everybody
I know has the same intention is to you
know we have a wonderful platform it
does it's we have a beautiful community
built around it we have a lot of what i
would call Commonwealth as a result of
this particular platform and because of
this commonwealth we also have a lot of
what i would consider to be better
individual wealth you know not just
monetary but in many other aspects also
so we're all pretty much in a much
better position because of this so you
know i think we all have a vested
interest to watch what's going on to
make sure that there's proper investment
in the platform and we keep moving it
forward so that the platform remains
relevant and that you know people
understand that you know there is
benefits in contributing to Commonwealth
that will come
talk to you well we appreciate all that
you do for the java community and you
know thank you as I and as I've been on
board as the program manager I
appreciate all your guidance and help oh
yeah that and you know to the folks out
there i'll just say that she's been a
wonderful program manager so we're we're
very to have very happy to have her
handle us even though at times I'm sure
she's going like what did I find up for
passion is passionate I'll take it yes
the rest of deaf heart dev ox yes I will
plan to starting now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
