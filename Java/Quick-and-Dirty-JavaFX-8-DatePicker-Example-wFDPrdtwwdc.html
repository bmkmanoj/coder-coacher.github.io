to show you the date picker control
that's new with JavaFX
8 that's bundled with JDK 8 and in the
process I'm going to show you NetBeans
IDE 7.4 beta as well as some things
about lambda expressions and also the
new date/time API that's new with JDK 8
so first I'm gonna build a project from
scratch using NetBeans so I'll say new
project choose the JavaFX category and
the JavaFX application and we'll give it
a name of date picker example and we'll
take all the defaults and finish the
default behavior of a new project in
that beans when you when we create new
project is to view a stage that says
hello world in a button and when we
click hello world it prints hello world
we're going to modify that application
replacing the button with a date picker
so here instead of button will say date
picker and let's give it a name of DP
for the local variable and we'll say new
date picker and then we'll fix the
imports of the imports up here this
import is JavaFX that scene that control
dot date picker we won't need this next
line since we're not going to set any
text into the date picker and on this
line
we'll use the date picker and local
variable and we're going to
have an an event handler when the user
selects a date but instead of using an
anonymous inner class we'll use the
facilities of NetBeans 704 to
automatically change that into a lambda
expression and then we'll simplify it
even further because with lambda
expressions the compiler knows the type
of event and also if there's just one
parameter you don't need parentheses by
the way there's a blog post that I wrote
in in my blog it's JavaFX Bert calm
where it discusses lambdas expressions
and goes through how to replace an
anonymous in a cleaner class for event
handling with lambdas and then explains
how you can simplify the lambdas so here
we're going to do a couple of things
first of all we're going to create a new
instance variable called local date and
we'll give that a variable name of LD
now local date is part of the new
date/time API that was introduced by
Stephan Colburn and it's part of the jsr
310 and it's it's a completely
redesigned date/time API replacing the
older one that used things like calendar
and Gregorian calendar that was in the
JavaFX or java.util package the new
classes are in the Java time package so
here we'll import the local date
if I look at the javadocs
I can see the package Java that time
package and there's our local date
that's a date without a time zone and
then here's a good description of the
Java that time package there are there's
a lot more information on the on the
documentation site that the Java
documentation site for the new date/time
API so here we'll go ahead and assign
the result of of get value so when the
when the date picker is clicked when a
date is selected this action of
amplifier and then will get the value of
the date picker and we'll put that into
our local date variable and then here
we'll print date selected yes LD and to
finish things up instead of adding the
button to the scene graph we'll add the
date picker and then just put the
finishing touches on it we'll say hello
date picker instead of hello world and
we'll go ahead and run this
the date picker looks like a combo box
as a matter of fact it extends combo box
but then when we click the down arrow we
see a calendar and we can go through
different months different years and we
can select a date now notice the date
appears in the text area and we're
printing date selected and that's the
date that's that's selected I should
also mention that there are other date
picker controls available for example
there is a calendar picker control
available with the jf extras project
written by Tom ug link I hope I'm
pronouncing his name correctly if if I'm
not Tom please correct me but in the
Jeff extras project there is that class
and I'm going to go ahead and run that
for you just to show you the appearance
of that calendar picker and like the
date picker it's fully style able with
CSS and has lots of features
I'd like to remind you if you'd if you
don't know that there is a site it's
called JavaFX community.com and it's a
great resource for being able to see
resources that are available with JavaFX
as well as news and announcements and
then the latest post from the JavaFX
community one of the latest posts here
is by my colleague and friend Pedro DV
is what I call him and this is one of
the posts in the aggregated aggregated
blog posts from the JavaFX community if
I pull this up I noticed that just a
couple of days ago he wrote a nice
article on what's new in JavaFX or java
hate and so the part one is JavaFX and
he actually did write about the date
picker and tree table controls and then
he also had a nice link on the original
user experience documentation for the
date picker UI which goes through all of
the appearance and behavior of that
particular control so we've
talked about the date picker also the
calendar picker that's available in Java
in J of extras we showed creating a
project from scratch using the new
NetBeans IDE 7.4 beta we touched on
lambda expressions and I showed you
where you can get more information about
that also we touched on the new date
diamond API which was based upon the the
jsr the Java specification request 310
so I thank you very much for your
attention if you have any questions
please leave a comment on my blog and
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
