technology Network we're here at devoxx
talking to members of the java community
and i have java ee expert arun gupta
with me here hi arun I Tony how are you
doing I'm doing very well thank you so
your position in the community has
changed a little bit so why don't you
tell us about that yeah I'm the new
director for developer advocacy for red
hat now responsible for the developer
evangelism effort for anything which is
middleware Red Hat so yes the companies
have changed but pretty much the
technology and the passion very much
stays alike right right yeah you're
still in our pond and I really
appreciate that um so tell me you did a
bunch of sessions here tell me a little
bit about those yeah so the one of the
first sessions was on Monday actually
which i did with antonio gonzalez who is
paris jug leader very qualified persons
a lot of things that can go after him
but that was a university session on
java ee 7 it was in the biggest room of
the conference about 700 sit in that
room and the room was i would say ninety
percent packed and then I'll later on we
were actually looking at the statistics
we had a live interaction from the
audience from Twitter they were about 98
questions that were asked during that
three hour University session a lot of
interesting questions and a lot of
philosophies being discussed design
patterns being discussed that was pretty
interesting and then in addition to that
I also did a hacker garden on Tuesday so
these are like bunch of samples that
I've created and the idea was to kind of
build unit tests for those they were
about again eight to ten people
impromptu who just showed up and they
helped us build those unit tests now
these guys they learn new tools like
arquillian I taught them technology and
then we had about 50 plus unit test
created as part of that so I mean at Red
Hat we say community powered innovation
and that was really what it was now we
have this sort of a unit tests that are
ready you could run them on glassfish or
wild fly or any other ee 7 compliant
server sorrowful resource for the
community
and then the last two things that I did
one was the java ee 7 hands-on lab now
the box has always been a challenge for
me so like I created this content for
like 60 pages hoping people would last
for like three hours hopefully but there
were folks who started finishing in hour
and a half so I guess next year I'm not
a problem to have isn't it yeah so well
I guess in the beginning of the session
I said you know people who finish first
I'm going to offer them my signed book
so I was like oh man it was a race it
was race and so but exciting very happy
feeling that people were able to finish
it and a lot of good questions and
earlier today I did a session on jsr 356
on java api for web socket and i would
say about fifty percent room was full so
a lot of good questions excellent so
tell me about EE 7 it's been out for a
while what are you seeing in terms of
adoption yeah I mean glassfish is the
only compliant application server today
and this is the reference
implementations are definitely very high
respect for it in that sense in general
you know every anywhere and everywhere I
presented on java ee 7 huge huge
community feedback very and positive i
mean so for example i was in romania jog
last year last week their typical
attendance is about 60 to 80 people they
had 135 people for that jug meet up and
that's sort of the typical meetups that
i'm seeing everywhere we are talking
about java ee 7 so I think java ee 6 was
a very very important significant step
for us where oracle actually build the
platform in such a beautiful way and it
took us some time to kind of start
putting the messages out in the
community but i think Joey e7 as you say
you know hit the head on the nail or
hammer on the head if they hammer on the
head and it's like really people are
getting the message across and I think
the important part being it is also has
some key technologies like WebSocket
batch which kind of people connect with
their day-to-day needs so it's like
their beads are being solved platform is
modern it's serving their requirements
enterprise centric what else you know
this is a beautiful combination great so
tell me a common question you get about
EE 7 um of the recent Oracle news for
example
yes you know with it yeah sure why not
so one of the common questions people
typically ask is oh now glassfish like
literally in the universe today somebody
asked me so glassfish has no commercial
support now what do you think about this
I said guys important part is to
recognize that glassfish has always been
the RI and it will always be the RI no
matter what happens to it show respect
for that and I'm glad actually Oracle
made that decision in that sense because
I've been through sun coming from son I
appreciate it a lot more because that's
the reason you know sun went down an
Oracle will not go down so i think that
to me is very very important that i'm
glad oracle made that decision so that
is very important and in terms of other
features like people ask for like okay
when do I see no SQL support and there
when do I see cashing in there and how
could we make the process lightweight
more transparent so for example
yesterday we had a hawaii community
gathering at devoxx and there we were
talking about how can we open up the
process more so i guess there is a lot
of hunger even though we did a lot of
transparency in JCP to benign there is
still a lot of hunger on people I want
to contribute more participate more so
that is good there's more work to do
absolutely excellent and maybe adapt to
jsr as a way to get it people involved
and maybe there's other streams we can
open up and I think that's the whole
benefit of JCP because once you build
that infrastructure when we build
infrastructure we may not realize how
people going to use it they come up with
unique ideas oh I can do this yeah of
course because it's about all community
powered innovation well well Arun I'm
sure glad you dropped by and I'm glad
you're still in the community and
working on java ee we definitely need
you so thanks very much thank you this
is Tori wheel with the Oracle technology
