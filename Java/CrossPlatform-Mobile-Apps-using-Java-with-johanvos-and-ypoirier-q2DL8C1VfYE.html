create mobile applications in Java and
connect them to Java Enterprise and
cloud systems so the Java that you use
for creating your enterprise
applications or desktop applications can
also be used to create applications that
will then work on the phone so glue on
mobile is a set of tools that will
convert your Java code into an Android
app or into an iOS app and gluon cloud
link is a product it's a it's software
as a service that allows you to ask data
from the mobile application or coral
functions or sync from a synchronized
data between mobile and cloud components
and it also allows you to manage a push
functionality or to leverage mobile
specific functionality on the back and
so what we're actually doing is
extending the enterprise back-end to
mobile devices and we make it very easy
for existing Java developers because
they can they can write everything in
Java okay so so what is that service I
mean okay it's connected to a mobile
application so but what does it manage
do we do do you have like a monitoring
tool what kind of tools do you have like
connected to this solution yeah so we've
glue uncrown link you can indeed monitor
the usage of your application and you
can for example decide to send push
notifications to all the Android devices
that are in this or this geographical
location and so so the typical mobile
functionality but you can also link the
data that has to be shown on your mobile
application with some back-end
information so imagine that you already
have a web store where you can wear
yourself tickets and you now want the
mobile application that sell tickets as
well you don't want to duplicate your
back-end you want to leverage the same
functionality on mobile and then you can
use glue and cloud link to implement the
the connection between mobile and the
backend so using glue on mobile you tell
your mobile app that I want to to get a
list of possible tickets and then glue
on cloud link will map that request to a
request on your back-end which requires
probably security so
you need to store a key and a secret
somewhere but you don't want to store
that in the mobile app so the man in the
middle here is glue on a cloud link
which allows you to connect which talks
enterprise protocols with the enterprise
components and which talks mobile
protocols with the mobile components ok
so typically like what kind of other
tools or solution would you use with
with glue on and then glue on link what
we see today is that there are many
applications that need to to call Web
Services or res based resources in
general and one of the hard parts is
that the the back-end applications whoa
they they tend to change so sometimes
the URL is change or new parameter has
been added and then it's a often
difficult that the mobile application
need to be changed as well so a new
technology well an emerging range of
technologies that's now applicable for
solving this problem is serve less
computing so by using functions as a
service you can offload some of the
functionality for your mobile app to a
cloud component so that's what we did
with glue on crowding and also with glue
on mobile so at glue on cloud link we
have a service container we use the
event project from Oracle to implement a
surveillance environment on the Oracle
cloud but it also runs on other older
class we have it running on the Amazon
ec2 for example as well but that's a
service environment that allows you to
execute functions there and we couple
that to the mobile development and we
started with the IDE so we have a gluon
plugin for the three IDs Eclipse
IntelliJ and that means and for eclipse
or IntelliJ and NetBeans we already
enhanced this plugin so that you can
also create functions so you can use
this plug-in to create mobile
applications and you can also use this
plug-in to create functions
those functions can then be linked for
in the mobile application but the code
is sent via gluon cloud link to the
service environment so when the mobile
application wants to execute this
function it is not happening at your
mobile phone it is happening into the
server in the service environment and
because of this if the protocols at the
backend changed for example you need to
update the function and you don't need
to update the mobile application
updating a function is much easier and
can be done much faster than updating a
mobile application which requires
rebuilding submitting to the App Store
and waiting for approval which can take
days and that's often not acceptable if
your back-end changes and you need to
have these mobile apps to be working
immediately again so so you mentioned
Oracle cloud it was announced I think at
JavaOne the FF project was announced
you're right I have one an overworld yes
and also the integration with gluon link
Larvik yes right so where can people
find more information about that older I
mean the entire solution yeah so part of
it is Oracle of course and the offense
project but so what about gluon link yes
Oh Oracle has a it has a dedicated
website about the event project it's it
is an open source project code is
available on github and there's lots of
information about it at the gluon we we
recently wrote a blog post about how to
use the new plugin and write serve less
functions and upload them so we have a
blog post and we have a screencast at
YouTube and we plan to to put more
information on the website so that's a
glue and glue and hq.com
or docstoc glue an ice cube calm that
contain the information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
