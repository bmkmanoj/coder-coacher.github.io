Chris hedgie JG JG thank you Chris jg at
the j fall conference welcome to the
night hacking show so we're streaming
live on the camera up here via ustream
and also recording for parlays over
there so tell us tell me a little bit
about what you what you guys are
speaking on here at the Jayhawk
Conference ok so today I'm going to
speak this afternoon about a modularity
case study so for the past year a fee
most active in well the modularity no-gi
space mostly and I've been working on a
system I've been architect on a system
in educational space so that's the
program that the Yuuzhan high schools in
the Netherlands and the difficult thing
with this system has we're building is
VR go you're not sure what what we were
building exactly because we are doing
innovation in education so we have to
try stuff out and so to do so i went to
evolve the system in just in an easy way
we have to well folks modularity because
that gives you the flexibility to move
forward more easily so that's what I've
been working on for past year mostly and
I'm going to show that system this
afternoon and we'll talk how we are we
built a closer modularity education that
all sounds exciting Chris tell me tell
us a little bit about what you're doing
here Jeff oh yeah sure I'm i'll be
talking by the title of the talk is
rediscovering modularity and at the
point i'll be working on in the talk is
this and we as developers are really
familiar with the concepts of modularity
and the principles of information hiding
and interfaces high cohesion low
coupling that type of thing and we do
that really well we do it all the time
we do it at the function level we
organize massive amounts of code into
functions we organize functions into
classes they become methods we're good
at organizing
the class interdependencies so that they
are reasonably orderly but then it stops
and we tend to just let the sea of
classes grow indefinitely and that's
simply not scalable we need higher level
abstract higher level abstractions than
just classes we need to organize the
code base in a modular hierarchy and
i'll be showing some metrics to that
help you figure out how modular your
code base is and some of our own
products from structure 101 that help
you get from something that is very
complicated and unstructured to
something that's more structured and all
to play more modular okay now so you
guys are both obviously here for a
similar topic modularity so how how
similar are different I your are your
approaches I guess I guess we haven't
gotten it's too much deal do you do you
know each other first of all yeah we
just met are you planning to see each
other's presentations oh yes yeah for
sure and very good so I should probably
I should probably be asking you after
you see each other's presentations what
you think about versus just from lush
and what Paul was saying there I think
that you know he's very very specific to
osgi which is one modularity technology
it's a way to and I guess implement
modularity in the concrete form and my
talk will be much more about the general
principles you organize your code base
first if it isn't already in a modular
structure once you've done that then you
have the options too
in a move port to your osgi platform or
what have you cool so before we we go
too much farther I have a gift for you
guys so I'm traveling around Europe
meeting folks interviewing them and
everybody I meet gets a night hacking
sticker but you have to be on the
livestream to get one this is this is a
very limited edition there's only a few
of these in the world and you guys have
them and the box over there um and we
also have it set up so we can show some
stuff in your desktops so maybe we'll
start with you first Crist is there
anything you'd like to show yeah sure
and I was just to give a flavor I
suppose of the the kind of things and
that I'll be talking about and this is a
title slide here I was gonna show i
guess a random spot here so we go down
one more and this is just a dependency
graph I guess of some classes from some
random open source code bases looking at
all right so that's a that's a huge
dependency graph here yeah and that's
not even particularly big because you
know you could be talking tens of
thousands of classes and of course the
complexity does your softer look like
this Chris I mean Paul does your
education software this area so we tried
to look better than this but well you
always get dependence is obviously and
I've used this tool both several times
for cockroaches mostly and it's very
useful yeah I mean and so the point i'll
be making is what you want to try and do
is organize it in the case of java we
can closer we can in the case of java we
can organize and the classes into
packages and this is an excellent way to
start introducing and introducing
modularity into a code base the problem
is that we don't tend to use it very
explicitly as modular abstractions
they tend to be very ad hoc uses of
packages and we end up with something
that's typically a big tangled mess as
opposed to a nice hierarchical structure
yep and so I was going to briefly show
the products here we have a protocol
restructure 101 and I just expand here
which allows you to do things like here
the red zone here indicates a tangle so
cyclic be dependent items and we can
simply explore in a kind of sandbox
environment moving items around to for
example free the util the tangle it's
used it doesn't use other stuff in the
system etc call and then on the other
side we've got something called
structure 101 which allows you to track
some of these metrics to keep the
complexity out in the first place and
then on the architectural side we can
create architecture diagrams from the
code which look something like this
where they're expressing some rules now
about the code base the dependency
should only flow downward in a diagram
and you can see here we have a couple of
instances where those rules are being
violated I can adjust the diagram here
the layering in it to express different
things you said you can actually use
this tool before yeah okay and see where
is it helpful in your code base to
figure out where the complexity was well
I don't actually use it for my current
code bitch but that did a lot of a lot
of code reviews for other companies in
the past and then it's the most helpful
tool because well it gives you insights
any code base that you don't know about
and all especially the violations are
very interesting because there are
always a pain points in an architecture
and you have to well look into that in
more detail and that's what you're going
to discuss for the customer yeah
sometimes say that the stuff that's a
real interest and where the pain is is
the stuff you don't see in the IDE it's
the stuff that emerges from the code but
into higher level structures and that's
where we need to put the emphasis now as
code bases grow bigger and bigger yeah
so those those slides from your talk
that's a talker giving later today when
yeah that's in about five minutes so so
i think i'm going to thank you very much
for thank you very much taking your time
out to speak on the live stream and have
a very good presentation chris forget
your yeah i'll move in here all right so
how you been doing pretty good it's r
it's relaxing space here so here's your
desktop what do you got here clips yeah
I've got a clip chair and a not just
eclipse but I've gotten plugin installed
it's called Billy tools and beanie
ptosis well plugin focused on developing
oh she eioped occasions and it's
interesting because if you talk about
our CI with people who know a little bit
about osgi they were always complain
what's that it's so difficult it's just
a pain yes to work with and I have to do
all this stuff at manifests and defining
imports and exports and it's just so
much work and well in the in the past
that's actually true I come from Joffe
background I've always been doing Joffe
and for all kind of frameworks actually
and I tried looking at always GI several
times in the past and I always thought
well I'm not going to use this because I
mean a lot modularity but I don't want
to go to all this trouble to get it it's
just that much over at well in the first
ball say two years or so that's a lot of
well improvements on tooling and
frameworks out there which makes it just
much easier to use ogi and now it's
almost see you're almost saying that if
folks they try to SGI before and they
hasn't worked out they should give it a
second shot with the modern yeah bitch
yeah it's a completely different world
than the world that fever in a few years
ago cool so um I don't see any code
where it was yeah I do you want me to
show something maybe a demo record sure
yeah the code might be a little hard to
read for the folks online but well I
tried to make it as big as possible so
it should be okay awesome so I
dispossess excited exactly so this is a
demo project I've been using for several
presentations
and actually if you want to see the full
presentations there's a few of them on
far less about osgi and modularity the
what Jeff 11 is also also also should be
there so they said demo project is just
a simple agenda conference agenda
project not doing that much but it shows
modularity in a nice way so what do you
what you want to do when you talk about
modularity is just split up your system
in small pieces and by isolating pieces
of cult well it gets much easier to do
maintenance on it because you don't have
to be afraid that you will change things
that you are not intended to change it
to two chains so what you want to end up
with is just several jar files these are
all ogi bundles so for example if I open
up one there's a manifest here and well
the exports are there and the manifest
version everything like that um but it
don't actually do with that myself this
is all generators for me so I fun
Eclipse project and are several ogive
bundles coming from there so let's take
a look at at how the project is
structured and what I always like to
start with is start with an API bundle
in an API bundle that's a bundle with no
implementations in it which is from
classes and interfaces which are public
to the rest of the world and are
exported in oci terms for other bundles
let's take a look at it I've got an
agenda class agenda interface story and
this is just an interface for service
level show in minutes so there's a
method to list from conferences and
there's a method to ethical enter
conference and the conference is just a
ball-playing pojo nothing exciting there
that's not the name and location that's
it yep so so far there's nothing else I
specific here and the only thing that I
do too well make this an Aussie I bundle
is to find this pd file and just define
that with a eclipse resort and here I
say well I want to export my agenda of
the API package and by this elbow or
eclipse will generate the OSHA bummer
for me
including the manifest file with an
export header of a general API so I've
my oh joy bundle without actually called
dealing with our GI right so the next
thing is that you probably want some
implementation of this surface and now
we start talking about our services and
it's another subject that people most
disabled OCR services that's like with
random dynamics and it's complicated and
well I probably don't need that and
that's where people go wrong because if
you want to do modularity rights it's
not just about Flash loading plus
loading is to start it's the low level
structure that we need never gets
interesting where we start talking about
surfaces so I've gotta know she is super
sheer energy can see it implements my
agenda and the other thing you can see
is that there's nothing how is GI
specific here again this is just a plain
old ojo again and a save some
conferences just in memory that's it so
how would you make this knowledge are
surface well there are several ways to
do that and what you should never do is
use a low-level API is because then
you'll get into a lot of pain of well
taken care of thread safe since and
everything like that but what I can do
is use the Java API in this case you
used Felix dependency manager it is just
one of the dependency injection
frameworks out there for oci and it has
the Java API to create a components with
an interface is my agenda interface my
implementation and I even have a service
dependency which will be injected by the
framework on some kind of lock surface
that's it there's all I have to do to
well create a dynamic LGI surface and
the framework will take care of
everything so it is pretty easy this is
not that much harder than involved using
any other so combining some good tooling
and then some frameworks for dependency
injection you can do pretty clean simple
osgi yeah absolutely and that's the goal
because we do one modularity and for to
do that completely well you need some
kind of go runtime dynamics and
modularity at runtime level and oh she
is the only solution for that and but it
should be easy to use and that's what
we're trying to well do here cool so
you're giving a session later today as
well right
yeah that's right what what time is what
time is your session uh 230 I believe Oh
see you have a little time to do
last-minute preparation are you all
ready yeah I'm ready I'd never seen talk
adelfa one already so I'm sorry nice
very nice a bunch of the bunch of the
guys on the online stream were
commenting so we have Jim Weaver on the
stream we also have Marcus Marcus and
he's very happy or using Eclipse and not
that beans yeah so um is there anything
you want to call out as resources folks
should look at yusei's osgi more
effectively or things you want to leave
people with no I would say they could
make another look at it and another good
place to start let's go to this website
i'm down to those work and now it's a
set of open source components that make
it easy to create modular cloud-based
applications so there's all kind of
components there to do well among go
integration for example the restful web
services based on jax-rs deploying the
clouds at auto scaling and everything
but one of the nice things on this
website is there's a lot of talk share
video recordings and those video
recording just show you well how to get
started with our GI and all the way to
well how do i do a cloud application bit
provisioning server and everything like
that so we just try to create well
resources for people here to get started
with cool all right well thanks a lot
for your time Paul thanks a lot for
having me good luck with your
presentation thanks and I'll be doing
sessions with other folks here at Jay
Paul so if you are watching online then
tune in in another 10 or 20 minutes and
we'll have our next set of interview
candidates school okay alright thanks
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
