to be here it's the last session of
today I think before we go to the JCB
party so no hard feeling so put all
probably the one who keep keep you
between you and your beer tonight with
that let's see I'll keep it very
informal so just shoot questions
whenever you want if we don't get
further on to the first slide that's
good if I get to the end of the slide
act that's also good but it's not
necessarily I'll do some code em was
rather than showing slides if you if you
rolled like that
I am a Java champion
I've been Coney Java since the inception
of the language I'm in the executive
committee in the JCP and also served in
the expert work for for embassy since
its beginning and earlier this year I
took over a suspect lead for this
specification I also serve on the the
expert group for jsr 375 which is a Java
EE security this is about the the
embassy specification so what I'll go
through today is a little bit about the
status what we have done what's happened
how how come we we arrived where we are
today and I'll go through the basics of
embassy and then I'll run some code
demos and do some coding and show how
it's done and hopefully inspire you to
try it out and and get feedback to us
and see that we're on right Rackham and
I was going so the status of 371
remember this one from last year that
was when Oracle announced that they want
to drop them with a and I discussed it
with some people at Oracle and we were
kind of annoyed that we couldn't
continue with this because we were
almost done
I mean the spec documents was
brilliantly written already so so it's
not very much
left until we're there we only need to
write the tzk more or less so that they
didn't drop it entirely as they did with
JMS and and and the the management a
source so we discussed and in January
they actually proposed to transfer it to
the community and we had ballot in AEC
and voted for a transfer of the spec
specification from Oracle to me so here
I am the new spec laid of embassy since
the ballot was approved in January the
actual document with atomic urines
signature on was received in in May so
it took about four months to go through
the process of actually having the
transfer finalized so and or model is
controller or control to the community
or for the community so this is a
community it's a specification it's all
open source we wanted to have community
members contribute and and we want to
give it back to the community and I'll
talk about that later as well the race
strong community supports there are
eight or last I checked there are eight
user groups around the world who are
supporting this chase or in the adopted
JSTOR program and there probably are
more to come because even though the
trend today is to ship the headless
arrest a PRS in micro service based
cloud environments you need to have some
UI and there is a market for a
server-side rendered us as well and this
is a very viable option to JSF for
example so we if you look at the
timeline we started this JSTOR back in
2014 and and it was approved and
followed the the regular status and and
it was pretty fast out with a needy or
one and a day or two around Java one in
2015
since that the activity officially kind
of stopped
and this was kind of the hiatus in Java
EE 8 but a couple of members of the Java
over the XM group and a couple of non
expert group members continued to
discuss on and off the mailing list and
delivered functionality and did evolve
the specification even though in this
silent period and some of those guys
were actually added to the expert group
later as well so it wasn't totally
dormant it was slowly moving forward but
we are still doing something and it was
community contributions at all it so and
then at JavaOne it was announced to be
dropped and the transfer ballot in
January and here we are
so what we've done since then is that
the transfer was approved by the
executive committee in January the
transfer was finalized in May we set up
a new infrastructure on github and we've
changed the license so this is a and
also I sore about that one we have moved
from Java and net to get up we did it
before
Javad enacted was closed down we've also
moved the issues and over we set up a
new website and we revise the schedule
and what we need to do is to formally or
use more of the resources in the the add
of the J's our program and get people to
contribute a little bit more than than
and we are able to do today so
so what are we done is to license it to
Apache to write license it's fully open
source all of it and that includes the
reference implementation which we call
Ozark and the TCK so we are we open
sourced the tyskie in May as Oracle is
doing with their technologies coming up
now with the move to the Eclipse
formation so what about the adopted
JSTOR program what you look when you
contribute with to help us with this
chair Sora
well first of all just write code use it
and try it out and see where are we
doing things right and where is this
of lacking is it something you want in
or is it something you want out it's
it's all open because we haven't
finalized it yet so give us feedback
what we should do is something good or
bad blog about it tweet about it show
that you care it's good things what we
also need is actually somebody who is a
creative kind of person who can create
us a logo type because when we launch we
want to have a cake and we want the cake
that is looking better than the jsf cake
that they had at the java land in in
March so so and the JSF logo is open
sourced contributed by members and voted
for in the expert Griffin we won't do
the same thing the only logos are being
validation and security specification so
all having them but we don't so if
anyone wants to draw something and
please do you will be laces at a
contributor at the spec document if you
do so that's the easy way if you can use
a pencil so that's about what I want to
say about the the roadmap and what's
going on and what's not going on and etc
so let's move on to what's in it so
first of all MSE is an action-based MSE
framework by action-based we mean that
the controller is defined by the
application and not by the the framework
and there are no standard java ee
implementations of this today you have
non-standard and other implementations
such as spring and receive for example
but there are no standardized in in the
java ecosystem so if we look at a pretty
common visualization of the MVC pattern
you typically have a request coming in
from a browser the hits your controller
and the controller of there's a model
and selects the view which access the
model to render the view and in a
components based embassy such as JSF the
controller is defined by the framework
you know you have the faces servlet in
in Joseph so so us the developer only
implements the view and and the model
and in an action is Emma's Asia such as
mac-10
the controller is defined by the
application so you as the developer have
total control over their controller and
and so it's a more fine-grained a way of
implementing things other action-based
are as I mentioned a spring embassy and
also stretch 2 if you remember that one
so one of the important objectives when
we started this specification was to
utilize the existing Java EE
technologies so if the we're something
we could use we should use it rather
than invent something and example of
this are to use CDI a bean validation
JPA for for the model implementations
and for the views use whatever we have
such as actually facelets and jsps or
other templates but the the focus was to
use the the existing technologies asks
the requirements and for the controller
there actually is isn't anything we can
use directly so we have to to implement
something or build something on top of
some of the existing technologies that
brought us to some key decisions or
actually one key decision in the expert
group pretty early
there were divided but we we came to a
a conclusion that we want to build MVC
on top of jax-rs
the alternative would be to build on top
of servlets which also would have made
sense and most or jax-rs can also be
implemented on top of servlet so so in
either way it's it's it's a good choice
so the jax-rs was selected after vote we
were divided in a group but personally I
think it's a good choice and especially
as today you see Jack psoriasis is a
very much used technology for writing in
westerns and faces and to use that
knowledge is one of the benefits of the
mac-10 so we start start to look at
looking at the controller's done so if
we start with a simple class in this
case called hello controller this name
is not necessarily a very good name and
I'll come back to that in a minute the
first thing we do to to you know step to
creating an MC controller here is to add
the a path annotation and as patent is a
Jack's orientation so so far we're only
using jacks or jacks or s and this is
the the add path for hello them and then
we had the F control orientation to this
one and this tells the the container
that this is not a jax-rs resource this
is a controller in an MVC and it will do
behave a little bit differently and the
important thing here is that in this
example I'll put the controller on the
class level and that means that every
method that has a public method and so
called one of these checks for us at
path or at get at post etcetera our
controllers so my class isn't the
controller that's why the name isn't
very good here because it's actually a
controller controller and then every
method is actually the controller
you can also put the at control
orientation on method level and that
means that you can actually mix and
match a rest resource with in MSE
controller and actually have everything
in one class if you want to do it
whether that's a good idea or not that
probably depends on your special use
case so that's basically the very
simplest a controller in missy it's just
one annotation on on a dexterous
resource let's go on with the views we
have our controller us with defined in a
couple of slides ago and then we add the
act get annotation which is jax-rs for
saying this is a ship we get requests
and in this case we return a string the
method name is is hello in this case and
we return hello.js b and this is where
it where the F control orientation
actually does its magic because usually
if you did this in the jacks or as a
resource you would return the string
hello JSP but since the app control
orientation there it behaves differently
and actually returns the view that hello
JSP renders and the default location of
this view this JSP files page is in the
debian views folder in your web
application and i'll show you a little
later
I show Jay SPS here we also support
facelets that's needed by the
specification and in addition to that
our reference information also support
finally free market massages loss today
and etc I think also we actually support
ask a dog and I think there are about 12
different rendering engines that we
support and those are community
contributed by people in the expert
group and however the exit group we also
have a lot of flexibility and this is
where we we we are thinking of actually
removing something
if it doesn't make sense to have this
flexibility because as I saw in a
previous slide we you can return a
string with just the the hello JSP the
name of the review you can also return a
viewable object and then it can actually
subclass this and do whatever and and
implement it yourself so it adds some
flexibility if you want that you can
also go a really low level and actually
use a Jack stress response class and and
just have the entity being the hello.js
pin all these are equivalent the render
the same view and we also added an @
viewer annotation so you can have a void
return a method return void and that's
not allowed in jax-rs
so this annotation makes that possible
and after you has another benefit and
that is if you have a controller class
or a class with a lot of controller
methods that all render the same view
you can set this at V orientation on
class level as you would do with a
controller and those reduce the
boilerplate and write write less
so over two models and in in models we
leverage CDI so in this case we have a
greeting object which is request scoped
in this case we leverage all serious
copes and this has the getter and setter
is just a plain old Java object and the
way you use it is if you have this
controller level created in a previous
that renders the hello JSP view you can
just simply inject your your greeting
class into this controller and then you
will be able to access it and and for
example set the message in your
controller method or do whatever you you
are doing with your model there and then
from the view you can access a model by
using expression language so this was
the the CDI approach we also support a
non CDI version of it in case your view
engine doesn't support CDI you have the
same controller so everything is the
same there and rather than injecting a
greetings CDI scope object you inject a
models object and models is a class
provided by MSE specification and the
the reason it's called models and not
model is to avoid collision with another
class called model in Java EE so so what
you do here it is basically a hash map
so we just put the the stuff you one of
the areas Atlanta I've been lazy and not
updated slice but they could be in San
Francisco and then you put the the the
message on on on the model and you can
access this is the same way from the via
so let's look at some code
I did an upgrade to High Sierra last
night and that is not nothing I wouldn't
recommend it if you haven't talked the
day after I couldn't log into my
computer afterwards so luckily I had an
admin account check you again reset my
password rotates it works so let's look
at some of the code here and I've
created a very simple a simple project
here and what i'm doing here is i'll
just show you how you set it up with the
form files and everything to get started
and we won't show any more profiles so
we rely on on a Java Web API in this
case I actually run on on Java EE 8 so
I'll be running it demos on GlassFish 5
we also support Java 87 so so you're
fine with either but in this case I'll
run on glassfish 5 and also some other
servers so you need to have the provided
web app AI or the full API of Java EE
and then you had the the MSE API
dependency and in my case I we support a
Jersey and rustici so I've just created
profiles for it for to make it clear
here so if I'm running in GlassFish or
any any server that comes to Jersey I
add the Oh Sarge or say dependency and
if I run with for example our flower
which comes with birthday say I had the
procedure depends there so these two
dependencies you need to need to have
the API and you need to have the
reference implementation and that is
because we're not a part of Java EE but
we rely on on Java EE technologies I
also have some profiles here for setting
it up in docker I'll run some demos in
that afterwards but that's not the focus
of this talk
so let's look at my controller class for
first of all you said it you set up the
the application the same way you would
do with a dexterous application because
we're basing on jax-rs so I'm using all
dexterous here with the application
class and the application path and and
just add my controller attitude we do
then Ajax resource and my controller is
super simple
it just says returners hello JSP so
nothing there and my view is put it in
the web use folder and is also just
saying hellos of the world so if I run
this one you would expect it should say
hello world and it does so it's no magic
there we're not doing any anything cool
yet so let's do something and for
example go in here and inject the models
like this and maybe say model that's
message and one this and then just
returned the JSP ssibly
and in interview I could say rather than
saying hello world older message so now
I should have a getro guest coming into
my my path that hello or to set the the
message on the model and return the same
view as I did previously I said run this
one you should say hello job one so now
I'm actually interacting with the model
from my view such that it goes a little
bit further and I prepared a nother here
I'll just run it to begin with so you'll
see it's doing exactly the same as the
stuff we're doing what I've added here
is one more view a a form that is just
doing a post of the name to give the
controller and my hello controller is
exactly the same so what I want to do
here is that when I when I access this
page I want to have a input field where
I can write my name and then have it to
say hello to my name so what I'll do
here is to rather than return the the
the hello page I'll return the the form
and run it
so now it says it renders different view
it's the same reakless going down to the
controller or it's the same controller
or handling it but there's another view
rendering so if I have for example right
dick and submit it it was a method of
love because I haven't implemented
anything to handle a post yet so this is
all as expected so what does she do is
to add another method and use the add
post from from dexterous and let's use a
void here like this and it doesn't do
anything so let's add an annotation and
render the hello JSP so now when I get a
post it should be handled with this
method and returned the the hello page
so if I run this one again still say
look to do I submit it and it renders an
empty page and that's because I haven't
done any updates to the model yet so
what I have to do is actually to take
this message here and do that when I do
the post if I then run it it should say
hello hello did you have one even though
I say do care and he says hello to jovan
because it's requests go to everything
right this is per request but I don't
want to say hello to job one I mean it's
Duke I'm putting insert it's Duke I want
to say hello to so let's access whatever
I get to this form and then I can use
the the form purim jax-rs annotation and
it is in a name attribute in in my view
it's called
name here
so and this is a string name so here I
get the the name from the form and then
I can rather than saying hello to job
one I can say ho hello to name right so
I'm using the input ID ID it's not very
advanced but still um I'm just getting
what I get from the form so now I say
hello Duke this is how it works
so I also said that we have some other
cool small features and say that you
want to have some security added to this
this post over this form for example
protect yourself for cross-site request
forgery then we have a simple annotation
we can add here and say that we want
this to be CSRs F valid so by adding
this annotation I'm explicitly saying
that this HT request should be validated
for cross-site request forgery I could
do it by setting a property and have it
implicitly that all methods are going to
be it this is the explicit way and the
way I configure that is to set a
property and when I configure it the
application so then I can set the get
properties and here is I set the
prediction to to be explicit
so so if I now run it what do you expect
will happen right in Duke submit it but
it doesn't show anything don't say if
that's correct that's a nice one there
see I get a a 400 bad request error you
would expected it to be a foreigner 3
not allowed but that that depends on on
the the implementation I think run
anything Wallflower tours and we'll look
at it there what I should do to to avoid
this thing is that in my form I actually
need to add this CSRF token that is
generated from the server so why not
access the controller and renders this
view this token is set in my form and is
valid until the next request so this is
just an way of doing it and the way I do
this is that I use the the embassy
context which I also can access here in
in my my by injecting it in my class and
was a context so I can also actually use
it in in my method here too to extract
information from it for example get CSRF
if I want to check if that's valid and
do some coding on it on server side so
what will happen now when I run it is
that now I've set the token in my form
and I'm validating on the server so when
I submit Derrick it will say hello dick
so let's also check for four we also
have some simple language support or
internationalization so I've already
injected the MSA contexts so so what I
can do here is to take the MSE context
and get like locale and get language for
example and I can just say spring
language is so I get the language from
the the MSE context and then I can I can
just add here maybe you know in which
language Shaw I'm saying hello in or I
could actually have a language string
which will be a natural thing to do but
in this demo I'll just do that yes if I
now say do care I submit it and I say
hello do it in English and that is
because I'm here or mi brazo said in
English so if I go into here and set a
nother language for example they're set
it to Klingon for example just disable
this and do the same thing go there and
say do care and submit Oh
right
they're enable so now it's all think so
now it should say hello in in some
different language so it's a detected
language in a browser and the the
default implementation which comes with
the reference implication is that you
take it from the language header in the
HTTP request but you can also provide
your your own language provider in and
and figure it out whatever you want to
do if it's from the URL structure if you
add like German or English in front or
in the back of the URL you can you can
just implement very simply that a
language provider to figure out which
language it is there is another cool
thing we have and that is events so we
have added support for a number of
events so if I have a kind of a private
mind and here I can use
CDI servers and for example the after
controller events so this is a event
that will fired after the controller has
been invoked and I can just do whatever
I want here
sorry it has a CDI event but the after
controller event is from MSI yes so we
have we have four five different events
defined it's the after controller it's
after process view event before
controller before process view and
controller redirect event so we have
five events defined and currently I'm
actually not sure if we by default
support asynchronous events since we're
running on Syria too I think we need to
look at the implementation because these
events if they are synchronous you
shouldn't do anything heavy lifting here
because then you will slow down your
application but what we can do now is if
we decide that Java EE 8 is our baseline
we can rely on on asynchronous events
and actually do that
so this one should just be printing in
in the log when we do it stuff oh okay
it looks like we have to do something
for to be able to support see reality so
I want to show another thing that we
actually support Java EE right but for
before that all this is running in
GlassFish so I just wanted to show you
that we also support wild climb or other
in relation so let's go to
and they font up a little
so this is reasonable
so if I build this on with the the
docker profile for wildfire I would
Navin playin package docker build
awesome docker I think I call that so
I'll just rebuild whatever I built now
and just build a docker image of it
based on wildfly 11 release candidates
and then I should be able to run it
there's some fire supply and in docker
and my application there and I should be
ready to go local host 8080
it really to this simple form there and
it runs here and if I write dick it says
a lot to do in English so we actually
support wildfly as well so we have a
reference information that supports
Jerseyan and Norris TC and the others
should be fairly simple to write support
for what I also have here want to show
you is Java e8 support a little bit but
since we are supporting Java EE we
support bean validation so if I use the
any email and say that the name of
Symantec in the forum has to be an email
I can run this one again okay
I the reason why it didn't work is that
since I build it income online with the
Wildflower profile I'm using the rest is
a version of it sir just have to make
sure that I fill it with the glass while
a glassfish profile and then I should be
able to run so here we go if I said dick
now and submit it it will say a bad
request and that's because it's not an
email and I'm not handling these errors
very aggressively so if I want to I see
we have only five minutes left so I
don't think I'll have time for it but if
if I write a Duke at Java calm email or
s it will work so he says valiree's I
wasn't able to show you the the actual
how you can handle this well this
validation errors but we have a
fine-grained control and a pretty cool
way to handle each of these validations
errors individually so let me just go
back to my slides we're gonna be off
today JP party soon so if you sum up its
action base time you see it
that means you build the controller in
the application we build on existing
Java EE technologies and we also support
Java EE 8 you also have a little bit
work maybe to look at you last see the I
- no but
we support the other pretty well we're
built on top of jax-rs
we support GlassFish and wildfly the
plan going on for this specification is
that during the last part of this year
we should be able to publish a public
review then the plan is to have a
proposed final draft in q1 next year and
hopefully have a final release q2 next
year so within six to eight months we
should be able to find lastest
specification
and currently we are in get up and we're
looking at the development with Java e
or e fo J and it would be very natural
for us to follow them to eclipse I don't
think we'll go there before I think they
should be able to set up the project
just get it done but we will start the
dialogue with them and and movies all
three eclipses together with them and
hopefully we can have some way of being
incorporated into the Java EE or Evo
echo system again the the project page
is M I suspect of the org we are on
github we have the mo suspect
organization there we are also currently
in the Java EE github organization and
we will be there until they move it to
github whether they actually move it and
think that it's part of the Oracle code
base or whatever I'm not sure what's
gonna happen to this repo but we treat
it as a read-only mirror so whenever we
push something to our wrapper we just
push to there as well so we don't do
anything the demos I showed here today
are on my github we also have demos on
on the MSD organization we have a buff
tomorrow at 7:45 there I can show some
more details about how to do the
validation stuff and we can discuss a
little bit I have to move forward I know
it's late tomorrow and there's probably
lots of parties going on then as well
but I hope some we will come there and
we can go through it it's in this room
and so that's what I had don't forget to
vote when you go and it's a green deck
that but it's best to push but we feel
free to push the others as well we have
a couple of minutes for questions and if
you want to want me to show you I can
show you the the website it looks pretty
ok this
how the website looks a couple examples
internet here but but it also links to
our Giro rep oh we're Oh Sark that's the
reference implication we have the
specification there our website the TCK
fully open open source approach to on
kirov we have some proposals where you
can actually submit things you want to
have introspect but we are not able to
do right now and we also probably put
some samples and tutorial software as
well so that's it
questions one minute for question yes
yes yes session scope for CDI we
actually support a custom scope as well
we have defined our own scope for
redirects so similar to flash scope in
spring MVC so so you can actually keep
the scope over beam if you implement the
post redirect get pattern so the radar
scope will last for one one post and
won't yet
yes
yeah yeah so the question is if the
service request HTTP request is
available in an MC controller and the
answer to that is it may or it may not
it depends on if the jax-rs
implementation are on top of servlet or
not because jax-rs can be implemented
without servlets and then you won't have
access to it so currently ozark is using
a little bit of sort of stuff so so and
I think post rest easy and Jersey are
based on servlet so we find there but
you can actually have an implementation
that doesn't have the servlets so you
need to know where you are yeah in
Jersey you can but I don't think that
would work in other
yes
I think that as if the jax-rs
implementation you're using is based on
servlet and so look for you would get it
for free the same
yeah I would say that yes you have we
have I didn't have time to show that
today but I'll do that in in both show
the validation we have because jax-rs
comes with validation and supports bean
validation and if you you have like the
email doesn't validate true jax-rs will
will throw an exception and and you can
have an exception mapper that handles it
and does whatever you do and that's kind
of like a one-size-fits-all catch it
way of doing it and that's not
necessarily good for a MSE application
where you want to have a little bit more
fine guys control and maybe populate a
read something on the field that was
actually not validated similarly so you
want to redirect to the same form and
say that hey the email field was not
filled correctly and and we have support
for that by by getting the individual
and by bypassing the jax-rs exception
validation humbling and inject a binding
result and use that in your form I'll
show that tomorrow or yes
I think it's it's actually just
extending hashmap so whatever you can
put in a hashmap you can use
sorry
have we explicitly said that inspect but
then it's probably true I'm not sure I
have to check Tara
yes I think we're past our time and
ready for JCP thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
