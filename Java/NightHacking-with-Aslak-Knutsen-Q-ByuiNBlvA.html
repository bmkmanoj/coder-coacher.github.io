alright so I'm here for another night
hacking edition with AWS lock this is
your second appearance yeah yep on the
night hijacking show and we are here at
jbug also J Buc Oslo jbug so we're in
Oslo Norway at the jboss users group and
being nicely hosted by conduct some
thanks guys alright so tell us a little
bit about I mean just reintroduce
yourself for folks who don't know about
your greatness yeah most liquids numb
the technical lead of the art Killian
project working for red hat as a senior
software developer and basically deal
with the decoder runner Killian and
around the community and Italy up the
project visit and for those of you who
didn't see the earlier recording at
devoxx without luck I'd recommend
checking it out I think you were at the
top tier of our real hackers who
actually modified code multiply and did
real hacking that's good on the show so
you're setting high standards for for
the program oh and try to repeat that
known as well yeah we're gonna we're
going to try some crazy stuff here which
will get to a second alright and let's
quickly say hi to our studio our studio
audience oh wow let me
hi I'm yadi I work at conduct and have
to raspberry pi boxes at home I'm not
quite curious to find out more about
this yeah I'm gay also work it conduct I
have never even seen a raspberry pi so
I'm really curious but I am I'm also
part of the jpg meet up oh yeah i'm eric
i work here at conduct and I don't have
a Raspberry Pi yet maybe I will tomorrow
I'm Thomas Katya I'm air for the pie I
will get one soon hello my name is
Christian I will also work here at
conduct and looking forward to learning
more about the pie cool all right
welcome guys thanks for coming down the
cold evening to see hacking could you
mute the mic for now okay thanks and any
time you guys feel like jumping in and
heckling us just grab the mic you can
shut behind our backs alright so the the
plan for today is so last time we did a
lot of stuff with our Killian and showed
how you can use it for testing your
applications and doing all this stuff
for four yups running on a desktop but
we were thinking that you know it'd be
nice and be really cool if you could run
our Killian on the Raspberry Pi exactly
it should work i mean the the general
idea Rana Killian is that you have well
it started out being the enterprise
application servers and then kind of
went down to embedded containers like
CDI or hoping you to be and so on and
then kind of moved on to the same model
works for operating systems and works
for for servers in that sense whether
you're installing a package and and
running with that or you're installing
an application in applications
from a abstraction point of view 850
same same so we have a little new member
of the earth Gillian family that's TR
Chilean demon which is intended to be
able to run in a normal se environment
to be a isolated demon that run whatever
you want to deploy to it's not actually
a deployment mechanism per se but it
starts off the application and I figure
that okay that should run on the
raspberry yeah fortunately we have a
vanessi build for the Raspberry Pi which
we can we can test out ok so what we're
what we're going to be playing with
today so we have here a Raspberry Pi
attached to a creative power source
portable power source and it's one of
the later model raspberry PI's with 512
megabytes of RAM gigabytes megabytes
gigabytes of megabytes around yes thanks
have two gigabyte of RAM and we're going
to see this is running the latest java 8
early access built which includes some
java effects although we're not going to
play with that today we played with that
yesterday and it should run any SE
application on it fine for folks who
want to try setting up one of these pies
yourself let me let me show you a little
bit about how you can configure it with
all the same stuff we're going to show
oh so here's here's the pie hardware
itself so just to describe the hardware
for those of you who haven't played
around with one before it runs an ARM
processor very low power arm processor
doesn't even require fan farm version 6
it has a little sandwich memory module
on top of it so the original raspberry
pi had um 256 megabytes and now it's the
current shipping ones are 512 megabytes
which is enough to run reasonable size
java applications
on them it has an hdmi and composite out
so you can output to a monitor although
today we're just going to be
terminalling in to it via ssh ethernet
so you can hook it up to a network a
couple USB ports so you could have
keyboard mouse other peripherals and it
also has audio and some pinouts you
could use to control servos or motors
you want to do some sort of automation
project so it's it's fairly nice piece
of hardware and it's very very
inexpensive these are only 25 or 35 US
dollars what's what's that and nor we
and deletion crowns long as I times five
times ok so 125 275 grounds about what's
the same as a coffee visit yeah I
noticed prices here are very high mm-hmm
how do you guys actually well then a
high and low ends I guess of yeah ok so
it all works out yeah alright so this is
the hardware we're gonna be playing
around with and I've already
pre-configured this pie with a java SE
build but for folks who want to give it
a try yourself this is my blog Steve on
Java calm and I recently got a scroll
down a little bit I recently did a blog
post on how to set up the Raspberry Pi
with the early access build and it goes
through everything from getting the
sdcard configured so how to you know
format the SD card install the boot
linux deviant distribution little
eccentricities about getting the right
hard floor soft float distributions for
java the latest version of java early
access is hard float so you don't need
to download the soft float builds
anymore and how to get the EA axis on
the pie and then run your job
applications in this case i have a
sample javafx application which i
uploaded to github
you can try out alright so that's
setting up the pie we're not going to do
that today but later on you guys can try
out these instructions and feel free to
yell at me if they're incorrect in any
way there actually are some some
official docs for this but um I think I
think I'd beat them in terms of
correctness on the first pass oh please
I believe my instructions worked pretty
flawlessly okay so let's actually play
around well do you want to do you want
to show anything with our Killian first
just to let people now now we can start
on it I mean if you want to know about
it can we can see the previous recording
yeah yeah puff up instead alright so
before we swap once we swap I can't see
the chat anymore okay alright so char
the he's the the leader of the
evangelism team he's he's correcting me
on the pumpkin pick fights for the pie
512 megabytes and also mentioning that
Java mag is is out and there's some good
articles in Java magazine about embedded
and pie and the Internet of Things so
that's not a good source to check stuff
out and also has an article about earn
you an article and commercial I guess
about the new book about our kill you oh
very nice alright so thanks shark and
let's swap over to your desktop now see
maybe full screen will work yeah oh and
actually before we do that I should
probably get rid of the window dressing
there we go
alright so we've still got audio no
window dressing all right it was good
sit the whole slow i'm missing the
bottom part i'm missing a little of your
yeah that's fine uh yeah i can scroll up
and forget it yeah but Yandy bit at the
bottom I guess more sensible yeah
alright so well the the normal log
artillery in containers comes in often
in three different forms of being the
and the embedded type container which
you can start up within the same jvm as
your your client there's the managed one
who will start up a different process
but normally on the same same computer
and then you have the remote version of
them who then just communicates with
something that's already existing on me
on a server so in the in the case of the
in the case of the art ilion demon
container it works in the same fashion
as as any other achillion test but
creating some form of archive that can
be deployed to somewhere and then run
those tests and based on what's in that
in the inner archive if we start up this
is then they managed mode of that
container so that's going to start up a
separate process from the client
deployed it take the classes and then
run them so if we just run it once you
see starting up a little demon and
running like I forgot to actually put a
breakpoint here and see that it will
never break on the client side it should
break because it's actually running
somewhere else and based on this
conceptual idea of a remote container of
the same I believe and what we're going
to try to hack up is to have this
running on the Raspberry Pi article so
let's see where
just when we hundy oh yeah there we go
so we already configured the pie on the
local network here and we're connecting
to it over ssh logging in as the default
PI user so we're going to copy some
files I guess yeah currently the demon
requires that a something running on
that remote remote host we don't have
the distribution basically up running it
so we need to copy over the the tiny
little demon manger just start up
something on that the end if I can type
no grasp that way there we go
and then we have that one there and then
we can log in
what
so now we're in the rest break yep
pretty cool and the Java VM their thumbs
are up us-saudi k18 java was running
this thing and no tricks up our sleeve
this is the publicly available 18 early
access you can download yep so let's try
to fire up to the email tom so you know
if we were if we were really good and
professional we would have actually
tested this before the stream you know
that the unprofessionally just assume is
going to work so i guess i wouldn't be
real hacking if we actually hacked
before we got started injury so this is
more fun yeah you just have to put your
faith in the demo gods and so on right
sir so this defaulted Bible host huh
let's try to bind to local host port 41
590 anybody buns do any any address
basically and then only 41 5 194 porch
and so in theory we should be able to
reach that from our client side here
what is the actual IP listen same one
you just associated campers smart
thinking so let's copy that one and then
we have a little configuration to tell
it that this is revolution now copy that
address
say TV show
elastic porch was for 159
for there i configure didn't even a
container to try to connect to that one
so then the moment of truth I guess now
this is set up with the remote versatile
a container so the only thing that's
really going to happen is deploying this
little greeter class over to the
raspberry and booting up the environment
they're running the test case and
hopefully returning some results so if
we now do run a DNA test let's see
something happening blue well we got a
green test that's good that's good I
guess it's not actually doing anything
that was doing things but not actually
printing anything so without a print on
the server that's your prints on the
server side okay on the raspberry yeah
run that again
hey very nice I was almost too easy
something got to be wrong here all right
looks like it works right yeah so this
this was supposed to take us a couple
hours can you see can you see any of the
deployed files on the Raspberry Pi does
it to pull em to attempt directory or
somewhere when it runs summer yeah good
question let's see what he does have not
extra sure nothing where something
intent their modules I guess well that's
the module studies extracting using
nanny to communicate with your client
and server using Gables modules to pull
up tanya so it is sucking over the code
and putting it in time well I'm assuming
this is just the is it probably just the
the demon main the container itself but
if we see if you try um how i make it so
invisible file i was taught not none
that directory in the home where we live
directory rihanna come up
yeah well am I actually putting
something down in that module system
that we can see now because it's
removing it on the point yet again right
so oops so if we watch that run it again
maybe something happens maybe once every
two seconds not yeah two seconds in
power in our ketchup now where's the end
and one
the
Fung study dakotans here to see how it
actually works so this is the main main
runs the Kama that's the protocol
starting in Pine drink on deploy
test
should I have enough Toyota
ok
under strange so I was under pulling
something yeah putting it out to go to
the boy Tommy get smaller fish there you
go hi let's get to play put any hard
time and that's what that's when I
survey starch
oh no curse of course it's actually it's
not putting any piles on this because
it's using safely transferring the
shrink-wrap archived from the client to
the server and then it's running it and
running in armor yeah it's basically
creating a shrink wrap the classloader
so I lost it directly from the stream
that is coming in in 70 mm people nifty
Andrew ok so we learn we learn something
about how the Tool Works it doesn't even
leave any choices it's that good hmm
cool all right so let's let's find out
what sort of questions you guys had a
better killian or the Raspberry Pi and
same same question for four focus on the
screen char char says well done he likes
me likes our Killian running on the pyre
are you gonna are you going to make this
say you should you should do an official
jboss blog so you can support we can do
the if the Raspberry Pi no absolutely
something to write a book so what sort
of questions you guys have about the pie
hardware are killing that a lot can i
can answer
what kind of access to enough to the hog
with Java alright so let's try yeah I
was wondering what kind of access you
actually have to the hard work to the
poor some stuff through java yeah i can
do the vm so loose most of the hardware
you can access just through the normal
java api s so I know Simon one of my co
colleagues did hehe access the ports
probably you're talking about these pin
outs right for controlling motors he
used those to control a crane and well I
never really asked him how he did it but
I I seem to remember he had to do
something tricky with J&amp;amp;I or something
low level to get access although I
believe they're they're going to add in
better support for that in the Java
libraries in a future release because
they're merging in some of the any
features into the SE forearm so I the
short answer is I know that you could do
today there's a trick and Simon Ritter
is a good person to ask about that and
hopefully it will get easier in the
future pine forge a something for the
gent ok there you go Jonathan is the
answer and Piper J so somebody even
packaged up the solution and made the
library cool for those of you who don't
know Jonathan Giles is a member of the
javafx controls team any work set of New
Zealand so he's a cool guy so he's up
late I guess yeah
he works on ours because he has to match
the USB so any anything's you guys were
thinking about what we are what are
going to do with your pies now pass the
mic will it run XBMC so that's that's
actually one of the more popular uses
the Raspberry Pi is as a home media
center it's supposed to do full 1080p
video isn't it Lisa
tried to open a web patient and open
what's up I hope I'm still connected to
the Internet yeah I'm on the chat so I
guess yeah alright so you can you can
run XBMC as a home media center or I
guess there's a version of Raspberry Pi
BMC which so Jonathan's helping answer
all our pie questions that's great
thanks thanks Jonathan and it's is one
of the more popular uses for the pie a
lot of people hook it up to their TVs
and it's very hackable so you could even
run your own you know javafx user
interface for you know managing your
media collection transferring files from
around your house and aggregating them
and then run XBMC as a remote user
interface 40 showing all your movies so
how about you guys are you going to
whole media center you have grander
respirations seemingly to hook up an
external hard drive or something not
that much space it is a all equally SD
card puzzle yeah i think so i'm jonathan
you probably answers but i think i think
what people do is these the USB ports
doesn't up storage devices
yeah this is also not a recommended
power solution for the pie a single USB
port only supplies 500 mil amps of power
which is not quite enough to power the
pie comfortably so if you had a keyboard
and other devices attached to it you
might not have a power to run the pie
itself you really they recommend seven
hundred milliamps or higher which most
cell phone chargers will take care of
and and Jonathan gave us the answer to
Ho media solution you run an ass off
your Ethernet oh yeah of course that's
enough so you've got this all figured
out already you're going to go home and
set set up day on comedia sorry alright
so anything else gonna show us look well
I can show other random acts the run
stuff yeah if you want sure what do you
got well I was working on some some
interesting stuff last week if anyone
knows the cables forged project
basically a kind like it's a project
management in that sense but I'm not on
a scale of managing the project from him
but fixing dependencies big thing
scaffolding and that kind of thing one
of the things that I was working on
there was too it's always annoying to
have well when this theory new version
of some kind of library and so on and I
mean maven should know how to tell you
that I mean it has API is in the
background to federal diversions from
the repositories and so on so i hacked
up a little version for that for for
forge so when you have a normal project
with an xml file any any xml or any-any
palm maximal either yeah well the
plug-in will then scan through that palm
and look for later versions of update
define define the artifact so if we look
at the
look at the palm itself you can see here
that it currently has are killing 10
final as alpha six of the resolver so if
we simply run maybe an update oh right
they simply one maybe an update on the
project for full end of the fourth
plugin will then kick in and we'll start
to just candy repositories for newer
version going optimate in central or
whatever these de palmas it's the point
so in this case it's finding that hey
there is a couple of new versions of the
of the arquillian project out so you can
look at for instance which versions are
out there one two and three and then in
the air killian plugin for forge we
integrated in integrated it with the TR
chili in the road website and the
release notes so if you want to select
and said okay we're going to upgrade to
103 and actually goes to to our
calculator org prints out it's awesome
musky hike and will tell you that
between the version you have in your
palm and the new one this is release
notes for the 1010 so even hard one of
your fighting off I exactly I had to
swap it around so you could potentially
see up front before you upgrade but but
now it's after so you can see what
faults you now have inside and then of
course with links to the actual release
notes where do you get more information
so cool that's pretty cool yeah that's
that's much nicer than like having a
project depend on a snapshot or latest
version where you don't really control
it oh yeah yeah and it makes it very
easy to upgrade your project versions I
don't know what you've broken mmhmm yeah
cool that's a nice hot so I've been
doing updating sir so are you guys maven
users yeah Gradle anybody who's I be no
antis kind of yucky and underneath the
covers Forge is using maven or lets you
pick for your project with them well
currently well then additional
abstraction layer on top of any build
system in theory so if anyone want to
build the ant version of all the stuff
that's there for a minute or Gradle
buddy currently the only basis for Navin
okay but it's possible possible to plug
in something else any future plans for a
great all cradles I'm not sure actually
I would assume down the line at some
points here I mean a lot of the things
that are happening with the dependency
and so on are the same same stuff just
how how you read in how you write the
files when Gradle makes it a bit
difficult because I mean you have a
structure of an XML that you describe
how how the project actually worked in
maven we Gradle it's cold you have to
parse in a census yeah there's more if
there's this more of a mix of the
declarative palm style and also build
code execution yeah which doesn't follow
it into your purse pattern right at
times and and Gradle has a tooling API
but I'm not sure if that's right a ball
or if that's read-only API because in
theory d le version does blood in time
actually updates the palm file right so
you want to be able to do things like
that yeah and I mean in in in Gradle the
verse number could become concatenated
from whatever so quite hard to kind of
play back to wear them value actually
came from it is cool
alright so soon why don't we see if any
of that one else made comments or ask
questions on a stream and if not what
we'll do is we'll we'll swap over to non
recorded streaming so we'll leave the
stream running and then break out break
out the good stuff deal above above 18
above 18 content ok leone xxx ok so char
char wants you to come and speak about
our Killian sure and raspberry pie maybe
also if if anybody here is interested in
coming to Russia for India or China we
have upcoming regional javaone
conferences and the cfps are just opens
the Russian ones open now and I believe
China and into your opening in the next
few weeks so submit papers and then you
can tell your boss to fly you out to you
danger what you ping I'll help you
convince your boss oh alright so thanks
thanks everybody online for watching the
livestream we're going to keep it
running after up dates for the events as
well Russia India China so thanks for
watching the stream and will will
continue going a little bit after the
closing so don't leave this dream quite
yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
