which is a garbage collector that's
right so why do we need a second garbage
collector oh okay I'm gonna talk about
this on my talk so the gist of it is we
are progressing from full list of the
word collector of the fully concurrent
collectors g1 and CMS are kind of
halfway there
g1 for instance dust concurrent mark
concurrently so it solves the large
portion of the poles already there is
the second part which is actual
relocation of the object and the
updating the heap references after you
did that current opportunity collectors
do that in stop the world
Shenandoah does it concurrently does it
solves the second big part of the GC
pause this is why I shouldn't Oh is able
to achieve very small pauses because it
solves most of the problems that are
there it doesn't concurrently okay so
why is that important
when is it important or I mean like a
kind of though there are two basic
things first when you go off to the
large heaps you suddenly realize that
your garbage collection overheads are
dependent on the amount of alive objects
in the heap which are proportional to
the heap usually so if you are looking
into the real world deployments when you
have multi ten gigabytes heaps say my
desktop has countered gigabytes heaps I
run workloads with the heaps like that
I want GC technology to do nicely in
those heaps and the second part is that
when you realize that the collection
garbage collection our hats are actually
in cycles per megabytes for instance the
CPU cycles per megabyte but you're human
but the metrics that you're after are in
human units like you have the metric
that you don't want the post time less
than larger than 100 millisecond for
instance that means if you run slow
Hardware it gets interesting because
what what fit well the desktop look like
for instance you have the 4 gigabyte
heap which runs nicely on your desktop
which has the post times of 10
milliseconds and then you run on the
embedded device which is a hundred times
slower and for the same amount of work
you'll now have a second a single second
GC pause which is not nice so it's not
always about the large heaps it's all
it's mostly about low latency which
means larger heaps or slower harder okay
so and so in your session are you
presenting what code examples what are
you really talking about yeah we prefer
not to talk about Shannon door itself
because if you look at the GC talks you
might wonder and you might have this
impression that the GC another yet
another GC is the good innovation and
everything there is brand new it's not
like that it's usually the incremental
improvements in the technology and so to
understand what step shenandoah took
it's important to understand what was
before it so before explaining watching
on door does we are explaining what
current GC is do and why they do this
this particular way and why it's
complicated to do watch an and or does
okay and so what kind of developers then
will need that kind of I mean we need
the shenandoah I mean it said well it so
it's for large applications but more
specifically like who today is not
looking at this technology and my
actually be interested in it I think
that the people who are aware of GC
pauses and where GC pauses are affecting
their latency metrics or our primary
target you have to understand that there
is the latency throughput trader of
going on so you cannot have low latency
and high throughput at the same time
there is a kind the contrary intuitive
goals there so most people who are
running say patched workloads or
non-interactive for clothes
are not the target they want raw
throughput they can accept multi second
GC pauses but they want another 30% say
or 20% throughput improvement on top of
that so in my mind there is the spectrum
where the parallel and serial like and
on the throughput part of the spectrum
when you have high throughput higher
latency you have Shenandoah which has
low latency but more throughput overhead
and you have j1 and CMS which kinda in
the middle try to balance between these
two goals so where on that spectrum you
fit it depends on the application in the
use case you are after it might might as
well be that your application is
actually running fine without Shenandoah
and we are happy that you have that
application some of our applications do
not run fine on many open on all open
JDK disease so this is why Shannon Dora
okay and so when where do you find more
information about we have a wiki page
which is I think the first Google hit
when you google for Shenandoah Java
Shenandoah is actually the the park so
if you do a fortune and OGC you will
probably Google Shenandoah golf course
so Shenandoah Java gives you the wiki
page and open JDK Java net you have all
the information there where to get the
builds how did unit what it is called to
debug it curve the performance assess it
etc so and you were part of that project
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
