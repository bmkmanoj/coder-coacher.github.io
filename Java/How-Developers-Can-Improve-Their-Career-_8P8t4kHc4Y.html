everyone we are here at the Java hub
directly from Java 1 and this is 2016
and we are having a great show today or
extras whole week yes I did and you know
we have all kinds of very very cool
discussions and I'm here we're for very
very good friends but a guy that's
that's fundamental in the Java ecosystem
mr. patch kokorin how Patrick hi Bruno
good to be here I'm doing good so so
Patrick you are the PMO of the JCP right
I'm that chair suggestion yes champion
yes you're the chair of the JCP that's
right right and you're responsible to
hurdle all of the other community around
a reproving java in danger yes now the
reason we are here today it's not
stockist receiver about the JCP right
but it should talk about how developers
can improve their career indeed yes the
JCP is one of the best ways that
developer getting over the Koreans right
that's right yes why because ok you
notice I have gray hair I've been in
this business for more than 30 years
right when i started i started with
punch cards huh there was no not even
pcs species came a little bit later
right ah when I started a Cray
supercomputer cost 10 million dollars
this thing that I'm holding in my hand
is more powerful than that Cray
supercomputer right there was no
internet there was no net lucky exactly
I of course more than they was like the
point is you can't predict in this
industry what's good things are going to
be like in five years much less 30 years
yeah but if you're a young person
selling out today what are you going to
do how are you going to plan your career
how you're going to put yourself in a
position where you
learn the things that you need to learn
so that as new stuff comes along you can
take advantage ollie so that's one
aspect of this the other is I've been
reading a bunch of books recently about
automation and robots and stuff like
that and how most of the jobs that
people have today are going to go away
because machines will do them right you
know cars drive themselves think of
number people that will put out of work
not not dancing in 10 years all the jobs
that exist today and one thing you know
there's gonna be new job that's right
there'll be different jobs we don't know
what they are then the other factor is
outsourcing over my career I've out
sourced jobs to first of all to Ireland
then the Irish got too expensive and
then we went to to Russia Russia right
China these days it's Eastern Europe I
have a good friend in Bulgaria who's
running a company trying to set up the
outsourcing work there and I met a guy
last night who wants to do the same
thing in in Romania okay so if you are a
young developer leaving a tough word
indeed we do yes most people don't even
have an office if you're lucky you've
got a little cubicle right many people
don't even have that you know you have
this big desk and you're sharing it with
12 other people you don't have a desk at
all and you're working at home so in
this world how do you distinguish
yourself from other people I take it for
granted that you're smart and that you
know the technologies that's otherwise
you're not even going to be about right
right you're not even in the game but no
matter how smart you are there's
somebody else on this planet who is at
least as smart as you and who's willing
to do your job for less money then you
are being paid today that's just a fact
of life yeah so what is it that makes a
difference between someone who is a
competent developer and somebody who
actually advances up the ladder the
difference is in what the HRP will call
soft skills okay right so softer skills
are the skills that now not only the
engineering the writing code right
that's right what you do
warning that that's right it's all about
communication basically you have to be
able to talk to people you have to be
able to work with other people you have
to be able to explain your ideas to
people you have to be able to sell them
when that's appropriate and when
somebody else has a better idea than you
but it's different you have to figure
out how to work a compromise right so
all of these skills are really important
and I've been hiring people in the tech
industry for 30 years and like I say I
take it for granted that they have the
technical skills I once hired a young
woman she had a PhD in networking
thought this would be great I brought
her into right device drivers she knew
the theory but she was not able to get
on with the rest of him and it really
didn't work out so these skills that you
need guess how you get them you get them
by working collaborating with other
people right if you are even a high
school student today in the US and you
want to get into college in addition to
getting your s80 and proving that you're
technically smart you have to come up
with a long list of social stuff that
you've done these kids have to go and
say oh I go and I help the homeless
people or I go touching whatever and
I've been a volunteer here and I've done
this and that and the other you have to
do these things so okay so we're
developers where do you do that kind of
stuff well there's two places either you
join an open source project and that way
you're working with other people and
you're collaborating on stuff or you
join the JCP right and you work on our
specifications and in both of those
environments you learn exactly those
skills that I've been talking about
because you're working with people all
over the world many of them speak
different languages from you you have to
learn to communicate verbally in writing
and you have to be able to compromise
and to work together those are the
skills that you learn when you do
something collaboratively and believe me
if you want to have a job five years
from now you better have something like
that on your resume unfortunately you
don't get paid for doing that kind of
stuff that's just life yes that you have
to do this volunteering one way or
another and that's the way that you
distinguish yourself from other people
yes it's nice well first of all your
mission you know both the JCP and open
source projects and I can see around
here just just from where I sit mmm I
see you know I see eggshell for example
right there she was working on an open
source project I see fabiani right there
she's also working open source projects
you know I see Mark Lee ro from Red Hat
he had you know he's actually manage a
large company that's doing open source
project Andy and but he's also the JCP
right right so you know everyone around
here I can I can see our either working
or open source projects or I involved in
JCP somehow both or both yeah right so
actually you can see that what once you
start participating once you start
getting involved you do raise above the
level because that all of those guys
aren't actually here empty and and it's
fun look at how much energy there is in
this room right it's you know some of
the volunteering things you might do you
may find a little bit dull a little bit
boring but you feel you have to do them
but this is actually energizing you get
together with a bunch of interesting
people and you do fun stuff there's
robots over there there's there's IOT
devices over here I mean it's it's fun
yeah it's a it's a very interesting
combination right because you know we
see Linda right there hi Linda that's
that's especially for java ee right so
we have java ee robotics and IOT and
arch you know there's a there's an
artist thing going on right here so it
is really really cool to see all this
energy and all those develop is actually
doing
uh things that they love right because
it was more than just doing their work
indeed yes and let me say one other
thing many developers their actual day
jobs are kind of dull yes I am London
java community one of the biggest
contributors to the JCP along with your
own joke so Java and what they tell me
is there based in London mostly the
people who are in their drug work in the
financial business of one kind or
another and in that business what
they're doing day-to-day is kind of
boring you know you don't get to
innovate because we're talking about
multi-billion dollar enterprises you
know you're probably maintaining
somebody else's code there was written
ten fifteen years ago it's not that
exciting and they said that the one of
the main reasons they formed the user
group was to give the London developers
an opportunity to work on something
other than what they were doing in their
day job because that was a bit boring
yeah all right so so it looks so it
looks like that you know for you to grow
your career you have to go you have to
participate you have to actually eat
with other people but now when you say
like this hmm this sounds really hard
right because because really it a lot of
developers are not very willing to go
and talk with other people and and so so
now you're saying oh you have to talk
English to be to be to be part of this
you have to be able to express your
ideas you have to do you have to be able
to do all of this you are to participate
you could still are you killing it
that's the whole point right you learn
by doing so you start small excuse me
and typically the best way to do that is
not by yourself but through your local
Java user group right so join your user
group there will be other people there
some of them will know more than you
some will perhaps no less than you you
can all help each other that you won't
be alone you'll be working with other
people and then you can choose an area
of Technology that interest you and
together you can help to work on this
and you can start very small you can
start by learning about the technology
and writing a small
blog entry or giving a five minute
quickie talk you can perhaps take some
of the documentation and translate it
into your own language you can write
some small test cases to test out this
technology and you can go all the way
from that logging bugs triaging bugs or
whatever all the way up to as you gain
experience you can actually then help to
contribute in a more significant way to
the specification and maybe even
actually to the implementation so
there's a whole range of stuff you can
do that's very cool so now you just just
mentioned it launched our community end
and you know how they started to help
developers improve their careers do you
have any interesting or fun stories or
actually real people that went through
this process and and are better today
because they're far spent in this
process I mean who who could you think
about you know I i can I can see a few
of them here but well I know you always
quote to Tommy oh who started Kalyan
Santana who started very small said I
want to contribute to openjdk but I
don't really know how and within a
period of what is it about three years
became a Java champion and Jim just got
himself a fancy new job with Tommy tribe
I believe that I yeah so it's it's
really good to see that and I think that
as part of this whole exercise we're
doing here at javaone we have some
comments from other people who
participated talking about how their
careers have improved as a result of
their community involvement yeah you
mentioned at agios an interesting case
because the Tokyo when he first joined
to JCP he he messaged me and said bruno
this thing is dad i said why is that i
joined me at least there's not a single
email going on i said what are you this
GSR was approve it yesterday right so so
you know and then
and so he really didn't know anything
about it but and on the same year that
he start to participate he actually got
the outstanding member of the Year award
for the JCP yeah so actually you know he
went from not knowing anything about it
yeah actually be a outstanding far
superior to JCP the single ear yeah so I
think it's totally doable and indeed yes
get your career going yes indeed yes so
bottom line if you want to advance if
you want to have a job five years from
now you better be out there
collaborating with other people but you
know it's it's work but it's fun you
only got to look around see how
energized people out here so jump in
have fun advance your career okay that's
really good kilpatrick now let me ask
you one question for you you know you
know you said you have gray hair you've
been you've been in the computer
industry for a long time yeah but do you
remember any specific things that you
did or any specific career moves that
you didn't pass something that really
working well for you they say after did
this my career completely change it you
having any really remember of what well
as a tip jar the development what he
could do sometimes I say it's like
surfing I'm not a surfer myself I lived
in Southern California for a long time
but with surfing the idea is you don't
get to control the waves they just come
along that you have to be ready to jump
on them so the very first day I walked
in to my first job the manager said okay
I'll give you a choice he said you can
go over there you go work with those
guys and a lot of people with jackets
and ties and shirts and stuff and they
were sitting with kobold coding pads
they said you could work with them or
you go work with these guys in the other
one the other room is punch of grungy
looking guys with jeans and scraggly
beards itself and the tables were
covered with circuit boards and wires
and oscilloscope sand all sorts of stuff
and I said I wonder which one I go for
I'll go for that one that looks like fun
so I took that and I learned a lot more
in that first couple of years than I
woulda done if I'd been coding in COBOL
and then a couple years later my boss
said to me you want to go to California
I said I don't know I never thought
about it we said we'll pay you a little
extra money and you can go there for a
year and if you don't like it you can
come home I said ok I'll go for it so
it's all about trying to put yourself in
a situation where opportunities will
present themselves and then having the
courage or the stupidity depending on
how you look at it to just go for it
right because again going back to what I
said if you're in London you're working
in the finance industry you know you may
not actually have the most interesting
work to do but if something comes up
then go for it I Oh Trisha G used to
work in in London she's now living and I
think in Seville yeah I don't know
exactly what the circumstances were
there but again it's a matter of she's
someone actually who learned very
quickly she I remember I was at her
first talk at a public conference and it
was only 23 years ago ah and then she
became a Java champion she ended up
moving to civil and now has a new baby
and stuff and sometimes you just gotta
put yourself in a situation where things
come along and then don't be afraid to
jump on it just go for it right that's
that's excellent so so you know if
you're listen to you to us and if you
feel your careers stuck right if you
feel that nothing happened for your
career in the last less three or four
months or are you know even just a few
months if you see nothing happening your
career nothing different happen do I
Patrick is talking about right search
put yourself in a position where things
can happen do not keep doing the same
thing ever right right so you know go to
user group talk about some things go
visit go go to an event that you haven't
gone before try different different
technology you have an experiment before
but you know put yourself in a position
where things or change can happen
because you know the one thing that we
know is if your career stuck and you
don't do anything different you're going
to continue to be stuck that's right yes
so jump in have fun build your career
exactly so takes a lot better okay Bruno
thank you thank you very much
okay thank you all for watching us hi
