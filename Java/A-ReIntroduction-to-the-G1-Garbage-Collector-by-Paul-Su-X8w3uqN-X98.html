this screencast of the g1 garbage
collector there's a lot of information
already available on g1 but since G 1
will become the default collector for
JDK 9 I'd like to take this opportunity
to give a high-level introduction to the
collector due to time constraints this
will be a very basic overview but more
detail than my information is available
a little bit about myself I've been
working with Java and the open JDK
community for the past 18 years
primarily in the micro Edition space
currently I manage the hotspot garbage
collection team here at Oracle today
we'll start with a brief introduction to
the variety of collectors currently
available in hotspot before we're moving
into g1 specifics these are the
collectors currently supported in
hotspot serial is intended to address
use cases where memory footprint is
critical parallels should be the optimal
choice in most situations where
throughput is important CMS is built
with a focus on latency but is being
deprecated beginning in JDK 9 since for
most applications g1 should provide a
better overall experience g1 is intended
to deliver a balance between throughput
and latency while not suffering from
fragmentation as mentioned g1 is now the
default collector for JDK knowing it was
introduced as an experimental flag in
1614 and became a fully supported
collector in 7u 4 as stated above the
goal of g1 is to provide a balance
between throughput and latency the
default pause target for g1 is set at
200 milliseconds by adjusting this value
users can tune g1 to provide either
lower latency or higher throughput with
a higher value providing higher
throughput at the expense of higher
overall latency or a lower value of
providing lower throughput and lower
latency there are three properties that
are needed to allow g1 to collect
objects at finer granularity x' dividing
the heap into smaller regions knowing
which objects are live within these
regions and keeping track of the
pointers between these regions in the
serial and parallel collectors the heap
is divided into only two or three
regions
with g1 the heap is divided into
multiple smaller regions usually around
2000 regions or so it uses these regions
to achieve a finer granularity on how
much garbage to collect at each GC pause
unlike serial and parallel the marking
phase of G 1 is done concurrently this
allows G 1 to find all live objects
without stopping the java application
objects can be marked in multiple
regions at the same time in order to
move objects from one region to another
you need to know the pointers pointing
to those objects G 1 keeps track of the
pointers between regions in order to
avoid leaving a stale pointer on the
heap G 1 can decide to collect a few
regions at a time by doing so it can
limit the number of objects being
processed resulting in lower pauses
relative to other collectors g1 has more
data on the state of objects in the heap
before of collection begins giving it
more control over the length of the
pauses as G 1 begins a collection G 1
needs at least one empty region to move
live objects into a set of regions is
selected based on the heuristics such as
the amount of live data how much of the
heap is free and the posit argot the
live objects from the selected regions
are moved into the empty region freeing
the memory from the original regions the
heap is now more compact there have been
a number of significant improvements in
G 1 since JDK 8
there are numerous changes but 5
significant improvements are string
deduplication class unloading after a
concurrent cycle eager reclamation of
humongous objects adaptive start of a
concurrent cycle and more effective
pauses more detailed information on each
of these is available in the release
notes and tuning guides for their
respective releases here are some links
for more information on gdk9 you can
