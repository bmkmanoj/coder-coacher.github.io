with the otn advocacy program and I
manage the Java champion program and I'm
here with one of our wonderful Java
champions James how you doing very well
thank you are you enjoying devix Belgium
it's awesome and tiring at the same time
first time here ever so it feels like an
endurance race where you kind of have to
keep going until the very last day it's
also though it's awesome so I wanted to
get the various Java champions who are
here together and just kind of
understand a little bit about you know
what makes up a Java champion and so a
couple questions you know what do you do
for your day job I'm technically an
engineer for red hat technically and my
day job is technically meant to be
developing obvious or upstream open
source projects okay so I'm kind of a
full-time hacker on open source
basically but I also do conference talks
down again and think of that as well I
like to get out now and again and we
customers and real users but mostly I'm
in my pants I concur lots of they keep
you hidden away yes I took it out that
must occur yes I'm well hidden then we
could see me and I kind of had code of
my desk and you know being a java
champion it's not just being an expert
or a luminary in your field it's also
about giving back to the community you
know how do you feel like you tend to
give back to the java community I mean I
think open source is really about
community it's it's not just code and it
takes quite to do well in open-source it
takes a little while to learn how to
stop being just a person in your attic
typing their keyboard and actually
working with lots of other people it's
for me really good software development
is really about people it's not the
computer yes the code has to be compila
balai a computer but really the code is
to help other people yourself in several
years time and anyone else who comes to
the project is about people in
communication an open source as well is
is about marketing is marketing
communication teaching documenting
presenting which is something I never
really realized I started off just
programming and just thinking of the
code in the computer and I didn't really
realize the people side as I've got
older and grey
runs slightly larger I've realized that
the human side is way more important
than the computer side and and good like
we've all seen lousy killed in our lives
where the poster Brody it has no care or
consideration for anybody ever looking
at it ever right for me good software
and good open source is all about making
it easy to understand making each of
people to contribute which is really the
social side of software so I in as much
as being a German champion I am I see my
role as really helping bring communities
together around certain projects or
products or api's or libraries or
whatever and it certainly it takes a
little while to find you feat because
it's kind of alien to a lot of
programmers programmers tend to be
slightly introverted don't it to get out
too much yeah I think it takes a little
while for programmers who were maybe
introverts to really do well at the
human side we all as open source
developers we often get the odd brush
comment when something doesn't work and
you kind of learn fairly quickly if you
want to get on in open source be nice be
respectful like don't offend and insult
people like all open source people are
doing this even a spare time or it's
their passion or sometimes it's that
their job but they've got lots of other
things to do so don't be abusive or the
fantasy video issue the more offensive
you you are the less likely your issues
going to be fixed right and so you kind
of learn the social side of like github
and apache and whatnot it's about the
people not so much the curb well thank
you for all that you do for the
community and you know very do you have
any upcoming talks or have you already
done yours I've got one more talk
tomorrow which people should definitely
check out okay if they watching this in
time to be able to do anything about it
it's 550 tomorrow on fabricate and Cuban
eighties and docker and confuse delivery
and lots of amazing awesome things it
will be awesome well hopefully you have
a full house I'm sure you will fingers
crossed cheers Cheers thank you have a
great day pleasure thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
