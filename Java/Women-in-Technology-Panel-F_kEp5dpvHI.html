again and this time I'm surrounded by
wonderful women that we will introduce
very quickly but this is the IOT so no
this is the women in tech panel and and
we have a great audience like supporting
us so I'm your employee so from Oracle
technology Network and I'm going to have
every each of those panel members
introduce themselves so y era hello my
name is you're a singer I'm from Brazil
from Seoul java i am thought found a
founder of a company training company
love to be here at javaone since 2002 so
thanks to have a community I want to see
more and more women here so my name is
forbidden our doll I'm the chief data
scientist that they a target in Brazil
and I'm also java champion and a Java
developer hi hi my name is accelrys ah I
help run the hacker garden and also work
a canoe a small company in Switzerland
well that's so small I'm a Java
developer and also in in my spare time
an open-source advocate
hi I'm Tricia gee I work for jetbrains
as a developer and Technical Evangelist
and I'm also a leader of the Seville
java user group and i'm in the london
java community because I've kind of got
one foot in Spain and one foot in London
and and did I say java champion java
champion um yeah that's me and please
introduce who you have also with you
this is Evie this is my daughter she's
been 27 conferences already she's nearly
10 months old and if she's not a Java
developer I'll be very disappointed so
the cool I get this question a lot as is
like so you all like speakers community
members you've done a lot with I mean
with the community so how did you get to
where where you are now and so how did
how did that happen so y era yes for me
since the university I really wanted to
work with Java so I was looking for a
job where I can I could work with java
and i found that as soon as i started to
work at for accenture it was in front of
San so just cross the street and we have
turned there and doing a training I got
to know we need to singer Bruno Souza
and after that I start at so Java they
were telling me you need to participate
at sol java and i was near new to the
city it was a new job as a user group
right you speak with you grew up in
Brazil exactly and then I didn't have
lots of friends and they tell me you
should come and engage with community
and that's what I did and when I start
participating at so Java I got to know
this wonderful woman she was already
famous at that time she has you know
winning book Choice Award and lots of
things in the neck
years so it was very inspiring for me to
see other women in technology and I i
was looking at and looking men and women
around and they were open doors for me
so being part of the Alpha jerk is like
people are open doors for you so the
first time I came to java one I got to
know so many people and the next year I
said I want to go back again and since
that I just needs to java once one when
my first baby get born and the second
for other reasons but community helped
me to achieve lots and lots of stuff so
be part of it okay this de story how I
started in technology is kind of funny
because when I was the girls 12 years
old I ask it for I wanted to have a
video game for my birthday and my father
said that video games are for boys but
if I wanted he would give me a computer
so he had no idea and so I got the
computer and I said okay i can make
games in the computer and transformed is
in a video game anyway and that's how i
started because i want to have a video
game so i had to program games and then
i thought that was so cool i started to
work in his company actually and i
created all his systems for the company
i still use it today it was 20 years ago
i'm a co-developer and sonia so and then
later in the university i learned java
and I thought this is what why I want to
do I want to be a developer and I've
been a developer since then and uh it
work it very well takes that
well I also started very very young I
used to take one computer or anything
and and throw it apart and my father was
always behind me like don't or well he
was a electric engineer so he knew how
to put everything back everything I
turned apart he was after me solving the
issues i created uh and then i went to
college and i had the opportunity to go
back into electronic communications
engineer but I say you know what this
computers are interesting I really want
to know how to control them so I wanted
to software engineer and the rest is
history I firing it well no well that's
how I got my degree but how I came to be
Jabbar one well that was really nice I
really wanted to participate as really
big conference and I said to myself okay
I can enter as a student or I can get in
as a speaker so for me was a goal to be
a speaker to be able to come here so at
that point in time I said I have to be
really good at something or I have to
have a topic to be able to explain up
there in the podium and that's what I
did I work i did some projects I consult
with teachers I run around and I said
okay I'm ready I can submit a talk and I
was fortunate enough to be selected and
the rest is history so it's really like
about the first step right I mean it's
uh yeah go ahead I guess in a similar
way I had parents who were supportive of
me doing computer science
okay thank you that's very nice I wants
to be a speaker or even severe speaker
and so they they were teachers and they
used to borrow computers from school and
they would give me programming books and
say computers at the way forward you
should do this and I did that when I was
about nine or ten when I went to
university I wanted to be an
astrophysicist so I took physics and
maths and and i found that physics and
maths was kind of hard but computing was
quite easy and interesting so i went
into that at university instead and they
they told me java so that's why I ended
up doing java and a few years ago my
company won the Dukes Choice Award so I
got a free ticket to come to Java one my
boss at the time was speaking so he said
why don't you co present with me at
javaone and I'm like but I have never
spoken at a conference ever in my life I
did a short lightning talking a user
group but I've not spoken a conference
like this and so I did it Jeb being a
parent is doing everything on hard mode
Thank You Evie and so I co-presented
with my boss and it went really well and
then because I presented at javaone I
got into presenting at a bunch of other
conferences and the rest as they say is
kind of history really and yeah and I
think I'll come on to my later points a
bit later on I think about that so
co-presenting right that was like the
way you started wonderful so now we know
I mean we just have to look at the
audience and there are more women than
usual but it's still not the majority I
mean maybe we have a half of it and so
so my next question is so what can we do
to attract more women in technology you
know I think there are several little
things we can do so I just want to give
a background that you actually are
running a conference in in Brazil so so
what do you do in Brazil to attract
women to speak yes I think first we need
to
understand our audience and understand
what women want and what women need to
be there and why they are not there so
the same way her boss just said let's go
present together or the same support i
have from the user group like will help
to have you your talk we'll do a
collective effort so i think the key
thing is community and between us
between women as well so how can we
support people that are near us before
thinking you know about how we are going
to change the entire javaone but how can
we support our friends our nieces our
you know young people that are around us
and mainly for me when we think about
jobs most people are seeking for
opportunities we want to do things we
like we want to get more money we want
to get visibility we want to master in
something so i believe that showing
build big giant opportunity that I t
provides in terms of money in terms of
having a baby and working on home office
you know on being able to live in any
place so my basic concern nowadays it's
to be able to discuss with women the
size of opportunity that is in the table
and because we are few the market is
very good for us because if we go to a
conference it's very likely people who
remember us so they're not had much
speakers and they would say oh ok Yara
right because it's few speakers so it's
likely they will remember us and that's
a big advantage I'm not telling that we
will be accepted because we are women or
anything but will be remembered will be
recognized it and people kind of like to
see what we are doing so I think inspire
another woman but more important helping
and pushing them reviewing their work
and
making sure that that how we use to feel
insecure about things lots of women feel
like that we feel that we are not good
enough that you know our biggest enemy
must be ourselves so if we try to help
to kill this enemy in our friends it's
already a big step yeah i think it's--
is a great feud for for both women and
men so i can't i can't really understand
why women wouldn't consider going to IT
i I personally never had a problem with
coworkers or classmates actually when
they when someone says you're not going
to be able to do this this is a very
motivational for me that's the way I
want to make them wrong so if my gym
teacher find and finds out that he just
had to say you won't be able to do this
I would be in a better shape but anyway
so I think I I personally never had a
problem but I see that many young women
go to universities and their classmates
sometimes say what you're doing here why
don't you go why don't you became a
tester that's easier than V and
available things like that so I think
one thing we can do is set an example
and be visible so more young women see
that you we are developers we are we
know how to code we do good things and
then I think more people are going to
consider this this career and as the
other said it is a great career for for
women wish I can work from home and have
her baby in the conference and that's
okay if she was a physician or I don't
know a teacher it would be harder so I
think I think being visible and show
that there are more women technology is
a very good first step and right now in
the market all the become
these are looking for more women just
because having more diversity leads to
better software so it's actually a great
moment in the market to be a women in
technology right now so I think that's
it well for me as I told you I'm very
into open source I'd like to share
knowledge I nah I like to help people
make connections that why i love hacker
gardened idea it's for me it makes sense
for me so but not everybody wants to be
on the spotlight I used to be like that
I was a good developer and that was it
for me I didn't need anything else but
then I start talking with conference
organizers and they will say you know
what we need more role models we need
more girls to find an image and say you
know we can do it in that environment
and I was happy in this environment
technology for me it's so amazing you
get to do some interesting things for me
having up the ability to create code
that actually do something that I can
see the results there and so problems
it's amazing I mean for me is like
writing a book even though I'm not so
good at writing a book but I good at
writing code that does something as
amazing as that but anyway so they said
we need more women in the spotlight and
I said okay that's not me but I get the
point and that's why I'm today here
trying to share my experience in the
community trying to say to all the women
out there that this is fantastic and you
should give yourself the opportunity to
explore this world if you are interested
in technology you're interesting in
solving problems if
you're interested in changing the world
because technology and in our case
computers and programming it's
everywhere you cannot avoid it so yes
there are different levels of
communication different levels of
contributing back so emails blogs talk
to the community if you talk to women
even better but if you talk to other
developers that's good enough so I guess
I wanted to pick up on the theme of role
models again and I think we get we get
told a lot as women we need to stand up
and be seen because there aren't enough
women role models and we do have a
tendency to just want to just do our
jobs right we're supposed to be it
should be enough for us to sit and do a
good job of what we do why are you
always fidgeting when I'm talking why
can't you sit still while I'm talking
and and so it's not really we don't
necessarily want to have to be role
models just because we're women in
technology why should we he's she's
heard this before and why should we sign
up and be role models just because we're
women and the answer is well we should
because we have to stand up for
ourselves as individuals not as women I
need to represent me and my interests
not all women in technology because if I
see another woman standing up and
talking about women in technology and
she doesn't say what I want to say then
she's not talking my language she's not
representing me only I can represent me
hello you want to represent you so it's
important to stand up and be counted for
what you want and for myself in terms of
role models I had a lot of male role
models I had my boss who dragged me on
stage at Martain who put me in in front
of the ljc and got me involved in the
london java community i had a bunch of
people who were all men who pushed me
forward and said you can do this and
it's really important that you have
people who say you can do this
apparently I can't
but if you are a woman in technology it
is important to stand up and be seen so
that other people can look at you and be
like well if she can do it than I can do
it and it doesn't necessarily just
appeal to other women there are guys out
there who look at us as role models as
well and think okay the industry is not
just dominated by alpha male types or
programmers or whatever we provide a
different a different type of role model
so it's important for us all to stand up
for ourselves and be role models for for
people like us whoever that is so I like
I like to have like next steps so I have
one for everybody which is who knows who
did the J Duchess organization
organization is ah so I I see a lot of
women who are not do don't know about it
so so it's jay Duchess that org and you
should belong to the so come and speak
to me afterwards but and also mention it
as part of them as part of the video as
well but but I would like everybody to
say like okay so what our kind of the
next step that people should should take
okay so sometimes first first I just
want to tell something about what Tricia
said which I totally agree with that
sometimes I see very competent woman
that they stop talking about technology
and starts talking about women in
technology and that's like a very woman
style thing where you are caring about
others and not about yourself you are
taking care about kids about family
about everything but not you so I really
love to see woman that talks about
technology and keep that and understand
that your main challenge it's to be good
on technology on some on a certain
subject and focus on that but then just
to go next it's not easy sometimes to go
to in front of the stage and talk to
everybody and how much I know
and there's always somebody some person
that knows less than you so if i would
suggest something i would say start
sharing and it doesn't need to be on the
stage it can be on social it's very easy
you know to see that night hacking and
share good content with your friends
start positioning yourself on social
media as a tech content provider even if
the content has not been written for you
you are providing good content for
others just by retweeting just by
sharing then the next step would be
write something for yourself so how many
people want to know how to install Java
or what JVM is or how to connect to a
database or simple things that you might
know so just start sharing some content
writing a blog post or recording a video
but sharing something and you know so I
think we should transform ourselves
instead of consumer in providers of
Technology in some way that would be my
first advice well i'm not sure but i
think if you really like programming
just go for it just do your best and
you're probably going to have a good
career because if you like what you do
it's the first step and I I think that's
not really any difference being a woman
or a man in this technology it is this
market it's it what matters is how good
is your code how good you are as a
professional and actually sometimes when
this is dis bringing more women in
conference started up a few years ago
not long and I was already I speaker by
then but when more and more invitations
to start to come I was always thinking
are they inviting me to be a speaker
because I am a woman or because I'm a
good a good speaker so you always it's
it's I hope that someday
women are going to be invited to be
speakers because they are good at what
they do and not because they are women
and I think that's what we all want
right we don't want to be invited to
anything because of our women but
because we are good so next step is just
start coding do your best and we are
going to have a job for sure so you are
not invited because your women you were
invited because you're a good programmer
to plus you are a woman yes for me that
was also important i usually don't like
to talk about gender related topics
because it can be seen in the two ways
either you are here because you're a
woman or and then I I wanted to make
that clear if you are adding that I'm
here because I have a woman then I don't
want to be there because I want to be
because of me regardless of if I'm a
woman or I'm not but oh yes next step
for me is if you like it do it I mean if
you like to program if you like to solve
problems if you like technology keep
doing it and if you encounter people
telling you this is stuff because you're
a woman you won't succeed go ahead there
are a lot of women that are very
successful it's a matter of decision but
it is a matter of decision that doesn't
have anything to do with gender so keep
doing it we have excellent role models
I'm totally fun of trish and fabian and
also Jarrah so when I encounter them i
said to myself they are super good at
what they do and they are doing a great
job of being women are being motors and
being community leaders and they are
doing what they like
so I have two next steps one is we
haven't really touched on any negative
sides of gender &amp;amp; technology which is
kind of intentional if you are in a
toxic environment if you're of any
gender any race whatever and you're in a
toxic environment get the hell out there
are other jobs I know that not every
where is the Silicon Valley not
everywhere is in London but there are
other jobs if you're in a toxic
environment it's not necessarily because
you work in IT it's because you work in
a toxic environment get out go somewhere
else there are other jobs so that's my
first next step isn't and it's not
necessarily because you're a woman it's
often because the people you're working
with are idiots so just get out the
second thing is and particularly aimed
at women but not just women if you're
thinking of going to conferences or
blogging or speaking or basically
becoming more public public in any way
shape or form just do it you are ready
you think you're not you think you're
not good enough you need to learn more
you need to read more you're fine you're
good enough do it now someone will learn
something of you and I've seen this time
and again i'm sure you've been to talks
even at this java one where you thought
i could have done that or i could have
done it better you're ready do it now ok
great so another next step I we've been
running a program which is like if those
little stickers if you see them you
should put them on your laptop or
whatever and take a selfie and because
we are donating money to girls who code
so we haven't really touched on that and
I know some of you are actually also
involved with kids programs so and the
other advice that I would have for you
as a next step is like you have leaders
here so and they are available so if you
want to talk to them or talk to me I
mean I I do also contract a lot of
developers to create content for the
java web site for oracle so talk to me
if you want to get a head start article
whatever blogs
promotion twitter i'm at java so you
know where to find me so having this
said thank you thank you so much for
doing this and for for coming and
sharing your insights oh really
appreciate thank you everybody big
audience so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
