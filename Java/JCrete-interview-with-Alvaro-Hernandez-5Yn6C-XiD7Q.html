maybe time for a retreat from my side
yes he do of course that I have a
connection directly to Twitter database
yes now you now you're coming through
live and clear even louder than me
alright so i'm here with over Jake reef
and we were just hecka like I'm /
talking about relational databases which
is one of the hot topics here at Jake
Reed I think Kurt Kurt our official
heckler over there Kirk Pepperdine wants
to say something what do you wanna say
you know you're not you're not on Kirk
you're not on that's probably a good
thing so we're back we don't need your
your kind around here your foreign key
relationships right our object models
are completely zena phobic right we just
don't like Kenny says the performance
curve all right exactly yeah but there's
going to be by the way a session Kirk
you should attend I'm gonna present
about running no sequel on sequel hmm it
turns out to be way better than running
no sequel on no sequel so you take
advantage of like existing investments
in sequel databases absolutely don't
reinvent the wheel yeah so every no
sequel database is trying to reinvent
how to do concurrency durability and
there of course failing to do it
properly well whereas relational
database got that well done decades ago
so don't reinvent will yeah it's
exchange they certainly had a lot of
investment the past twenty twenty thirty
year at 20 30 years yeah foster 30 so
Kirk Kirk once you're poking a bear
right now right I realize that might
wake up San thanks cook yeah yeah so
speaking of poking a bear so have any of
the I hear lots of big data people here
and there they're attacking you and the
beaches and it's a lunch table have you
have you suffered any any injuries well
I'm a tough guy I'm not a very tall but
I can defend myself and so far being
able to protect my my my area protect
your philosophy yeah absolutely very
nice yeah the conversations have
actually ended in something conclusive
so you must be succeeding at one some
level thank you nice so what what
sessions did you attend just know there
was just a set of sessions which came
out oh I'm coming from my concurrency
session okay I called lambdas and
features completa bezane dit could take
aways from that session oh sure
absolutely that everything is
synchronous is going to be dominating
short term right and there better
options right now with Java 8 then they
went for so we're in better shape better
yeah the best we could be but yeah you
know most people say that scowl on some
of the some other languages for JVM are
we going step ahead but the distance is
reduced so far ok any any wish list for
java 9 well my personal wish list is
modularity ok absolutely number one
priority marks in your corner yeah it's
absolutely number one because I still
see a lot of DevOps and sis admins they
don't really want to use Java because
they still say it's too heavy heavy
weight yet large especially in
virtualized environments I think that
matters more because you're trying to
spin up lots of instances there are some
other approaches that I think that quite
interesting like osv which basically is
able to reduce the number of layers of
abstraction from the bare metal to the
hypervisor d hypervisor to the operating
system the operating system to the JVM
and they are trying to reduce that
amount of abstraction it is not always
needed that in a pile ok whether I
losing some isolation in the process
yeah well there's just
so single-process operating system yeah
so that's threading but not processes
and so there's no context switching okay
it's everything running kernel space
let's it's quite efficient and it's very
targeted for for java programs the fact
they tried a knave your Noah's jump okay
to suggested that session here no to
give it a try to download it and run it
and maybe some of that I remember that
you proposed trying osv yeah yeah Oh
Izzy yeah Oh is he cool that'd be a good
session and what we're also you're
looking forward to for the rest of the
unconference well us being a of your own
session yeah well of course I said yes
to some sessions about the topics i'm
interested in to ya about being they
called a database guy or their
relational guy or whatever yeah I'm also
coming here to to get in I feel your
pain man i'm hoping the client guy for
many many years taking the arrows all
right all right you gotta stick with
your guns stick with your pencils
absolutely absolutely and no problem
body things that people say that for
example many relational databases are
slow thing is that when you take a no
sequel database and make it durable its
way slower than relational databases so
it dont matters about which use case are
you talking about to in what i see is
that most gnosis the databases or what
do you mean by that like having like
having a strong warranty that no no just
having a strong warranty that your
information is going to be there in the
event of a crash or whatever okay as a
consistency on disk yes consistency in
disk which is basically durability and
most if not all of the no sequel
databases are not durable all right so i
think on a future day of the conference
we should have the no sequel fat data
bake-off you can get a couple guys here
and just kind of hash it out and uh yeah
absolutely absolutely hopefully we will
survive
it you want to kick all here Kirk yeah
i'm going to heckle because i have to
say that there is a wide range of shall
we say quality differences between the
no sequel implementations but to say
that all no sequel implementations are
slower than relational databases or when
you add durability i think is ignoring
some of the nice advancements that have
been made in terms of making making
these guys durable using techniques that
relational databases unfortunately can't
take advantage of and it and i think the
other the other interesting thing with
you know with the relational database
object mismatch that the mill sequel
databases look after is just you know
it's it's just the amount of code that
you have to use to maintain you know
object relational mapping sand and and
and you know how to reconstruct things
and stuff like that so you know we can
have it I think okay so we have another
my dams that ain't about Turks in the
debate I think we know which side piece
no that's absolutely on this side of the
debate and we're going to be standing
now that's absolutely really are
interesting because it's it's absolutely
true that no sequel databases have their
specific use cases the things that most
people use them for broader use cases
than their original design for and it's
of course true that there's some
performance difference between the
different no sequel implementation
that's hard to generalize what I'm
trying to say is that most of these
developments are quite new and they are
trying to do thank for its abuse case
and after that they're trying to expand
that use case to more general use cases
and they'll find out that when they want
to go be the general and implement some
features that are already available in
the relational databases they're
struggling to make them as performing as
they are in the relational database
because there's there's been years and
years of development in the dells
relational databases yeah well I I think
if you're talking about a use case which
specifically stresses what relational
database
are good for them that might be the case
I think Kirk's point is that most of the
use cases he sees for fat data are
things where you can get small
advantages by taking advantage of things
which you don't need that you know
foreign keys or things you don't need
that relational databases force upon you
yeah well for example the one of the
sessions I'm proposing it's about
running no sequel on sequel yeah and it
turns out to be a solution we are
working on our company that's going to
be open source product later on this
year well and it's basically a way of
mapping document-oriented loads to
relational data stores okay but you
found a way where you're not kind of
performance strapped down by the
relationships exactly on the on the
contrary we are getting huge performance
improvements over the same data on no
sequel database I know a performance
tuning expert who might be interested
too I don't remember I'm sure he will
join the session on opposite I really
helped so things that one of the d but I
can see the policy of no sequel
proposals is that they talked that
they're schema-less however so we're
going to save this for the discussion of
sequel vs s equal all right live later
on all right I think it'll be a great
debate and we can get to the details of
schema and your no sequel and see I'll
give you a win on the ski myth one
because you know schema migration has
always been a killing a killer feature
yeah yeah that that is so yeah there you
win you know okay what s 1 points will
win points by could I do how are you up
to 15 20 20 points no Kirk what's that
tell me what's your score board he is
100 it's how you doing think I have any
yet because I'm just letting him yeah we
you know you it's basically you let him
retreat so you can encapsulate and then
you kill
right vice all right so thanks very much
LOL please enjoy the rest of the
sessions today sure thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
