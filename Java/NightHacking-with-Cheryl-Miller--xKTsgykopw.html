night hacking and i'm here with cheryl
miller who is going to show us some cool
maker robust today chera mälaren family
i should i say and gremlins yeah yeah so
so so maybe you should introduce
yourself fool that what what sort of
stuff have you been working on uh uh
what are your interests you know Steve
um I don't profess to be a programmer
and I'm not but I am in the world of
trying to get there to be more female
programmers that's what I do and I come
from a very a great line of female
software developers well excellent um so
it's I actually don't know why I never
went any further than superficial
knowledge by ramming well apparently you
inherited the the joy of toys oh yes who
didn't inherit that and probably your
kids full as well because they've been
having lots of fun playing with the
video hardware yeah picture coming us
and there's actually design what is a
process of being produced over there in
the corner okay so i should probably
describe how this this works in a little
more detail ok so we the way this works
is this an online program you can view
tonight hacking com folks on the stream
can interact via the social stream so
either on the night hacking website or
Ustream and when they type stuff in
it'll show up here on my computer and
then we can see what what folks are
saying about and we can interact we'll
talk back
the folks in the stream and then all the
recordings are off live later on the
Java YouTube channel and also on ustream
no well the live recordings are viewable
yes yes yes okay so are the most
interesting thing happening here is
we're playing with the MakerBot so let
me point the camera at this and maybe
you can tell us a little bit about what
this very interesting thing is doing
well the one of three very interesting
things over here look there's two oh
yeah there's two other animated things
their bodies are all to organic things
and one digital thing yeah well the
organic things seem to like the digital
thing quite a bit that was kind of the
point so we've played around a little
bit low E actually I took this machine
out of the box today some friends of
ours at hackable devices don't work are
letting us borrow it for the purpose of
your life livestream and night hacking
nice starch I'm sure don't touch don't
go touching no touchy um and I recently
had the wonderful opportunity of playing
and observing other kids playing with a
3d printer a replicator and this is the
MakerBot replicator 2
it just came out last month it might
actually be one of the few that is on
the continent at this point because
rather than me wow so it's the kind of
so it's a mere of sorts yeah so we're
probably seeing a first I don't think
anyone has created a video watch out a
MakerBot in action yet I wanna know
MakerBot themselves have and there was a
big three deep don't care about though I
don't think they have the kids yeah
that's not know we have that unique in
touching no touchy no touchy and that's
actually you know that's my favorite
part about this yeah yeah kids so you
know i was at trish's session in san
francisco we were chatting about kind of
getting one women in engineering and the
conclusion we reach doesn't look like a
collective minds was that age is when
you really need to get kids excited
about technology and later on it pays
off yeah you know I as early as you
there a better basically but I don't
even think they realize what they're
getting excited I mean you can you can
also take them outside and go for a walk
in the woods and get excited about that
too you know so we never made it to kind
of build the future generation of
programmers like all of the folks and
Technology who really are interested
started at a fairly young age yes flying
with technology well one thing I i read
recently in fact was it's a very kind of
an attic anecdotal thing is that Google
has done kind of an internal study of
their own software developers yeah yeah
and they found that as a rule the people
who you were
grew up to be software developers were
exposed to it outside of school uh-huh
and in these very hands on creative
environments so that's kind of been my
angle of tackling and getting kids and
especially girls yeah excited about
technology is really working from what's
fun and creative and something very
tangible or you can see the output and
getting them excited and kind of getting
I'm gonna reposition the camera so we
are somewhat in shock you can see the
full chaos in the Miller and the Miller
living room here Wow bond egg these are
all on dates yeah so practical slicing
away and kids they don't know you know
they're not thinking in terms of what is
behind it yet but when you can make it
really accessible like this yes i
remember i was at oscon where you were
doing though the project the project
with the girls to do a mm-hmm we should
get up she gets a final look that was
fast creation that literally started
when we were like two or three minutes
sat down you have to let it cool my dear
i am using some very cool very cool
things about this filament is that its
water water degradable mm-hmm and its
glow in the dark oh nice we'll have to
see don't touch please don't touch
there's a thing about you know
introducing very little ones
this kind of high-end stuff yeah so is
this is this accessible where kids can
create designs and and play with it with
all adult supervision so for just the
tools to be able to as the tools you'll
do it you saw I I mean I've never this
was done in 13 minutes from the record
I've never even lived at the software
used to but to do this and I literally
did that in like the five minutes that
you were setting up your hardware here
let me let me um yeah let me switch to
your desktop rocket science this is the
actual software yes look that Cheryl
listen loser these are this is actually
the drivers as well as if you go into a
little uh let's see what was the program
that i was using wasn't 3d to my teacher
kid look we didn't have enough time to
figure out how we would get the relief
of the d on the heart oh I'm serious I'm
gonna take us two hours to print okay
let's just push them out can I know I'll
send me one yeah why don't you do that
why don't we let you here we will let
her do this in the background just to
show how easy it is yeah I saw Beth the
day was too low in that picture yeah it
didn't really have any relief I was
hoping it might do a kind of you know
really yeah type of effect but that's so
pretty cool let's see how if I can
action
take this off of here no nice so there's
kind of a base that is looks kind of
stringy yeah well it's filament by
design so swing by definition you have
like a little base on it uh-huh this is
a duel there you go extruder it actually
has two heads to print so you can print
in two colors or you know I guess start
to get kind of fancy well look for five
minutes of study yeah here we are really
nice I think it would be really clear
you can see like what like a little you
could do like a brooch you could do I
mean it's perfect for the holidays isn't
it yeah so you could play little models
with us yeah yeah I mean you know 3d
printing is now used for prosthetics
it's used for industrial machining but
you know we could just make some really
cool things that she designs herself
yeah so we've done Christmas presents
make a little make a little Duke logo as
well i do right there's some other
extrusion going on oh here's it this is
really nice were doing mushrooms from
the fireplace yeah so I'm gonna 2 i'm
gonna show you guys the usual chaos in
our house and the other the other half
of the studio here so we have we have a
lot of expensive equipment stuck on the
table here right next to smell is being
run open 50 guys don't hackable devices
don't see this or at least that we're
insured but you know the point is
basically it's really crazy
isn't it yeah yeah I was those you were
amazingly fast and she is creating a
pretty cool design there you know how to
do the make it go away thing sis because
it yeah no that's that's a really nice
little I'm inside that cab program for
but that's really easy to create little
die keep suffered but the last event
that we ran in mid-october yes was
really kind of a culmination of a whole
a dream of mine that I've been working
on for three years that was to be able
to run a 3d design workshop where the
girls learned some basic elements of
design and where they could make some
cool things and they could paint them
then with some really great volunteers
that happened that came together kind of
in a serendipitous way but also with a
bit of you know facilitating from my
side uh-huh we actually got to do that
and these are there rather temperamental
I guess you had that experience right so
I almost shyly this Harbor up here is
temperate so look no no no I but I'm
pretty impressed that that Bell anything
of that that was here timing we put the
stream live and it was printing making
great background noise and then it
finished up right as we were not quite
plug and play but it was pretty it was
pretty close so I'm one of the one of
the guys on the stream Mike Mike telling
I think yeah he mentioned that he's
actually played with one of these in the
tech shop in Menlo Park replicator
acuity replicator mm-hmm and was it that
easy yeah so how easy was it for you
Mike I'll also mention it because
there's a slight delay on the stream
okay how easy was it for you to use
throw yeah running I literally took it
out of the box today at about seven
seven pm
and it was packed like Tetris it was
amazing and there's even a warning read
this before you unpack did you read it
yes okay because it's not mine it's all
alone so and I thought so nice of them
are giving me a brand new out of the box
replicator 2 and then I realized that I
had to do all the assembly mm-hmm so but
i assembled it installed the drivers and
that was pretty came up with a little
tiny it works design and it works
straight out of the box that's really
pretty amazing but apparently there it
has been improved magnitudes over the
last model I don't know if there's
anyone who has the original Gator the
replicator it's actually let me what
does my take this camera off as Mike
responded yet
no not yet it looks like my condo hello
is that west coast to quarterly chaos I
must be west coast because it's not yeah
apartment mommy let me get a good shot
of this I'm really impressed with the
beauty and simplicity of their blog have
to say yeah so how does this how does
this device work well you have and you
know this is just from putting it
together today but basically you have
the extruders that are here two of them
which is Anna marshmallow get that out
of here please thank you these are the
guides for the filament when it comes in
from the from behind the printer here
because there are two it's a dual
extruder yeah oh yeah yeah okay what are
the two colors this you're just
different oh yeah well this one is
magenta because I wanted to yeah play
the defendant card and that's the glow
in the dark one the woman is you know
yeah one of what could you know I
haven't tinkered enough with it to see
how you get the how you can make it
print multicolor multicolor dual color
but I think that's the next challenge
and I haven't even seen we haven't
really established this actually glows
in the dark either yeah well that's
right yeah we can turn off all the
lights that that'll be great for the
little high street this guy was pretty
good in my life but I don't know if it's
that good either it's either my eyes are
it is starting to glow
no not at all no not at all no let's
pray right oops so something I was asked
is is this making 3d printing you know
when the kids asked me what this was I
said well basically you can make a toy
yeah right this is the well there are
two kinds of filament like I told you
the water-based water-soluble one which
is this that we use here and the other
one which is the same material as
leggings are made out of yeah what's out
for the cable what's up adorable
daughter is actually so what are you so
how do you like how do you like the
young but you're going to make your own
design right we auction yeah how many
takers you should ask them this was
designed by by Darius and Artemis would
like a lovely piece of art her first
ever right yeah you're quickly you're
quite the artist I saw your signs around
the house that was helpful they're my
bride aren't they yes yes creative
because they're all pictures so it's
hard to think of the pictures and I got
the first time that I'm gonna be
yeah so you know you see me I was really
impressed when she will stuff where you
could actually see like the knot and
then the two arms of the scarf doing
that kind of a 3d oh yeah just like
dimension yeah on the coat closet yes
she did that with him like five and I
thought yeah see she has a 3d mind
she'll create some cool models just have
to let her try so I do is a request will
take your request for the holiday so now
I time yes it's me it was the weekend
it's Friday night yeah and and so we can
play I really fun and that comes from
the heart yeah hmm we didn't we didn't
prep her to say those things out oh god
no heart that's good she's just making
good puns the first of all get to you
you are
I am reality so I would do it with you
all right let her go daddy and this is
actually careful while you're here watch
it I have 30 oopsie three sons and one
daughter nice and slow because if you
knock this out our video stream does
yeah so we're gonna try one more one
more Artemis create one more creation
mm-hmm all right i'm gonna switch i'm
gonna switch to Cheryl's desktop again
so you guys can see the the wonderful
cab yeah this is I mean I literally have
not even tried to figure out how to use
it but it's relatively intuitive if
anyone wants to coach me on how to and
you got our Barbarella oh hello yes
how's the hacking yeah we're doing
family hacking this is family hacking
night I think this is appropriate for a
friday night yeah it is because we've
been doing we've been at like about of
worsh workplaces the rest this weekend
this is a lot more fun
checking back for she had a nice
homespun meal are you gonna yeah I've
been being in this kind of environment
makes it worse no oh it's that's fine
but it's not fair for my wife all right
I'm look I can't even are you how are
you watching yeah we're seeing tell us
how to make the move one object onto the
other object okay she gave you a little
smiley she does this all the time she's
a designer nice actually she designed
this wonderful let's see if I can find
it my wonderful logo for this awesome
initiative that I want to evolve into
three two one oh nice I was actually
trying to look at a way to make that
beautiful logo in 3d but that might be a
project for the weekends well you could
you can start the simple extrusion
mm-hmm no probably be very interesting
and even do something with two colors
fancy huh it's simple enough beautiful
enough yep absa heck he's watching she's
watching it I skin appreciating her own
work as you should yeah yeah it's not
it's not the hottest night of the week
is it you know friday night i think
people are out drinking good belgian
beer by now maybe going to listen to
some music going dancing but some people
have their priorities from there
watching you play with toys and hang out
with your family so well thank you folks
we're going to take Steve all later just
another you ready yeah yeah so I need a
cup of coffee before then yeah maybe a
couple maybe a couple all right shall we
try to yeah let's mr. let's do a lot
more pressing and then wrap up the all
right wrap up the strand my office your
sprint yours all right no one out there
can tell me how to make a hot pepper
sure yeah this is the thing about simple
interfaces is also you know it's
literally what you see is what you get
why don't we make a nice asus you can
put that on a chain hmm not good not too
big 29 gyres 20 my twenty nine meters
might be kind of be so thanks for being
my cameraman yeah woman's picked up the
step up there
but it roll the credits it looks like it
might be below the plane I associate
extreme yeah all right I know this is
like sheer frustration fruit you have to
move the move the plane all right Steve
well I what I think the fastest thing is
the latest in creationism all right so
sorry about that here we go let's just
check out the membranes bank ohmmeter
sounds pretty smile what do you like to
move to San meters take to buy team yeah
all right yeah I know you wanna make
them taller is that high okay move it I
guess I d how do you go from here to
printing how does the you save it as a
oh it's just I just rewrote my last real
/ room I'll s I got where you say
there's a CAD file download for free me
I saves it as an STL file which you know
first clue about I'm sure it's over sure
how it is out there does it is already
and you push that it even like is
intelligent smarter than me the bottom
of the model it doesn't appear to touch
the build surface shall I do that for
you yes yeah that's pretty good it's
like so probably what it works before
even extrude to blow the plane because
it would have adjusted it would have
told me that yeah that's pretty smart I
mean I have to say I can't wait to check
it out something's happening that's all
right we got action good get your nose
away I me on the pink ah you want a pink
ah alright you're next you're so next
now it's got a boy it's got a he it's
just the warming up part yep don't touch
it I think you guys need to sing a song
or something all right you got a song
for us yeah while the machine heats up
oh boy that's funny ok move the machine
back like wow they have cable
Oh be blacks left a mark versamark 22
jun hwa teetee wah ji wah wah wah ji chu
hua ji chua chihuahua Oh be mass of your
class Wow Oh be a blast Oh be a blast
slinky I'm on this press you're supposed
to do this oh oh my supposed to be
joining in there and soundless all go
out the soap take chu-uh chu-uh chu-uh
chu-uh chu-uh chu-uh opieop lacks a PFS
stretch it out and scout over chua-chua
wow
keeps you up you two up chiuaua hope you
pass it goes on forever what sort of it
this is actually the downside of this
machine isn't it well it's not it's not
exactly like ink jet ready and actually
yeah but it's when we when we started
filming it had already creeped heat it
up basically wah ji wah ji wah wah wah
wah wah wah wah wah off your black hope
you're that sick yeah I'm out and I'm
your funeral wah wah wah wah wah oh that
is how to sow sow thistle Oh would you
have been typing it don't
and that was that was a great warm-up
song for the printer doesn't that
everyone you all check out the heating
it meant so you thought the song was
long feel the printer warm up is she fed
locker but you actually started to ask
me about the oskins yeah you know yeah
so I thought it was cool ah stone that
you actually were building stuff having
real projects there for the girls to to
try out on a wage yes in a minute in a
minute um yeah you know that was
actually an initiative of Tasha's where
she put the she made her little open
source program with the Sodom yeah again
actually yeah Seguin Seguin de and and
some mindstorm robots actually she she
had used some higher-end proprietary
robots previously been for this cheese
to my storms I mean there's no point
exactly yeah which is another thing that
you know that I've also used them in the
same way as using the printer is robots
are just really popular and great for
kids because they can you know program
them and kind of give them missions and
make them do what they want them to oops
and you know sometimes it's really just
about marketing you know like sitting
together and going Tasha had the great
idea because you know when you do when
you do space missions there's always the
delaying communication so she thought
all right we've got a sit-in program
these things it takes a while we have to
then put load them up on to the robots
take them to the to the Mars scape and
then let them run their missions and it
kind of so did you guys need you lates
reality you get any feedback from the
girls who who ran the lab about kind of
what they thought or yeah you know
what's what's funny is because I saw I
saw it in action but i like everyone
dispersed out yeah um you know part of
it the biggest feedback is like thanks
for caring yeah really thanks for caring
about us yeah yeah so go out of your way
and want to bring us into this world and
give us some of them for some of them it
was extremely easy and if it was like
too easy for some of them it was very
very inaccessible yeah yeah but but I
think when they see other girls the same
age doing it then even if it's hard than
they I kind of take a note of it I
interested the occasion yeah that's true
and you know we tried to then among the
group give the girls who had more
experience a little bit more
responsibility to so that they could
share their own knowledge with the other
girls and that works really well you
know we had a group that was very
diverse and age to you saw yeah there
they were on your own you know 5050
everybody everybody everybody had their
own Hall even to walking around and
taking pictures or talking to folks were
passing by yeah that was really cool
tonight I think just not only the event
itself you know the thing that we did
but being in that context for them was
really eye-opening done in a way it was
hard they were right in the for the
folks who don't know we're talking about
this was right at the in the center of
the ASEAN conference which is the
largest open source conference in the
u.s. world in the world in the world yes
in the world and Cheryl was running
Terrell and talks are running a girls
program for young girls to participate
in a technology project and it was right
in the center of the
million area the expo hall right next to
the maker yes its food and they have
lunch with the rest of the geeks yes I
really early love that I mean I think
it's we worked with a really great
foundation in the neighborhood called
Friends of the children who are like
their mentors that stay with kids
literally their whole with kind of at
risk as as they say you know and these
adult people basically stay with these
kids for six seven eight nine ten years
make sure they get through high school
and you know k into life on a better
footing up and um I think they were just
they were really actually thrilled to be
in that environment where they saw a lot
of household names for one thing you
know and kind of went out you paypal and
google and it's hot oh here we go we
have stuff happening
for what it's worth i don't know if it's
on accelerated extrusion this time i'll
have to see
i'm diggin color
I think for a little it's gonna thank
announced I start pounding pounding at a
design yeah yeah and you know we had
great support of course from o'reilly
and black duck software and there were a
couple others who really just you know
who acknowledged the need to get more
girls interested in this area it's kind
of it's actually just about marketing in
a way in some in some senses you know
but these girls firstly through that
experience basically they broke open the
box you know they said oh is this all
this is about you know I may have turned
them off just because it's like oh
that's kind of too easy but in another
way but it's it's more accessible yeah
now they've seen that day they have a
its kind of demon idea I'd the whole
idea and also they met a lot of really
interesting and fascinating people who
were who are really excited about this
area of work and especially when it's
someone that they can identify with have
a woman and in particular you know there
was a just by chance these really great
people from NASA who happened to be oh
yeah I remember that at OSCON you
actually I saw a NASA yeah I laptop was
that that's from yeah that's from then
yeah that's my my pride and joy actually
from nice from being there is an apple
NASA logo actually add a few other
vessel it started that whole downward
spiral you know once you kind of deface
right so I've got I've got something to
else to add to your own are you serious
alright sweet so you thanks for coming
on the night hacking stream and you get
a limited edition
I'll have to find a good place for it on
yeah yeah your laptop's pretty full but
somewhere oh oh you know that's where
you have to start getting creative also
one of the nice things about it Ben
figured this out so it's partially
transparent oh really so I'm so I could
just slap it over the other ones yeah he
found a nice place where he wasn't
covering his github logo or any other
the other arm stickers which yeah heaven
forbid yeah maybe we'll you can fade out
with the printing are less yeah I know
whatever Versailles to keep moving make
sure because yeah actually that's right
after this will take will take lots of
nice pictures of the replicator and what
you guys see it one it's heated one of
the extruders still working on the
second one and it's gotta go from 77
degrees Celsius to 220 meh yeah that's
not why I do it like math yeah it's not
wait for that alright so thanks
everybody for joining us for another
night hacking stream with cheryl miller
and tomorrow we have hacking with
Russell's with Tasha oh that's good and
also touch i have no idea what we're
gonna do but but it will be great from
right horribly out of focus yeah cozy
belgium alright so thanks for thanks for
joining us and have a good evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
