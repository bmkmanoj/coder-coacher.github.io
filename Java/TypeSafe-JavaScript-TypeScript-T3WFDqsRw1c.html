the j focus conference in stockholm it
with me is ben Pizarro hi and we're
going to be chatting about doing
typesafe javascript using the the new
typescripts language for Microsoft so
just to start off tell me a little bit
about give me the 30-second elevator
pitch on why I want to use typescript
instead of JavaScript so if you have a
large JavaScript application like over
10,000 lines of code and you work in a
team with several people and you want to
have like a type-safe language to
represent your work then you should go
with typescript and the main benefit for
me actually is because i was using just
JavaScript before is it's very close to
JavaScript so you're not you don't have
to learn and enter a new language it's
very close to to JavaScript so yeah this
is this is really type safety but
designed for JavaScript hackers it's
very comfortable if you're familiar with
JavaScript constructs so it's like and
then what typescript rise to be is very
close to the ACMA script six standard so
whatever will come in the future with
classes and module syntax is already how
types good works today do you think do
you think maybe typescript will be a
future acma evolution of javascript well
what I believe will happen is it could
come closer together yeah like the
convergence yeah yeah okay so why don't
we dig in and show a little bit of the
code so i have your your screen up yep
so i'm i'm here on the typescript
languor dork website and typescript is
open source an open source project and
it it's a it's a superset of javascript
so that means here i'm having some
javascript code on the left-hand side
and on the right hand side you will see
like the compiled version of it and it
actually not surprisingly looks the same
and the reason for that is that any
javascript file is already valid tab
script file okay typescript compiles to
JavaScript exactly so and and it tries
to be very close to to what you have
written so even white space is preserved
and stuff like that it gets interesting
as soon as you start to use types
because that what taps crew is all about
so let me just type here on the
left-hand side and this is the colon
ocean to introduce the type in your in
your code and you will see the right
hand side didn't change this means that
your types are erased on compiling
there's nothing that is added to your
code but we have some validation now
happening because we see hey we expect a
string so your literal whatever you pass
here is not valid so that's really like
the idea is to have a rich language
service that it uses all these type
information got it and if you do more
advanced things like classes and modules
let me pick the class system here then
you actually see that you can have with
the very concise and short syntax create
your classes and you don't have to do
all the prototype dance that usually
have to do when you do this in in
JavaScript sorry very straightforward
and then what else do we have so there
is generics which i think is a very cool
feature so if you if you use promise
libraries for instance they are usually
they complete in some future and return
you the value and using generics you can
actually type these promises and the
return value is a strongly typed so so
you've taken types all the way to
generics yes it's it's all the way
through and and and what's really cool
is if I if I go back to this to this
example is that actually typescript has
a very powerful type in fear inch type
inference so even if you don't use like
explicitly annotate your types
typescript understands that for instance
a function when I write one like let's
say we have a function make message that
returns something and I I hover over
this this is actually the type that has
gripped in fear so without me doing
anything he knows this make message is
something that returns friends like
typescript could actually pick up type
inference hours on existing JavaScript
code is that you actually doing anything
or using the features yes so you will
find yourself when you start my great
putting your javascript in you might
already get errors because some of the
things you return don't match but what
is expected and that's really very
powerful and be kind of funny when
people realize that their code was
actually broken all that yeah and and
and the nice thing is so we we went all
from JavaScript to typescript and you
can start with yo-yo code base and just
gradually add the types as you go and
then benefit from the things yeah cool
no that looks like a really good
technology from making your your
JavaScript code much easier and more
maintainable for forget big teams which
i think is happening now that folks are
doing large frameworks and building more
rich client applications on the browser
and actually you can you can take it one
step further let me jump here to to some
other example so if you write note code
you you you have a module loading kind
of thing require like common jas in that
case and what typescript has is like in
a very strong system for these modules
so you can just write your import
statements here and when you compile it
down to javascript it will just work
like your dependencies are expressed and
if I do that I can actually go ahead and
use the typescript compiler here to
compile this to come on Jas so that's
like the compiler you just use it from
the command line it's it's an open
source node module that you can run and
then you see actually this is my
javascript code a note and the import
statements have been rewritten to
require and we use note on the server
and with typescript and we use tax code
on the client with with an AMD module
loading and that has been a very good
decision yeah cool all right well now
that's a good lightning pitch of your
talk how can folks find more about
typescript and them what they're doing
the best resource would be to to go to
taps key Blanco dork it's like the
official entry point and you will find
the playground there you will find some
documentation there's also an
echoplex page where the issues are
listed like you can file box or
contribute because it's open source and
then you're all set play with it cool
alright well thanks very much thanks
