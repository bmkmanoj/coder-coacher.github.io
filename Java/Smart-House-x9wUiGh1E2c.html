concedes that how can we use Java ME
embedded in our everyday life so how
some of you can be where the germany
invaded and now he's available for
raspberry pi we did support for this
platform deliberately too late the
developers to buy tragic keep watch such
as chipboard right Raspberry Pi and run
Java me in greater toledo and then
imagine 10 okay a developer has
raspberry pi each down he downloaded
germany invaded and how can he do
anything interesting and beside itself
quality stuff is to automate something
inside of you girish or inside of your
home so here we came a model of smart
house smart home we have different
systems light systems that control the
light of the house alarm system and
temperature system let's demonstrate
some of them the house can be controlled
by two ways by simple short messages or
by raw socket connection now we can for
example let's turn on the light you
should write the common joint on light
SMS is being delivered to this module
and as you see we proceed proceed in
this SMS and turned on the light in the
house as interesting stuff is the alarm
system now as you see the alarm is
turned off because the ledge is shining
green now we are trying to turn on 01
runs in the sixth st. in you
for kids elements window another
interesting thing here is a feedback
from the cars for example imagine that
someone open the door and now we are
waiting for the education that the door
is forced something like this so they
this idea is very simple the
technologies are available and so we
would like to motivate our developers to
do something like this in the homo gay
or other places
