the alps jug and grenoble france i got a
bunch of the user group members with us
and we just finished setting up and
having dinner eating some good pizza and
i thought the first thing we do is
introduce the folks who came out on up
let me let me first explain a little bit
about the the format what we're going to
do tonight so this is all live streams
so we have folks online watching live
stream and it also goes out recorded
later that if you're online and you want
to participate we'll be watching the
chat on the stream here so I have a chat
window right here as folks online
savings will be able to see it on the
screen in the room here and if you're
online and you want to participate with
us type in the social chat or send out
Twitter or Facebook messages with pounds
night hacking in the address and then
what we'll do for the session and here
is introductions kind of introduce
yourself what company you work for what
java technologies are interested in and
I was thinking we do a scene builder lab
since seen builder was actually built by
the local oracle team here in grenoble
so i think it's appropriate we're in
grenoble we should go it's seen builder
and that we can get direct feedback to
the guys at the office here if there's
anything that can be approved and then
we'll see if the folks online have any
questions about the user group or have
any interesting they want to talk about
all right so let's get started with
introductions
okay so mention you know who you are
what company what sort of Java
technology is your you're interested in
so first ello and my name is avila idea
i'm working at bonita soft we're writing
a Bonita so BPM solution business
process management solution on the
personally I'm working and only keeps
SCP application mm okay so lots of Vesta

eclipse gun about it keeps for running
over job I fix I came here to see how to
do job I fix cool alright welcome okay
so hello my name is mature chef at I
work as well at bonita soft I work on
the engine part so I'm I focused my

system so i'm interesting in the in such
things but in my free time so okay
wait what do you do wait were you doing
your free time yeah but I am I for the
moment I'm just exploring some
disability system some no sequel systems
I don't guess on the harm Hadoop say I

what's your what's your what's your
what's your experience with no sequel
sisters you are you paying with this
saga this tool so there are contributing
in the future let's see cool all right
past my cover ok so I'm Emmanuel Yugen a
and so i'm working at silver piece which
is doing libra software to and well as
the technology like I told you before we
are using all the stacks in Java fossa
forever on the server side from a from a
g to e 1 dot tutu g6 so you guys have
everything yeah we've got everything you
can imagine I can still see Sierra with
jack rabbit now using g do is cast off
suppose we go about it we are using GPA
ibanez ask GBC and then we have all also
owned or em from large excess right just
name in and we have it so i noticed i
notice you have a nice little laptop
logo there yeah do you know who that is
doable character in a laptop so this is
a what is the this is the up Joker logo

pinch of that jugs yeah and these are
adding a snowboarding board and because
we are enjoyable and so is out of the
muntins also on guys fit so i think the
paris child is the same French yes you
have it in
jokes because it's a I don't remember
the world history about it but i think
it was it was in Sunday's but they used
to have this mascot for drugs out of the
finches for the jokes are the Duke for
for java and so listen close is a
snowboarding and since nobody can share
okay well i think i think he looks
lonely so we are to give him a a friends
to go snowboarding with him okay alright
so how about right next year it must is
a free market all right and then since
you guys are all brave enough to get on
the livestream you guys all get limited
edition there's only a few of these in
the world thank you and also as a as a
jug leader either i'd like to give you
some oh I'm drinking drinking beverage
fallible here pajama table so I can get
a good shot yeah yeah this is beer from
Greenville bunnies are isn't it and this
is a temp says a local a bird yes it's a
just to be a on the weather I'm too
crazy with all yeah so you guys you guys
very cold weather here so you drink more
beer so and it's a cold multi which is a
famous McGraw run Gruenebaum because a
runnable used to be at the frontier
between sanwa which was which would be
studied next and France call that's it
so I'm passing to go
some so you want you want some gym beer
you want some beer Jim I can see you on
the line they're watching us you guys
know Jim Weaver these fees the ones
commenting in the chapter he's one of my
co-authors and an expert in all things
javafx so he's a good guy to know so
yeah hi my name is a win over now I'm
walking for open the name of the company
French company and the 20 I'm walking
for first idea as a contractor focusing
on security a choice cool what's your
favorite Java technology right now
what's are things you're working on one
of my favorite estates a good gain was
very impressed with their product okay
yeah that's like a cloud-based your
system Thank are located in San
Francisco yes yeah let's burn passive or
so who lands who and jeans are also
interesting it's my too many cookies
cool alright so I'll leave this here in
case you guys want to grab it and yell
something at somebody in chat alright so
let me see if I can point the camera at
myself successfully oops now this is
this is guessing but I bet the focus has
to be around there somewhere
oh there's Antonia on the stream hi
Antonia all the all the jug guys here we
were actually chatting about you earlier
in the restaurant when we were we were
eating let's see think a little push my
camera guy when I need to go farther up
ok so the format here that was wrong way
this truck let's try
alright so I did anyone your help
because I can't focus a camera can one
of you take the outer the focus knob
here this one and just rotate it until
I'm in focus yeah Oh back a little
perfect yeah thank you all right so what
we'll do is I'll do it very very very
short presentation on javafx so you guys
know a little bit about the technology
and then before we started I showed you
links for downloading the scene builder
tool which we're going to use for doing
a prototype and I'll do a really quick
prototype maybe we can use the the jug
the jug mascot and do something with him
so think of application we can write
really quickly using the mascot with
maybe some animation or something all
right so
that's not my right talk
there we go
oops I think that's not going to work
for the folks online
think
this one will work
now
see what I want
speaker full screen
Oh individual ones on this one ok so now
now folks on the stream will actually
see it full screen in addition to us all
right so hacking John effects at the
Alps jug alright so this is this is my
tour map of traveling around so I guess
I'm about near number three now here and
going back up my way this is reversed
now I'm going up towards Belgium but
I've been through Germany Switzerland
Italy where else would I go netherlands
london so um lots of fun and these are
bunch of the people who I've met along
the way or we'll meet as your picture
should be up here to a little bit about
the JavaFX platform so it's a
cross-platform framework for building
client applications so kind of like
eclipse RCP which you guys mentioned you
use but this is a more modern framework
it's written from the ground up on a new
3d pipeline so it takes advantage of
your 3d acceleration on your computer it
takes advantage of CSS styling for doing
all the layouts and controls so it makes
it much easier style your application
similar to how you would if you were
building a web application and you can
integrate different technologies like
html5 JavaScript inside of your javafx
application using the web view or you
can put existing swing and SWT
components using GFX pain or the sweet
pain I think so you can embed existing
content inside of your javafx
application to get javafx all you have
to do is download Java 7 and then you
have it if you download the Jerry you
get the runtime if you download the JDK
you get the development tools and it
works on windows linux and mac
tasha and to develop you can use your
favorite ID which which i do you guys
use ok that was expected so a bunch of
eclipse developers how much you guys
netbeans ok well i think i think i think
we can we can tell that you maybe you
like netbeans maybe a little bit how
about you what ideas your favorite ok
see your ID agnostic yeah i mean i
actually i use all the IDS sometimes the
best tool for the job but um for javafx
i mostly use netbeans for development
because it's the best plug in right now
but you can use any ide you can even use
it on a developer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
