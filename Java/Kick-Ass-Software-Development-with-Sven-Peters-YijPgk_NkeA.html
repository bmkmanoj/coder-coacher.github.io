have any audited I'm live stream sook
open and he are scanning the office teen
born and he played on a broad send
button that's great okay then I'm going
to do it in English so yeah kick ass off
for development so so who knows the
movie kick-ass we have seen the movie
kick-ass well the first part not the
second one because that sucks the first
one is really good so for those who have
seen the movie they know that already
kick-ass is just an ordinary guy so he
doesn't come from this planet kryptonite
or he doesn't him haven't been bitten by
a biter by a radioactive spider he's
just he's just an ordinary guy and he
walks the street and said one day okay I
want to be a superhero and I want to
fight criminalists so and for those who
have seen the movie they are they also
saw that he got really really beaten up
the first time so he went out side of
criminalist got peed enough to get
actually step by knife driven over by
car afterwards so really really bad
things happen to him but then he stood
up he stood up again and did actually
his second fight so he stood up and did
his second fight he didn't he didn't
stop at this point he stood up and did
the second fight and all of a sudden
other superheroes drawing so he'd go
joined and Big Daddy joined so it was a
really super hero crew and this is
actually if we take this and put it to
software development this is actually my
talk in a nutshell my elevator pitch yep
so it's actually we are there's a
superhero in all of us this is super
hero in all of us we can really kick ass
again in software development we just
have to go out and and see what sucks
and fix fix those things so but first i
want to set some expectation here on
this talk so who's actually here to see
some some kickass coat yeah in this talk
well sorry this is the only code you
will see you may leave now bye
so who wants to learn a new methodology
the new the new agile the new scrum the
new combined and you kick ass
methodology yeah okay after warning for
you there is no kick s manifesto
atlassian has not written a kickass
manifesto and for those who wants a
kickass who think there's a kick-ass
manifesto and who are here to get a
certification no there will be no
certification after this talk guaranteed
you okay who just wants a kick ass well
now you're a little bit scared here you
can see that yeah so for those who want
to kick ass this is your freaking talk
here yeah and yeah that's actually
that's actually me with a mask but it's
pretty warm under that mask so I haven't
taken another personally all right um so
actually how do you do kick ass off for
the moment how do you how do you achieve
that how do you do kick ass off for
development two words use Java thank you
and goodbye oh well okay good so the
programming language is of course not so
important you can kick ass with Ruby you
can kick ass with C sharp you can kick
ass with PHP I don't know PHP
programmers here in the room no one out
no just kidding so my PHP ages are it
may I think 10 years ago the last line
of code PHP gota from Britain so but I
care about software software developers
and my name is when I worked for an
Australian company called a lesson and
I'm an ambassador which is like an
evangelist and other companies so tweet
me if you think this talk doesn't kick
ass at all tweet me if you think this
talk kicks ass whatever you want just
give your feedback so software
development I've just written some
random things down when I said okay what
what what do I want to achieve in
software development and these are my
random sinks I want have better software
suffer that is better that performs
better that is better in quality
whatever just better suffer I want to
have less overhead I don't want to spend
that much time in meetings I just want
to write code that's what I want to do
it I don't want to read emails that much
i want to write code faster development
faster development is a good one I want
to want to actually have my features
faster at the customer so they can they
can really see what I've been doing last
week so this is what I want and all of
this I think I hope makes happy
customers so I want happy customers and
when the couple of customers are happy i
think we all have happy developers so if
you would have asked me spin how do we
achieve that five years ago I would have
said the HR agile as a solution for
everything well we just have small small
sprints and at the end of the Spirit we
showed the customer gets the call
software to the customer fast
development the customers have been
great I told you five years ago I would
have said that well so what's actually
the state of agile and the year 2014
where are we with agile well you hear
more and more people bashing on a shell
so like like marketing for brooke the
diabolic developer which says something
like hey if it can pause then just ship
it which is I mean really feel
professional developers this is totally
stupid I mean we have to queue give that
to QA or test thing
and and run it to the build server might
make some make some tests automated
tests we know that but a little voice
inside me says yes awesome that's great
I want I want to just ship it if it
composite yeah I don't want to care
about all the stuff or the people from
the dark manifesto of agile software
development who just replaced some words
in the agile manifesto like individuals
and interactions and not process and
tools all the guys from the programming
 scene they say just they
didn't just replace some words they
replace the whole manifesto every
sentence they translated with what's the
real value on that programming
 that's a real value so the
question is if we see all this all these
people all this guy's is agile actually
debt is it over are we waiting for the
new thing to come well I think agile
goes like like every technology
methodology treaty through this Gartner
hype curve well at the beginning
everybody thinks wow this is great this
is awesome you have to try this so they
sort of let us say you have to try this
developers you have to try this is still
good then the early adapter says yes it
solves all my problems and then you
adopt agile adopt the technology and
then you see well it actually doesn't
solve all my problems actually agile
introduces more problems because makes
things more transparent all of a sudden
so you get more problems maybe in your
organization so what what should we do
now that we know that so we are
somewhere on the downside maybe it's
going up at the end maybe not so what we
actually can do is wait for the next
next smart people the next girl that
shows up wait for for the new uncle bob
or i don't know let's see let's wait
well we all know that we shouldn't do
that we should stop following the next
girl and we should look at our own
software development what we are doing
at our own own company what are we doing
day in day out change this and kick
again so this is what we should do so
here's here's here my far ass-kicking
topics brought with me deliver kick ass
suffer 1 Giga steamed cake is
collaboration caigas automation and we
start with to live a key get software so
kickass suffer what is kick-ass offer I
mean for me actually kick azz suffer is
if my customer looks like this well
maybe not exactly like this but if he
smarts like this it's like like this guy
here if he's happy using my software so
he's he's getting up in the morning
being happy going going to the office
yes i can use when suffer great who then
I pretty much know that I'm doing kick s
suffer we want to build the right thing
so how do we how do we do that how do we
know that we build the right thing who
here knows the microsoft kin this
audience 12 okay good I didn't know the
Microsoft can be for this talk i just
googled for microsoft software disasters
and this came up so and microsoft they
wanted to do this cool mobile phone I
think it was 2010 or something the ones
that do this cool move iphone you'd see
it's little bit looking like a
blackberry where people can type very
very fast so it's for the young
generation Facebook integration Twitter
integration foursquare you name it
everything is in there so they can type
very fast type the messages cool thing
they actually acquired a company who did
this separation system on that one so
they acquired this company spent I don't
know a lot in marketing actually they
actually spend 1 billion dollar just
deal of that developing this phone they
brought it on the market nobody wanted
it nobody wanted this phone and then
Microsoft did something very very smart
after 40 days they pulled the plug and
they removed it from the market again so
very very smart they didn't try to fix
it they saw we're not going to win this
battle it's over we stop it 1 billion
dollar down the toilet so actually
how do we know that we build the right
thing actually before we build the right
thing so atlassian we have one sentence
if we say day in day out and this is
called fake it till you make it we can
go so far with faking stuff we can save
so much money if we if you just go and
fake stuff so IBM actually they did
something some very very cool and this
is decades it up go and this is the
speech-to-text experiment so they did
this experiment where they put they said
they developed a soft have developed a
software that turned speech into text
great so they took this took this
software took took some some people set
them in front of a microphone that was
just a microphone at the screen and then
people start speak started speaking and
magically the words appear on the screen
cool great they didn't ride one line of
code they just had a guy who could type
very very fast he was sitting there with
the headphone and type very very fast
and they take the whole the whole thing
and what might what I BM found out is
that people cannot talk the whole day
they got a bigger they just cannot talk
for the whole day and then they cannot
control the cursor like backspace
backspace delete delete Lee it's all
working that's not that's totally not
working so they found out they stopped
this as the development they didn't
start even so they stopped this project
and said we're not going to develop it
because it doesn't make sense to do it
okay but even one step before that we
can start faking stuff and see if if
stuffs working so we can start one step
before that and that's what we also do
atlassian it's paper prototypes and
paper prototypes are very very cheap
thing you just need some glue is sis or
some screwdriver and and and piece of
paper and then you draw your interface
what we do is we sit together with the
designer or a few designers developers
customers and then we're doing paper
prototype sessions which may be our one
enough our sessions and in this paper
produce I session we take a user stories
say we want to want to solve this here
we want to draw the UI for this
then we're trying maybe 15 15 prototypes
and we throw 13 away from this paper
prototypes and say okay these these
13,000 radial don't really work and this
is the good thing if you use paper you
can just throw it throw it in the bin
you don't have a connection to it if you
already have put effort in making a nice
design and and and and writing some HTML
code and all the stuff so then then you
say okay I'm going to fix that but here
you just throw it away paper prototype
looks a little bit like this if you see
that if you can see that that's a better
prototype very very cheap I know what
kind of software this looks like an
email software so this is a cheap paper
prototype that's somebody built but
we're not just doing new cool interfaces
here we all have running software out
there so and we have can't we have to we
have to improve our software
continuously but which path should we
improve maybe we should throw away some
parts so how do we know that which parts
are used which what is good what is not
good we know that through feedback we
collect feedback we want have feedback
from customers how they use our software
what they what I think is good with our
software what is it they think it's bad
with our software but how do we generate
a kick-ass feedback experience so two
weeks ago I went through Heathrow
Airport and there was this terminal here
and it says how is your security today
and there were three terminals I went
through the security saw this terminal
very easy to find and it's very simple
it's also very simple you just have a
few buttons here yeah good bad in
between so it's very very simple and
it's fast to submit you just push a
button and go go on go to your plane
very busy if you want to have more
detailed feedback you can give that to
there are some cards to fill out great
that's a kick-ass feedback experience in
my my point of view so we have this
problem at alas iam that not this
problem we wanted to be
it for our product called greenhopper I
don't know of anybody knows that here
anybody knows green harbor was not
called greenhopper anymore it's no jaja
anyway there was not a test so so it's
now dear agile so for Deirdre we wanted
to have this new board we wanted to make
a new board experience so we can it's an
agile software there's a scrum board of
Kanban board inside so we wanted to make
a new board and what we wanted to have
with this new bodice we wanted to
collect as much feedback as possible so
we wanted to create a kick-ass feedback
experience for Jo Jo so what we actually
did is we we created this button and we
put it just on the header so just on the
header there was this feedback button so
everybody could see it wherever they
were in india raja they could see this
button so and if you click on this
button very very simple to fill out just
a few required fields and you you can
fill them out very very easily and as
you see it's in application feedback so
you don't not dragged to another web
page you're in the application so and
then press submit and it's very very
fast and you can see you end up where
you have started so you don't have to go
back somewhere you just end up where
your salad so to wrap this up easy to
find very very simple and fast to submit
with this we did this and I think we
tripled our our feedback that we got so
we had a button down at the page like
every web page has sent be feedback
please and we tripled our our our
feedback so three time as much feedback
as we had before it's good but how to
deal with all this feedback so and
actually you want to protect your
developer a little bit from that
feedback because you hire them to
develop code that's what they do that's
what they what they do they in day out
they should write code actually google
has pointed turned for this and called
the umbrella and
the umbrella is I mean these
numbers are I think two years old so
don't count on that one our developers
in the Gmail team and 425 million users
it's it's much more than that right now
I think but still still that's just an
example here so and if you if you see
that and if you count the numbers and
you can easily do the math that's 4.25
million users / developer if they
collect the feedback for one development
you know they will never get right of
the line of code so they said actually
okay good we have our product manager
they take care of all this feedback
prioritize that and then we can write
code the developers can write code
that's great that we want great other
people are sorting out what we should do
we just writing code good well not so I
think well so we're not gmail atlassian
so we we have maybe I don't know ten
million users and 300 developers so just
another ratio and atlassian we think
everybody has to go on the front line
everybody has to know what's going on so
we send our our our developers to
conferences to talk directly to
customers so they know what packs the
customer here what's the problem with
our software they know that so they
should know that actually we want to
close close the feedback loop very very
tight and get personal and this is also
what the JIRA agile team did with this a
lot of feedback so they they sat down
every day for 45 minutes went through
all the feedback they got the debut from
the day before and prioritize that and
actually if they found found something
what I said okay good idea but we won't
do that in the next three years that's
not that's not our our goal they said
they actually wrote that to the to the
to the guy who gave us feedback they
wrote that and they got personal so they
said okay I'm a developer here and we
say we're not going to do that nextly
what you see is actually pretty pretty
amazing stuff people really appreciate
that their feedback get down to the
developer and they said okay turn you
down but anyway okay
that's good I understand that and then
we have another program where we send
our staff to support so we have
developer on support so our developers
we have a program our developers have to
spend at least one week in 1st level
support each year so one week 1st level
support second level support they have
to do anyway so but first let us support
one week so they know actually all the
first level problems I cannot lock in
yeah you have to use another log in or
whatever so they come back with that
with that knowledge from their support
and say hey we can fix it very very
easily in our software our support
people are just saying ok go to that
page and yeah blah blah blah we can we
can fix it and software that's easier so
there's a win-win here also the support
people they learn from the development
so we make deep backing session with the
support people so they can debug our
software they can debug 0 of confluence
so let's develop on support saying that
about feedback and delivering kick as
software you should care about your
customer care about your customer and
have an effective feedback loop close
your feedback look very very tight ok
the next thing I'm going to talk about
is how to work in one kick-ass team and
you already saw that developers and
support people are working together to
solve problems so this is for me one
kick-ass team let's have a look at some
other disciplines in software
development what comes there is
developer and tester yay and so test or
a good at testing software developer
good at writing software that's natural
that we're doing two different things is
it well we all know that if we if we
just separated like this we will get
problems we will get problems in our
software development so there are
problems like bottlenecks so if we are
just in front of a big release and we
throw everything over to the QA and the
QA you have to test it and then give
back to us well the QA the bottleneck
here a lot but the most important thing
is we lose the accountability we are not
accountable for what we're doing it's
the QA
it is responsible for the quality so we
just give our features throw it over the
wall and the QA will find the box great
we don't have to work for box now that
we are accountable for what we're doing
it's our quality that we deliver deliver
to our customers deliver to QA that's
that's really important and what we also
saw a lesson if we hire so so we're very
engineering during driven so we think
great we can solve everything through
automated testing awesome but then our
customers so we will pretty high test
coverage but then our customers came
back and said oh you have some box in
your suffering we add cannot be
everything is tested automatically well
yeah you know that you know that you
cannot test everything automatically so
we learned it from from from testers
from QA people that we also have to do
manual test to test our self or manually
and then we saw okay good how many tests
do we need then we have a scalability
problem here and lesson actually we have
resolved that and we now we have for
certain developer we have one tester so
certain developer bone test so that's
all ratio we don't want to get get more
down and we solve that by introducing a
program called developer on test so this
is when developers are testing software
so developers are testing their own
software that they have written of
course not because in other developers
testing your software that you have
written so this is developers on test so
you might say now well great developers
are doing all the work and the testers
can sit there drink pina colada be happy
who and just say to the developer test
harder there's a buck now it's not it's
not like this so tests are good to
testing the complicated stuff and what
we found out exactly if we take the easy
to test stuff and let this test by a
tester and a developer we found the same
amount of boxing the easy to test stuff
it testifies the same amount of box like
as a developer it's a hard to test how
to how to test things where our testers
are better so we divide our features in
it's easy or our QA does that an easy to
test harder test and too easy to test
things that's all
our developers get because quality QA
Edilean doesn't mean quality assurance
it means quality assistance so the QA
people are helping the developers to
become better testers to find better
tools for testing this is what the QA is
the responsibility of the QA not just
testing the software but helping
everyone to become better testers okay
and I told you developer on tests it's
called dot at atlassian and we have was
a work for that and starting and I bring
you six tips for kickass studying that
we do it alessia and the first three
tips are no are just just normal dotting
things and then we're getting the last
free a little bit advanced dotting so if
you have reached the first three steps
you can go on with the with the next
three steps so first we send everyone on
training on training courses so we train
our our developers they they get to get
they get to think like a tester so they
think like a tester at the end of this
course but this is just theory so this
this is maybe one week one week course
where they really get into deep testing
theory and then we also pair we pair
together our developers and testers are
pairing together so they fit at the same
desk that the developers testing and the
tester says if I would be you I would
test more into that direction test more
the extremes or whatever I don't know so
this is this what they do they they pair
and then we also do blitz test and blitz
SS is it's another thing it's not just
that the developers are testing but the
whole company is testing so we say okay
now we got three cool new features here
so we got three new crew features and we
want want them really to be tested so
our QA is inviting people to to a blitz
test which lasts maybe just two hours so
everybody in the company can take part
of the splits test and can test our
software or three new features and the
QA is saying okay you test this feature
you test this feature and you're just
trying to break the whole thing and then
we take together the feedback our QA is
doing
at sorting out all duplicates and then
prioritize the stuff so this is the
basic dotting what we did maybe two
years ago and then we get went into
advanced dotty and advanced studying we
are writing our our qas writing test
recipes I told you that the complicated
stuff is done by our testers which is no
longer true for for all tests because
they write recipes so this is how I
would test it and then our developers
can take this recipes go through all the
steps and test the software another
thing is what we do is split session
split sessions is the opposite of
pairing split session we take a user
story set the developer or say you test
it and then the tester is going to
another room and test the same thing and
at the end they come together and
compare the results and then find out
that maybe the developer hasn't found
all the bugs that the test has found and
then they're discussing this or the
other way around and then we have
something we experiment experimenting
with it a little bit and it's called
back hunters and backhand us are
actually people that say okay for a
sprint you're the buck hunter you're the
bug hunter here in our team now for this
print and then we he's actually going to
the done column in our scrum board and
taking the things that are already QA
tested and try to find some back so is
hunting off the box this is back hunters
said all that is that developers are
testing and testers are testing quality
at atlassian is everyone's
responsibility we are all responsible
for the quality also we adopt footing
that means we try our software on our
own servers before we send it out to
customers so I'm also doc footing the
software I'm trying it out and if I find
it back it's my responsibility also to
file that back to the confluence teen if
I find a bug in confluence in an early
early bitter program as it's my
responsibility to fire that back to the
confluence team okay one kick-ass team
department barrier slows us down and
this were just two examples support and
and and test us I can go on with design
us I can go on with IT administrators so
we all work
from the idea to the running software in
our server we have to work together as
one team doesn't mean that we have to do
all things we don't have to be a
designer it's good to know how the hell
do designers work to become to
understand this process better so we
work together we should work together as
one one kick-ass team the next thing I'm
going to talk about this kick-ass
collaboration and just start was coding
we all code us so I start was coding
here who doesn't remember the good old
times when we are the lonesome cowboy
Cola and just writing code and we were
the only only commit us in our no
repository and we knew every line of
code no merge conflicts that was great
it was awesome and the trouble started
we worked with a team where we work with
the team yeah we all of a sudden had
merged conflicts ah and then we
didn't know every line of code some
Hecky developer did this thing and we
didn't understand it so we didn't know
every line of code and really the
quality were really different in our
code base so but if we work together in
teams we need some rules how we work
together so let's have a look how other
disciplines solve that note software
development so let's have a look at
traffic routes so looking at this
Junction here traffic junction it's
maybe somewhere in the u.s. I don't know
we see red light maybe the cars have to
stop wait wait wait green light we can
arrive until the next strengths and then
we have to stop again next traffic light
stop stop stop wait for the other costs
right when we when we look at this this
is that very efficient I don't know if I
don't think so if you look at a junction
in India let's look at this I don't know
if you can see that but you get the
point here so it's actually the traffic
is flowing and I've seen that that video
a few times I can't see any rules in
there there are no rules but it's
stopping sometimes but then it's going
on so it's really really flowing that's
great that's what we want no no rules
great seems to work seems to work very
fine well said that is this
person is a little bit unfair we know
that traffic rules should protect us
from accidents and i'm pretty sure that
there's more dead people in the air in
accidents and traffic than in the u.s.
so that's not fair but if you look at
our development we have so many rules
our company gives us so many rules and
what does actually development rules
protect us from making mistakes but does
it really mean that we have need to have
that many routes I've worked for a
company that said okay we have to write
our our process down our whole
development process and it looked a
little bit like like this here if you do
a go to be or go to see or well well I
actually have to have two ripe things
like that down it's not a development
process but when we look at coating
processes please keep it simple and a
lesson it's it's very very simple we
have just these three things ranch coil
much so we're doing actually a branch
for every task so we're using git and
we're doing a branch for every task that
we have so a task is an alas in an issue
0 of course so we take take that and
make a branch word and it's very very
sure of lifetime so branch is a very
very short lifetime an average of two
days after then we merge it back and
delete the branch again the problem is
solved it's in the master branch we are
done well there's not the whole process
so let's add some some quality here so
we ask people we're using pull requests
and we ask people hey what do you think
about my changes and this is an hour
process this is baked in our process no
line of code gets into the master branch
before it's got reviewed so but actually
why do you why do you want to discuss
our changes so i have actually hear my
game show candidates who can answer me
that questions and I ask the question
why do you want to discuss their code
changes here so who wants a press the
button first year Julie she wants better
quality that's good that's a great
answer of course if we discuss the
changes we get better quality we get
into this discussion well this is good
this is bad well this looks like
infinitive loop well this
statements you never reach that so we
get better quality here somebody else
wants a drill press the button live and
you cannot see the answer from Lynn but
it says what it says thank you Steve she
wants to learn and that's so true we
learned so much and this is I think the
most important thing if we do code
reviews if we discuss about code we
learn from each other we learn we learn
how the other people are solving
problems we also learn some parts of the
code that we have never seen before but
other people can touch that because they
know that parson we get we just get
pulled in the pull request and we see
all of a sudden what this PDF import of
class is doing say oh yeah that's great
ok next one Andy Andy come on and he
wants to feel better so he feels better
about about the coaches if they just
gets discussed code changes and the
fields better and that's also so true
and I'm also feeling feeling better
somebody else is looking over my coat
that's great so if the if you put it in
a production and the server goes down I
can say well we all have have looked at
that code and we all haven't seen that
back good now why I have to fix that
anyway so it doesn't matter but I feel
better ah Steve come on answer Steve I
want to blame people and wrong answer we
don't blame people in pull requests on
code reviews we want to be gentle so be
respectful when discussing changes and
then at the end of a pull request you
approve the poor lucas if you're happy
with with the result you approve the
pull request and we have a ruler lesson
we invite maybe five reviewers and if we
have two people approving the pull
request two thumbs up we're good to go
we merge the code we don't wait for
everyone to review our code so it's just
just two people grade or two three
people depending on the team great so
that means we have fast development so
when we're not just talking about code
we also have to collaborate about around
other things and we distributed over the
whole world so we have offices in san
francisco in Gdansk in Vietnam and in
Sydney so baseball development sets so
and we
or actually co-located tips team sets it
together in one office and we think the
collaboration is much better but said
that is the truth is that's not always
possible people are traveling people
want to move away and we don't want to
lose them at lse and we acquired new
companies and they work maybe on a canal
island and gypsy actually or sauce Prius
development giemsa so we are really
really highly distributed and then
another thing comes comes to my mind is
actually where do you work best is that
actually in the office with all people
or is that in the coffee bar next door
or is it on your couch at home and the
answer here is it depends it depends I
mean if I want to collaborate if I want
to talk to people the offices may be the
best place if I really want to
concentrate maybe the coffee bar or my
couch at home is the best place so the
question is how do we how do we actually
connect all these dots here and and
collaborate effectively how do we do
that and that's one great great thing
that we all use day in that we just have
to use it more efficiently and we use it
at lesson heavily it's called emails
emails are great so let me tell you
about in its emails emails work offline
but which is cool I can bribe my Amazon
a tree one too many I can reach I just
cried one email and reach many people
that's also good that's good right they
work as in closely yeah I don't have to
answer directly I can wait one day and
then answer cool and then I can add
people to the conversation also great i
can just forward emails and show show
the problem to other people that's good
well we love emails adolescent you might
think that now are you crazy spin this
is how my inbox looks in the morning
actually it's way too much emails okay
good we all know that email doesn't
really work so emails are bad for
conversations discussions on emails and
working lots of spam guts in and we get
every every male leads an action after
the meter they have to put it somewhere
as they are often too long people are
writing
really affects in emails so just we want
to avoid emails as much as possible and
that's why we use chat at atlassian
heavily very very heavily who just chat
here at work oh yeah half of you that's
great we use actually we have a lot of
chat rooms so we have maybe over 100
chat rooms that are less Ian and this is
something like for example the
conference develop a chat room where the
conference developer hangout discuss
discuss code and new features then we
have the design team the design team has
its own chat room where they discuss
their mock-ups and their design things
and then we have something like an
enterprise discussion room when I got a
question from big company I just jump
into that room there are the experts so
they answer my questions and then I can
leave that room again because I'm not
interested in all this enterprise
discussions but just my question get
answers I'm happy I leave that room
afterwards and then we have something
like beer drinkers or cat lovers chat
rooms and now no idea what's going on
there but the most important thing is
here just the comfort then you need just
the conversation you need in order to
kick ass we want to kick ass so just
have the conversations you need to kick
ass and stop all the rest and what we
found out actually when we went into
this chat room thing that we put up
temporary chat rooms and temporary chat
rooms are great for them we have a cross
project and across team project here so
if we want to do maybe in your web page
for our HR want to hire new developers
so we have to set up a new web page and
we have all this all this knowledge in
house so we don't ask an outer out and
consulting company to do that so then
we're creating a temporary chat room
where we have the designer talking to
the marketing guys and of course talking
to the HR and the web developer so they
talk all together in this temporary chat
from they don't have to sit in the same
building they don't have to sit on the
same continent this is just they're
connected through this chat room and
then of course you have to also involve
the management maybe well that's just
randomly
emoticon see I don't I don't know how
that happened anyway and so and then
actually when we when we have created
the web page we delete the chat room
again it's just a temporary chat room so
but Chet is also great of course for
remote conversations we all know that if
I'm sitting I'm sitting I'm actually my
home office all day and it connects me
to the office so it's great for remote
conversation but not only that it's also
great for for local conversations so
what people do and alas ian is they stop
that much talking in the development
room they start chatting because if one
is in the zone he's just in the zone
coding closes his chat client because he
wants to stay in the zone and then he
and when he comes out of the zone he can
follow the conversation because we
there's a history in the chat so he can
see all what's happening during he was
in the zone so this is this is great and
this is also reason why it's great for
conversations different time zones
because you if the Sydney team gets too
bad the San Francisco team wakes up and
looks at the chat room and knows why
some decisions has been made like they
has been made so so they can see that in
chat room there's a history they can and
they can jump into the conversation
understand what's happening that's great
another thing is that they can pull you
can pull people into conversations and
you just need to mention them so you
just say at Thomas has already had that
back and then Thomas Thomas got
mentioned you got a notification and you
get dragged into the chat room so we use
chat heavily and I encourage you to use
chat to at your work and then if I talk
about collaboration we had another
problem in our Sydney office where well
we we expanded heavily in Sydney so we
had on one side of the street building
and then we expand it to the other side
of the street and even though there was
a traffic light somewhere 100 meter down
the street people didn't use that so if
they had to use if you're deaf if they
had to go to two other developers get
across the street and it's verbs very
very heavy and you know software
developers in Australia they are
are there not so many and we don't want
to lose them so we needed to find a
solution for that and then a developer
watched a movie this one here Stargate
yeah that's a solution we are stupid we
built a portal that's good well we kind
of did so this is our portal in the year
2014 so well it's it's just a TV screen
with a mac mini and it's a small camera
so you have a small camera up there and
then you we have one in 11 building and
one in the other building and then you
can really start conversation you can
look into the office and wave and things
like that so it really feels like you're
looking in the others office and it's
this this conversation if you stay in
front of the TV screen it's much better
than just using your computer webcam
Skype connection so this really great
well talking about collaboration remove
collaboration friction everywhere you
see friction in collaboration remove
that and think about your workflows
special your coding workflows easy
workflows means fast development the
last thing I'm going to talk about is
automation we are software developers we
love automation so what are we doing day
in day out well we are helping people to
be faster we're helping them to be
faster but automating their work great
that's what we help us our software
Stewie but the question is actually how
much time do we spend to automate our
own software development to be faster
hmm not that much I think so when I talk
about automation the first thing that
comes to my mind in software development
is continuous integration so who's doing
continuous integration here not all
hands goes up but anyway okay good from
those whose doing continuous integration
who's actually doing kick-ass continuous
integration
one okay good come up stage here and
explain us how to do because we fail
also with kickers continuous integration
actually we had a last year so if we
look at our builds our bills they really
took too long two years ago we were
looking at our bills and they took too
long they were way too complicated they
were unstable and they they really
missed a concept we didn't have a real
concept I have to hurry up here okay
good so this was a problem with our
bills especially JIRA 11 years old
software really really was long and so
in short terms are built sucked but what
we want to achieve this we want to fail
fast we want to fail fast actually I
want to check in my coat and I want to
see immediately if my build is green if
all chest form through if I can can
build it and if all performance test
runs through that would be perfect we're
not there yet but we're getting there
and I call this sick things for things
to take mon stables and how to kick ass
again we're not there yet we're not
kicking ass but we're trying we're
trying have we looked at our bills and
try too hard to fix things so the first
thing is a little bit embarrassing but
this is the truth what we did is pass
the effect so build the thing and check
it into your Nexus or artifactory
whatever you have or whatever you want
check the artifact in there and and take
it from there take everything from there
and we we were building it I don't know
how many times so these are the stats
actually we went down from good that you
cannot see the numbers here very very
very good but it's one hour down to 30
minutes very very embarrassing but just
passing the artifact the next thing is
building making tests parallel and it do
them in parallel so just put in more
power into your continuous integration
server have a second one a third one and
run your tests and parallel that fixes a
lot of things then we looked at our
strategy our build strategy and we
thought we had we had this idea of a
build pipeline so first we build them we
do
test that we do performance test then we
do you know you get the point so that's
what we had then we're slowing us down
actually so what we do is now we build
in steps so just or in layers so the
first layer is every check in we're
doing building and making unit and UI
test this is what we do with every
chicken on the master branch then maybe
maybe hourly we're doing the platform
test and then maybe just the performance
test we're doing on I clip is because
they take so long and we find I think
ninety-eight percent of all box we
introduced here so this is good and if
we we don't fail fast here on that
stages but anyway it's just the rest two
percent and then look at your statistics
so look at your stats what you how does
your build perform and then you can
maybe see okay this this takes too long
I have to split it into two tests
because faster builds means actually
less task switching we want to switch
less tasks then when we are on task a
and we make our build and we have to
wait one and a half hour we already
started with task B and then our build
breaks and we have to go back to task a
this is not very efficient we want to
just want to want to go grab a cup of
coffee maybe and then go back and then
we see if the build succeeded or not
more test automation awesomeness so what
we also have is a flaky tests detector
so you know this flaky test where you
you build this red and then you say okay
I run it again and then it's green and
then you're fine that's a flaky tests so
we have a detector that detects that
nothing changed in the code but it was
rather than green so this must be a
flaky tests so it puts it automatically
and Karen teen so this test is not
executed anymore and this ultimate
erased a JIRA issue so somebody has to
look at it so it doesn't say anything if
it wants it succeeds and once that fails
so we can put that away for a second or
but somebody has to look at it it was
really relevant then we have wall bolts
all over the place so every software
development team has has a TV at least
one the most teams have to and you can
see actual numbers on that
whatever you want some some teams make
that differently so you can see how many
bills succeed is how many bill fails
what would toss do we have right now
with who's working on what task whatever
then we have a static code analysis
which is our Freud pot so we put that
into pull requests and if we if we have
if we do a pull request the fraud pot
kicks off looks at the code statically
analyzes this and puts in automatically
comments into the poor request and says
hey this is a magic number here maybe
you want to use a constant so said that
is use your skills to automate things we
are software developers we can automate
things we have to look at our own
software developments and fix things
there and make make our development
faster so for ass-kicking topics but
these were just randomly picked from me
I just went through at last day and say
oh this is great this is good this is
where we kicked ass these are just just
random puzzles I could could have picked
four different ones for four other ones
know your priorities what are your
priorities what are you looking at kick
ass customers kick-ass team you want
kick ass customers who want a kick-ass
team you want kick ass their speed kick
ass quality kick ass get but where's
your priority or maybe you are more into
quality the software requires more
quality then maybe this is a higher
rated thing yeah but know your
priorities at the beginning of this talk
I asked you the question I erased the
question actually is agile debt no of
course not I mean all these things were
actual we are constantly adapting things
we're seeing this is not working so we
change it maybe it's not the scrum
process or whatever we don't care we
just want to want to make things work we
want to kick ass we don't want to follow
rules we want to kick ass this is what
we want to do it's like running a trial
law so it's got Farquhar founder once
said be excellent in everything you do
it's well we can't run a triad lon if
you're just good at running you have to
be also good at cycling and at swimming
so look at your software development and
tackle everything it's not
just good if you are you have kickass
automation your build servers are
running very very fast but you're suckin
collaboration you have to also have to
fix that be excellent in everything you
do try ever every time you see a flaw in
your software development try to tackle
that and fix that you might say now okay
we know all the flaws and our software
development so we go to our managers and
tell them and but actually managers are
humans too managers are humans too yeah
I agree some may be easier to persuade
and some may be a little bit harder to
persuade I don't know so but what you
want to do is actually you wanna you
want to build a kick-ass culture that
everyone that sees something jumps on it
and tell the team this is this is really
bad we have to fix it it should be yeah
it's not it's not happening if you're
the only kick and software developer in
your company it's not happening it's not
it's not working you're not going to
kick ass you have to build a kick-ass
culture the whole team master has to be
a kick st and at the beginning I started
this talk with this one here kick ass
you see you get stabbed by a knife
driven over by a car but he stood up
again and you have to stay up also
you're not changing things if you're
sitting all day long behind your screen
typing in maybe writing an email to
create a we have to do da ting I heard
that at a talk at the jack alone please
let us do that no you have to stay up
you have to you have to actually get out
of your comfort zone in order to be more
awesome if you want to be awesome you
have to step out of your comfort zone so
atlassian we have different teams and
I'm finished in a sec
different teams with different names
every team can pick randomly a name so
we have the a-team the Black team the
Muppet team and of course we also have a
kick-ass team and they have this post at
the wall and it says did you kick s
today so every time they leave the the
office in the evening they see that and
they ask themselves the questions did we
kick ass today and I want you also to
ask yourself the question when you go
home every evening did I kick ass today
thank
okay 10 minutes right I want to Mike so
I'm gonna give you this you're gonna
help me ah okay you're gonna kick ass
I'm trying robots oh come here hover a
bit cool cool okay so I promise you guys
demos oh and there there's all the
countries I'm traveling to if you have
any buddies in any of those countries
let them know I'm going to be zooming
through my motorcycle and they should
come to the local jug of that all the
pages are posted alright so let's some
kick some ass with them like I do so I
go Duke is built using the ev3
mindstorms and on the back he has old
cpu it's actually an ARM processor and
this is powerful enough to run the full
java SE embedded so the same basically
the same code that was wearing the
raspberry pi earlier but this time it's
on a lego using let host libraries for
sensors so we have wheels we have an ir
sensor appropriately positioned in his
buttocks we have a gyro inside of him
and of course a nice lego shell sell a
lego do items back on this day yeah
that's back and then you're going to
press the button in his hands I don't
know yeah yeah go alright so hey Michael
you see that computer in front of you
the the mac pot down below in front no
not that one the other one yes the one
you're pointing to press return on the
keyboard because i think i forgot to run
the app program you're you're so close
to starting to finishing several times
that i rebooted the program several
times is it like spamming random stuff
now yeah okay try again come on we only
want to win my kick-ass with let go Duke
come on
now just click ok now you want to stand
them up quickly and rock just like a
bomb okay now he's running a little
segue algorithm so as he the gyroscope
tells him he's like tipping forward or
tipping back he's going to try to
compensate you got you guys used segways
at laughs um to get around to get across
that dangerous street now okay and we
will I are remote here let's see if we
can give Duke some commands now for
folks trying this at home I would HIGHLY
distress on tables especially the ones
made out of like ghosts but we'll we'll
see this is the the most flat surface
okay so you can turn and you can go
forward not too fast yeah okay you went
a little forward a little too far
forward and you can turn to the right ah
ok so just a quick example of what you
can do with Legos and Java range
recommend Lego devices running a full
JVM and you know the new Java 8 release
which were celebrating the launch of so
thank you and enjoy the break if you
want to play with Lego do come up during
the break and you can try them out
great what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
