of javelins how was the roller coaster
and festivities yesterday good make make
some noise for the live stream alright
so we have day two of night hacking and
we have a special guest we have heinz co
boots and Max kibitz who also you guys
are going to be the keynote shortly as
well but we figured we would do to our
first interview non-technical because
it's way too early to be hacking in the
morning so I heard about this this
conference you you guys have been
running on the island of Crete which it
seems very unusual for a technology
event so tell me a little bit more about
Jake Reed well it's a very unusual place
to be living if you're a technology
person and we've lived there now for
almost eight years and it's absolutely
stunning and we thought we wanted to
share this with other people in the
driver community so what we we started
this 2011 i think was it 2011 and just
invited a bunch of guys it's a it's a
conference which is it's an unconference
it's a lot of conference it's the
opposite of a conference yeah so we
actually don't know up front what we're
going to speak about so now now call for
papers for Jeffrey ok local for papers
no worrying about the program what we're
going to do do you get a bunch of
premium sponsors for jquery we have no
sponsors not one we have unsponsored
switch don't send us money and we don't
mention their name on sponsors and the
rented and also don't spend 10 speakers
as well so very good to do and actually
it's really nice with a lot of lot of
Java champions coming to this and we go
on some cool excursions ok so I assume
it's well if there's some technology
related to this so how do you how do you
structure the technology and the fun ok
at Jake Reed so to me a conference is a
vacation ok I think where are the theme
parks that's appropriate because yeah I
mean theme park
backe when I heard about the theme park
i said i want to go to this and you know
for me the best part of the conference
are speaking with people so what we do
is in the morning we have our sessions
yeah from nine o'clock till half-past
twelve then we have lunch and we go and
do cool things sounds like a good plan
mm-hmm so we'll go and cliff jump and go
to different beaches sightseeing so it's
yeah lots of fun I've never done cliff
jumping but that sounds dangerous well i
will show you picture at the end of what
can happen ok yeah whatever like one of
the fatalities of Jake Reed fortunately
not a fraternity but it's a it's not
without risk okay we have a lot of fun
it's and its really nice to mix the the
technical and the fun because we
actually have some really good
discussions sitting out in the beach you
know on the beach or out in the sea you
see these in an art in the sea you see
these heads sort of in a circle talking
about garbage collectors and why we
still need to have incremental GC and on
and it's it's it blames us off to really
deep discussions we got some really good
comments from people who've come Peter
Lorre mentioned that he learned more
from our conference at all conference
then he did it at another seven combined
he waited idea he's coming back with a
whole bunch of his fellow program yeah
actually we missed we miss peed on the
on the live stream here because he had
some issues with his visa but maybe we
will no no he wasn't able to make it
that's a shame but I heard that we might
have a chance to do some night hacking
interviews it or make it a great city so
maybe this will be a chance to catch
Pete on a live stream well the real fun
part about doing the night taking videos
is going to be getting the internet
working but one plan is for me to bring
along a satellite dish and hook you up
there but we will figure something out
very good okay so I think we need to
show people yeah I think so what Jake
Reed is like so what would we do is my
son and I Max and I we go exploring and
looking for the cool places to take you
to so this is a preview of way we're
going to go
well except that they won't be any
clouds so let's make blue skies pristine
beaches and and also what what we're
going to do is we're going to sneak up
in the morning at seven o'clock golf so
you know that the beaches in San
Francisco never look like that they have
rocky shore value water this is a
special one this is very nice there it's
in a good so you you know you can swim
out and it'll be nice and warm the water
in place it's just awesome absolutely
awesome um that's a non technical aspect
of it now by the way there no conference
fees you don't pay for the conference oh
that's a very good price I think I think
most people can manage not paying for a
comfort well you know it's tough to get
there so you still have to pay your
flight to communicate it to pay your
accommodation so on with but it but
there's no there's no actual conference
fees this is what we do on the actually
here we're planning our excursions that
we're doing right yeah exactly on the
Left we've got jaan co-star us who's the
is one of the dis organizers and the guy
was the black shirt that's Dmitri he's
also he's the main dis organizer and he
dis organizes all the sessions and here
we having a discussion it looks like mr.
Pepperdine let's cook up a time yeah so
good discussion this is actually the
first day we were just getting ready to
to decide what we're going to do you can
see also we keep the number slow it's
not that I see a lot of shorts tear that
looks very visual short hair it's very
casual t-shirt shorts nice what we do is
we as I said we keep this number small
so that we can have more discussions
there are closed discussions this year
we actually are full but if you if
people want to come please go to website
jake reed organ register and you'll get
the first invite for next year call so
it's basically we don't exclude anybody
said other words what you're telling me
is you've not yet sold out 2015 that's
right
for 2014 we've basically got we over
subscribe our about fifty percent yeah
they're more sixty seventy percent we
oversubscribed so now we have to tell
them how terrible it is so that people
will know my to come and they will be
better right now so on the first day
what we do is we we use the the open
spaces conference approach where we
write on different ideas mhm and here we
are busy sorting out what we actually
going to do let's day one the first the
first hour and then we go and often what
happens as we sort of combined sessions
we see that a lot of people to talk
about lambdas want to talk about you
know performance tuning whatever them
nice thing is we have a lot of a lot of
experts coming to this conference so you
can really get some good information
they discuss some discussions that's
undress on me right yeah he took Peter
Lorre sitting there actually quite a few
don't champions in and see Ricard my
chest what's his name is very critical
anything that's a great that's the equal
Richard no no no no the other guy and
this is embarrassing go from the Java
 and Carl Carl Carl Hawkwind mitza
token our other time I was going to eat
me up after getting a nice a nice ride
in his own much of a call electric car
so sorry call I do know who you are I'm
blushing or not she's a person but yeah
it's there come from all over the world
you know 25 countries normally so wrong
about the dice em come to Crete this is
probably the most international group
that Creek gets for you know you'll be
surprised the way we do it this year in
the place called the Orthodox car
Academy of creature yeah and the author
Excalibur of Crete is actually hosts a
lot of international groups like this
now a lot of young they have a lot yeah
they've done over a thousand of those in
the last 30 years or so 50 40 years so
it's actually quite a popular
destination for this type of thing well
is some more highest talking about Java
and discussing things yeah a lot of
informal gatherings groups and of course
the you know cretin party dance this is
a family friendly event as well yeah
absolutely absolutely you can see lots
of kids coming Wives coming along that's
actually our house there yeah nice
background I've heard your house has the
best internet in the whole island it's
it's actually more reliable than the
American base the American base is a
single fiber optic cable going in there
and there Barry it's about 10
centimeters under under the ground yeah
all they need is one form of the tractor
and they are they're out yeah they got
rid of all of their satellite dishes and
everything so yeah you probably right
and this is our this is the group you
can see money confront thee with his
broken leg funny it wasn't very same
anak it was your story behind this yeah
no yeah he's a rock climber or something
and he was hopping along like a goats on
the rocks and he stepped sku and he
snapped his foot oh and then my dad and
