about how to get a started with Oracle
Java ME embedded 3.3 on the Kyle ball my
name is Angelica Cera anomic Java
evangelist at Oracle what I want to show
you in this particular tutorial is to
take you step by step of how you can
have Java ME embedded running on your
cow board and everything about
configuration of the software the hard
work how we're gonna test that how we
gonna be able to connect to the common
line and login interfaces and of course
how you're gonna get started with this
first Java ME embedded application so
we're gonna see everything about
installing updating or even uninstalling
your application so let's get it started
so first what we're gonna do is we're
gonna talk about software what do you
need to install on your machine what do
you need to configure everything then we
move into hardware what do we need to do
how we connecting people and then
finally making sure everything work
together so we do some testing about
being able to talk to the board and
making sure everything got installed
properly then we visit tools so in this
particular tutorial we're gonna be using
NetBeans so we're gonna see how in
nettings you can create your embedded
application how you can actually run it
on an emulator and how you can actually
even debug your application it's a cool
stuff and then finally using the tool
we're gonna be creating your first
application deploying it and making sure
everything is working properly okay so
let's get it started with the software
what we're gonna need is we're gonna
need mdk-arm light development kit
either version 4.5 4 or 4.6 this is
actually required because Java ME
embedded will use it to be able to
actually flash the binaries into the
board so we will see how it works later
so make sure you have it we're gonna be
using
terminal emulator program for the
purpose of these screencasts we're gonna
use party and the idea of terminal
emulator is because we're actually going
to connect to two different sockets on
the board we're gonna be using one for
the common line interface and another
one and to actually have access to the
login and actually also the system
output that the vault is going to
provide us with of course we need Java
ME embedded we're also gonna need Java
ME SDK 3.3 and this is really cool
because we will actually have emulators
that come with this SDK and allows she
run the application on an emulator so
even before we download and install into
the board we can actually run it on my
desktop for the purpose of this
screencast we're going to be using
netbeans ide 7.3 and we do need a plugin
so it's gonna be the Oracle Java ME SDK
3.3 again everything will be shown in a
few minutes for the installation of the
mdk-arm Lite development kit there's
nothing really important important that
you need to be aware of just follow the
instructions of the installations I do
want to emphasize that at the end of the
installation you will actually have the
option to install the driver for that
you link so the you link is gonna be a
hard debugger it's gonna be it's gonna
be used by us so we can actually debug
the application on the board so we do
need the drivers for that so make sure
you select does you install the drivers
as long as along with the installation
process otherwise it would just not
attack the you link and you have to
install the drivers later on so just
make sure you do select the drivers
installation install in putty
again it's extremely simple you'd
actually download directly the emulator
executable so there's no such thing as
an installation that just just download
and run it and
security and remember we're going to be
using it running it twice at least one
foot to come online interface in the
second for logging an output system
output ok now let's install the Oracle
Java ME embedded r-tx software
distribution version 3.3 on your board
so the first thing that we need to do is
we actually need to prepare the micro SD
card so let's see how we do that
ok so let's insert the micro SD card I'm
gonna open it now what it's gonna happen
is we need to format that cop dad as the
car so we're gonna format make sure you
select five five thirty to unselect the
quick format and just do it yes okay
now go to the directory where you and
sip the Java ME embedded for Cal port
and this is the structure that you will
have you're gonna have a wonderful
turret air is called SD car one flash
and the drivers so if you go to the SD
card these are the files that we need to
copy to my sd card there are few files
that you need to configure on the soul
let me select these and copy those into
the card okay now what do we need to
configure so one thing is the platform
so let me open for editing that file and
for the platform there are a few things
that you need to know so you need to
decide if the network will you are
connecting your device it's gonna have
either is gonna be using either DHCP or
if you're gonna be using a static IP
address so you need to select which one
in my case I'm just going to be using a
static IP
so let me comment out the DHCP and
uncomment the static IP address ok the
address that I'm gonna be using is
10.0.0.0 star I'm gonna be using would
be 255 255 points 250 / 5.0 and the
Gateway tempo in 0.0 0.2 54 ok another
thing that is good to double check em is
the MAC address so if you're connecting
more than one board on the same network
just make sure they don't you don't have
like the same MAC addresses okay you
don't have any admin any conflicts
another thing that you should check is
SIL what is the watch dog
make sure it's false but the watch dogs
is actually doing the register will
reset the system if anything if any
programs appear to be stuck the problem
is it might conflict with the debugging
when you are on that beam so just make
sure you disable unless you really
really need it ok make sure we save it
and close the second fault that you
actually need to modify is the RTC in
this one you will enter your information
about the date and time that you want
the system to have ok once you have it
just make sure you save us and actually
remove the UDP so we want it to be
called RTC the configuration file ok and
just save it ok now if you got to Java
if you want to do on device debugging
there is also file that you need to
modify so let's go to the Java directory
and open these jwc properties here we're
gonna look for ODT so this is one
property that is gonna be on device
debugging so if you need to
do on-device debugging make sure you
turn it to true otherwise just leave it
to false okay so now that you actually
put the files on your SD card we are
able to eject and continue with some
installation before we move to the
hardware
you
okay so let's say what else we need
so let's look into the hardware list so
we need of course a desktop computer we
need to be running Windows XP or later
and we do require two USB ports we have
the Cal port of course we have the
hardwood debugger we're gonna be using
the you link ma we do require my micro
SD card remember we just configure so
it's actually ready to go and finally we
need a networking LAN cable so how does
everything gets together so let's see
how we should connect everything
okay so we finished configuring all the
software in the computer now let's move
to the hardware side so of course we're
gonna use the world we're gonna have
also are you link ME and this actually
allows to debug the code from my
computer we actually have the micro SD
card the one we just configured we have
two USB cables and we have one Ethernet
cable so let's start putting things
together the first one we need the you
link ami this loop allows to do the
debug in okay very good then we need the
micro SD card make sure it goes all the
way in then we take the USB cable so the
first one will allow us to power the
board so we have a few USB slots here so
you can use either of them
okay the first one now the second one
goes to the you link and me and will be
also connected to your desktop
okay and finally we have the ethernet
cable very good
okay now the last thing we need to do if
you see you pay attention to a couple of
jumpers that we have on the board we
have this one that is label be a t3 v3
when if actually to move that jumper to
the BA T so let me take it remove it so
let's make sure for flashing the board
we do need to move that jumper okay
you
okay now we need to flush the board so
if we come here to the director where
you unzip the content of the Java ME
embedded you're gonna see it flash
directory we go in there and we have the
flash file we actually need to 35 that
it has the correct path so let me open
it for editing and we can see here that
is pointing to UV for you before exe to
make sure that yes and see we have UV
for and down here we should have you
before executable okay so we're good to
go
so let me go back to my directory let's
plug the two USBs to your computer okay
one and two and then execute double
click the flash file okay now what is
going to happen is the you vision for is
actually executed and we're gonna see
here some information about the flashing
process okay once the process finished
automatically everything is actually
closed so now let's go back to the board
and see what happened
okay so we reboot by pressing the reset
button we can actually see that all the
initialization process was fine
initializing the time the filesystem the
network and it has our IP address that
we said the netmask everything we can
see it in red they say starting Java and
me embedded Java 3.3 and it seems that
everything was ok so let's just start
creating some programs and use NetBeans
to debug and deploy the application to
the device so let's go back to the
computer
okay now it's time to test everything so
let's connect to the board and see if
everything is still correct what we're
going to do is to open party so as you
remember we installed party at the
beginning of the software configuration
here what we need to do is we need to
connect to the host name in this case
it's going to be the board in our case
for this webcast we use the IP address
number 10.0.0.0 and we need to use the
pour 65,000 before any reason you forget
about this particular port you can
actually check on the board screen and
you will actually see this display one
of the lines actually in this screen
will tell you about the login port that
was open in this case you can see how
it's initializing login and it's
actually gonna use TCP on pour 65,000 so
if for any chance for anything for any
reason you forget about the poor you can
always check your screen and then you
have the information you need okay and
also you need to make sure that if for
the connection type you select rogue
make sure you don't forget about this it
actually happened to me a couple of
times what's gonna happen is just just
going to see just just an empty screen
and never able to connect so once you
have it all the details enter you can
actually open the first screen going to
see is actually the login and standard
output console okay let's go back and
let's open a second one a second console
let me print party again and again we're
going to connect to the our machine okay
and in this case we need to connect
65,000 and - okay again it's a royal
connection and for this time we're
trying to connect to the common line
interface
we can actually use their AMS to
actually even have information about the
inlet that you have installed so what is
what is really the set of comments that
you can use over here in this command
line so here is just an example of the
comments that you can actually use so
for example you can install a particular
inlet you can list the inlet that you
have previously installed you can update
remove you know a bunch of things run a
stop etcetera and I think that the key
one is the help one so to make sure that
you got the latest list of available
comments you can always tap type help
and this will provide it with the most
updated version so let's try to do a
list of what we currently have because
we just flashed the board we're not
gonna have anything but just to make
sure that you are able to communicate
with the AMS in your system okay so if
we - ma AZ list it will actually tell
tell us that nothing is really being
installed yet so what we're gonna do
next is finally we're going to create
our first application install it and be
able to run it using this command line
interface or actually using NetBeans for
that - okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
