2 in Tallinn Estonia and we are at the
zero turnarounds headquarters having a
an evening meet up and we got Anton
hello okay who is what what we're
dealing Jin of a player will product
manager yeah but also hacker yeah we can
tell you can say something yeah we could
say so maybe maybe some of the guys we
have real hackers here actually if he's
got other real hackers okay and we're
going to we're going to do some real
hacking so earlier we were chatting with
JK and he got a question about whether
you can use javafx Jerry will javafx so
we're actually going to try and see if
we can get it working yeah and we have
all the necessary ammunition here we
have we have hackers and laptops and
pizza pizza we can have beer as well as
you need yeah a little bit later when we
get stuck will pull out the beer okay so
let me explain how this works you can
see the live stream or check out the
recordings on night hacking calm it's
all broadcast live we have a chat window
open here so we can see all the folks
who are joining us for the live stream
so high Matthias hi Jim thanks for
joining us if you're a lurker out there
without actually logging into to ustream
log in so you can see who you are ends
for folks in the room here Anton I are
miked up but you're not so this
microphone will let you chat with focus
on the street
let us now on all right you all so hard
hello I'm are now working on Terra but
removing mostly so now I'm trying to
hack through the effects part of thing
going to get it working already I mean
haven't succeeded it yeah well we'll
figure it out we're gonna get working
for a bit hello and my honest I'm mostly
working on IntelliJ they're terrible
plugin oh alright i'll leave the i'm
gonna leave the bike out here if you
guys want to use it it is now unmuted
alright so what's the what's the plan
here at home what are we doing okay the
show gosh i share your desktop yeah so
the plan is to the idea is to get some
java effects working with Jerry ball or
vice versa actually get terrible working
wait ok it's working but we should
should show it to the folks and how it's
working there are definitely some
cavities I think I did sure slice of
pizza ok and down so we could start from
very simple sample get it running a
touch terrible to that one and see if it
updates if we actually do some changes
mmm for for the application for the
sample application I picked one from the
ensemble Sam plop and that's how it's
called a pc so it's go down
tabs example whatever it is so i just
copied the sample code into my ID and
started the application so here i have
it running now nothing special and mmm
now we could try adding a new tab for
instance but before doing that we
actually could yeah let's write like
this just add a new tab call it tap five
and give it a title also top five and
add it to main panel I guess I know
nothing about javafx I'm just I just
don't know what I'm doing and I just
presume it's right ok and this time i
will just start with a terrible we just
have a new release today so it's it's
hot and we have a new tab here yeah so I
was doing the right thing it's brought
it's probably hard to get it wrong now
we could do the same experiment that was
a really something well that's okay it's
a video to the tabs where content I
think okay let's maybe add a label or
what yeah label we have six options of
that give a that work yeah hey mom
test go and you label something sure and
tap five
at now get a like a consult your
children well then I get content and now
something should be something else it is
rude or Larissa you might be it might be
cancer yeah that's a nerd so second all
right so we should see a new label on on
the fifth tab right here after we
recompile it actually okay and something
has to rewrite this UI or this screen
try killjoy try switching curves so
they'd be the code that we wrote is in
init method and probably the init method
is called only once during the lifetime
but works before when you add in detail
no I restarted the application that
wasn't difference Oh with restarting the
application everybody can get it right
what do you mean something is called
method um if if this new code was added
in in this new in the same method which
was run only once and it never runs
again then it cannot be added you know
on the time okay so maybe we could do is
when it switches tabs does it really
fresh something well it's the way javafx
works is it uses a static scene graph so
it's
it keeps the state of all the elements
in the scene graph it's not like swing
which does immediate mode where it calls
the paint method and rear enders each
cycle so your med that gets called
repeatedly but what we could do is we
could add some sort of event handler
when you switch tabs to the main theme a
scene yeah well no other tabs themselves
Oh what we have to have but what if I oh
that's that's too fine grain to see far
then we add a new tab we should add a
new listener what if we just add a
listener to how we know can receive
events if something changes but you can
but like in other words you you want
something which is going to a dullness
to the scene graph yeah so you need you
need some sort of like like reload
button maybe that will recall in it and
set up the stage from scratch right okay
maybe we could okay the idea was to add
the listener to your tab right yeah so
for example here like let's say we
change this was its tenth step 5 or what
is that for now let's just change this
to a button almost call it reload
oh it's option enter option in first
class and then on the button we can add
a set on action event and back
option and then
a lawyer
no that's not right oh I know this it's
a it's a genericized action yeah this is
horrible i've been using I can do I've
been using netbeans too long I forgot my
intelligent on it ah the United Easter k
is the same aunt engine no no but I mean
for the other theater that one's easy
look the other ones felt quite weird the
same ah and then on this one have it
recursively called up the leather you
need method for for the whole tree of
yeah so we will reinitialize the whole
scene when you call me with mmm so we
should get like something this kit I
just just call the method wherein just
come on it Hey okay yeah but it should
probably clean clean this year yeah well
we'll make sure that we push the
contents of the same graph and then
reinitialized it what's called okay
that's sleepy while even throw an
exception for this method yeah maybe
maybe oh that's strange
that's different in it that's why
something else should be this one oh
actually this this is not a good method
to call again hold on science they they
how they pass announces fine they pass
in the primary stage for some reason
that's cute okay let's pass it again and
then make it up make it a I final okay
let's see if it works we probably have
to restart application now well I mean
good thing we need to do is make sure we
actually flush things out because well
yeah yeah so go a little bit to where
its first 10 ok so it relates your new
route and sets grids and you seen not
such that's fun yeah ok right and at gym
Weaver's request he's asking us on chat
to show an example of builders so if we
get this working or refactor the code to
use builders because that procedural
code so we have a reload button here
let's try it sets to 0 hahaha what we
get that's pretty good library Apple
maybe well
let's not do that okay interesting
nullpointerexception maybe recourse
recursive stuff is not very good for it
but it shouldn't bother it yeah I don't
let me let me try without cheerful
actually just some of the bugs suck are
actually revealed with terrible in
normal condition they don't arise but
then we add you're able to it and find
box in JVM yeah it's not k it's
right so let's do this instead because
this was kind of well we were just doing
it because that's how the code is
written but it's not really the best way
of doing it see how this is creating a
scene and then attaching the route to it
I think what we really want to do is
like like take this guy out
here and then have this guy new primer
stage set seeing you seen really gently
truth as well yeah well set aside member
fields
okay so now we have a root I think
that's something different
Oh actually no we can't do this that
would that would be bad because it gets
initialized outside that's going to get
initialized on the wrong through it but
anyway now we don't need to pass the
stage anymore
come
camel case highlighting great stuff
okay so this will initialize the stage
with our new route and what I'm thinking
is instead of replacing the whole scene
we'll just replace the roots contest but
to do that we actually need to
initialize root here because we're just
going to change the children of route
since that's a variable so give her that
why is this complaining and it clashes
with in it okay all right she's at
cantos it's just uh
get children has protected access and
parents okay so we'll just change the
type to a group instead of a parent and
I'll get rid of that our unhandled
exception because its scenic this should
be sick content ok so now when this gets
called or does it use root now this is
adding a new elements so instead of
doing adding we want to do set Wow set
all it's that way it will replace it all
right ok show
let's see if it crashes now to know so
you basically reinitialize the whole
application yeah it really ideally we'd
have like root beer outside the pain or
it'll be menu item or key binding or
something so you could force a reload
but I mean we were already adding
something a tad five so this adds
updates have five now we should be able
to like read it at using J rebel instead
and this time we'll make a code change
to like to have one hit reload and see
if that shows up ok and ok let's start
with terrible and the application now
and let's add a new tab it will be
chopped 0 this time
tab 0 and we will add it into our stuff
ok so just we compile it now and 55
chivalry world yeah voila so currently
what we need are we did manual reload
but it's it's not the idea which Jericho
actually brings it should be automatic
because currently we've basically
created a special plugin that you know
cause the the class which is reloaded by
general okay to be reloaded by jaribu
but it didn't realize the whole
application so what I think I think to
to do what to do the automatic reload
type behavior that you want to get from
Jay rebel you the problem is that javafx
keeps the scene graph like a static
version of the scene graph in memory and
so making changes to the program you
can't simply rerun code to update the
scene graph right if it's a small
application and doesn't go into database
for picking up configurations during its
initialization then it will be fast but
if you have like a big application which
does lot on the stereo you know it will
be like the whole yeah it is this is
what we just a polluted yeah there are
there are no current options depending
like if currently javafx is a tool kit
right there it's not really a framework
within frameworks usually like I have a
life cycle and what we do with terrible
is that we try to rerun some parts of
the life cycle to construct the
application
again for instance there are different
ways to actually do like you can do it
in different levels and the first one is
to you know really integrated the
framework and make this framework to
reinitialize the application or itself
but we also can implement a special
plugin especially for this application
which could actually look almost like
like the code we have written here the
would probably be a bit more generic
than this one so that from from the
window we could get the root and
reinitialize everything and the third
third hackish way for this small thing
is probably to add a special callback
method to the class which is public
public static rebel we load method oh it
should be void of course and this is
kind of a call back from terrible when
when the class is reloaded by terrible
this mega Cola will be magic yeah and
they did have to do your own figure it
out if you can call this in it from here
then you know this is the only thing you
have to do basically what we could do
from our site for swing your desktop
applications we could actually
instrument all the components with this
kind of method and you know
automatically without you having to
write it and then reinitialize with this
this is just an ibn we haven't actually
tried it
yeah we can we can try if it will work
actually and such let's see start again
what is the event which is five here can
you grab the mic yeah yeah it's on I
like I just want to add an event
listener which is triggered when I open
one of the tabs but i am not familiar
with a given system effects also when
you you want the events when the tab is
initially opened or perhaps every time
one of the ocean one of the ways you can
achieve reloading believer is that every
time you open a tab it is initialized
it's slower than whispered as relevant
for development it's enough yeah or any
event that is happening on this window
then then you can actually make the
Chase who go to that tab and will be
there the changes yeah me I mean part of
the part of the problem is like a lot of
applications are written in java effects
are written in a way work you construct
the UI so you have some code which you
know sets up the tabs and sets up the
scene graph and it's never ever called
again and it's actually the code is the
code is designed so it can't be called
again like in this case we changed wheat
we had to change this line here it was
previously add and that something wasn't
set all so simply calling the method
again over and over again would actually
it would cause your UI to grow grow new
on order pains so it's you need that you
need whatever methods you're going to
call to be kind of reentrant where there
you can call them repeat of times I
think a case where it would just kind of
magically work you do clear and then do
the other one it's in there Oh terrible
buttons work
we monitor the configuration parts and
when 105 changes just really invoke the
initialization logic princess credit
industry Indian context yeah but my
point is that for you I stuff you can't
just call the same methods again which
we use the Creator you are the first
time what if I am let's do it start I
just wanted to see if it when it three
loads will it print something something
from the callback method oh yeah yeah so
actually execute were limited yes so
this is one of like the hooks that we
provide for the users and actually some
of the users are are using this method
but more convenient way would be if you
have a framework your you know custom
one to implement the plug-in for torture
a bow and we have this decay for that oh
maybe not really SDK but API and for
this API we actually have a small
tutorial also on the website software
shareable let's see if I can find it
because we have a new website and I
don't know anything about it it's just
so crazy to find something on the new
page when you have technical dogs I
think we have it somewhere plugins
yeah I it's easier to google for it we
will most more about your own website
than you do yeah
I think it was called the what how and
why about jello plugins so
yeah so basically the small tutorial is
a swing application it's a single window
one and in here when it works when we
try to reload stuff actually the retains
method is called and that is what
triggers the reinitialize ation of the
logic behind you know positioning of
those flags so here change the flag
position then repaint will ya yeah I
mean I think that so that's an example
of like immediate mode rendering and
because it recalculates stuff on each
cycle you can you can more easily do
that sort of stuff it's not keeping
state but I I thought of another example
we should try so one way people build a
lot of you is is with FX ml f XML is a
declarative XML markup for describing
the UI and that's that kind of gives you
a convenient entry point for reloading
the whole easy why is it something like
was created for flex as well we have
like yeah like the bechamel for flies
okay it's similar so what you could do
is there's a we couldn't we can do it
can you can you um grab seen builder
there's a there should be a download for
seeing builder if you if you google it
quickly oh and what we'll do is we'll
will hack a quick F XML application and
then we can have J rebel reload the f
xml ah so this one all right we should
get your leg doctor um well which java
effects first me really well java
version 1 dot 706 i think i think you
can use either either should work so
seen bill do is a user interface tool
for quickly building user interfaces and
it will generate an F XML file that
describes the user interface so it would
be cool to see if we could get jay rebel
to refresh the UI whenever you may have
changed here seen builder file oh that's
I think that's impossible what is this
file actually compiled into java
bytecode but it's it's loaded from java
bytecodes so you have an XML file here
okay your feet java file which calls
load on the xml file here so essentially
what you want is whenever you touch the
xml file then you call a method in your
java okay well the most brutal approach
would be you know just to reload reload
the configuration all the time whenever
you access the application this is the
happy path information when you reload
the cuadrilla were conferred like if you
have a xml file is basically
configuration right this generation for
the layout and for web frameworks what
we do the very first integration is
usually just brutally monitor for the
configuration every time you access the
application you reload everything and
then we sort of start to optimize if you
if you really change this file this is
the first thing if you really have to
reload the everything in the application
if just single you know element change
it can be can you actually find unity so
for big applications we do some
performance optimization we don't know
every load the most social for instance
for spring creatures
no some parts of it and but for small
applications we usually just you know
yeah so we can reload all that little
bit okay I have a scene builder I think
I should install it first actually yeah
you can just run it out of the dmg yeah
there's oh ok
oops patient yeah okay so seen builders
actually a tool ridden in javafx so it's
a javafx app and it generates user
interfaces and if it's really like all
the controls are on the left side here
and you can edit properties on the right
but like we can just do with Dana
Griffin does it actually assign to you
on meds you can expand yeah that's cool
and let's do something let's scroll down
all there for some controls yeah buttons
checkboxes button that's a huge budget
okay I really like this and with the
slow food makes a move or yep exel oh
let's see so we have a great we have a
button if we save this let's say I'm
desktop example
safe and also it's a single file that
that it basically saves or is it a
project a single file okay how can I get
rid of this one go to your ensemble I'm
trying to close this window
oops let's put on
alright so the pier is the effects xml
or FX mo
and let's see if we can open it I don't
know in maybe IntelliJ
okay so we have nice xml file we don't
really have a schema yeah they're
actually isn't a schema because it's
defined by code what you can what you
can put in the XML is defined by code
these are class names and get some
properties so it's some reason oh there
is a class scheme actually that's just
for some of the extension okay just so
it's a dummy namespace for FX colon ID
and some of those special blade space
taxis okay what what now what should we
do oh yeah we have okay so go go back to
like a javafx off yeah and what dish no
that's not the right one no see not
single to go to code down the code
ok so we're worth the so basically let's
let's start a new project or you want to
use this project and just we can create
the new file I'm going to do file name
too so if we need the same basic
application structure extent application
application the javafx more yep yep the
main method to that calls launch
ok and now in the start method we're
going to use was it FX load FX utils
what is it like suite 220 loader fix my
back that put someone else in a letter
top and then we probably want to use the
one which has to do a URL resourcebundle
filter factory you just eat oh yeah we
want to use them with the URL and we'll
get it off the classpath and just put
the xml file in a relative path ya know
we just create the new on you
hmm
and we just closed
at 6 ml all right okay and this is a
code relative path so I'm the prison
that should be correct okay according to
what you can okay now this will give us
a some sort of note back Sean the focus
you know and if you do the same thing as
before so we create a stage set C and
you seen and I think it once a parent
yeah what's a parent I think actually
this is a parent I'm pretty sure as a
parent so you just make it apparent and
then stage set show let's try try that
sea levels okay
alright alright so we've got your app up
now here's here's what I want here's
what I wanted to do so ideally when you
change your XML file it should reload
the layout oil okay so can we go Mick
Jagger will do that okay Jerry will help
us do that I think I think I think you
can get around without durable for this
one yeah I mean you have you go Jacob
initialized layout but probably this
this go here or sets it will be
basically the same we need to load this
file again yep and said this scene again
yeah so we could we could do we I mean
this as I did this all in one step but
was it
we could just create a scene Oh actually
seeing can't be create with that up so
create it will create a group called
roots
and then we'll load it in a separate nom
yeah so let's just do here we could do
load see let f xml yeah
and
when it loads it let's make this and
current method sure we r dot
set get children so sin oh ok so now
every time you call that load of XML
method it will load the effects ml fall
from disk and then replace whatever is
on the route yeah so again it's the same
as in previous example you either can
have a button that I want I want
whatever the xml file gets touched okay
so in that case you probably would put
some thread running which checks after
aisle five milliseconds the timestamp of
the file and then if it changes if the
timestamp changes compared to the
previous one you call this movie okay
let's do that let's do it in here
clap
runnable and then basically will do is
to this threat start and in run we will
check for this resource should actually
create a feel for that resource
you are all right and who resource
mmm
phone gets what was how could i check
the timestamp of the file Arnel can you
remember that being a bitchin what was
the method to check the timestamp of the
file I just don't remember check their
egos or nature then yet
you mean Jericho no just enjoy to get
the temple yep yep timestamp you could
do late you can see less great white
last modified yeah that's all right last
yeah you have a gift file which is dream
what that's why I didn't find it
yeah so last modified should be filled
probably
and then
and modified and just check he thinks
he's smarter long and if last modified
is not equal to modified then we do
recall what affects one
okay doesn't look nice place to be done
k okay so I think you're also you to
move the initialization of the source up
you mean go good about this one because
you don't you need unique resource
initialize in your well before you start
your thread so you can move it into the
initialization with variable or that's
funny because I'll semicolon here so
instead of home oh yeah first modified
most money flight should be utilized
actually otherwise for the first time we
will do unnecessary reload well actually
that's fine because that means you don't
actually need to call load yourself you
can get rid of it off you can get rid of
that load effects of alcohol and just
like a thread call the first number
right and then that also initialize you
have to set last modified equals
modified at the end of your chance
exactly
yeah so the idea is like this we do in
some plugins we actually do something
similar and oh you actually have to do
you need to sleep a little bit you know
the other thing is don't you need to
loop around this because the runner like
is called once yeah that's true
Walter
I don't put your slip back on
well
oh that's just
and that's it
see let's see if it works so do you guys
think cuz it's gonna work well no well
for the first time if it works for the
first time we should get some markets as
me Yeah right and that's it doesn't then
we will make on to meet them okay it
doesn't even start actually mmm let's
see what what what is wrong illegal
state except oh yeah so you cannot you
cannot call the that's what love
difficult Vietnam so just wrap this in
applications include application yeah
I'm sure of the class it's javafx top
application application wait now let's
not a platform platform okay
platform run run Lita yeah like that sir
and then um I catch but you can get rid
of this one because that that was the
try-catch from before huh the try at the
top oh yeah it's just ignore this one
hey welcome no dry the party join the
party let's see let's see if it starts
yeah we're gonna run me that once we get
this work wait it's it's running but
it's it's somewhere somewhere I gave the
color I could check where we are I think
it's a graceful dead Walker graceful
that one oh maybe at that FX you tells
not actually
it's an in sleep wait we cure them start
it again we are doing some javafx rebel
effects red bull x show no window option
so don't wake up yeah what's up let's
try let's try something just to get
something going so previously we have
that and that was actually showing a UI
this will get one extra reload but they
might give something visual for feedback
or exception which is almost as good
location oh ok let's go
not that one so this one sorry so this
this can just be loaded here ok and then
it's available to both so we not to
worry about what what it was ended up
lying confirmation
okay all right now that is open now we
need to modify touch the file and see if
it blows up and up okay just put a space
or something well
so no nothing happens well so remember
before it was getting stuck kind of
deadlock the thread was deadlocked we
own we might have a situation where the
threat actually isn't doing well sure
but we could put some output yeah I
think let's comment out this one and we
could you know write something here and
see now that's gonna spam because it's
in the it's in a while loop with a
threat sleep of 100 put it and then
modified if there is modified know or
you can put it above the while loop if
you like it one output okay let's just
do this
let's see
run
so and we are going to change the seed
file okay so see we got we got one and I
bet it's I bet deadlocked summer so
check the threads and see where it is
now if you could just build a new scene
and swap that that's essentially what
we're doing I mean we're swapping the
children of the rear is you should um
since I don't know much of anything with
defects are just reading the
documentation here and as far as I
understand you can do pretty much
whatever you want as long as the sea is
not fly what should speak yeah so only
when you modify stuff which is visible
on screen wanting to do we do the
application threads but we are modifying
what's visible on screen the salt point
I've been jewel that you make a copy of
it off screen and then once yeah yeah
yeah we could you give me alone we can
load the effects Amell file off the red
thread mm-hmm but that was evidence that
will just replace yeah but it actually
shouldn't matter like it might be a
small performance optimization later not
to block the event threat for quite as
long but I don't think it's I don't
think that's the problem or any I think
we're not actually getting any farther
than like I think we're hitting an
exception or something in here maybe
like you're also ignoring so so yeah
maybe should just protect race not a
good practice to not the exception
you
this is finished loading
like a trap right let's see
and start
Oh so finish finish loading let's
totally fine okay touch the file and see
what happens oh but I have two buttons
already somehow when it went over and
the fact that you have to like touch the
file just save something yeah that's all
and see it didn't oh I know it is so
you're you're modifying the file the
source path is looking at the one in the
addictive deployed path yeah I see okay
we can do this someone has a question
jet oh what's the question would use
that what this is worth like a good
question i think it was some marketing
dude so on from marketing team we put
you if a few it's not the first time
someone asks if I maybe if we do a
proper position for this one like
something else done you know now you'll
see two buttons or actually can just
remove this one and change the title
text that will be enough
ah
see if it refreshes seems that rendering
takes so much and my my cpu is just
dying right now might be might be the
desktop Cassandra software's children as
it seems that it says this is the UI
what we do we just set the sleep for
longer let's say for three seconds do
the same thing again and change this
theme like this is the title of the
button and say that button should be
here yeah so which which file are you
modify that this is the source file and
now if we do and go and say compile it
it will be copied to the correct
location and we have a button here okay
got reload exactly so that's why if we
do stuff with cherub oh we do generate
river oaks amount and when it's loading
then we instrument the class loaders so
that it would map the source actually or
the place of the the files were the
director is for the compiled classes are
in our case still the problem problem is
that we are modifying the the file that
is in
in the source code but what we could do
is to you know maybe move this can move
this scene somewhere else and start
modifying it or or we actually could do
this coffeepot and a scepter have that
path before yeah yeah just extend the
clasp off a little bit and let's see if
it works so if you see that it sells
those directories will be monitored and
now if we go and let's see let's see if
it happens life you know like I oh okay
all right we need a we need a drum roll
on the other chat here what's that all
right try it try it and button hello
I tell us more than three seconds yeah
maybe still something else is like this
does javafx come with its own class
loader you you you just did the class
learning right there's no special class
letters I mean that get resource was the
class limit I mean what we did we
probably then attached Nana I think I
think the problem here is um you are
checking this yourself right you're
checking the modified timestamp of this
file so you're not even going to try to
reload from the classpath unless the
modified date this man does Jay rebel
Swizzle modified date no but if I if I
change scene f xml I'm changing the last
modified of the source of a source yeah
and the idea was this is checking the
one in the upper class back yeah but
this output classpath will actually go
to this mapped folder this is where all
the resources are loaded from okay it
actually finds both from the source path
and okay we can you can we can flex fix
that actually we can do that this way
and
it's a bit hackish but you know just
enough fun packages or yeah you know
sure not hide I'll take hide middle yeah
that one okay Sophie we just copied for
right now and we will do modifications
on that one I still it will not work
because it will be twice in the
classpath okay we it's better be out of
the source tree and never get to the
Super Deluxe it should be it should be
somewhere here
alright so and we should
getresource I said it's not a resource
item where you have to deal with it up
file file file new file and gets you get
past it
I'll give you a string I think there's a
gap your eye it should be at well it
should be just knew you're out to URL
right to your right answer now to you
really well that's duplicated did you do
to ride out to your l ll throw the
except ball you might have exceptional
shoe but yeah yeah it's a free and so
now let's try just running it and see if
it if you didn't break anything like
that ok so it just works and wait wait
don't 30 it doesn't it close the
application section yeah I think you
let's see if we can kill some threads
actually one that like you can force
quit it oh do you I freeze will help it
GPS
No
in shape es
doesn't seem to be you know
x 9 and 12 this one so I killed
something looks better alright so yeah
let's see if you have to change applies
and be 0 but we didn't start with
terrible sorry so it's now running with
terrible I suppose it it's actually it
actually loaded the correct scene file
and let's see so something is taking my
cpu time really
oops
let's see if it's
the UI is a bit frozen here
come on come on you can do
so I end it going to be happening is you
keep opening scene builder by double
clicking on the F xml file and that's
probably what's killing you see it keeps
opening this and this is the application
which is frozen oh but actually that
shouldn't happen because it's for
IntelliJ it's just a text file all right
well
let's quit him
it's frozen still still there
um
now please please try out for squid
I have three maps a little bit
oops
oops there you go hold option what
maybe maybe maybe dice I don't know yeah
Claire goes dead
okay now it seems to be alive again
almost but then we have this application
and let's see if it made the right thing
beach ball death
so it's not be salted DVD bitch for them
come on someone watching Danny panic
ignore ignore please please ignore my
god I managed to create the transparent
stage trailer distorted well the close
button eastern frontier well there is a
close of them okay but we should do top
actually yeah she's figure out what what
let's see what's eating up all the CPR
in your machine and kill it because this
is unusable
please
it tries to do something I can see it
No
funny part is that I can move this
window but I cannot type in it
now all the windows are movable is it
impossible to set the primary stage
transparent I try to set it to a
transparent but it still has white
background oh actually no I think I
think you might need to also set the
fill I think just machine filled up the
stage that's why he wasn't transparent
yeah hmm i think i think i should do a
hard restart for but yeah this is this
your computer's toasted okay I i will i
will do shut down
oh now we're back to this video we've
either focus on so what what we have
learned now I don't know we have learned
that you can freeze your machine with
threads yes how many did you create I
did not video audio is cutting out
that's not good when is the video and
audio cutting out Kirk
I
oh that's good right yeah well cared yep
crush cover is that nice how when it
when you're having issues it um reboots
and opens up all the applications which
you had opened before so you can have
the same powerful flagging performance
so if anyone's having trouble with the
live stream since I'm broadcasting at
one megabit per second which you might
want to try is choosing the 240 240
height broadcast you stream down samples
it to a lower bitrate and that might
help you Kirk if it's on your end I'm
not sure what your what your connections
like out there okay what I will try now
is to did you start the desktop return I
go on not I think it actually it started
off yeah you got your back okay I should
actually open up the real project again
there you go all right some reason
showing me that okay so all right rubble
it let's go
now it should be running just fine i
think if we where's the title of the
button I'll go down Down Goes Down and
their texts go yes yeah we have rebeling
all right I got another one open the
file and zine builder it button open
open this this I've seen that affects ml
and seen builder and then make a change
in the visual you I and let's save it
okay I can I can see what's the point
actually we did it oh it was almost the
same experience with volume framework
Jeff Jeff Jeff laxity he gives you a big
thumbs up very good let's see can we
actually open it so that it will not
look lockdown me again you know
and we should open this the correct URL
here that means i can copy pause and
open this and yeah but you should you
should open single door again oh yeah
exactly so before you didn't actually
copy with your Applications folder you
just launched it out of there this yeah
okay so you might why do this time is
rather than running a dmg drag it to
your Applications folder yeah all right
and everyone have their was it's not
right there okay open
I just drag and drop should pick it up
right if you know now that you're in
finder you will be here now yeah exactly
okay it should be what source FX scene
there you go now we are going to open
this little right here and start a time
maybe just that a new button here maybe
some I didn't know the text area awesome
save here we have it is so basically for
these kind of things if you want to
speed up your work you just have to
design your application in the proper
way and jerebo can help you here if you
really want to change something in the
code you know listeners if you have your
own business some behavior if you attach
something to this one and and then Joey
will reload it for you so I think you
need a be a rebel attacks ripple effects
that all it could be a good product
extra package package up the hacks and a
nice little bundle I really like it
rubber laughs wherever
grunts and all ever that's horrible hex
okay yes yeah yeah so effects to school
I think I like it oh alright we got a
quote Anton likes FX yes they're going
to be the UI designers ready sit tweet
tweet ready said tweet alright so i
think i think that deserves a sermon
that deserves some beer now or something
like that or or something we we had a
successful hacking session and this is a
good chance for anybody who's watching
on the stream to ask questions for Anton
yep so shoot you or shoot shoot the
insightful challenging hard questions
this way and thanks for those folks who
hung in here for this fun little hacking
session so Jim Jim Weaver was in here
the whole time Matthias Kirk survived
for most of it but then he he seemed
very angry about the connection the
connection where does he live he was out
done I think you k no no he's oak red
hungry I honestly didn't know
III should know this he gave me he gave
me some money from his home country
before I tried it for euros I think I
think it was the application threat but
that was actually hanging my computer
somehow we managed to create too many of
them because now I had this application
running today for some time I was
hanging again so it was it wasn't the
fit seeing dildar it was your apple app
so be careful with red alright cool so
that we've proven that you can use
terrible for doing javafx development
with some creative packs yep yep alright
so Oh actually I forgot to give JK his
but you guys you guys get um stickers II
for being on the live stream for
suffering the embarrassment of here your
co-workers and friends and family eating
beets on the who would be pushing I am a
knight Tucker I was almost reading it
I'm a nightmare you you might be a
nightmare what would you so close
no it's just need a map to its it works
on PCs to it's been tested all right
yeah so Jim confirmed hungry because
we're Curtis alright so thanks for being
on the street and check out the next
stream is going to be monday we're going
to be at baden headquarters in turku
maybe i'll have some good footage from
snowmobiling over the weekends and we're
doing interviews with Martin Martin
verburg JCP expert group member yonas
dr. yonas it's going to share something
you've on and 7 features and we also
have somebody from life right so we got
a full house on Monday and we would be
the last destination before Jay fell to
60 yeah that's the last destination and
then I take in a lot of both to Jay
focus and then the um we have lots of
cool folks at j focus like bank at holly
cummins pines go boots and gnome 10 from
jay frog cool all right so thanks for
joining us for night hacking and have a
good well evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
