wait a moment until people quietened
down just a little I'm Patrick current
chair of the JCP program really glad to
be here and to welcome you to our 15th
anniversary party we were here five
years ago for our tenth tenth
anniversary and we continue to move
ahead excuse me I'm going to use my
cheat sheet here so I don't forget to
mention certain people and so for 15
years the JCP has been working with
corporations individuals nonprofit
organizations Java user groups and so on
to advance and improve the Java platform
and so every few years we like to get
together with all of you guys and
celebrate and say thank you to you
because we would be nothing without you
java would be nothing without you so
we've invited a number of people who
have been influential in Java and the
java community process over the years
and people who've participated in
working with the JCP members of the
executive committee and people generally
have helped us to move forward it all
started 1998 when Sun introduced the JCP
decided that this would need to be a
collaborative process if they try to do
everything by themselves it would not
work would not be successful and over
the years we've made a number of changes
and some of the people responsible for
those changes are here today but
basically the process has been one of us
adjusting to changes in the world the
way that people do development work the
expectations that people have for the
software that they use the development
of open-source processes and open-source
licensing and so on and over the years
of course we produce many many jsr s and
have advanced the three Java platforms
java SE Java ME and Java EE very
significantly so we're still working on
this we're still working on changing
stuff we have a number of GS RS that we
have worked on in the past few years and
continue to work on we call JCP next
collectively and these are all about
increasing transparency increasing
openness and making it easier for people
to participate and not just the big
corporations which is the way it was in
the beginning but regular folks like
most of you in particular a big embrace
for Java user groups and when I say that
let me say thank you to the Silicon
Valley Java user group for agreeing to
co-host this with us would not be as
much fun if you guys went here and
bringing your grassroots influence to
bear so I want to just take a few
moments to to recognize some of the
people who are here or we expect to be
here people who've been influential in
Java and the java community process
darling of course with the grandfather
of it all james gosling thank you James
glad you could be here need no
introduction from me George paolini I'm
not sure is here yet but George was
responsible for defining the JCP in the
very beginning basically for figuring
out how the JCP could be more than just
son saying we need to bring in these
other people even if they are sons
competitors IBM and HP and Oracle and
all of these other folks so George will
be here hopefully a little later Rob
jingle is here I know rob was I guess
responsible for making the step from
just corporations to corporations and
individuals and the open source
community I'm sure that gave you some
gray hairs the way it is still giving me
gray hairs but we're still working on
this and so long as we're working on it
that's good I guess my predecessor where
I think with your successor oh no quite
again they supposed to be rivers doesn't
seem to be here right now but owner was
chair of the JCP for several years and
was responsible for handing it over to
me did so just before the whole Apache
thing came to a head and did not tell me
what he was getting the enter I was
foolish enough not to study it up
beforehand so well I deserve what I get
I want to mention bill Shannon bill is
here somewhere very senior engineer at
Sun and now Oracle and a longtime
supporter of standardization on the JCP
thank you thank you Bill and vineet they
need coop chairs here too tough sales
guy but always used to emphasize the
importance of JCP and standards and so
on we also have several former members
of the PMO the PMO is the minister
d'ivoire Matt the JCP before I mention
the former members i want to mention
Heather Heather Van cura who is the
manager of the PMO the person
responsible for putting this and all our
other amazing parties together and life
would be much left less fun without Ella
we have also some former PM our members
here Aaron Williams I don't know if
Aaron is here haven't seen him yet Liz
Kinnear and Nancy Williams and then
current members of the PMO we have
Harold ogle where Harold is but those of
you i SPECT leads oh okay Harold is
working with Duke to bring Duke in but
Harold is the guy who helps all the spec
leads out with the work that they do
there is no co who does a lot of work no
co is at the front desk and does a lot
of work behind the scenes but thank you
know co and
harrell no cojo jos shrimp is a
webmaster he's again at the front and
he's the guy who keeps JCP dog up and
running when it goes down it's not Joe's
fault it's because Oracle IT says we
have to install a patch or whatever okay
so that's it further the credits and so
on thank you all for coming want you to
raise your glasses to celebrate the JCP
and 15 years we have a cake at the back
which I think we're going to cut shortly
Duke is going to be coming Duke is
getting changed I guess but he'll be
here in a moment the will give you
access to the revolution exhibit which i
think is upstairs you can't come to the
history museum without going to see that
plus of course you go see the difference
engine yes I'm sorry oh yes yes yes so
we're doing some recordings here
particularly those people that I
mentioned who people a part of history
will ask you to come and share some
thoughts but anybody else who has
something that they would like to
contribute we encourage you to come up
and Stephen chin will broadcast your
thoughts to the to the known universe
the revit the revolution exhibit will be
opened 730-745 or so so you can take
advantage of the fact that we are in the
computer history museum and if you stick
around we're gonna have a raffle when is
the raffle okay before the exhibits open
so if you're here you may have a chance
to win something wonderful and I forget
what it is and then if you're still here
and if you remember will give you a
little goodie bag when you leave so
probably too much talking for me so now
I'm going to stop once again thank you
and I'll see you here in five years time
for the 20th anniversary of the JCP
okay so anybody who wants to come and
share your favorite memories we also
have some 10 year java books that you
can have if you come up and talk to
Stephen chin you can have one of those
and Duke will be here at seven o'clock
so you can get your picture taken with
Duke back of the room by the banner the
15-year banner and cake at seven-thirty
they're nice books fans been saving
those for four years special occasions
such as this so thanks for coming come
up and talk to me and Stephen put you on
