here with Andre all right all right get
out or actually I gotta go Jessica I'm
here with on dread all right yes that's
good okay and he is a professional
groovy hacker works for canoe is well
known for the Griffin framework which
did did your book about you yes the book
came out in early june of this year
congratulations thank you very much I
know from experience that that's not an
easy feat so that you finish the second
one by the second edition of your book
is that yeah two editions of that
another book of flash and gay mobile
yeah hey that's for another one no well
not if I want to stay married all right
let's wizard what is your wife think of
you being a great author of the source
hacker and she loves you very much but
we definitely would like to do some
additional things during the weekends
yeah yeah okay yes I pretty much in the
same boat as you yeah okay wait wait a
couple years ago she forgets right you
need your darling yes all right and
today we're going to we're going to hack
us some cool technology so for those of
you are new to the night hacking show
this is a live video cast I'm touring
around Europe on motorcycle you can
interact with us on ustream or night
hacking com via Twitter you can send out
messages with hash night hacking and
that will show up on the live stream or
also there's a social chat you can type
stuff in and choose to send out over
Twitter Facebook and ustream I'd
recommend you check them all when you do
it yeah please do santos as many
questions as you can all right and what
we have a screen up here where we can
see questions as they come in and
already we can see that Jim weavers page
AV chat probably some other folks we
just finished interviewing Garrett we
also have a live audience I'm not going
to point the camera at them anymore
because as you can see here that you can
hear them over there anytime you're in
the area somewhere i'm doing a night
hacking session
you're welcome to attend in person just
drop me a line with the contact form of
my blog and you can come be part of our
part of our studio audience and have fun
chats and hacking before and after and
there were plenty of time during day box
instead of you have like three or four
days of doing the same thing yeah that
box i'll be walking around with the
camera and awesome catching people on
live on video feed when I least suspect
to you so for any devil size Indies when
Eve when you go there and you see a
Steven with his big camera don't be shy
say hi to him yep and you know I happen
to be wearing a shirt of a different
conference as well but so this is also
nice j this is coming up in library
yeah lobster pots a good java conference
to top java comfort it's like it's like
social time for geeks well yeah well the
nice thing about europe is there is
someone almost every single week yeah
and you're probably at half of them
alright so let's get on to groovy javafx
groovy effects Griffin what yeah which
is going to be a little bit of
everything internet you're gonna code
here aren't you yes I'm going to show
some code something that Gary didn't do
but it's okay all the competition
alright so let's show you guys Andre his
desktop okay so what I have here is
let's make the the funnel a bit bigger
presenter fonts exactly nice so some of
you that might have seen the night
active earlier Stephen interview Russell
window he is part of the groove effects
team which I'm also part of the group a
steam and what we're seeing today right
now is a groovy effects view of a
Griffin application and so what I want
to show is that it's quite easy to build
a new I using Ruby as kin of declarative
language so what we can see at the top
here they're the top medical application
these will be
your main stage then inside here's the
scene and then you see another nail
meekly off which it's comes from the
code made by tum tum you think you were
with him earlier yeah we got tom tom is
on a live stream too yeah so Tom this is
your component and what we're doing here
is laying out different labels in and
text fields using big layout and a
couple of buttons so but I like about
this design is that the UI hierarchy is
right there in front of you is it's easy
to find your way around and then we're
making use of some other niceties nice
things about graphics which is the
binding we're binding the text property
of this text view to some other javac
space property coming from that
component called the model about you
finding you had you know to like get the
property out by calling a method and
then call the bind keyword the find
function on that and then get the other
property and then chain together yeah
that's the gel way this is the groovy
effects within the Java way in the Java
IPS well we still making use of the
java-based API under the cosine that's a
really nice thing that the oracle team
which are fixed in d for java fix tool
is that is now based on java everything
so now other people like cars like the
graphics team can build libraries on top
of the common chava later so you are
also based on the on skala fixed on you
you bet as you know I was just giving a
little theater yeah I know I know and
we're still waiting for our release yeah
yeah is that gonna happen it something
yeah well that very soon ok and then
there was something also ready register
right after i get off my motorcycle oh
ok ok so let's make advanced so nice
thing is that we can build these things
and now we make use of the nice Ruby
syntax to do the binding now for some
this may look more natural because you
have to think in terms so who is a
target and who is a source as a matter
of fact you can even reverse the binding
in a way that right now this is a target
and these will be the source
but if I want to push the makeup
bidirectional binding push the value
from the text field to the model and
vice versa then it's just a matter of
finding a different property here and
that's all so then then then again let's
see here's one label text view another
label another text field here this is a
password another couple of buttons
what's nice about me Cleo is that it has
a couple of default constraints for some
of the four song or the configuration
that you put so let's see that here for
the whole layout all the components will
try to expand as much as possible as
they can now for the columns we have two
columns which are the things are inside
the brackets the first column says well
whatever constraints the default sizes
that the components have in that column
what those were the ones are you going
to use those will be of two labels with
a little special five percent a little
bit it's a very special five percent so
that they are space between the label
center text fields and then the textures
will grow as much as possible so we
resize this stage and the scene then we
should see that the text fields expand
but the labels will stay fixed and
whenever you want to so you write these
things heroes so here the text view is
the second member or the first row so
when we want to write another row and
soon the layer that they should do
another row then we just simply have
grabbed it to this thing so this shows
that you are we were making use of the
parsing capabilities of the meek layout
using just the strings or you can even
use the real objects there are this is a
full java-based api behind yeah this is
almost this almost feels like the old
Java affects the javafx scripts so it
feels like jello takes a script but this
is a very much that's pretty close and
i'll tell you why is better because it's
a full language this is a full purpose
programming language whereas javascript
was nice javascript but it was confined
to just the UI okay were you expecting
me that i'm just saying that groovy was
there since the beginning yeah okay all
right is that was that was all plant
there you wanted to get a reaction yeah
leather got the edge on first name is
around the ones that have to carry the
other burden of coming up with
javascript in the first case yeah it's
called Vizag now yeah it's called the
session which I we're still was awaiting
an opportunity to write a massage plugin
for Griffin yeah that would be awesome
now it's almost ready yeah so so shift
let the let Raj and restitch and I user
group members know that we have a
official request for visage paraffin
plugin it's Logan's Gradle we just dated
from awesome Gradle plug-in I suppose
now that I it doesn't also cool alright
so ok back to groovy effects so you have
Cinco let's see the application running
because this it's just enough of the
theory so what I have here let's make
the phone a little bit begin I have the
here's the edge of the application and
Griffin has good support for IDEs but it
also comes with command line tool I'm
going to use a command line tool because
it's just the easiest one and I don't
have to set up any idea at the moment so
running an application is just a matter
of Negreanu actually the fact you have
an open ID is actually grading or all
the napkins the deputies career is on
the line well they open ID that have
this idea but test night all right he
didn't he didn't he just started like
twisting the knife in their harsh it so
happens that idea supports much better
Griffin right now that happens but that
can change a quick everyone yes might be
better I will tell you why that can
change in a moment so let's run the
application first visual senior named a
mainframe we are a couple of labels in
couple text fields and two buttons okay
so that the commander is doing right now
is making sure that everything is
compiled everything is up to date and
then launches the application and we'll
see it in just a second there we go nice
so here is to see if i expand this text
which did not expand the bottom does
move okay
they're shrinking them yeah ocean games
are shrinking yeah okay expand to a
point maybe there max the next size at
some point large enough I bet that the
container has the right constraints but
the controls which have a their
preferred sizes though this is sit right
yeah it's just a matter of playing with
the constraints that comes with the meek
layout that there's actually good
documentation for that so I have set up
these things so that if there is no data
enter in any other text fields then this
button doesn't do anything and if I
click cancel this will shut down the
application so let's see your name and
some secret password oh I will count on
me the official personnel oh yeah you do
then click login and then we get this
Wow even though it's my name yes now
you'll notice that the top side is
different looks like a proper dialogue
do I remember this is for java fix and
we'll have dialogues in traffic so what
we're doing we're bringing a stage with
a different set up with a different look
and kind of like a look and feel and so
that it looks exactly like a dialogue
malice and then we would close it and
that's it so now let's shut it down so
what a night this is one particular
brought up yeah doesn't matter so two
battles let me see here they have
behavior and they are reacting to this
thing called kin selection and log in
action and this is one of the things
that I believe is missing right now from
the gfx API I see if you compare it to
swing in swing we have actions so we can
abstract what we want to do with buttons
and menus and whatnot but enjoy effects
we don't have such thing as an action
but we do have them in groove effects so
what we're doing with this but we're
application is wiring things like
convention if there is one guy which in
this case is my controller that have
that has two methods that follows these
naming convention then I can wire
everything back again in the view using
those things so and the text fields
sorry the the name of the actions that
will be represented in the buttons the
the graphics
tooltips well not everything that is
needed to configure the action can come
from externalize resources okay so this
is what we see here and the kin
selection we simply shut down the
application are the login action what we
do is create a dialogue right here this
is one of the internal KPI so Griffin
how you can create an NBC group which is
a Model View controller and this one is
particularly a dialogue we set some
barrels variables here and then simply
show the dialer or is that with the
inner class definition there are no
inner classes we have closures closures
yes so for others we have to wait for
JDK 8 comma so that we can have lambdas
in in Java language proper but other JDM
languages such as Ruby Scala and closure
allows you to write these things which
some cold an anonymous function somehow
we'll call them just functions over the
column closures and other Russell will
give me some grief if I will call these
things real questions because they are
not such thing but any case they are the
closer to lenders that we can have right
now in induced alien language got it and
once once lambdas actually come into the
language it will get even better both in
the core language and also grouping
exactly will be still undecided if the
groovy implementation of lambdas will be
based on the JVM language on the javelin
does but there will be some definitely
force some sort of in their
communication mechanism so that you can
use one of the other or both in some way
nice yeah cool so that that looks pretty
pretty easy to set up yeah but there's
my cash you'll see they're here this
message is making use instead of writing
the message directly I'm trying time
kind of resolving the messages the same
thing goes in the view the text fields
that the labels you some kind of
resource mechanism so what I'm going to
do now is launch the application again
but launch it so that the default
language is not English but in this case
my model phone which is Spanish
you know run the application so i
haven't should taste touch the code
right don't be a change in a single line
curve just changing the language
and now we got the labels in Spanish or
username and password how about this
didn't change because they are related
to the action but I could have changed
this to as well access Martha we can
like I can show you how can can can do
it yeah we can fix it yeah yeah I'm very
unhappy that we haven't changed good
okay but the message has also changed
now so the world interests ipi
bienvenido that's welcome yes punish so
let's say it's a good point let's change
the this ms let's show you how easy is
that so we go into the resources here
you can see the resources in English the
deeper ones and the resources in Spanish
that is that the only difference is then
you can see the soon there is this there
is a suffix on the file name alright so
let's see what is the full name of this
action the full name is the name of the
controller which is sample one sample
one controller then the name of the
action cancel and then I think I had to
say name put in Spanish will be
considered and for login will be a
better name for logging let's put in
dryer okay okay let's run the
application again with spanish as a
selected language and let's see
alright and if you guys have any
questions for Andre's so good if about
Griffin or javafx or groovy effects now
would be a good time to ask so I'm just
I'm just planting the seed so there you
go that's pretty tough that was really
easy yeah thanks groups you proof that
you're I think that deserves we put up
the little plus sign for the studio
audience wish you guys didn't see in the
background there that deserves a night
hacking sticker so Andre and actually
I'd also like to present one to Steve
couple coworkers to see you allow you to
scape without getting a camera again all
right thank you very much for coming
driving all the way across Switzerland
coming out here to join our session
alright so what else you have to show so
yeah one nice thing about this is that
javafx may not come with
internationalisation support with you
could say pretty much the same thing
about swing but that is one of the old
features that application framework
should provide you regardless of what
you are told if you make use of another
child facts is just Charlie because it's
very easy to wrap in groovy and use it
with person and integrative I mean you
did it before but it wasn't this easy
yes one thing to note is that of course
i'm showing groovy effects and go
because i like Ruby and is so easy in my
mind at least to go around with this
code but say that you cannot use Ruby or
you don't want to use it for whatever
reason but you want to make use of this
thing or Griffin and Java effects
together what can you do well you still
can if you create an application using a
java-based templates so the Griffon
command can help you in this case we can
create an application in the scale is
called Steve I would use the JavaFX
archetype because this will tell the
application that you should be a job
that affects one instead
swing which is the default but I will
also tell it to use the Java file type
and what I do this you will of course
booster the application in a different
way but the main language of for
development will be chatter now okay so
let's go inside Steve these small
application I said the Gryphon director
here let's look at the view said
java-based file inside is just playing
Java code and here is making use of
these of the standard traffic storrow
api's yes so when we run this now to
griffin running app then we will compile
this stuff and lunch it let's see there
we go
there is the default setting well this
is in a java version and this is the job
ash on the same application frame of the
different jealousy you can pick which
language you want to program in but
still use Griffin yeah yeah and you can
even mix and match things you can write
the view in in groovy effects and then
the rest of the code the model the
controller and services or what any
other beam that is required before the
application in Java maybe and you know
maybe with the help of the generic will
have a visage Griffin bogan hopefully
yeah looking forward to it yeah yeah so
here allow me to say big thank you to
Jim Clark and Dean Iverson they began
the work with the crew defects ap is and
Dean is the guy that created the job
exploding for Griffin if it weren't
because of them this couldn't be
possible yep let's go sir are awesome
yeah Jim Clark put a lot of effort into
the original birth defects ap eyes and
put really good documentation and yeah
he's a monster yes yes a plane ticket
that's a lot of lots tons of Kelvin code
in order to make the use of the data fix
and api's with movie such a pleasure
cool so say that you have bought the
idea of making use of groovy effects
well is there some kind of UI designer
or playground for testing out the google
fesco turns out that Griffin comes with
such a tool is called Ruby effects pad
it's one of the sample applications that
come bundled here let's look at this
different directory I have my microphone
distribution install in this place and
there you can see a groovy of expat Grif
expat is just like any other regular
Griffin application what we're going to
do now is run it and what's interesting
about this particular application is
that it's a swim based app and but it
allows thanks to Jeff the
effects panel you can embed a gfx scene
into a swinging app so that's another
way for you to bring new life to a
legacy swing application by putting in
traffics counting on it yes up for folks
who have swing up so you can use the JFX
panel i'll just put put y'all effects
content right in your swing up and
that's exactly what we're going to do
here so remember this is swing in it and
things listen incrementally font a
little bit you did a smaller phone I'll
be it a be right yeah well yes larger
font let's say the hell oh well we have
some samples here hello groovy effects
that looks familiar yeah that's pretty
short it's from the groovy effects yeah
example let's see another one to see
some animations the grill effects logo
is also based on graphics here nice and
when you click on it it animates then we
also have the gauges from Garrett from
JFX extras right here there we go these
are also animated so your gauges still
got in Garrett you didn't get away from
it there they are I think I think your
gauges have showed up in it should have
been Sven's talk spoiler once and I were
chatting and it show up when Tom and I
were shutting everyone loves to show
your gauges except for him yeah it's all
right sorry we were chatting with them
Garrett who's who's part of our part of
our studio audience so this is new the
canoes to do is to do exactly so this is
as easy as the star I need your code and
if I make it right I think that we have
some basic and cook out the completion
here no not that one
command shift space now I think that is
not on this version okay let's put us a
built in here hello my hackers you with
mish mash your quote oh thank you know
that one this one there's about ice but
it's a nice thing so what days you can
just write your script on one side and
then see the result you get immediate
results back exactly you don't have to
match the application see what's going
on yeah I've had to raise the applause
sign for that one sorry that's okay so
it's a nice thing and we have kind of
the same tool I actually this is the
second one the first one works for swing
and it's called swing pad it's also
available in the same directory in the
sample directory and the basic idea is
the same you write a scrip on one side
and see the results on the other okay
sweet we actually leave a question from
some okay some random stranger on the
social shot who could that be han Solo I
think I think he is one of the
characters from Star Wars actually oh
wow he's won that for a galaxy far far
away yeah he like he finds the planes
and stuff ok ok so anyway and so I was
wondering does it work with layouts this
is work with layouts yes you can apply
pretty much any layout supported by
groovy effects or any of the Griffin
plugin for example they meet layout John
of exploding click and can be used with
this tool so let me show you now kiss
we're back to swing land and i'll swink
legacy but i still like it so let me
show you something oh here's a meek
layout for swing now that we go so
what's interesting is that the swing
code that you see here is quite similar
to what we saw on the JFX go
I can use of a different dsl this case
swing based yourself but these names are
very close to the ones that we saw in
javafx yeah there will be a few
differences in the properties that you
can set but when you move to these dsl's
is easy I would say it's easier to
switch from one tool kit to the other so
again a nice thing about this tool is
that you can learn want to get from
using this dsl and then apply to the
other one you could also build an
application using the graphing framework
it started with swinging and then move
it to javafx and you don't have to
change neither of the logic not the
model do they only have to touch the UI
cool right so this is it very nice yeah
so where can people find all these great
things Egyptian Griffin groovy effects /
they gather to find out more information
so the homepage of the Griffin framework
is Griffin dash framework org cool
effects is found at groovy effects org
there is another interesting website in
the case of Griffin which is called the
artifact porta i'm going to show you
here this particular page i have
selected all the currently jar effects
based plugins for griffin they are at
the moment 12 half of them have our
related to icon so the icon that we saw
on the first application and there was
two blue icons 14 shutdown and the other
from login come from one of these
plugins and then we see here they meekly
job plugin for john effects this is the
one that provides the integration and
there is this other one plumbing for
dialogues that right now just builds up
a basic dialogue but there are other
dialogues i will build eventually like
this one in textmate you have the search
dialog these we have already for swing
it's just a matter of setting up for
javafx and so you should be when when
you use make you
this plugin in traffics application you
should be able to just pop up this
dialog with a simple structure just one
liner and do a search on anything that
you can do so go yeah ok so there are a
few other things that I'd be hacking
related to who what happened oh oh okay
so i clicked on Wirecast and it said
report sense but that was for the
previous crash no it didn't crash okay I
had a little double take there and I
thought we had I thought we'd all stream
is she all right so Kate no it's okay ah
so there's a lot of job fixing that I
would like to show alright so before you
start that let me let me quickly show
folks a couple of the URLs so this is
the website for Griffin yes Griffin co
host org where you can find out more
about the Griffin framework you can't
even see the link to a book oh yeah
that's nice that's a nice cover there do
you know you got wrote this I have no
idea who wrote that book yeah yeah
probably some with a lot of time to kill
yeah exactly all right and we had also
the groovy effects project and some one
of the nice things this is really good
documentation on only controls and api's
and they just they just did a really
good job with what the user guide for
this and there are plenty of examples
showing how you can make use of the
different nodes and the different dsl
options so you don't start from zero
yeah yeah so that's that's all very good
stuff so check that out and give it a
shot so what were you gonna probably in
a chef oh yes so you might remember JFX
extra there was this other crazy guy
that started this project back in the
three or four years ago your memory foam
I said of course you must must have been
like who's that guy that I don't run
cameras
it's been a it's been too long you know
that you forget about yeah because that
was that was like last that was javafx
wanted stuff yeah but at the time that
fix estÃ¡s was close two versions here
too we decided to add these shapes to
the project you might remember this
remember the right shapes the buzzword
shapes from the JC web project and then
we added them to JFS extras in javafx
basil then we came up with this yeah so
each one of these things I these have
three different shapes and this sub for
one provided by the shape API if you are
some other examples from the default
demo that we have look familiar yeah
this is def x1 I think that this is
james fabric the love guru well brew
yeah that's what the you want yeah
and then we have some other regular
polygons so my idea is to bring back
these shapes to jf XX front based on ji
festival the cold but i'm still learning
how to do these things because it's not
just a matter of of korean a controller
Gary does it but you had to make sure
that this thing's high style and there
are some I will say one key things with
how the early shapes API works in
traffics you cannot create a new shape
per se because shapes are somehow
attached to the lower level of the scene
graph there is a you could say the same
native implementation of a shape and you
cannot reach that so that's still close
API and may base their clothes and make
make sense to stay close so what you
have to do is fake something that looks
like a shape in the end you just produce
a note that will be rendered by the
scene graph it will not be of type shape
but you can provide pretty much the same
contract as if it where I shape there so
what I have here now I turn to my ID yep
is a star shape i'm here i'm sharing the
other way around there we go this is the
java-based api for creating a star
you set some properties on it and then
what I'm doing is I will bind some
sliders to those properties the first
I'm going to change how many ARMs a star
can have how big the outer radius could
be and the angle because of this shape
can be written in a different angle so
we'll run the demo this is a standard
javafx application and then we have the
star familiar yeah so let's change the
number of arms and like the old Jeff
actual shape yeah but we can do this now
well we're back we're binding the number
of arms that this starting here cool and
then we do the same thing with the outer
radius nice so it gets point here if you
have a bigger router video so smaller
inner radius yes exactly so let's change
that again now let's HIV exactly or we
can even rotate it on its center now you
see that this target is move around a
little bit and that's because the
bounding box yeah but the bouncer
changing so it's in a way out which is
why yes this is something there to do
with the layout but not how it works and
how we want to render the shape itself
so this is the first guy walking yeah
now we have just to add a animated
transition on the x-axis and that will
be it cool so here's this is the first
shape and I'm sending the colors
explicitly what I would like to do for
this node later is so that it's just
exactly so that's a style yeah that
would be awesome and once this shape is
a style bowl then the rest of the shapes
that you saw here this one's most of
them pretty much followed the same
design so if once you have ones copying
data remove and change the degree' lips
but take advantage of the same base
classes and patterns and exactly so we
might have jet java jf extras too
caption exactly as the point of the
possum why is it is terrible and i have
finished with all of this will
contribute back to jail for sex wise to
see that that han Solo Luke Skywalker
sidekick he proves nice that's not mad
enough to say anything or coming to the
stream again but he'll whole Hill tweet
from us from across the room yeah so the
rumor that I say something that these
things are not really shapes here you
can see the code this star is threat a
stands for a master complex shape which
extends from that region this is a trick
we read yung isa javafx yeah no actually
this is probably the right way to do it
in javafx to these shapes are special
she Lester's unless you was it once
javax is fully open source and you can
see all that in rotation then you could
potentially asked to type changes to
expose more of that but even then you
probably need to be part of the scene
graph in the platform to do them the way
they did yes so that so I think
identities bleeding from extendable
shapes you need something closer to this
so what we do have here some kind of
activities this is now yet here but this
utility class should be able to grab a
real shape plus one of these fake up
shapes and create bigger areas using
addition or subtraction or intersection
as you can do with regular shapes go so
you can create bigger shapes or funky
shapes space on the basic one yes ok you
tell a lot hacking yeah a little even
pretty busy now releasing plugin is
making things is making sure these
things work so you do you occasionally
work for canoe with your day job right
medication what about on a five page of
aces my my daily work I'm happy to say
that is that revolves around groovy and
grails most of the code that I do for my
customers is related to Grail singer be
nice nice yeah okay so it kind of it
jives with what you're doing for your
for your day job both your your insist
this is your interests right and you're
you know what what makes you pay the
rent and decide we have a couple of
customers are actively looking into
chava fix what we do a presentation at
each other I said javac space API
demonstration of 3d container management
four walls companies now this is neva
neva so here's a ki kheer the
application you saw on stage is a
Griffin application said Griffin javafx
place applications ice grippers nobody
was about why say yes who was facing
cool effects so using all the
technologies all that have shown today
was used for creating a little bit more
of the secret sauce for the other 3d
stuff that was used to build the
application that was shown in the
general wonky oh cool all right anything
else the aerial tricks up your sleeve
unless mr. hacking so did the bees hash
code yes but now i remember i said
something coming back to that so I'm
very happy that the H&amp;amp;R guys can do it
but if somebody else wants to jump into
the fray and it so happened to go to the
box there would be a full day session
called hacker garden or steve and
garrett and some other prominent members
of the java community will be there the
whole point of this session is to meet
and greet with the leaders of the
open-source pragmatic it might actually
be fun to stream the hypodermic there
will be nothing secret you like edge
even can you manage eight hours of
hacking well some portions of it maybe
now like we extreme the intro yeah we'll
who's who's who's kicking off is going
to you or hand it's gonna maybe you I
can't stream the interest of folks can
you see how it starts you know that
people introduce the projects which
they're going to work on so we can you
know we can get someone at the beginning
and then I can pull people aside and
kind of you know I have to show what
sort of projects they're working on
earth
different time slices but it could be
fun yeah i'm gonna be there at the
hacker garden i'm not going to be you
know doing something else like you know
interview someone else in the conference
oh ok we can we can set up some
different times when will have the
stream live love people participate
perfect love it alright so we've got
we've got we got an extra agenda item
for for Steve's incredibly long
motorcycle through your mind hacking sir
can I already have like 15 12 or 15
videos well the remote you're always
welcome to come back here to Switzerland
thank you okay in case you don't like
you to go back to to France or virtual
summer place yeah you're always watching
too okay appreciate all right thanks a
lot for being on you very much Andre
thank you very much to our studio
audience and also the folks the folks
online oh one more thing cuz when I
Grizzard 90 whirlwind FX any lights a
box no OpenGL there's an idea well wind
FX that'd be really cool Gosling James
Coughlan would loan out if we did
something like that so that's that's a
really good idea yeah well we have to
knit to see what are the published 3d
capabilities of joy FX by the time their
books were seen in two weeks I know that
Jasper and Richard says something that
they will be close to that those days
but don't quote me on that we have to
know we will know where eventually when
they make the announcement yeah it
should be should be very close to these
dates cool alright well thanks everyone
for joining the stream and our next
event is in Torino Italy tomorrow so
I'll be meeting the the user group there
and interviewing folks in streaming some
sun life life hacking from from Italy so
see you for that since one CS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
