the OTN advocacy group and I managed the
Java champion program and I'm joined
today by Antonio who's a Java champion
how long have you been a Java champion
oh that's a good question you know I
think oh god I think it's six seven
years okay because I created the Paris
Java user group in 2008 okay so it's
been and then I was then I became a
champion so I think it's seven years
okay seven years and as a job a champion
you know you're you know the moniker is
your technical experts luminaries and
you give back to the Java community so
that's one of the things I wanted to
kind of highlight with different
interviews here at devoxx and so the
first thing would be just you know what
do you do for your day job Oh
my day to day job I do Java I go from
customer to customer I I develop systems
and mostly on the backend to be honest
but I discovered Java in 98 and since
then you know 80% of my job is doing
Java code for my customers okay and then
when you're not busy with your customers
how do you give back to the Java
community since that's such a integral
part of the Java champion program yeah
so first of all I became a Java champion
because I created the Paris Java user
group as I said it was eight years ago
nearly nine we are going to the ninth
year and I rule the the Paris Java user
group for seven years once a month 250
people for seven years and then I you
know I gave the the Paris Java user
group to another team because I've
created the DevOps France so that was
five years ago
very nice congratulations thank you
people and DevOps Franz today it's the
same format devil Belgium mostly French
75% of the talks I in French in 25 in
English
and it's 2,800 people Wow okay plus on
my spare time I write Java books I think
I've stopped I've written three books I
think I think I might not yeah so that's
also a way you know to give to people
and not many weeks ago I was touring the
French Java user group so I did three
Java user groups South of France smaller
jugs you know so it's also a nice way to
interact with people
now it's share yeah so you know on the
day to day job I work with Java and when
I have a bit of spare time and I do take
a bit of spare time I try to all to
organize conferences jugs and devoxx but
also to participate some smaller jugs
found it difficult to find speakers
because they are in remote countries etc
etc so I also try to to do a bit of
countryside seeing talking to the
community well thank you for all you do
for the driver community and become have
a great rest of Jeff box yes thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
