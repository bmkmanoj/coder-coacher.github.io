fall today I'm joined by three different
java speakers the first one I'm gonna be
interviewing is scared Grunwald do you
wanna say hi Garrett hi everyone
after him I'll have keys Joan and then
finally is Saskia so Garrett are gonna
do some Java effects and embedded
hacking yeah so I would show some stuff
but I I would run it on my desktop
because it was not enough time to set it
up after my session here so but it you
have to trust me that the same code
works on the PI so this stuff that is
made for the pine cool and that um Keith
John is gonna do some bytecode hockey
with me and finally ass ass guy for
really cool videos of what we did at the
dev ox for kids Netherlands event
alright so with that I wanted to kick
things off by showing a little audio a
little video clip here from the Jay Paul
conference we're in the Netherlands at
one of the biggest Java conferences run
by the Netherlands user group so we
might as well show the opening clip from
the keynote this morning to a thousand
NT he is Rakhal see ya Bert
airball
all right well that mostly worked until
it didn't hold on just a sec tick number
two
yes this is a really busy conference
there's lots of people milling around
here beside
and they don't
it's pretty cool
nothing else that goes on in the city
paper Jay Paul because there's not a lot
it's really the best one-day conference
I know ya know they do a great job with
the NL jug and they're also Dukes Choice
Award winners so they got the re
presented the Dukes Choice Award this
morning all right so I'll hold the mic
for you but why don't you talk through a
little bit about what you've been doing
with JavaFX and embedded and let's
switch over to your desktop okay so you
own it what it's uh yeah I got it hold
on just a sec I gotta add in the video
all right so here we go yeah I showed
that already on Java one and this is
that's the job FX application I created
for for the Raspberry Pi now it's
running on the desktop and thirty
minutes ago I showed it doing my session
running on the PI but like I said it was
not enough time to do the whole setup
here so this is this is a little Java FX
application that just measured or shows
the the data that some of my pies are
measuring at the moment I'm have the
bigger bone black which is measuring
temperature outside of the house and so
you see it's nine degrees Celsius
outside and then I have also another pie
which is sitting in my office then I can
switch to and in the bottom I created my
own charts these are not the standard
Java FX charts because I would like to
really use as less notes as possible and
the charts are not that small if it
comes to number of notes so I created my
own one this is just a canvas this this
part here in the bottom this is just the
canvas node and I draw some lines on it
and I can measure temperature and every
five minutes each of these devices will
store the data to a MongoDB instance on
the web and this client will just get
the data from there and visualize it so
you see that it's quite stable around
nine degrees Celsius outside and
muenster well if and when I switch over
to the to the PI for example then you
see the PI is also measuring humidity
and pressure and then yeah now you see
it also on the stream so and I just
created some ranges or sections that
show okay humidity is ideal and the
temperature is nominal which means it's
okay it's comfortable and the pressure I
just added some little icons here that
shows the weather because the the air
pressure is directly connected to the
weather so it's it's a change at the
moment so it could be sunny or rainy so
depends but this is in principle the
whole application and if I would connect
another PI that I have with me I did it
in during the session then another PI
will automatically show up so I use XMPP
to
for the communication part between that
stuff and as a little add-on I have to
show now with the mouse but this works
with touch on the PI if I press the
mouse button on the lower right corner I
think on the stream it will take a
little bit of second so it will pop up a
menu and I will wait now yeah there it
is so and I have some more options that
I can choose from for example I have
this little light if I switch it then
you might see it on the screen that this
little LED here will be green now
because the temperatures idea this is
directly connected to the temperature
then I can also measure the brightness
in my office so now so we have some
attendees here they are so keen on
watching us that's how you know we're at
a real conference autographs yeah so I
can add also the brightness measurement
and in addition I have some info which
shows now I it takes some seconds to
show up on the yeah here we go
so it shows me the public IP of the PI
now and all the Java version is not
known at the moment and the sensors that
are connected to that and when I go back
you know he's in the upper right corner
you see the little indicator that shows
the brightness so it's day at the moment
and if it's dark then you see little
moon so this is in principle the
application that is running and it's
exactly the same if I run it on the pie
even with a little LED connected I can
now switch back to the BeagleBoard and
it is 9 degree and it takes to the next
pole when the LED will now switch to
blue because the temperatures yeah now
you see it it's blue so it's always like
a extreme feedback device right so you
can put it somewhere and obviously the
temperature it was made for the Java one
session with the toad Costello yeah so
this is the one application that I would
like to show but I'm working on a
different one now that let me show you
this one it I created that only for j4
here we go hopefully this will fit on
the screen ok
so you see ah here it goes this will
takes a couple of seconds here we see
the things it's in principle the same
but here this application will monitor
the temperature humidity pressure
brightness outside temperature and also
other stuff like voltage power current
depends on the sensors I connect to
whatever PI I have so for example if I
would like if I take this pi that I have
with me and would connect it to the
internet and connect the voltage sensor
then it will automatically show up in
this application and I can do some
measurement stuff that was the idea that
I can place PI's or something that
measures temperature in different
locations and then you see here if you
take a look at the screen and it's the
temperature there is something like
office humidity office pressure office
so that means in the office I have the
Raspberry Pi that measures temperature
humidity and and pressure and and then I
have also a brightness sensor and to see
it's also in the office and then I have
outside temperature which is in the
Shanti's so that somewhere outside in
the in the backyard and this is also
measuring so this won't show really the
the PI's so not the devices but just the
measured data that it that it that it
collects right and yeah in the upper
right corner I just created a little
weather widget that shows me in Muenster
where I'm living
it shows ok it's sunny we have 10 degree
Celsius humidity and pressure so this is
in principle it the nice thing about it
is that I can now use a lot of parts and
plug the devices in there and I see the
the all the data there right so I can
for example if I would like to measure
during my session I measure the voltage
of a battery I just hooked up a voltage
sensor and then it's appears on the
screen and then I can measure the
voltage and it shows the value so it was
just it's just a little fun application
nothing very special so but it my plan
is to create something new in
in the near future so for next year's
conferences I'm working on something
where I connect a PI to a sensor network
and I have something with me I can just
show it maybe it's hard to see on the
camera but it's alright so I made the
camera bigger and I can also zoom in on
your device cell come around here Reggie
all the
so yeah it's um the end the idea at the
end is that I'm because I can't put a
pie in every room right that doesn't
make sense so I was looking for
something different and it's we'll start
with measuring temperature because this
is the easiest thing to do so to do that
what I what I use is I use of course the
Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi will
only be some kind of a server and I
connected an XP to the Raspberry Pi it's
this little this little thing here on
top yeah you know it's hard to see
that's an XP which is some kind of a
Wi-Fi extender it's not Wi-Fi that you
know from from computers it's something
different but with this I can this acts
as a so-called coordinator in the way in
the network so the PI is connected to
the to the web and this little xB is
connected to other sensors and I built
this the sensors they are in this little
box maybe you can show it this this box
here so this is this is what one of
these boxes I just place it somewhere my
house I have ten of these so if I open
it if it will be you see just give me a
second
yeah so that's the stuff I have in years
it's really small this is an XP and I
just hooked up with temperature sensor
it's a TMP 36 it's the little one here
and the advantage of using the XP stuff
is you have a DC connectors so that
means you can hook up analog sensors and
these things will directly measure the
temperature every minute and send it to
the coordinator which is the PI so and
this is running on a battery that I have
also in this housing it's lates this
size right and it's with this battery
this setup can run up to eight months
without then I don't have to open it so
and that's really amazing so I built all
these things I had built 10 of these and
I will put them in the house everywhere
because it's small and then the PI will
collect the data but the really
interesting part is not only showing the
live data but somehow store
and then visualize it so therefore I use
another little device which is the so
called cubieboard it's in here it's a
hardware compatible device to the PI but
the big advantage is it has a SATA
connector that means you can hook up I
hooked up is 64 gigabyte SSD on this
device I'm using JDK 8 and I compiled
MongoDB on that and so here's a MongoDB
running and storing the data from the
sensor network so I can then the PI just
collects the data and stores it to the
MongoDB and then I can use it from
wherever with a desktop client or
whatever I like and just take the data
from the MongoDB of the cubieboard and
this is all you need right I just put
this thing into the power pop lock and
then I'm good to go
it's connected with Wi-Fi it's just it
looks similar to the Raspberry Pi so
that's it's the stuff I'm working on
right now so the first thing will be
hooking up temperature sensors but it
will be more right I will also hook up
some switches and that stuff everything
connected by our XPS and then we will
see if it works out and I will use the
Raspberry Pi then for visualization and
I will use this application that I
showed you before the smart monitor but
then instead of showing temperature
humidity pressure it should show all the
rooms where I hooked up the the sensors
right and then it showed just running on
a PI somewhere attached to a wall in my
house and just show the current
temperatures and data and you can also
imagine I couldn't put up switches in
that where I can touch it and switch on
light or whatever I like or for example
a slider to control the heating system
which will be the next step so this is
the the things I'm working on right now
I'm jealous of all your hardware now see
you guys have any questions about his
setup so um
okay okay and so one question I have for
you is do you use these things in
production or are yeah the question was
if I use it in production now I'm
because I'm I started with this two
weeks ago so it's really the first thing
is to figure out because you know now if
I connect sensors to the PI it's it's
cheap in terms of 40 bucks for the PI
hookup some sensors but to be honest you
don't want to put PI's everywhere in
your home right it's just too much 700
megahertz running for nothing but
measuring temperature so I was thinking
about what would be the logical next
step it would be using the PI just to
collect the data and use something very
small to really sense the data and this
is the the XP stuff now and this is
nothing new so you can find it in
industry everywhere so this is not not
really new but the newest may be that
you hook it up to the PI and use it
everything is running on embedded so I
don't need really a server or something
to run this stuff so the server's the PI
and the the cubieboard in fact I can
also connect the cubieboard with the XP
and then just only use this one as the
whole thing and I think this is that's
the new thing and I would like to figure
out how to use that for home automation
torments home a home automation right
because I don't have a bus system at
home and I will set it up and next year
will propose it to conferences and
hopefully it will get accepted so you
win then you will be able to learn more
about it if I may ask another question
we're using an embedded Java environment
right now and Java me and we're also
using X bees it's a lot of stuff to
figure out and I I don't know if you
know the protocol
already but it can be a pain sometimes
though one question would be if what's
your opinion about using the Raspberry
Pi in a production environment do you
have experience on that one or yeah so
to be honest the the Raspberry Pi was
never meant to be used in industrial
environments right it's just something
for consumers and you have to treat it
like that so I use it for the one pie
that I use at home it's running for I
don't know it I started in February or
January and it's running since then
without any problems at all run in Java
8 and I can't really say that I have any
problems with it and I'm I would not
rely on that PI for industrial stuff but
for home things where it's not that
critical
I guess it's absolutely useful to do
that and it's really reliable especially
I'm using the the JDK 8 Developer
Preview but since they are out on on the
market right and they are stable from
the beginning which is awesome it's
really it will be released March next
year but it's really that stable that I
can use it on everyday basis so that's
really great so I think for if you use
it for home automation maybe for small
things we use it at canoeing in
Switzerland we use a PI connected to a
big monitor to visualize the the meeting
room to meet the meeting rooms the rooms
in the calendar to see which meeting
room is blocked or which is free so and
this is also running now for months
without any problem so I think it's
quite stable but I think we have to wait
a couple of more years to see how long
it really will last the biggest problem
will be there's D cards yeah
Munich is watching the livestream
indecent Jeff he's wondering if you over
cost your pies are done no III tried it
to overclock the PI and it works but
then it's not stable in anymore so I
child with one gigahertz and forget
about it then I traveled with 900 for
the same 800 works for some times a week
but most of the times it breaks down
after three days so 700 is perfect and
to be honest you don't need the power
because you have no benefit from it - if
you overclock the PI maybe for the game
stuff you do this might make sense of
I'm I'm agree that's a good idea but you
have to be careful because it's really
it's really getting unstable if you
overclock the part no I don't have good
experience with that ok
yeah Tony likes your answer alright so
with that thanks very much for joining
the live stream here Jay Paul our next
speaker is going to be Keys John call
stirrer and he's going to be here in
another 15 minutes on the live stream
and to close out I'm gonna play another
NL jug movie so thanks for joining us
see more videos on night hacking calm
and here's a little NL jug outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
