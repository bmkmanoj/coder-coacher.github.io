fellow nut hackers I'm at cienaga I'm a
Java champion and also Microsoft MVP I'm
here today to interview a great friend
Clemens coffee I did I said right yeah
okay because he's French I don't know
how to pronounce this French name
correctly and Clemmie is a software
engineer at Red Hat and he works in a
very cool project collared vertex you
know everybody these days are talking
about reactive programming how can we
create distributed systems in an
effective way how can we create this the
systems in a reliable way a reactive way
so I guess one of the questions that
everybody's asking and maybe we could
answer try to answer that
what in fact is reactive programming
well the first thing to defining what
reactive the world like it means and
actually reactive if you look at in the
several doors it will just say well it's
something that is reacting to stimulus
so that's all and a reactive software is
going to be a software that will react
to stimulus so then we have two things
to see that we can do that on the
programming level so that will be
corrective programming that looks like a
bit it's a subset of functional
programming where you will under stream
and you will observe streams and every
time that you have an event so stimuli
inside these streams and you will react
to that and produced all other streams
so that one way of doing that so we have
Eric's we have spring rector to do that
and there is another way to look to the
reactive world is to think well let's
not do that at the programming River but
we're at the architecture River and then
having components that will react to
other components by message but also to
the state and to the state of the system
at the load the failures the networks
and so on and here that's actually what
we call
reactive system is this and it's going
to be dynamic it's going to be like a
living entity something fail it would
react a request arrive it would react
where is that to be a bit more confusing
so we are reactive programming
interactive systems but you can
implement racket systems using reactive
programming Wow that's thought to be a
bit weird but our active system will
react to Maceda
but if you consider the sequence of
message you have a stream so as you have
a stream of message you can use reactive
programming to implement that one
everywhere it's one of the cool things
and vertex does vertex will let you
build your active systems but you can
use regular gaming to build it so have
an easy API to avoid the callback else
and stuff like that
ok and I don't know if the guys watching
us since you mentioned vertex can what
is vertex is a framework a library a
platform what is that vertex is a
toolkit aha difference it's not a
framework it's you can build your frame
up with that actually vertex is just a
Java file so you take this buffer put
that in your class bus do try to witness
and install some vertex and that's all
so it's not an observer it's not a
container it's not a framework but you
can build all of this with vertex so as
it just jar file it's very simple to
start you don't need any plugins you
just will create your own main so public
static void main to stop your ethics up
so it's very simple actually so simple
development model well it's the
development model you learn at school ok
is it a big job it's a very very small
job I don't have the size but it's very
small and actually when you create a
Phaedra so when you take your
application of vertex and vertex
dependencies it's not that fat something
that will not exceed a couple of
megabytes so we are already far from the
60 megabytes that we see in other
frameworks but actually ok it sounds a
bit uncommon because when you're
thinking about distributed systems if
you have a message bus clustering
capabilities you know application
service these days to have this
capabilities they have hundreds of them
or maybe gigabytes off of file size so
how it's pretty amazing that you can do
all of this in fact is it really
possible does it work it's it's it's
built on top of Nettie and it provides
some really nice appear on top of Nettie
so you don't have to deal with Nettie
yourself we provide on a higher level
API and it just need out of native you
can build everything you said so the
clustering actually works
we have TCP connections between or not
the event bus adjust this then we have a
cluster manager to create group
communication so we have different
implementation you can use other caste
you can use approaching night you can
use a zookeeper so it's up to you or
deep enough you use case one you will
pick but that's all and when you pick 8
all of this and you have a fat jar that
is not that big because well it's all
based on this low-level or basic
building blocks like we said something
interesting vertex is not an all-in-one
solution it will just provide you the
building blocks in it's up to you to
build what you want all of that so in
terms of building blocks will have HTTP
client server TCP client server a
synchronous DNS lookup even burst
clustering run or beam failover and so
on and so on so everything you need to
create a really really cool apps that
will be fast resilient and scalable ok
because I've seen a bit of reactive code
especially non verdicts and it seems to
me that when we were back to the 80s or
90s when we use the like callback Basic
programming you just have events and you
pass a callback to be called when
something happens and I don't know if
it's nature of these days because most
of the Java developers they are used
like to imperative programming and we
have a lot of this block in API I don't
know does vertex has a role in this
world can i still be using these old
libraries that i use every day we verax
so one first thing is you're not old
enough but it was not into 80s but more
or less in the 60s that we are already
using callbacks imagine that so yes this
callback style actually just how we
implement vertex but we provide some
also start to develop that we provide
features
vertex futures where you can compose
them instead layer and we provide a rich
support where you can really use one
also every Java and stream and so on so
you don't have to use the callback hell
but what is very cool is vertex to be
fast is using a non-blocking
but most of the library today that we
found are blocking so like gdb see like
wildfire access input stream and so on
vertex will let you use those libraries
because we provides a construct to do
that so you can use any libraries with
vertex it doesn't need to be vertex
aware you can use absolutely everything
and that's that really helps the
adoption of vertex ok
and I don't know do you think that there
is reactive programming style it fits
any domain model or maybe there's some
specific user case where it's a really
good fit well it has some use case where
it's much better than imperative model
so it's obviously use case where the
reactive model doesn't really make sense
or it's not natural it's more natural
like well batching and stuff like that
you don't necessarily want this but for
every application where you you will
receive requests so messages you have to
under that than the right chief
programming model is differently what
you want because it's it makes certain
kind of application really really easy
to to develop speaking of all the
history this is very similar to what
actors and Adams was doing during the
60s actually Rick if it's not new really
hold I thought it was a new concept
that's just arrived while you know we
just rebrand stuff and we say all the
concepts that we have behind we active
something really old and harder than us
okay well maybe mainly because that's
disability system series has been like
around for many years but just about
these days people are talking about the
severus systems it used to be just a
monolith before well actually we we made
that white at the beginning we decided
to do distributed system because well
seriously our non distributed system
it's much easier to do and to build
easier to debug and so on so but why in
the 60s and say well let's do
distributed system let's do the painful
way one of the easy way will work but at
that time
the power and the CPUs and the memory we
have was too limited so instead of
trying to build build build very great
computers and Werfel computer it was
impossible was too expensive so we say
well let's try to build smaller one and
make a network out of that ok two days
so 50 years later more or less we're
almost less more or less in the same
paradigm so before we were using
mainframe and big computer and now we
start using small one because mainframe
not just too expensive and the advantage
of this is that it to give you a
synchronous evolution of all you're not
so you don't have to synchronize
everything and to deploy everything and
so on you can have this will be released
next week it will be released in two
weeks this is already running and make
this evolve evolution working and so on
so give you flexibility give you a great
flexibility but while flexibility come
with a huge risk and it's distributed
system so we know that is going to fail
at some point it will it will fail you
just don't know when while we know that
is going to fail in production but we
don't know well when so you need to be
prepared to under the strainers and
again vertex is really good for this
mm-hmm doesn't have because people are
talking about histories for fallbacks
handler these days in systems a vertex
does that too so vertex provide a
different way to under resilience and to
implement resilience the first one is of
the world development model as a concept
of failures as first-class citizen so
you can't you will have to under your
failures the second thing is that we are
can do we can deal with timeouts too but
again Tomas doesn't mean that the
operation has fail it just means that
something bad happened but the operation
color green six could have been a
success and we also have circuit
breakers so you could use these tricks
you could use any circuit breakers we
also provide one that fit in the vertex
execution model so a single-threaded
event loop and stuff like that it's a
very powerful of circuit breakers that
provide just enough features that you
need if you rein in more you can use
hystrix we provide everything to use
these tricks to
it's up to you to use the one you want
okay cool it seemed that maybe we should
start learning more about reactive and I
guess that verdicts can be a very good
choice for this okay so tomorrow thank
you very much for all of this lesson
because I learned a lot of things I hope
that you all have learned it too and I
hope to catch you later
more conferences of course yes thank you
very much thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
