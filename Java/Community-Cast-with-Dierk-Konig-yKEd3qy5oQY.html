community cast my next guests we have a
Dirk from canoe thank you
hi Dirk thanks for joining us you're a
surprise guest for me this morning
and I haven't talked to you in a while
so I thought we'd hear from Dirk a
little bit about what he's doing here at
aura dev and share some of his
experiences here so Dirk want you to
introduce yourself and tell us a little
bit about you to get started oh that's
that caught me by surprise about you her
neck from canoe
I guess I'm mostly known for my work in
groovy got the groove in action book
which is kind of best-selling and famous
and I'm still very much concerned with
groovy yeah but also with a new language
Haskell for the JVM okay and let the
third topic that I cover is open dolphin
which is UI technology and I've been
spending actually now that you mentioned
and so last week I was with Andres and
we were briefly together for DevOps
Belgium and now here I am with you at
aura - and and next this weekend I'm
gonna meet up with Hendrick and in
Iceland so I'm having a tour of all the
canoes ya can do is all over the place
so that's been fun so tell us a little
bit about the talks that you're giving
here you have one today I went tomorrow
yes today I have talked on introductory
talk on
Stiga that's before the JVM and I was
really flattered to have John use one of
the founding fathers of Hesco sitting in
the crowd so after I'm given quite a lot
of presentations but every now and then
I get nervous
so that was this morning but he was very
generous and said I did not overly
misinterpret tests always great feedback
this is really awesome so you meet
really good people he had aridif that's
it's really very nice it's very nice
conference very much the last time that
I've been here was like I guess in 2007
or so nine years ago
so have you found it what were the
differences between a new location yeah
that this the conference organizers are
just so thoughtful and and organize it
so well it's really it's crazy it's very
good experience what I also always like
even though it's it's very late in the
year and then in Scandinavia we have
like short days right there they are the
the indoor architecture is very special
you you meet up you see that people in
this part this time of the year they
spend a lot of time inside so they care
about the inside architecture I love it
right it's very beautiful here the venue
right they've designed it with that in
mind right to take advantage of any
light that they do have at this time of
the year it's coming in through the top
and the brick so I really enjoyed that
and then just the casual atmosphere are
the folks hanging out here at the stage
and the beanbags yeah it's very info
8bim jpeg sui have out here with our
audience so yeah one other talk right
there you have another talk tomorrow
noon that's about going safely parallel
with Vega so here we are using the
Haskell type system and the language
design of Hesco on the JVM for going
safely parallel so if you try to do
stuff that you should not do you cannot
do because it wouldn't compile and
that's the kind of the best thing to
apply if negative which is we are using
the Haskell language design which is
arguably the most advanced language
design and type system that you can have
it's it's scientifically sound it's
based on mathematics you know it's it
provides a level of robustness that is
unparalleled and we are using this on a
platform which is unparalleled by its
mastery of Industrial Engineering no JVM
is a masterpiece of industrial
engineering and we are combining the two
and make that available and put it
inside the Java ecosystem even better
right yes make it play together so you
can
you can employ true parallelism and
concurrency in a safe way
safe means for example when you're doing
software transsexual memory so we are
you have like transactions that may roll
back because of a conflict then inside
this transaction you're not allowed to
do any kind of side effect you are not
allowed to go to the database for
example because that's only you should
only do this after you finished your
calculation right so and without any
conflicts so you have a piece of code
which must not do any side effects which
in other languages on the JVM beside
fake means you just have to adhere to
this kind of convention right and if you
do you get no warning not even a runtime
error but in fleiger if you try to do
this it will not even compile okay you
will not have any runtime errors because
you cannot run it because it doesn't
compile
that's the thing and I'm this is really
big it's it's a big thing for going
safely parallel and it's only possible
if you have a language that doesn't
allow you to just have a system out
print line anywhere in your code because
you cannot throw in the statement
anywhere in your code in big it because
you don't have statements they are no
statements and no control structures
either so there is no if for for or
whatever your only that's what topic of
this morning
you're only constructing your
application from pure expressions okay
and that is that sounds crazy so if you
start thinking about next Monday I not
use any kind of statements or control
structures in my code how do i code at
all and interesting thing is it's
possible and not only is it possible it
is even practical it leads to better
results that was kind of we are trying
to make this case we are trying to make
it a practical choice on the JVM to do
this kind of programming if you want to
you may start out only for curiosity is
it even possible and then you realize
hey not only possible it yields factual
benefits right but with high
facts you can show measurements how much
better that is and that was topic of
this morning and then tomorrow afternoon
we bring this over to parallelism okay
well that's what's really interesting
about the Java ecosystem right is
there's always new things that people
you can try and expand so that's always
interesting to hear of things I know
this isn't quite new but first time
we've discussed it and it's really
interesting to about your company right
so the consultants that you have the
employees that are there you know there
seem to have quite a bit of freedom to
for these new things right so how do you
find that is that part of your culture
built in or maybe share it is part of
our culture for me luckily as part of my
job my job is so-called fellow okay
which means I call it the Joker
yeah yeah so it means I'm I don't have
to deliver any kind of money to the
company directly okay that's quite
absolutely it is totally on myself what
I want to do right but for my personal
pride I organize such that my billable
hours make up for at least my salary and
for the remaining time I go to
conferences talk to interesting people
yes and do publications and so on and
look into new technical technologies and
this is where this Haskell thing came
from all right cool well thanks for
sharing that with me and the audience
and telling us about your talks and how
you're finding or a dev and your passion
for ative it is and I look forward to
visiting with you more over the next day
and a half or so that's always a
pleasure
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
