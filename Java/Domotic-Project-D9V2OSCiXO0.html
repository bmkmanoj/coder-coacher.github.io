Mexico and he's a job another nine kids
coming I remember for caesars
interactive in los ang tanan he works in
new york times easier from New Jersey
project that we went on is a whole
automation platform it's built on top of
a research project that Xavier was
working on which is a portal that allows
you to destroy something which is this
is a protocol developed using tomcat and
my sequel so there is a home gateway
Raspberry Pi which kind of a we have to
endure like an hour component diagram
here but but all the devices can talk to
a home gateway which is essentially
going on Raspberry Pi you can come to
get the devices there there are there
two kinds of devices one of the sensor
devices or like no even produce your
devices which will produce events like
temperature sensor light sensor or like
in a or proximity sensor for example of
somebody's on your gate so you can
censor the gate and you can have that
sensor like you know we pull the idea is
the server has all of the information
about each gateway we can have multiple
and multiples gateways between this
crazy son and plus well if I could be
undergoing it could be another kind of
device and the idea is that this device
can recollect all of the information
from the difference sensors or relays or
whatever that we have connected a
gateway and we get within that
information to the server and in this
every week
can internet and he generate some rules
to interact between one or different
gateways so we can read a rule that if
we have a censoring in Mexico in my
house we can interact with one another
group that is in in this part wait one
important thing is when is that the
gateway is open a connection open a
certain connection to the server so we
don't need to do to help axis directed
to this get with isn't about connection
lips the naked would happen the cold air
conditioned to the server so we can get
have access to whatever that we have
what we stay and to directly to this
girl well this is a no-fun but another
important part that we developed is that
this gateway we develop a bootloader
good order to create to to learn the
code from the server so in this in in
the Raspberry Pi we only have a very
short charge to go to two kilobytes this
is a good learner that a connect to the
server and the surrogate all of the code
and and start the Raspberry Pi if we
need to delay the server do today in
this case they get well we can send a
message to the gateway to and go down
and reload the code dialectically server
this is the process that we develop this
is a loser that we inherited from
obvious research and so I just think
this process has a logic of reading all
the devices that are in your home that
we need to that this colgate they should
be pulling for and this action server is
the servants will also will pose the
devices it sends it to the rules Urban
Roots
might have certain actions configured
against those and if there is an action
configure that loser will send it to the
action server and Action Center will
execute those actions which could be
turning the TC naught but we have that
is the only survey we can support the
locally locally configured target
devices that's what we're calling target
devices through GPI year programming or
the target events that are necessary to
reserve services services there's a
target devices that proves another
configuration that where we are
computing all the target devices that
need to that will be the recipient of
the targets that the root server will be
target action that the rule so we'll be
sending to the game the important thing
here is that we have a 3 concept one is
the context we have and we can create
contest maybe one context is when you
are in your house yeah I know context
when you are out of your house on in
maybe on game mode the country the
different contest because you have to
create rules but the truce has to be
associated to a Content a specific
context dependent you are doing in that
moment you can we help groups all of the
devices you can a group group that
device using different consciousness we
yell dynamic we can group travel good
the relays lamps security sensors
whatever that you can create you can
define different groups you have another
concept that is the gateway in this case
a chopper gateway in my home that is
offline is not connected in this moment
we have a gate with the first four AP
password by one that is that Laurel
fight we can have another Raspberry Pi
with pony with a patrol when we stay in
income we have a distance sensor the
distance sensor East is more than 20 we
can activate the fan weather
yes so long and so 22 it just just one
so too would we do the last few days is
that we added the gateway logic that's
running on the Raspberry Pi that's
actually talking to the rule server by
sending you by coating the sensor
devices and then update if there is the
status change sending you to rule server
then root servers running logic that's
sending to the word action silver which
is again on the Raspberry Pi that hey
making everything's because of these two
values change we need to run this
command and that action center which is
on your Raspberry Pi cause these lab
services or can actually trigger the
censorship they are connected on GPI
here but we don't have that biondello
gpio because we didn't have time to
learn pie for j yes when we stay calm we
can one either distances Morgan 20 and
then the problem will be a problem ok
yeah who does this is an</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
