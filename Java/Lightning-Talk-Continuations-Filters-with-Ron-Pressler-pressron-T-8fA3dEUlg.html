thing already yesterday in a workshop
but I'm going to do it again with slide
so we are starting work on adding
continuations and fibers to the JVM I'm
going to say is a not a promise so a
continuation or more precisely a
delimited continuation is an object that
represents a computation that can be
suspended or paused and resumed a fiber
is a lightweight thread it's B it
behaves exactly like a thread but it is
scheduled and managed not by the
operating system kernel but by the Java
Runtime or user code and it's
lightweight in terms both in terms of
memory and in terms of switching costs
and the fiber or a thread in general is
just a continuation plus a scheduler and
we already have a very good scheduler in
the JDK so we just need to add the
continuations and fibers are the main
motivation for adding continuations
although they do have other uses so why
do we want to do this now
mostly servers are now experiencing a
much larger number of concurrent open
connections and it turns out that they
spend much of their time just waiting
for i/o and the utilization of hardware
is generally very very low and
developers have two options either they
write simple easy to debug easy to write
easy to understand code which just
assigns a single thread per socket but
this code is not very scalable because
it's limited by the number of threads
that the operating system can manage or
they can write scalable code that is
asynchronous it's complex to write to
understand and to debug and not less
importantly it's very hard it doesn't
interoperate well with legacy code
and with other synchronous code in
general and with fibers you don't have
this dilemma anymore you can write code
that is simple maintainable and
interoperable but also scalable so even
if you have a million concurrent
connections you can assign a single
fiber or even more than that to each of
them and even existing code can be
relatively easily retrofitted to work
with fibers and it's going to make you
able to run write code that handles a
much larger number of connections on a
single server requiring fewer servers
and the key idea is that the language
runtime can make some assumptions that
make it much more suitable for
scheduling these lightweight threads
than the OS and that is why we can do
better than the OS so one of the ideas
it's not the only one is to have a fiber
class implemented in pure Java on top of
continuations that behaves like a thread
but both of them implement some common
interface representing the commonality
which is big between the two of them and
you can write code that is agnostic to
the kind of thread implementation either
either a fiber or a thread and if you
want to write a simple web server then
you do is you do is you do it just
innately as you normally do so you can
have a fiber that just loops around
accepting new connections and assigning
a new fiber for each of the connections
this is how we normally think of writing
writing a server but of course many of
us today don't do this way because we
know the blocking is bad but this just
makes blocking essentially free and and
under the hood it uses asynchronous i/o
and performs like a synchronous i/o
and we would want a common Java
programming patterns like servlets and
and jax-rs
to work more or less unchanged on fibers
fibers also open the road to new
interesting kinds of programming models
like channels or actors
my favorite is something called
synchronous programming not many know
what it is but look it up another thing
we want to do is to enable fibers to be
when they're blocked to enable them to
be serialized and that allows you to
tear down the VM while you wait for some
events or to move a running fiber closer
to the data so the idea is that hotspot
would implement a single primitive
continuation class that captures the
stack and implement fibers in Java on
top of it there are still some problems
with how to handle synchronize
synchronize and object weight and to
retrofit IO to work with fibers thank
