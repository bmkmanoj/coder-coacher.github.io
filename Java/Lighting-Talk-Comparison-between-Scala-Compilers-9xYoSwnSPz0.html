new Scala compiler dottie on average
twice faster than the current compiler
Scala c and the basic idea and the main
reason why it's faster is because we
organize our phrases differently so here
on the screen you can see the way how
normally in its previous caller c
compiler are phrases organizers so you
have something called macrophages which
takes the entire compilation units the
entire AST and is a black box does the
whole unit compilation you into Hall
compilation Union transformation in
practice you have multiple phases like
this so you have some a yellow taste
which takes the initial blue phase after
typer transforms it recreates a new tree
then the next phase comes transforms the
entire comparation free recreates a new
one and you have multiple phases like
those so in practice you're compiling
big files in practice that when the
yellow phase iterates over the blue tree
and starts creating the yellow tree a
lot of time passes and the blue tree
gets promoted to the old generation and
because a lot of time passes the blue
tree it's called for it every time it
goes deeper inside the tree its need to
do it needs to do a cold read by the
time it created the yellow tree the blue
tree is entirely in the old generation
and then the grid tree comes the green
face comes and starts transforming the
big yellow tree from the route every
time doing a cold read so that's why if
you try to profiles Colin standard Scala
compiler you don't see any particular
bottlenecks but for some reason
everything is equally slow the main
reason the main thing is if you take
intel vtune you will see that most of
the rates are called rates most of the
caches aren't helping us so what we did
instead ok so to sum up in micro macro
phases you're almost always reading the
cold data all the phases are free to
decide how they transform the tree and
how they traverse the tree creating the
new sub trees and because they do it
longer everything gets promoted the
whole generation it leads to interesting
design
decisions so for example in standard
Scala compiler there is a phase called
lazy wells funny enough it doesn't
implement lazy was so standard Scala
compiler has 25 phases because the
problem here is is every time you
introduce a macro face you introduce and
all this traversal of the tree all its
creation of a new tree and it costs you
a lot in terms of compilation time to
save on compilation time you will want
to reduce number of macrophages you will
start joining the independent
transformations together and then you'll
have a maintenance costs for it then
you'll have a phase which does multiple
things cough of which are not documented
you won't catch a small finger inside it
but there is a lot of code rounded the
doodle don't understand how it works you
touch it it breaks it explodes and even
battery if you don't have self
verification framework it exposed to
some bytecode to somebody in production
yeah so what we have instead is we have
mini phases our faces don't control the
order in which the trees are transformed
they don't control their order in which
trees are observed they we impose the
order that it's from leaves to root and
then we can take all the sub-trees
separately and pipeline them through
multiple phases at once because they
can't see the root of the tree they
can't see that it wasn't transformed yet
and we can recreate the trees early in
small parts they yet recreate the
trésor example the tree created by
yellow it just was created it's hot it's
in gang generation then the green guy
who exited it has perfect cash locality
and if it changed its a tree it dies
young it never gets promoted to their
old generation so the way it works in
practice is let's say we start with blue
tree and then we have the same orange
transformer he changes a small thing so
we have a yellow transformer who changes
the blue guy to the yellow guy dropping
the child that's fine then the green
phase restructures the small tree then
we have this new transformation and we
reconstruct the tree out of it so it's
an interesting model to code in because
some of the standard algorithm
which were previously able to decide in
which order they transform the tree now
need to follow the common pattern but
then it's very easy to understand how
they work as soon as they written you
don't have surprises from phases to do
strange orders of traversals and somehow
end up being exponential in some use
cases the trees are always hot you're
always fast you don't create much
garbage and that's why our footprint is
better than the footprint of skeleton ok
so I'm perfectly in five minutes so for
the interested ones i have several other
topics to cover so one is why how we're
able to develop the compiler faster and
move with more consciousness and be sure
that we're doing the right thing and how
do we do close relative limitations both
language specific and library specific
and how we do something very similar to
symbolic execution ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
