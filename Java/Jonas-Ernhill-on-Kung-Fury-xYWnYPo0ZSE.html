and i'm here with Yonah cern hill who is
one of the creator's behind the kung
fury independent film yeah thanks for
having me so tell me tell me a little
bit about the hunk fury film it's a
Kickstarter project kind of how did you
guys get it it all started with wanted
to make like a whole movie and I didn't
have the money for it so we tried to use
the materials that we already shot into
creating this trailer that will be which
we put on kickstarter in order to try to
get some money and we reach our goal
within 24 hours after we released it wow
really went viral so after 30 months we
got now 30 days we got like six hundred
thirty thousand dollars from around
18,000 people so we really notice that
people are really interested in this
project and we did get the funding to
complete all 30 minutes yeah and i think
the the sort of film you guys are are
doing is not something you could get
normal financing or like this is
something to give everyone we didn't
happen without a funding vehicle I
Kickstarter we actually tried to apply
for money before the Kickstarter but
everyone was like what the hell is this
like you can't make this into a movie
but after E kicks torium people really
notice that I'm people were interested
and really like stoked about it then
people wanted to like collaborate with
us yeah so that gave you the credibility
yeah take it to the next level so yeah I
think like the trailer was a good thing
because then we could like show instead
of just tell what we wanted to create
so I'm happy that we were able to do the
trainers and like show the concepts so
your primary responsibility the film was
you mentioned cinematography yeah we're
like three people who shares title it's
me Martin yeah the mountain mattias
andersson so we've been working in a
kind of untraditional way where we kind
of like try to decide like what the heat
shot should look like together instead
of like just one person deciding okay
yeah so our collaborative yeah and
Outsiders can't even imagine how we can
work like that but for us it's a perfect
nice and then you guys worked up like a
storyboard for the film yeah we have
like a really talented storyboard artist
called young naveed marks is I think
this an educated screenwriter from the
beginning so we really needed a
storyboard because like it's so much v
effects in it so I really had to know
especially work so much with me screen
so we had like this animated the
storyboard for the whole movie that we
so the storyboard actually was pretty
detailed before really detailed
otherwise I'm shooting it wouldn't have
been possible otherwise and I guess
there's a seems like there's a lot of
special effects in the film as well so
helpful all them I think it's 400 plus
VFX shots there's a bee effects house in
the Stockholm called Phaedo who like me
to most of the material so they work for
nine months and i think it was in total
around 46 people involved in the project
Wow so yeah it was nice like having some
professional people before feel the
garden wall was just like David the
store seeing it directs it wrote the
script and everything this time from the
beginning was to do all the VFX himself
but I think that's way too much yeah I
think it would probably be finished in
like 10 years or something like that
yeah so for the trailer yeah if you guys
actually do more of that work yourselves
for special effects of things yeah was
David and another guy called the Schloss
tucson we're sitting in from the
computers for like twenty-four seven for
two months or something like that Wow
just for like those two and a half
minutes so it was like yeah they wanted
to like crunch mode to like complete the
trailers we could like release it just
after Christmas so yes they were rushing
two together and a really short I didn't
have that much time to sleep them relax
serious like in from the computer the
whole time used to yeah that's crazy so
like I'm I'm Carrie semester on the
video stuff because I do a lot of kind
of run again video and audio stuff then
on my own so what what sort of cameras
or equipment we're using this year a lot
of people thinks that we use a lot of
fancy cameras we didn't have any money
so basically you're a typical DSLR
camera we used canon 5d mark two amor
we okay yeah they won't really comment
for like Oh schools to use for teaching
yeah we had like this 24 to 105
millimeter lens that we use the most but
also you have some better cameras like
some we shot some scenes on like red
cameras on the artery cameras as well
depending on if you wanted to do
slow-motion or for outdoors depending
what we needed but uh mostly material is
like from a technical materials here
canon canon DSLR shooters with some
cheap as soft boxes from China but as
soon as long as you have like the
imagination you don't really need those
that much fancy equipment to do stuff
yeah how about from you mentioned soft
boxes so what do you do for lighting in
the in assets like we had like different
themes for dependent where we were so
for Nazi Germany we try to manuals were
some really bright lights pretty high
ups we wanted a lot of lights coming
from behind them we thought about it
more dramatic job yeah exactly so we
talked about we didn't do any beauty
shots we just wanted to make sure that
everything looked dramatic so it was
like some scenes that we had lights like
oh this is looks really beautiful need
to change the lights this looks way too
beautiful so when we went bananas with
the color filters as well we watch a lot
of like the Terminator movies the High
Line removes just to get like a really
nice reference and it's like a lot of
voice that red light there oh just
because it looks cool so we try to make
it that way yeah yeah so kind of going
for a more dramatic effect yeah but less
realistic yeah so yeah it was fun like
usually when you shoot stuff stuff we're
supposed to look pretty and you can't
like use too much color filters but now
we can just go hey why with like our we
want more blue filters for red filters
yellow filters were there any were there
any scenes or shots in the film where
you you really felt like it was unique
or something you're proud of
basically everything it's so like
wanting it comes to like Swedish movie
making is more about like youth growing
up and it's difficult and hard and I
know find your sexuality or whatever and
this is like action movie with not that
much Depa so i'm proud of i love the we
do a lot of the effects stuff but a goal
of practical effects we had the chance
to blow up some miniatures and stuff and
that was really fun and we hope we
continue more of that stuff yes that was
that was really interesting for your
part yeah I you just feel like a little
kid but uh there's a lot of questions
like how do you get the exposure right
on a explosion so we have to like do
some test shots and stuff but it's fun I
want so how many how many times you do
to pull up the same I think we're like
one test maybe like two or three times
test different things yeah get it just
right but that's also scary freedom if
you don't get a good shot with then we
have to like reset everything and it
would probably take months and we don't
have money so the planning was like
really really important because like
this costs a lot of money we can't like
mess it up nice so do you have any plans
for a future project you're cooking yeah
hopefully we're working on a feature
script for a conqueror
the that has to take the time that it
needs we don't wanna if it's gonna be
like a feature movie we want it to be
even better than the short movie and I
mean let's face it how many good sequels
have you seen like yeah it's like the
second terminator yeah so when you
really need a good feature script before
we can even start talking about like the
how to make that movie come true yeah so
you're just like in the idea phase right
now yeah we have like I'm like outline
for the story but that mean you like
develop them with them down and
everything so it's still a lot of work
left until we hopefully can make that
that's pretty cool and how do you like
like speaking events like this at order
like the Aquino it's fun it's always
nice to talk about stuff that you do
know like the best conversation topic is
always yourself so have you guys given
other presentations like the one
described this is actually the first one
that me and Leopold has held together
but we heard that we look like an old
married couple on stage that's like the
best reviews I think it's a compliment
yeah but we're gonna have like I'm going
to actually go into Russian the end of
the month to talk about this movie so
nice just gonna be fun so we're gonna
have like some presentation gigs coming
coming up any have you guys noticed any
particular like geography where your
films done really well this date is
really biggest really went viral thanks
to Reddit and like the American audience
there yeah but it's been pretty
worldwide like well around 40 backers
who came to me when we were
the movie last summer they were from
like the states were from New Zealand
Australia Russia of like different parts
of Europe so that's the good thing with
like the internet is really if it goes
viral it's really like all around the
world we just had a global audience
really easily but we noticed that uh
it's a lot of guys around their 30s
likes likes it yeah probably oh well
vintage guys like me who grew up with ya
in those films yeah yeah by me like I
grew up with those films David the
Creator grew up with its them yeah
