oopah I'm a software developer at DNA
stack where we've built a called
platform for genomics our platform is
written primarily in Java so we've
started looking into what's new in Java
9 and I thought it would be interesting
to share this information so the goal of
this talk is to go through a couple of
my favorite API in Java 9 we're not
going to talk about modularity or
language improvements I feel like that
has been sufficiently covered elsewhere
well you're going to focus on our
library api's and particularly smaller
api api's that don't get get that much
emphasis or that I think are underrated
or just API is that make it easier for
it to write cleaner code so we're going
to take a look at the existing API
that's the collections API streams API
and completable future api's and the
improvements that they got in the latest
release of the java platform as well as
the new api is in the release and that's
the stack volker process handle and HTTP
to client and that's as far as I'm gonna
go with slides I feel like the smaller
api's are best explained using examples
so we're just gonna do a live demo and
we're going to write all the examples in
J shell and basically for each API I
would like to show how this was
approached prior to Java 9 will API so
we had available then and how this can
be done better in July 9 so I hope you
can all see this what you can see here
is J shell which is the tool oh really
yeah can we do something about the
lights here
has this not sure how to be honest
yeah I think we're we're stuck with this
is this readable yeah okay great okay so
J shell is a tool bundled with the JDK
and it's essentially Java implementation
of ripe old read eval print loop so it's
a tool that loops continuously reads
your input evaluates it prints out the
output so it's basically similar to
common line interfaces that you're used
to from other languages such as groovy
Scala Python they all had that before
and finally Java is getting one as well
it's a really good tool for when you
need to try something very quickly so
it's good for prototyping just exploring
you api's or learning the language if
you're new to java the main thing that
you need to know about J shell is that
it accepts two types of inputs there are
snippets
so the actual Java code that you want to
evaluate and there's commands to the
actualization tool which always start
with a slash and we're going to show a
couple of these for this talk but let's
start with something really simple I'm
just gonna do one plus one here you can
see two interesting things here first of
all one plus one is two
second of all two was assigned to
something called dollar one here and the
other one is an implicit variable that
J's all created for me and it does that
whenever you have an expression that you
don't assign to anything I could have of
course created my own variable I could
have just something she's done something
like this and this is the name of the
variable X and you've seen the first
shortcuts that I used here Michelle has
a couple of these shape tab and we
infers a type of variable from the
expression and then introduces a new
variable of that type I'm going to use
this extensively for the talk jeschill
also features standard tab completion
that you're used to from other shells so
I can take advantage of this where I
would say print out my variable
something like this and that's do so
there's a couple of syntactic shortcuts
as well you
Oh
that's good great yes so these are
syntactic shortcuts you've noticed that
I didn't need to read my expression in
anything it's just one plus one like
this I also need to didn't need to put a
semicolon at the end of my statement I
wouldn't need to worry about catching
checked exceptions and a couple of
things like that so this brings us to
the first command and that's worse which
simply lists all the variables that I've
declared similarly to days I can type
the methods and classes in J shell and
there's the respective commands for that
that's it super types but of course I
don't have anything here at this point
there's also lists that lists all my
snippets and Rochelle has this prefix
mention going on so as long as you
specify a unique prefix of a command it
can actually find the command and
execute it so I could have done just
something like this and the last meant
here is command help that just gives you
information about everything else that
you can do with your channel that's
pretty much all that you need to know J
was a tool is extremely easy to figure
out so let's move on to the first API
the first on the list our convenience
factoring methods for collections and
Java 9 makes it really easy to create
immutable collections of small sizes
this is something that was relatively
tedious to do prior to Java 9 and I'm
sure everybody knows Israel if I wanted
to create a set for example I would have
to do something like this let's say a
set of string and let's call it a set
then I would add a couple of elements
let's say like this and then to make it
immutable I would wrap it in an in a
modifiable set like this
and there are a couple of issues with
this approach first of all it's pretty
verbose so you have static variables you
need to do a static initializer block
that's not really convenient
there's also performance overhead this
is no really an immutable collection
it's more like an immutable view of an
existing collection so if I kept the
reference to the original set I would
still be able to modify it and there's
performance overhead associated with
supporting mutability not to mention all
the extra objects that I had to create
in the process just to get to the
immutable collection but that's much
easier in Gemini on Java 9 has static
factory methods on all the many
interfaces listed on map I can easily
create a collection like this it's
overall with a bunch of times 12 to be
exact so it's always 0 to 10 arguments
and then the last one is power arcs and
the reason it's done this way it's
because there's performance overhead
associated with creating the array to
back up the fire arc so if you're
creating reasonably small collections
which presumably is going to satisfy
vast majority of use cases you want to
avoid this panel thing so I can create a
list just easily like this let's call
this a list and then if I try to add
something to this list you can see that
really it's immutable it's gonna throw
an exception
similarly you like to try to get the
class it's going to tell me that
something immutable but an interesting
thing to note here is these immutable
classes are not really a part of the
public API so we can only rely on the
interface here and similarly the factory
methods are methods on the interface so
they're not inherited you cannot invoke
them for an implementing class so this
is pretty much the only way to create
this list and that's just a nice design
pattern to point out so first set it's
pretty much the same thing for a map
it's a bit different though for a map we
have eleven methods here so it's always
a zero to ten elements or in this case
twenty because you always specify key
and value interchangeably there's no VAR
arc version of this methods and that's
because keys and values can have
different types and you cannot have two
arguments the same method so what
they've done with this is actually
created a separate method which takes
just one var arc of my entries so
to take advantage of this I could just
create a map doing something like this
and I have a map where key is an integer
and value is a string and that's pretty
much all there is to know about these
factory methods so it's just a really
nice convenience feature collections
play very nicely when the streams API
which was introduced in Java eight and
streams learned a couple of new tricks
in Java night as well so the first
feature that I would like to talk about
here is a job while and take well
methods so let's just let's just go back
and have a look at what we could do in
Java
eight it created a stream of ins
something like this let's say zero to
nine and then just printed I'm just
gonna use a quick method reference here
and I have numbers 0 to 9 what I also
had available in java 8 were methods
lina done skip so i could do something
like this limit 5 which gives me the
first 5 elements of the stream and a
complimentary method scape gives me the
rest of the string so that was good but
the problem with this was that in
certain situations you don't know this
number beforehand you just know that you
want to keep taking elements while a
certain condition is met and that at
some point you have enough but there
wasn't really an easy way to express
this in java age in general 9 however we
have take well in job well methods so i
can specify something like this let's
say X is less than 5 and a complimentary
operation job while so these are kind of
like versions of limited escape that
take a predicate instead of a fixed
value and it's just really nice to have
this here another new method here is the
method iterate let's take a look at it
you can see that our two versions of
this method the first one was available
in Java age the second one was added in
Java 9 and the difference is the
predicate here so let's take an example
let's say let's say I want to list all
the even number
that are less than 100 now a very naive
approach to do this in Java age would be
to do something like this I'm gonna
iterate from zero let's increment by one
by two and then I'm going to print all
of these and the method reference here
just like this and you can see that it
kind of worked up not really because I
forgot a filter so I would filter this
let's say I think I said 100 I can do
this and this almost works and the
reason this doesn't work even though it
seems like a very simple example is that
I did filter the first 100 elements here
but I created an infinite stream so
after a while the stream kept going at
some point it went over and suddenly all
my integers were less than 100 there
wasn't really a good way of expressing
this boundary condition in July 8 but in
Java 9
I can actually easily do this I'm just
gonna remove the filter here I can add
another condition here something like
this this is going to work correctly so
if you look at it it reads essentially
like a four cycle and that's basically
what it is it's like a stream e5 version
of 4 so just a really really nice handy
feature here now the last method that I
wanted to mention here is method of
knowledge
so in Java 8 I could create streams of
certain specific elements using a
factory method I could do something like
this which would give me a stream
containing a single element and an
element is one what I couldn't do is
something like this which makes sense
because you don't want to have knowledge
in your streams
however in German I can do off nullable
pass now it'll actually gives me a
stream and if I have a look at it and
call the method count it tells me that
it's actually an empty stream so Gemini
is smart enough to treat now as kind of
an empty stream so where is it useful it
basically makes integration better so
you're writing along streams and you
have a
of chained operations especially maps at
some point you're gonna end up with
nulls and you will need to filter result
because you don't wanna have them in
your streams you don't want to have Mel
upon your exceptions so at some point
you will have a block with an e
statement or a ternary operator that
gets rid of these nails and that's just
not really nice coat you have so this
allows you to get rid of those null
checks just a nice convenience feature
there another API the plays really
nicely with streams is the completable
future api completable futures basically
provide framework for a synchronous
programming in Java they were introduced
in in Java 8 and they're kind of build
around the class called completable
future and as the name would suggest
this is essentially a future that can be
explicitly completed so what this is
used for is you typically use this to
model tasks particularly a synchronous
tasks in a bigger computation that
consists of many tasks so you can change
the status and the value of the future
and you also have IP is for creating
dependencies between futures so we can
express things like ok when this feature
is done triggered this action so let's
just have a look at the really basic
functionality here you can create a new
future let's say future of string so
let's call it CF then I can complete the
future with a value it might get a
string and you can see that now the
feature is completed normally and if I
try to extract the value it's actually
going to give me that value so what
happens if I don't complete the future
let's reinitialize this here and I'm
just going to call the get method direct
thing and you can see that in this case
it just keeps blocking and this so it's
essentially waiting for somebody else to
complete the feature from different
threads and that's basically how you
synchronize using this constructor you
can also complete the future
exceptionally which allows you to give
it a file in this case I'm just going to
pass any legal state exception for
example and now if I try to obtain the
value of the future
it's actually going to fail with that
exception they gave it so that's kind of
the basic functionality around
completable futures Java 9 introduced a
bunch of things quite a few actually
completable future is a pretty big class
almost three thousand lines of code and
it has a bunch of methods and a bunch of
public methods as well and quite a few
of these were added in Java 9 most of
them are not very exciting it's mostly
stuff regular methods factory methods
methods that make it easier for you to
subclass computable future and stuff
like that there are three however them
really excited about and Gemini and
basically provided a new way of
completing futures based on a time out
so in Java nine I can do something
something like this let's reinitialize
this here and can call complete on time
out which takes a value turned out and
then the actual time so let's say I'm
going to give it five seconds so now if
I have a look at this future not
completed yet still not completed and
now it completely normally and the value
is actually timed out so this is really
useful when you have sort of distributed
computation let's say you have a
computation that involves talking to
several micro services and for each one
of those you want to express something
like okay wait for this result from this
micro service for five seconds if it
completes that's fine if it doesn't
complete I'm going to load the default
value or load the value from cache or
something like that you can also fail
the future if something doesn't complete
in time I'm just going to reinitialize
this here that's accomplished through
the method or timeout which just takes
time so I'll give it five seconds again
and now if I try to get the value it's
going to wait for five seconds and then
it's going to fail with a timeout
exception so these are sort of two
methods that allow you to express time
dependencies
the final method that I wanted to talk
about here is the method copy and copy
essentially allows you to create a
defensive copy of a future so this is
really useful when you're designing a
synchronous api's where you're actually
returning completable futures you want
the clients to be able to take these
futures and respond to the changes in
these futures but you don't want them to
be able to write back you don't want
them to be able to complete the future
that you're using internally and that's
what copy does so it's kind of like a
one-way synchronization and let's take a
look at this let's reinitialize this
here and I'm going to create a copy
let's call it a copy and then you can
see that none of them is completed yet
obviously if I complete the original the
original is completed now and the copy
is completed as well so the change was
propagated for the client to react so
what happens if I do added a very round
let's reinitialize CF reinitialize the
copy and now I'm going to complete the
copy here and copy is done the original
didn't change so it's like a one-way
synchronization thing and that's that's
a really nice feature to have so I think
it's going to be really useful so I
think that's enough about these tiny
additions to existing api's let's have a
look at some new ideas in Java 9 and the
first one on the list is stack poker
stuck poker gives us easy lazy and
stream friendly access to stack traces
so prior to Java 9 I could do something
like this could have a fröbel and call
the get stack trace method and this
gives me an array of stack trace
elements so I print is here this is my
stack trace at this point in time there
are a few issues with this issue number
one this is pretty expensive it doesn't
matter whether I only the first few
frames or the first few elements of the
stack trace the JVM always need to needs
to eagerly capture the whole stack there
are also no convenience methods account
easily filter
out I can easily get access to the
actual class instances of the classes
that declared the methods and on top of
that I cannot even rely on this stack
trace to be complete the specification
says that JVM can omit certain elements
if it helps performance thankfully all
these disadvantages are addressed in
Java 9 through a class called stack
Walker so stuck Walker is actually
pretty easy to use you can just obtain
an instance here and the main method
here is walk that allows me to access
deck traces as streams so I can do
something like this I can collect this
stream and just use collectors to a list
and this gives me the full structure is
very similar to the one that we got from
the get sectaries method however in this
case I can take advantage of all the
stream operations so if I was only
interested in stack trace of that tree
for example I could just do a limit tree
this just gives me the top three
elements of the stack I can also easily
get access to to the class instances you
can install the stack driver to retain
the references and then I'm just going
to remove this limit here I'm gonna use
a map to extract this information so
I'll do for each frame
give me the declaring class and these
are all the classes involving a stack
trace so it's really nice it's it's a
great convenience API to have in Java
another API I'm really excited about and
I think it's actually probably the most
underrated feature in Java 9 for me
personally is the process handle API so
the new process handle API allows me to
easily get information about processes
so what we had available in Java prior
to Java 9 since gentleman 5 actually was
the process builder API that made it
really easy to launch external processes
so I could do something like this
process builder
and I forgot to close this command let's
say I want to list all the Java
processes in my system it's going to do
JPS start and this starts an external
process JPS now the main limitation of
this API is that I cannot get any
information about the process even
really simple things such as the PID
that's available in Java 9 but it wasn't
easy to access before the dish so what
people ended up doing is either using
jmx which is really hacky or they would
write their own tools so typically you
would call something like a PS and grab
and it would essentially obtain
information about the process from the
outside which is just really unnecessary
tedious to write not to mention all the
portability issues so it's really great
to see this finally resolved as part of
the JDK so JDK 9 provides an interface
called process handle which allows me to
get all sorts of information about the
actual process so I can obtain a handle
to my current process and there I can
easily extract the PID just like this I
can also get access to all sorts of
other information through the info
interface you can see this gives me
quite a few things and there's kind of
convenience methods for everything so I
think once that it's going to be used
pretty frequently it's common line which
essentially tells you how your java
application was launched so it's the
full full Java command all the arguments
everything so that's really useful you
can also get information about other
processes in your system so I can do can
do something like process handle all
processes which gives me a stream and
then I can extract some information from
this let's say for each process give me
info and then the command and then I'm
just going to collect this
and this gives me all the commands
running in my system another really
useful part of this API that's new in
Java 9 is method on exit which allows
you to essentially trigger an action
when an external process completes and
that's that's really useful so let's try
something here I'm just going to create
a process that has predictable run time
so let's call let's go sleep for example
I'm going to tell it sleep for 3 seconds
and I can just start the process and
immediately obtain the handle to it
and then I can call the method on exit
which gives me the completable future
and we've seen the API for computable
futures I can easily just do something
like then accept and there I will just
print I can just print the whole process
handle actually so the two string
they're essentially prints the PID so
just to recap what I'm expecting to
happen here is a process starts a
synchronously and then three seconds
later I'm going to see the PID of the
now-deceased process straight it's here
process started and now I can see the
PID so that's really useful and I also
don't need to limit myself to managing
individual processes I can build the
whole pipelines in the sense of UNIX
pipelines so I can express things like
take the output of this first process
and connect it to the input of the next
process let's just demonstrate this
really quickly let's say I'm gonna last
all my java processes and then wrapped
for J shell which obviously should be
running at this point so I can get us
create a process builder here and to use
my favorite JPS
and I'm gonna to call it Jake yes and
then I will just call collagraph for J
shell and let's call this grep and then
I can just throw these as a pipeline so
I'll just do start pipeline and you can
see that this takes a list of process
builders so I can take advantage of the
convenience factory methods here
I'm just going to do a list of JPS and
grab so let's call this pipeline so now
this is started synchronously if I try
to access it now it should be finished
and you can see that everything finish
correctly with the zero return value so
now let's try and take a look at what I
actually ended up processing so I'm
going to take the pipeline here and get
access to the last process in the list
which is index 1 and then I will obtain
an inlet stream to the output of the
process
I need to do the whole Java boilerplate
loop here so I'll just let this in an
input stream reader and I made a typo
like this and then rub this in a
bufferedreader and then finally I can
use the method read line
typo anywhere
oh here yeah thank you and I can see
that it found the process with this PID
that's called a shell tool provider
which is the actual process that runs
through a shell so that's very nice and
you can see how this is a real powerful
API and it's something that you wouldn't
want to implement yourself especially in
a way that works on all the different
platforms so it's really great to see
this as part of the JDK now the last
feature that I wanted to talk about here
is the new HTTP to client and yeah lots
of questions at the end
Thanks so the new HTTP client not only
provides a much cleaner API than the old
HTTP URL connection but it also supports
all the cool new things
it supports HTTP to WebSockets TLS and
everything that will expect server push
cookies proxies synchronous requests
that kind of thing new HTTP client API
is delivered as an incubator module in
Gemini which means that it's not
completely finalized and it's not
resolved by default and lives in a
special namespace but I pre imported
here into J shell so that we can play
around with it now to demonstrate the
client functionality I'm going to need a
server and if there's anything that
we've learned from previous demos at
this conference is that you cannot rely
on the internet here so I'm just going
to write a really quick one here in Java
and actually really like this example
because I think this is something that
people usually consider hard to do or
they assume that it's going to require a
lot of code in Java but actually you can
create a very simple server very easily
just using functionality provided in the
JDK and it's all the API that has been
around for a very long time so I will
just create the simplest possible server
there's going to be one endpoint that
just returns a fixed string so let's
start by creating an HTTP handler for
this endpoint I'm going to call it a
handler that's going to take an HTTP
exchange as a quick lambda here so I
will define the string that I want to
use let's call it body it's going to be
hello Java 1 and now I will set the
response headers I'm always going to
respond with 200 everything is ok I'm
going to attach the length of my string
here and finally I will ride the string
to the output so I will open an output
stream here let's assign the response
body here and too many brackets no it
looks fine and there I will just provide
to this output stream and I have to do
this through get bytes because it's an
old API but that's ok for demo purposes
and now I will just close everything
great so if you take a look here this is
our new handler looks ok so we can go on
and try to start a server so I'm going
to create a server here and this takes a
port so I will give it let's say 8,000
and don't need a backlog let's call this
HS and then I will create the end point
let's say slash hello and I will touch
my favorite handler to this and now
finally I can start a server so
hopefully the server is running and to
test this let's use the old HTTP URL
connection API just to see how how ugly
it was and how good the new client looks
in comparison so I will start by
defining a URI here it's going to point
to my local server so it's HTTP
localhost 8080 RI then I will convert
this to a URL so that I can open a
connection here and this actually
returns your auto connection which is no
good I actually want HTTP royal
connection and this whole API was
designed with multiple protocols in mind
even though HTTP is realistically the
only one that you would use so
unfortunately I need to
this here so I'm just going to do HTTP
URL connection let's call it C so you
can see that I'm just starting out and
this API is already really ugly now I
can specify the request method it's just
going to be a simple cut and this needs
to be passed as fast as a string again
not really nice no let's test if this
works
so do you get response code and I can
say that it's 200 that looks promising
so let's try and read the actual output
and again we need to do the standard
Java boilerplate stuff I will open we
will get the input stream from my
connection rub this in an input stream
reader I brought this in the
bufferedreader a lot of boilerplate here
and I can finally read the line that
says how much I want so that's great now
let's try to do this with the new HTTP
to a client so though the new API is
kind of built around three main classes
there's HTTP client HTTP request and
HTTP response pretty self-explanatory so
just start by creating the client here
in HTTP client and let's call this a
client then I will construct the request
which uses a builder pattern here so
I'll just obtain a builder give it your
URI that I had from before specify the
get method as a method this is really
nice and then build it let's call this a
request and then I can finally send the
request to my server so this takes a
request and something called body
handler here and I just want to tell it
in this case to treat everything as a
string and thank for there's a building
handler for this so I will just do body
handler
a string let's call this response and
now I can easily obtain information from
this response I can just do response
status code 200 response body hello
gentlemen
it just really nice really clean and
it's really flexible as well if I wanted
to make this synchronous all that I need
to do is change this send a sink and
this would return completable future
here let's just use this wait
okay one more time
let's call this a response and yeah that
looks good actually and now this gives
me a computable feature we've seen this
API before so I can just call it cat and
then body here it is I think as I watch
all one so that's really nice they also
have really nice handling around TLS
that goes way beyond scope of this talk
but you can do all sorts of things like
managing certificates and all that you
know very nice way and that's basically
it that's the overview of my favorite
API is in Java 9 so I hope you found
this interesting
before we go since I don't have any
slides I will just save this session
save the history of this session to a
file let's say backup J shell and I can
post this video later if you want to
come back to some of these examples and
that's pretty much it so we're close to
running out of time but we have some
time for questions but regardless I'll
be around until the next talk starts so
thank you and enjoy the rest of Taiwan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
