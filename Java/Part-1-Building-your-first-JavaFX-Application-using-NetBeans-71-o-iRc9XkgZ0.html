application using Java FX series my name
is Angelica Sarah and I'm an Oracle
technology evangelist so let's start
creating an application that I described
in the introduction for this series
we're going to start from describe from
an empty project I'm going to be using
for the whole project a netbeans ide 7.3
jdk FX application click Next you can
use any project name that you want it
I'm just going to use my C app you can
put it the location could be anything
that you want make sure that the create
application class is is selected so this
will create kind of an Eskimo tone for
your application and set as a main
project so what it's going to happen if
you have multiple projects that are open
at the same time the ones that can
execute a by default when you click the
Run button is the main project so
because we're going to be using this for
the next step for the next exercises so
I do suggest you to select the set as a
main project so this would be the main
project and every time we hit them the
run plot the run icon we're going to
actually execute this particular
application click finish and then we're
going to have my very first Java FX
application we can expand it and so we
see the source packages only one package
and my java application so this is
actually your very first Java fix
application so let's run it and see
exactly what it does so we hit the run
and again we have two applications open
the highlighted one is the default one
the main applications this is the one
that gets executed ok so this is your
first HelloWorld kind of application
when you are creating your Java FX
application you need to extend for the
application class so this is the first
line that you will see because now we
are back to Java API as you actually
recognize the
method from Java applications and we to
start the FX we use the lounge method
from application class we're going to
provide with any parameters that you
need in this case by default we're just
passing whatever we got in the Java main
and call which is pass it to this lounge
code when you run your application there
are a couple of things happening so we
do have a stage here it's called the
primary stage this stage is a top-level
container for your application
so everything that window that you see
here is your stage and then we have what
we call the scene and this is your
drawing area the drawing surface of your
application so any UI component will be
drawn on your scene that is this white
area right here so what we have is we
set the title for your stage for your
container in this case hello world
very simple we create a button here in
line 31 and we just set the text a say
hello world and we define some events
here so we have your event what we're
doing only is every time you click it
we're going to just print out something
on the output screen in this case it
will be the console we see more details
how do you define their events and the
handlers later on in these exercises
supreme us you click it and you will see
the hello world bed printed out in your
console then you see here that we have a
stack panel the stack panel will laid
out all the components in the
back-to-front stack kind of a container
and it will actually position all those
component all these children following
and specify alignment so it could be in
the center it could be to the right or
left is the predefined alignment that
you can actually set we are going to
modify this later on because we do not
want to have a predefined position we
want to actually place the component as
we want it so we're going to change the
stack and we're gonna turn it into upon
it we do that a little later and then
you have your panel and you add your
button into your panel so what is
happening is in Java
your your component I'll actually render
using a scene graph so we have to define
who is the route for that scene graph in
this case it's going to route is going
to be this panel that we just created
we're trying to do is add a component
into it and instead of overriding the
existing one we need to get the current
children's for that route and add it
into those children so that's what we're
doing here in line 42 we get the
children for route and we add into that
children's the bottom in this case it's
pretty trivial because there's no
children's we just created but is it
that's the way we're going to do it and
then from your state you have to set to
see this drawing area and it's destroy
an area we need to give a scene and the
scene is created by passing the route
component the root element of the scene
graph in this scale is going to be my
stack panel and we just provide an area
that we're going to use for this scene
right
finally we show the stage and this is
what we have here my hello were your
very first application so let's start
doing some changes so let's stop this
and the first thing that I want to do I
want to get rid of the bottom because if
you remember from the introduction we're
gonna show an image and I'm going to
comment out this particular line as we
mention we're not going to use step
panel I don't want my components to be
pre position or aligned in any way I do
want to have control because we wanna
actually associate bind the coordinates
of my image to the mouse so we see that
later so we're here we're highlighting
some errors and if I go up here some of
the inputs are no required anymore so
that's why they're highlighted in yellow
so a NetBeans has a really nice feature
that is it will fix them imports for you
so you can right-click in the background
and select fix imports it would remove
anything that is not necessary and it
will add the panel that we actually need
it okay so let's start defining the
components so we're going to display an
image
so we need an imageview are we going to
call it C zero okay is highlighting
again errors fix import right-click and
you just have it and when the tool
actually find more than one class with
that particular name is going to provide
it with the different options make sure
you select the one that is under the
same M package so make sure you have the
scene image image view ok selected okay
now so far my application is pretty
empty so we do not have any resources so
let's create here a package called
images images finish and one cool thing
about NetBeans is you had your favorite
tabs so let's add your favorite so here
in your project we have some options you
have projects you can see your file
system now you can see your services
we're going to bring some favorite that
is actually some pointers on some
resources that you use very often so you
have them handy so if I go to the window
menu you can actually select favorites
and right now I already have my JavaFX
but let's see how you actually bring
something to your environment so you
have your favorite you can right click
to it and you select add favorite it's
going to happen is is going to go to the
your directory and you can actually
select which one you want to add it so
you can say added nothing's gonna change
because it was already there but the
cool thing is here you will see your
resources your directory that you
mounted here you have it handy for doing
copy and pasting so here we have some
resources we're going to be using so we
have C 0 this is the image see one
another's image from the same and kind
of yellowish one will have a shark then
we're going to be using and we have the
close icon so we're gonna select all of
them right-click and we're gonna copy
those and I'm going back to my project
and I'm gonna paste that in today and
images back ok so now we have all those
resources available in my application so
let's go back to my program and what
we're going to do is we are going to
clear here C 1 C 0 C 0 equal so we have
a new we have image in net things you
have code completion so you can click
control space and it will actually
provide you with the choices that is
starting this game with ima and we have
image view ok we just double-click
you're going to create an image view
providing a new image again control the
space we do want to provide with a
constructor for this one in this case
and we want to provide with the input
stream ok and that particular input
string is going to be do your resources
so we're going to point to where C 0
JPEG is so we're going to get resources
so the resources can be taken through
your class name so C AB dot class you
select the class for your application
dot give resources as a stream and then
we Pro we provide with the string that
we need in this case we're going into
images as large and C 0 okay see we must
be missing something here so I'm missing
calm and that's it ok so now we created
now we need to display right so we can
go back to the scene graph to route and
instead of adding the button we're going
to add Z 0 we're going to leave the it's
the size of your windows the same and
let's run it so if everything goes ok we
should see an image now so the same
window and then there we have we have my
image and I can actually stretch this
and you can see there is a pretty long
image
so the next step what I want to do is I
want to create a window I want to clip
the image so you saw that is a pretty
big image so we're going to create a
rectangular area where you're going to
see through it and so let's create that
so in this case is going to be a
rectangle a rectangular area so they're
going to create a rectangle and it's
going to call c0 clip okay then again
click some imports right-click again
make sure you do not select the AWT
rectangle you need the fx3 rectangle
okay now we're going to define it
create a hit right here so C 0 clip
equal new rectangle remember control
space and okay and we are going to use
this one where we provide the size of my
rectangle then it's going to be 300 by
220 just a little smaller than your
window then what I want to do is I want
my rectangle to have rounded corners so
I can do this by calling the method set
arc with and let's provide it with 20
and also they hide until the space and
will actually finish it up for you okay
so pretty much does it so we create the
rectangle we set some properties for
that particular rectangle now what I
want to do is I want to set that
rectangle as the clipping area for your
image so I'm going to take C 0 and we're
gonna say set clip should be one of them
methods and then it's going to be C 0
clip onto the space okay so we set the
clip the rectangle area as the clip air
as the clip area for C 0 that is my
image and then nothing needs to be added
because what is actually being displayed
is the image field it does the UI
component so let's run it one more time
and now you can see your application if
we make it bigger we only seeing part of
the image remember we know the big image
is underneath we just seen through this
particular clip and we have the rounded
areas now I want to do something that I
love about JavaFX you can actually get
rid sometimes you do not want to have
this window around your application you
want your application to nicely blend
with your background so let's say I want
to see this window kind of floating on
my desktop so I'm going to get rid of
this window and this black the white and
background so what I need to do is of
course then we do not need a title for
this right we're going to get rid of the
title and we're going to set the this
top so we need the style control the
state in its style and we're going to
use a state stage style and there is one
style that is actually transparent so we
want my window to be transparent okay
then I'm going to separate because I
want to have the scene that we're going
to use that that that white area I want
it to be no I want it to be transparent
I don't want to see any extra space if
there is no components I don't want to
see that so because I'm going to set
some properties of this scene I'm just
going to take it outside here I'm just
going to create it so we're going to
create the scene here my scene we're
just going to create it exactly the same
right we don't need any changes to 15
okay then when we set the scene which is
going to use that one we just created
okay
and what I wanted to is I want to change
some properties of SAP that assault that
scene and is to set the field the
feeling and in this case is going to be
not in that case that means
I do not want to have any feeling okay
so let's try to run it again and
hopefully we don't have anything around
it so you see that we got rid of the
window that we have and we don't have
any white background anymore just my
component is being rendered so it's good
the only problem that we have now is how
I'm going to close it so let's move into
the next exercise and we're going to
play with events to be able to close
this application that is already running
we're going to use NetBeans for that you
can see here in the output window you
have this red area red square you can
clear it and your application will be
terminated
okay so let's moving to the next
exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
