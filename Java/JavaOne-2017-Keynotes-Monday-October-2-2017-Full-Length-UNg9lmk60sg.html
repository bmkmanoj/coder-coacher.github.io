please welcome George Saab
hi everyone wow that was an exhausting
run to get here welcome everyone to Java
one San Francisco 2017 I'm very very
glad that we're back here in Moscone
this year for the conference very
pleased to see so many familiar faces
I've already seen a lot of you I see a
lot of new faces too which is great and
thank you all for coming we have a lot
of very exciting topics that we're going
to cover today this is an exciting time
for Java as you're aware we've recently
released new versions of both Java SE
and Java EE and this afternoon you're
gonna get to hear a bunch of things
about those and we're also going to talk
about some of the things that are in the
future direction for Java over the past
over 20 years past 22 years or so Java
has grown it's matured and to the point
where the ecosystem and the resources
available are really unparalleled in our
industry and while Oracle plays an
important part is steward of Java Java
Strength is really something that comes
about because of a lot of people in the
community getting together working
together and collaborating in order to
to make it strong our first guests today
represent a number of ways that people
can get involved in the evolution of
Java and please put your hands together
and help me welcome Jackie and Mercedes
okay welcome so our first guest today is
Jackie Haines she represents Goldman
Sachs on the JCP Executive Committee so
Jackie why don't you tell us a little
bit about the JCP and and how it helps
make java strong sure thanks at Goldman
Sachs we have around 9,000 developers
working globally writing critical
applications for our business and many
of those are written in Java or run on
the JVM we've been part of the executive
committee for the JCP since 2011 to me
one of the key ingredients to Java's
continued success is the technical
specification and that's really unique
to Java the JCP provides a way for us to
take contributions to that and that's
really the key here the community
involvement okay and so that happens in
two ways one we ensure the quality of
that specification so that independent
implementations can be written by other
clients other people who would like to
get involved but two developers can
propose their own features to Java get
involved in a jsr and see that come to
fruition as part of one of the new JDK
releases my favorite example of that is
the date/time API that came out in Java
right excellent thank you our next guest
Mercedes Alvarez comes to us from the
Guatemala Java users group and also
representing J Dutchess so I went into
seeing these communities or environments
where we can share learn and grow up
together as developers and the J
Dutchess chapters are precisely that but
for the female sector it's a way to can
we grow up and increase the female
participation in the community and in
Java technologies but the most important
thing for me about the J Duchess chapter
is the easy way to change the future
because every female that be part of the
J Duchess chapter and has
role model in our society so we are an
example to what can be of women in
technology so we can inspire future
generation for joint careers in
technology and science we can say to the
world things can be done in a different
way and can't be better so that is me
excellent thank you thank you both very
much
as you can see java's value stems from
support and investment really across the
industry and just as Java is the result
of broad collaboration JavaOne is also
something that happens through the
efforts and the investment of a number
of sponsors our next guests in this next
section will will actually have some
words from one of those key sponsors so
I'm very pleased to introduce him I
think he has probably the coolest title
I've ever heard please put your hands
together and help me welcome the VP of
optimization from Intel Corporation
Michael Greene
[Laughter]
good afternoon Java one it's great to be
back you know data is the future do you
remember when self-driving cars and
talking computers were seen as
futuristic if not perhaps you should ask
Alexa or Siri when I was younger I
thought maybe just maybe in about a
hundred years from then this would be
possible
well the world has exceeded my
expectations what I didn't understand as
a kid was that data would be the key
enabler of such a futuristic world data
is to this century what oil was to the
last a catalyst of innovation and a
revolutionary leader of change data is
at the front and center of technological
advancements innovation and business
transformation across the globe
let's take cars for example the data
generated by cameras lidar GPS and in
the vehicle itself are essential to
automated driving we're looking at each
autonomous vehicle generating a box
approximately four terabytes of data a
day soon we'll be talking about data in
terms of exabyte points for what comes
after exabytes and Zeta bytes whether
individual users are massive enterprises
at every level data generator being
generated will be exponential from where
we are today this is a total
transformation across technology moving
from a compute centric to a data centric
world it's an exciting time we view Java
as a foundational technology to unleash
the potential of data and bringing in
this new future it's why we're so
invested and why we'll continue to be
invested for years to come we believe
Intel and Java to
together we'll deliver on three
imperatives created by this data
explosion speed skill and smarts speed
performance is everything in a world
where the difference between days and
months can mean the success or the
failure of a business or in extreme like
cases and medical treatment saving a
life skill in a world with twenty
billion devices as predicted in 20 in
2020 as predicted by Gartner operating
XK Liz critical to managing their data
and their businesses and lastly smarts
artificial intelligence will be the tool
that harnesses and converts a flood of
data into powerful insights and smarter
decisions increasingly these insights
will be made not only by people but by
the machines themselves there's a movie
of something about that machine's
becoming self-aware I'm sure you've seen
it so let's talk about speed speed
naturally improves throughput which
often leads to a lower total cost of
ownership let's take a look at what
intel's new class of xeon processors can
do for your applications in this video
so our newest hardware the Intel Xeon
scalable processors are designed to turn
on all this data into decisions faster
than ever with the Xeon scalable
platform Intel is delivering an
additional 65 percent performance boost
over our last generation this is the
largest generational gain in performance
in the past decade for emerging
workloads like AI it means doubling the
performance of the system we've also
worked closely with leading data Big
Data communities to optimize Hadoop and
spark for this newest Xeon platform the
result a 3x improvement in performance I
stood on this stage last year and told
you that a decade of accelerating Java
has led to a 73 X performance boost and
that we weren't slowing down I also said
that we would continue to add features
into Java that mattered to you what I'm
happy to say is that these efforts paid
off when we run financial services
algorithms on JDK 9 our latest int on
our latest Intel Hardware black-scholes
is three times faster Monte Carlo
simulation six times faster and for
Advanced Encryption up to 20 times
faster putting it all together our
newest Xeon scalable platforms and key
optimizations collectively result in
performance gains of a hundred and ten x
over the last 11 years that's impressive
Intel and Java are simply better
together I hope you're all taking full
advantage of what's possible with JDK 9
on our latest hardware clearly
delivering performance is core to our
business we must also solve the problem
of scale from large data centers to the
billions of devices and sensors on the
edge the data generated are growing at
an exponential rate creating a couple of
challenges
first of all data has to be stored in
access quickly if you want to turn
valuable business
insights valuable data into valuable
business insights and secondly massive
transaction volumes require a much more
flexible and scalable application
architecture in a world where data is
king computing requires advanced storage
and memory technologies the first is
Intel 3d NAND technology designed to
live to deliver double the capacity at a
lower cost and at nearly half the power
versus our first generation of 3d nan
that's good but we've done even better
even more exciting is our new in to
obtain technology enabled by 3d
crosspoint memory media
this is our first memory media
breakthrough since the 80s
enabling up to 10 times the density of
DRM with this new technology we are
delivering a new category of SSDs called
Intel Intel obtain SSDs and these
devices really fly we refer to them as
the world's most responsive data center
SSD it's easy to understand why when you
compare it to NAND SSDs it's up to 8
times faster with 40 times lower latency
well that's great we're going even
further
third Intel persistent memory will bring
the revolutionary Intel 3d crosspoint
technology that powers in to obtain SSDs
onto the memory bus in dim form you can
now remove the overhead of the
filesystem remove the overhead of the
device driver while keeping the byte
addressability of DRAM all while keeping
the capacity and the persistence of SSD
this is the best of all worlds as
exciting as the possibilities are for
this technology programming persistent
memory can be a bit tricky in Java
number one is heavy lifting to maintain
data structure consistency in a failsafe
way
and it requires access to low-level CPU
instructions to resolve these issues
we're happy to announce the availability
of the persistent collections for Java
this provides you an optimized and
easy-to-use set of common data
structures including persistent versions
of Lists Maps tables and sets it also
provides low-level functions for
powering for the power users amongst you
we have an early implementation of the
library along with sample code such as a
database example using persistent
collections and a low-level API example
please check it out
try it in your applications let us know
what you think we're always happy to get
your feedback your feedback is a gift
the demands of exponentially increasing
data require you to scale across
multiple nodes and clusters to manage it
all
whether you're delivering an e-commerce
site a streaming service or fantasy
sports league the challenge remains to
talk more about these challenges I'd
like to welcome a friend on stage chief
scientist of Alibaba system software
King some chow
nice to see a gay Michael ray it's the
same to you yeah what can you tell us
about alibaba's business and you know
how you're dealing with the challenges
of scale well that's a great question
yeah we dealing with the running with
lots of Java applications and running
about a hundred thousand Java
applications and million instances but
before I talk about that I want to talk
a little bit about Alibaba because
someone you might not be familiar with
what Alibaba is about so let me get
started they are there Alibaba has a
huge ecommerce site in China in fact we
are if you look at the economy of our
volume of sales we are about the 22nd
largest economy in the world
right behind Argentina that's impressive
yeah so what do you do to address the
challenges at Alibaba yeah is a great
question so in order to handle all the
business we have we have been using open
JDK a customized open JDK for our own
needs as we mentioned earlier we have a
huge ecommerce applications we need to
run and distribute them not only that we
also got some help from Intel yeah so we
put several important practice about JDK
9 and put them down to the Alibaba
changing a system we call a JDK and has
been running very well so far
so a JDK has been used to support lots
of Java applications in fact I mentioned
earlier that we have 100,000
applications written by 10,000 Java Java
programmers we have a huge presence in
Java and because of that we need to
customize someone is in Java so we built
our own JDK and right now we are running
about 1 million JVM instances in our
data centers well that's a lot of data
and a lot of compute so did you have to
do anything with the architecture to
handle this
well it is a fantastic question so in
order to support a scale we are we need
to deal with we we build something we
call the disability Ava's services on
top of a JDK and this means that our
always applications are modular Java
services they operate independently of
each other and each Java server is
running on a single process is handled
by a layer of communications among them
and these distributed services give up
these agility and scale we need so what
does that mean in practical terms for
your business yes so let me look at one
example here let's look at one single
day in China in fact is even called a
single day some of you might have heard
about that November 11th has been
redefined in China by Alibaba as the
largest online e-commerce festival it's
called a single stage because all these
singles they have been able to do so
they go online and take advantage of
sales and they buy a lot of stuff it's
very similar to Thanksgiving in the
United States so let's pull up some
numbers and compare them shall we ok so
last year the total online sales in the
United States on Thanksgiving Day Black
Friday plus cyber monday the total of
the spending there is twelve point eight
billion dollars it's a big number so
look at China people that you buy to
stuff in China for some reasons so they
generate sales in China on that day
seventeen billion dollars and not only
that in fact we need to process 120,000
payment orders at the peak of the French
at the peak of the shopping spree so
what does that mean so to give you a
comparison a major critical company that
at the peak of the purchasing they only
need to process about half of what we
need wow that's impressive
you know in order to continue managing
the growth of that of your business what
would you ask of the Java community
excellent so two things why is the
straight man I think so what is the
better the hardware performance the more
creative we can be we can distribute
newer services faster services so we are
very excited about all the performance
you have mentioned today we like all of
them so processes always sounds like a
good idea on top of that we are also
interested in learning how to use
persistent memory in our applications
secondly as we mentioned earlier that we
are doing large-scale cluster deployment
of our applications so you will be great
to have representative workloads for
distributed services that we can model
play with and then deploy in large scale
Wow King 'some thank you take a look
we're sharing with us Ali Baba's
challenges and challenging Intel and the
Java community to do even more okay
thank you nice meeting you
so as I've already mentioned when it
comes to performance of speed I feel
like we're gonna be able to take a done
on that one we'll continue to ensure
though that Intel delivers the absolute
best hardware for you and everyone else
to manage scale using distributive
micro-services while we're seeing an
increased focus on micro service based
deployments such as the one Kingdom
described today there's an industry gap
when it comes to tools focusing on data
movement and storage within and across
the system that's why today I'm
announcing that Intel is launching data
bench a new data centric work load the
data bench early release code is code
base is available for download and
collaboration right now on github
while the proof-of-concept framework
uses Kafka's SPARC and Cassandra we've
designed it in such a way that you can
easily integrate whichever components
you're currently using into this
framework our goal is simple we want to
turn it into a workload that represents
reality of how you really use micro
services so come help make it happen so
we talked about performance and scale
and now let's talk about smart when I
think smart I think artificial
intelligence society is being
transformed on a spectacular spectacular
scale machines that sense reason and act
can accelerate solutions to large-scale
deployments let's look at one
specialized form of artificial
intelligence deep learning it's
fantastic in that it can be applied to
big datasets and operate without human
supervision for real applications such
as image recognition analysis fraud
detection customer recommendations and
so much more in other words deep
learning can be a powerful engine for
producing actionable results but there
is a gap when it came to deploying deep
learning solutions on the same smart
clusters that many of us are currently
using
to run big data and analytics
applications I'm happy to say that we
introduced Intel's big DL solution a
distributive deep learning library for
Apache spark which of course runs on
Java technology here's a video to
demonstrate what big DL brings to deep
learning organizations everywhere are
developing deep learning applications to
derive new insights identify new
opportunities and uncover new
efficiencies unfortunately deep learning
application development often means
tapping into multiple frameworks
libraries and clusters the complex
time-consuming and costly effort now
there's a way to greatly simplify deep
learning application development
decreased deployment costs easily scale
your applications and achieve
outstanding performance with big DL big
DL is a distributed deep learning
framework organically built for Apache
spark that means you can more easily
develop deep learning applications as
standard spark programs using Scala or
Python and then run those applications
on existing spark or Hadoop clusters
without expensive specialized hardware
Apache spark enables applications to
seamlessly scale across Intel Xeon
processor based nodes on a massive scale
and big DL delivers extraordinary
performance across the Intel Xeon
processor based infrastructure by
leveraging the optimized Intel math
kernal library Plus big dl provides
support for rich deep learning and
delivers feature parity with popular
open source deep learning frameworks
such as cafe torch tensorflow and others
customers are already benefiting from
the power of big dl for example a major
financial services firm has developed
applications to strengthen fraud
detection and a leading manufacturer is
pushing the envelope on improved defect
recognition
big DL could be deployed on a variety of
big data platforms visit the link shown
here to learn more can't get tired of
the bong alright so big DL as you saw
the open source project it's available
on several cloud service providers as
you can see from the slide in fact it's
not just theoretical companies like JD
comm have deploy big deal with
remarkable achievements big big deal has
a growing list of applications and use
cases deployed we're encouraged by the
uptake and different use cases being
deployed please go check it out we're
enabling keep other capabilities as well
when it comes to AI among them is the
power of vectorization which we've
increased on our newest xeon processors
by adding the intel advanced vector
extensions AVX avx-512 specifically it
can accelerate tasks like modeling a
simulation and at Intel we've been
building this kind of capability into
our hardware since the 90s but as we all
know it hasn't been easy to take
advantage of it with Java I'm happy to
say that those days are behind us and to
share more about it I'd like to welcome
on stage
chief JVM Architect at Oracle John Rose
good to see you John
alright so John we've been working
together on several things been doing
pretty fantastic performance work
together we sure have Oracle and Intel
have been collaborating for quite a
while now on code quality persistent
memory garbage collection and of course
the libraries and as well as the vector
hardware you just mentioned I have
thoroughly enjoyed working with Intel's
brilliant engineers and with on all of
these projects we have gotten there much
faster than they would have on our own
you know on that note we've recently
been working on some pretty exciting
projects to give Java programmers new
tools and programs for Intel hardware
will you share with everyone what we've
been up to oh I'd love to
as you know Oracle's open JDK project
Panama was started to give developers
direct access to their hardware and now
we have a new vector API in Panama that
does just that complicated vector code
that used to require j'ni and assembly
code all that programming at the
low-level can now be done directly in
Java for example suppose I need to do
some image processing I need to quickly
run over my loop with millions of pixels
of course I want to use Intel's vector
hardware because it can work on multiple
pieces of data at once instead of the
usual single piece of data this makes my
code run as much - as far as 16 times
faster now I used to write my data
programming loops in classic Java the
problem was it didn't directly use the
vector unit we should do something about
that don't think oh yeah in fact we have
in fact with the vector API Java now
unleashes Intel's AVX Hardware making it
the ideal platform for accelerating deep
learning algorithms machine learning
algorithms financial services
applications scientific computing you
name it we know that making it easy to
add vectorization is incredibly
important it sure is
so what does it look like to a real
developer what does it look like like
you I'm a developer at heart and I ask
myself the same question I think we
should just show everyone here what
we're talking about you want to see some
real coding real demo
on stage all right well let's go take
let's go walk over there and I got a
laptop here see what we can do we can
hook it up to the screen and see what it
shows us all right look at that now this
was done on top of the Panama vector API
the idea is to transform the color of
each pixel of this series of images now
for comparison we'll do it the slow way
and the fast way first I'll show you the
slow way this is the loop that works one
pixel at a time as you can see everybody
reads code here
this is classic Java there's a three by
three matrix in there and it's doing a
transform okay here's the fast loop that
that works with the vector API and it
does eight pixels at once and you'll
notice that the two loops look quite
similar this is no accident makes it
easier to replace one by the other with
this code I get direct access to the
Intel vector registers and operations
look at those V mul PS instructions in
there aren't they beautiful let's see
what it does all right let's run this
baby all right I'm gonna press the
button I'm going to start up the loop
and what it's doing now is the images
are being processed one at a time each
image you see on the screen represents
thousands of individual processing tasks
the gauges on the right-hand side show
how fast it's going and see how fast
that top row went oh my gosh it's
already finished well why don't we run
it again meanwhile the vector loop the
non-vector loop the scalar loop is
chugging along trying to catch up one
more time you know these vector loops go
really fast you can get a lot more done
in the same amount of time hmm okay so
which loop would you want in your
application right and you are seeing
this correctly the gauge is there show
about a six times speed-up you know this
was really only possible because we work
together and the future is bright for
the Java ecosystem because of
collaborations like ours thank you
Michael well thanks to Intel John
it is great to have an incredible
partner like John and Oracle so to make
this simple we were really excited by
what we're what was able to be done and
in fact we're so impressed that when I
saw a powerful this vector API is then I
told my team we needed to get it out to
every developer right away
even while we're still in development so
I'm announcing the availability of the
vector API developer program accessible
today go to the URL where you will find
more extensive introduction to AVX
technology written in developer friendly
language meaning you won't understand it
unless you're a developer and you can
check out John's image processing code
as well Wow we covered a lot of ground
on how Intel plus Java will enable the
future speed we continue to improve
performance and our latest generation
processors scale we've added new storage
and memory technologies to help address
the challenge of computing at scale
smart with the addition of vectorization
that you just saw and machine learning
we've made it easier to use Java to
extract insights from vast pools of data
this was all done by providing
improvements and code samples to help
you the developer to quickly take full
advantage of the increased platform
capabilities we have an opportunity to
usher in a new world a data-driven world
I look forward to collaborating with you
in the open JDK community we are better
together thank you and enjoy Java one
thank you Michael and thank you Intel
over more than 20 years over two decades
javis continued to bring value to
developers and enterprises worldwide
thoughtful evolution has helped Java
grow into the most vibrant programming
language on the planet moving forward we
want to ensure that Java is
well-positioned for modern development
and growth in the cloud and our next
speaker is uniquely qualified to talk
about how Java future direction will
help you through this transition he was
a lead developer on AWS at its inception
and he led development at giant for just
long enough to have been cured
completely of any no js' religion he
came to Oracle debt and he architected
the bare metal cloud and now he leads
overall strategy for Java and and the
cloud and container native please put
your hands together and help me welcome
Marc cabbage
all right thank you all of you thank you
George thank you Intel we were super
excited to be here Java and Java one
really or by you and for you we have a
ton of stuff to talk about are there's a
lot of new content a lot of fresh faces
including mine and we're gonna talk
about the future as George said right
because those stats that he put up
they're fantastic but they're today we
need to be building for tomorrow and
actually even if we take an honest look
at where we are today all right we can
apply that actual famous red muck boat
that we all know and love
right when when companies grow up they
turn into Java shops that tells us
something though it tells us that people
are writing is something else first and
rewriting in Java we need to change that
right maybe it's no js' which apparently
you can be reformed from maybe it's
something else but we didn't want the
next decade to be Java first Java always
right that's all we want you to think
about it it's where I talk about how
we're gonna get there there's four
themes we're gonna come back to again
and again throughout this keynote and
really there weren't to use as guiding
principles for ourselves in the Java
group number one is openness right this
is self-evident to technologists
transparency is important in today's
world it's more important than ever and
actually we're just gonna show you about
this we're not gonna talk about it that
much then you would evolve evolution is
actually really hard right it's like
it's very easy to add things it's hard
to change things it's nearly impossible
to get rid of things but you have to do
it right with the use cases that existed
22 years ago aren't relevant today the
things that exist a year ago may not
exist next year
so we have to change we have to get
there really quickly you have to be
nimble as we do this right we get things
wrong we have to get it right to get it
right quickly last we need to continue
to scale right scale is easy for us as
engineers to think about but it's
petabytes of data or requests per second
or a number of JVMs that you manage but
it's also about people right George head
up that there are 12 million Java
developers out there which is awesome
but tomorrow we want there to be a
billion developers so that's the world
we need to be building for let's talk
about how we're gonna get there start
with Enterprise Edition all right this
is huge news from us this year eight
here brings you modernization of the
platform there's amazing stuff in it
HTTP to to a sink API is reactive api's
helps you modernize the platform but
that's not good enough
right we actually need to do a lot more
to modernize to get you to that world of
cloud and micro services and serverless
reality is EE is the bedrock of mission
critical systems it does power
enterprise and if we look at why it's
not getting us there actually if we
apply those themes it's actually pretty
self-evident right is it open
well no it's a vendor consortium the
last I checked those aren't that open is
it nimble well shift four years ago
that's not very fast so we're gonna
change everything about this right we
put out this news a few weeks ago people
have been very very receptive to it
we're super excited about it we're
fundamentally opening up Java Enterprise
Edition right cool so we're moving it to
the eclipse foundation right we're gonna
change everything we've got actually
gotten a lot of questions about this I
don't think people are quite clear it's
gonna be everything right the reference
implementations the tcks that was a huge
one people didn't expect authorship of
specifications importantly control we're
gonna be heads down over the next few
months getting to a 1 dot over release
there but it's gonna be that's that's
gonna be a new day for it right so
that's gonna set it up for the next
decade to help us modernize but I want
to make sure you don't just hear this
from Oracle right you've heard this kind
of stuff from Oracle before I want to
make sure you hear from all of our
partners right so what I like to do is
bring out three of those leaders of the
community along with us you hear all of
us saying this together so please
welcome David Blevins Rami tribe Iain
Robinson from IBM and Mark littell from
Red Hat
alright thank you guys so much for being
here
so we'll kind of do this as panel style
so we all you know here we all say it
together brothers-in-arms David we'll
start with you right so you've been an
open source for over 20 years
you've built a fantastic career or
fantastic company out of it what's your
perspective on what this change means to
the community at large well I think that
when you look at our industry
we're filled with so many passionate
developers some of them quite young the
thing that I can't help but take away is
you're inheriting EE and so in a very
real sense
ee for J is a EE for the next generation
and the other thing is collectively you
make the biggest investment in EE which
far exceeds what we collectively put put
in it and so you having access to the
tcks that if you have a problem you can
go straight to the test and get them
improved it raises the bar on us so this
effectively makes our largest investors
enabled to fuel EE and we can all go
faster I think in the end awesome
all right so Ian IBM obviously one of
the largest vendors we're probably one
of the two largest vendors in Java and
Java Enterprise Edition on earth what's
your perspective what this means moving
to the Eclipse Foundation
well the Eclipse Foundation I think is a
good choice it's the one that IBM picked
for example when we open sourced our j9
java virtual machine we've had it's
called j9 but it's actually been IBM's
JVM since the Java 5 days so I think
having you know both the low-level JVM
and the Eclipse and the enterprise
platform both that eclipse is a really
strong endorsement for Java development
top to bottom at eclipse and I think
there's a you know there's a there's a
couple of there's like a lot of
advantages I think that yeah that that
this has two people from a couple of
different perspectives David already
mentioned the TCK is access to the TC
cache which is great for developers but
for for people building solutions on top
of java re' I think having you know
having this new community fired up with
energy and I think is you know it's it's
it gives them encouragement I think that
the future of Java EE is strongly I
think the only word of caution I would
have
is that having just open-sourced open j9
and our Enterprise open Liberty runtime
that took us a lot of work that took us
a year to get us there so you know
there's a lot of work ahead but but I
think we're gonna be successful there is
a lot of work and we have a lot to do
right so mark Red Hat obviously
instrumental and creating micro profile
along with these guys on stage a lot of
people in the community what's your
perspective from micro profile and Red
Hat on what this means I mean you're
right we create micro profile over a
year ago moved it to eclipse we've seen
a great groundswell in interest and
participation since we moved it to
eclipse for very reasons that you
mentioned earlier that we can be more
nimble and we can react to changes a lot
a lot more quickly moving e4j to eclipse
I think allows these two big communities
to come together and help to drive
Enterprise Java
into the next decade as you mentioned
earlier awesome ok so what I want to
make sure you all understand with all of
us on stage is
please come participate right we cannot
do this alone it cannot keep being a
vendor consortium so the Charter is open
into eclipse foundation please come
check it out there's a mailing list
there's a Twitter foundation there's a
panel which I'm sure will be
action-packed right after this
importantly stop by the Red Hat booth
the Tomi tribe booth the IBM booth the
Eclipse booth the Oracle booth please
come talk to us please come participate
all right thank you guys so much for
being here thanks
all right so let's move on let's talk
about Java SE right so 9 is here 9 is a
transformation release for us right it
brings you over 150 new features
streamlines the JVM importantly there's
a lot of support in there for things
like Linux containers gives you better a
management honoring of cgroups memory
settings also it has modules which I'm
sure you might have heard about and
modules really are this amazing thing
they're gonna let us turn the corner let
us evolve right for you they mean you
can get just enough Java just enough JVM
in your life you can right size the JVM
very important for a cloud world for a
dynamic world for us that means we can
finally evolve the platform in ways we
could not do before literally couldn't
so we think modules really are this this
linchpin that's gonna get us to that
future again is Java 9 enough no it's
not what if we apply those themes again
look at those frets talk about openness
first but I came to this group what I
was told was open JDK that's a place not
a thing that's not open enough so now
open JDK is a thing going forward we're
going to be producing open JDK binaries
under the GPL license you truly now have
a free and open java that you've never
had before it's number one number two
you might be saying well you open JDK
the Oracle JDK there's one of those is
better than the other maybe I have to
use the Oracle JDK today that's true
right the Oracle JDK is commercial
features in it these things parley
powers some of the most entirely systems
on the planet some amazing technologies
for help you run Java at scale but today
they're only available to an elite few
and for that billion developers they
need to be available to everybody so
going forward we're going to open source
all of the features in the Oracle JDK
there will be zero difference between
the open JDK and the Oracle JDK that's
I got one more cool so we truly now have
an open Java right but it's actually
still not enough because we think about
pace right the last time it shipped was
three years ago that is not fast enough
so now that open truly free Java that we
just spoke about it's gonna come at you
every six months right so now this we
think actually starts to change the
future of Java this we think starts to
put job in the forefront of everyone's
minds
certainly ours but also people that are
not currently writing Java we think this
brings it to a new future that is not
previously existed before so what I want
to do those make you not hear this from
just me not from Oracle I'd actually
like to bring out mr. Java Renaissance
himself James governor from Redmond to
give you his perspective James come on
out
I only have one slit you only have one
slide all right I'm not gonna have a
next slide mom all right I'm fine thanks
hey everybody how you doing pleasure to
be here the last time that I actually
stood on the main main stage at JavaOne
was bacne the distant past back in 2004
so who all was here in the Java
ecosystem at that time yeah I think this
probably some of you that haven't
haven't quoted admitted but you've been
around that long but um I sit here and I
said something that was kind of
contentious at the time I said that the
JCP was the worst form of governance for
software apart from all of the other
ones that we've tried now it's kind of
interesting we've seen this long path I
mean at that time obviously son was was
still around
things have changed pretty dramatically
and in fact what I think is interesting
is that things have changed in the Java
ecosystem probably more in the past
three weeks than they have in the
previous 13 years this open source move
I think we really can't underestimate
the significance of it if we're gonna
have a chance for the community to
flourish if we're gonna have a chance to
really expand I think the ecosystem it
was necessary that Oracle took these
steps I think one of the interesting
things has happened over the past few
years is the adoption of java by the web
companies so first generation web
companies have been obviously amazon
very much a java shop google tons of
java obviously they have go and other
languages now but what's perhaps more
surprising is those web companies that
said look actually we don't like Java
we're gonna we're gonna be ruby and you
know twitter we're gonna do ruby we're
gonna do ruby that was until ruby
wouldn't scale far enough they adopted
Java Facebook again they came out from
the wall say oh no we're not interested
in Java until they became one of the
biggest two Duke shops on the planet so
they've been in big change but it's very
very important to those web companies
that have an opportunity they're all
making open source contributions now
things like in tracing Zipkin across the
board we've seen
contributions Kafka began as a project
from again LinkedIn so the fact is is
that you've got large web companies that
want to make contributions they want to
be part of this world but they haven't
really got involved with Java because it
wasn't as open as they might expect they
also felt that it wasn't moving as
quickly as they might expect you know
they're coming from world of continuous
deployment well if you tell me it's
gonna be three years before the next
version they're not so interested in
that you know developers tend to have a
certain degree of a DD they want
something new they want something bright
shiny and fast so I mean one of the
things as Java developers that you want
to think about is where do we go from
here
am I the new to the ecosystem where I've
been around for a while how relevant are
my skills so Redmont my company we do a
programming language rankings that is
every six months we do it it doesn't
necessarily change that fast so we've
we've kept it at that time frame and
basically what we do is we scatterplot
conversations in Stack Overflow against
what's happening in github and it's been
very very interesting to ask at a time
what a lot of people would say oh
perhaps the job was not as much a part
of the new world you might expect that
it is performed with strength over time
and continues we genuinely see Java and
JavaScript at the top of the rankings
there are tons of cool new languages out
there there's developers that are like
oh yeah everything's gonna be rust or
everything is gonna be go Copland's this
cool new thing in Java but the simple
fact remains the Java language and not
just the JVM are a thing so let's talk a
bit about the JVM I think why did those
web companies decide that they needed to
adopt Java poorly because of the skills
there are so many skills available if
you're hiring people out of computer
science chances are high they've got
Java skills there but it also gets back
to something that I I mean you know it's
it's it's all very well and good to talk
about you know move fast and break
things but who likes to sleep throughout
the night there you go so I have three
kids and so I've had various times in my
life of which I don't sleep through the
night but but generally you want
something you can rely on something
that's stable and what those companies
found was that in fact
in terms of observability performance
traceability and just the ability to
manage something overtime Java and the
JVM had a real value there isn't really
anything out there that replicates the
power of the JVM today so we can
accelerate the language development and
begin to make it more like the modern
developer expects and that's what the
challenge is for Oracle then you know
this this sort of this plenty of runway
to go and I think that'sthat's the
lesson it was very important that the
open sourcing happened and yeah we've
got a new version of Java coming out and
that notion of a six-month cadence is
gonna be a big big deal so hopefully in
a couple of years we'll be here we will
have had the low-hanging fruit done and
a lot more development in Java the
language thank you
all right it's it's actually super
validating for us to hear that I hope
you're as excited about the future of
Java as we are what I like to do now
after hearing that from James is
actually move on a little bit and talk
about cloud I talk about job in the
cloud this George said at the very
beginning there's 55% of JVMs today are
connected in the cloud somehow we need
to build for a world of a hundred
percent right that's tomorrow because
clouds pervasive doesn't matter what you
work on cloud is in your life if it's
not already now you come to conferences
like this or you know open world or
technology conferences in general you're
gonna hear a lot about the business
value of cloud right things like optics
and capex and elasticity then all those
things are true let's talk about a means
to deliver developer right this is a
developer conference to me when you boil
it down cloud is about building a
distributed system at the end of the day
all right those are hard they're
actually super hard the change is the
way you have to think the change is the
way you have to tool changes the way we
build deploy scale operate our services
this is what I'd like to do is actually
talk to you about what's an ecosystem
and what we're gonna do in Java itself
to help you in the cloud what I'd like
to do is make sure that we have a common
frame of reference for this right talk
about one of those hyper scale web
companies that James mentioned the week
that we all think about so they've never
been in a job of one before their new
face as I said there's gonna be some
fresh ones of those but they're gonna
come talk to us about their architecture
the challenges they've faced
what was hard what's still hard and
importantly why they've used Java so
please welcome to the stage Nicholas
Gustafson he's the principal architect
of Spotify
thank you so much for coming necklace
thank you very much
hey thank you very much for having me
Spotify is a music streaming service we
aim to provide our music you are users
with the music they love on the
platforms where they exist platforms
that might include the ones you see in
the picture here but also embedded
platforms like TVs or Playstations or
stereo receivers we also want to give
our users the features that they want in
order to be able to discover and listen
to the music they want since we launched
in October in 2009 as a small Swedish
startup we've grown pretty quickly and
we're now at in in 61 markets around the
world having most recently launched in
in Thailand we're at more than 140
million active users but if you ask me
what I think is even cooler than that is
that we handle more than 3 billion
streams per day and we have more than 4
million requests to our back-end per
second now dealing with this scale turns
into a pretty interesting and
challenging technology problem as as you
might imagine
Spotify started out as a Python back-end
and you already met James he heard mark
mentioning this this quote of his and
this is very much true for Spotify while
Python was an awesome way for us to get
started and to build out Rebecca as as
as we were a young company
we ran into some pretty constraining
scalability concerns we had one service
though at the time that was implemented
in Java it was our search service it's
actually still around we noticed that
during the scalability incidents that we
had it behaved in a much more stable way
than many of our other services and the
JVM had this nice property where we
could actually observe what was
happening in runtime if that was
collecting runtime metrics on the
platform itself or if that was profiling
the serve
while running in production both were
very effective ways of knowing what was
actually happening to the service one of
the very early and argue the best
decisions that we've taken architecture
wise has been to design our back-end as
a set of small single responsibility
share nothing services what the pattern
that is now known as a micro service
architecture as we decided to start
exploring Java and a little bit later in
moving over to Java being able to do
that incrementally service by service as
it made sense was a crucial way for us
to to be able to do that that change
having small services also means that we
can as humans easily understand and
reason about them we can scale them
independently different features that
Spotify is very different interaction
patterns and the the services that
powers the features needs to be scaled
in different ways we also have it also
means that we have limited impact when
we actually have failures so a service
might fail for whatever reason but only
a subset of the feature set of Spotify
or only a subset our users might might
notice like if the search service would
fall over that will only affect search
functionality on Spotify not streaming
or play listing or whatever might be the
case and lastly it enables us to have
ownership of a service firmly within the
team that builds that service so you run
what you build and that closes that
important feedback loop in between
developers and operations the picture on
the right in this slide shows a very
high-level view or architecture you can
see the perimeter services which are
exposed to the Internet they're very
hardened and they manages things like
authentication of requests to our
back-end and we'll route requests down
to services further down the next layer
is what we call the aggregation layer
this is services that deals with things
that are very
close to what you would see in our
clients one-to-one representation of the
views in our clients these services are
stateless and they don't do anything on
their own so they fan out to the lowest
layer where we have services that do the
actual data processing and storage then
as responses get back the aggregation
services will create the view that we
serve back to the client in a format
that is easily consumable by our clients
all of this runs in a complete clone in
multiple data centers around the world
for us to be close to our users to have
low latency but also to be able to do
full data center fail overs during
large-scale maintenance or or incidents
and this is something that we do
actually fairly frequently we're not
only using two JVM for our back-end
services we also use it for our data
processing and machine learning our data
processing framework is based on Scala
it's called Co it's been open sourced
it's a way to build pipelines that run
on tops of Google's data flow and
bigquery cloud products we schedule
these using you know another open source
framework called sticks which is a
docker scheduling framework and this is
it has enabled similar to what I
described from our micro services for us
to scale data processing and machine
learning to the scalar grants so this is
a logical equivalent to our micro
service architecture for it but for data
processing if any of this tickles your
interest I'll be running a session in
just a few hours so feel free to come
along if you want to hear more details
around how we think and build our
back-end services and thank you very
much
all right thank you so much Nicholas so
if you've been in the space for a while
I've been working on cloud systems for a
while you see that like an architecture
of the sneak peak that Nicholas gave you
you realize we all have the same
problems right we all have to build
effectively the same thing to solve that
same challenge again and again right we
have needs this like this thing that
helps us get a distributed kernel and
distributed substrate but if you don't
already have one and your estimate or
should I build or you have one it's long
in the tooth and what should you next
our opinion to Java our opinionated
Oracle is you should use kubernetes but
it is the right open source building
block that abstract away clouds abstract
away infrastructures gives you this
distributed substrate to help you build
resilient microservices we're taking a
big bet on it we've put a lot of people
on the kubernetes project we announced
several kubernetes focused cloud
products earlier today on the other side
of the fence at open world we're doing a
lot with it we actually think it can do
a lot for Java to sort of like to do is
have you hear from a subject matter
expert on kubernetes why this is right
for Java developers why this is the
platform you should build micro services
on so please welcome Craig McKee Craig
is the CEO and founder of hep do hep do
is the startup focused on bringing
kubernetes to the enterprise but what
makes him as an expert is craig was
actually one of the cofounders of the
kubernetes project during his time at
Google so Craig thanks so much for being
here
stages yours
well thanks so much for having me here
folks it's really been an exciting three
and a half years since we started the
Koopa news project and what we set out
to do back in the day was to bring a lot
of Google sensibilities around building
and running applications to developers
like yourself
I personally was really inspired by the
idea of providing a better framework to
run applications that developers can
focus on code and expert systems
underlying the the application languages
could deal with a lot of the manatees
and challenges associated with running
those applications when we set out to
start this project we knew it wasn't
enough to just write a letter from the
future to enterprise developers we knew
that we needed to create something in
the open and make sure that it worked as
well with relatively traditional
workloads as it did with the
forward-looking progressive dynamic
workloads that ran inside a technic
umping like Google and so kubernetes
over the last three and half years has
emerged as pretty close to a standard
and it is an open source container
Orchestrator so for those of you aren't
familiar with it it's worth just
breaking down those three words open
source obviously is critical it's
becoming increasingly important to
organizations of all sizes as they're
making decisions about the technologies
they know that open source provides both
an incredible force in terms of driving
innovation but it also buffers them from
the Lockean which is increasingly
important containers have become an
amazing way to simplify the operations
process as you're building applications
they provide an medically sealed highly
predictable unit of deployment so you
could take your application in this case
a java application package it up with
all of its dependencies and predictably
deploy it out into a variety of
environments effectively decoupling it
not only from the environment where it's
running but also in some ways from the
operating system that it's running on
there creates very high levels of
portability and then orchestration is
the final piece and this is where much
of the magic is by using a dynamic
Orchestrator you can rely on an
intelligent system
deal with all of those operational
mechanics deploying scaling monitoring
and reasoning about your application now
what this means through the Java
community is actually pretty significant
if you think about the old world you'd
have middleware that would be
responsible for writing your
mission-critical enterprise applications
what we're starting to see is that
middleware getting teased apart almost
polarized into two different pieces
we're starting to see the emergence of
systems like kubernetes as a standard
way to run a lot of the underlying
strizheus systems components effectively
stitching together a large number of
machines that can operate as a single
logical ideal computing fabric and then
what we started to see is a lot of the
other functionality getting pushed up
into application level libraries that
provide a lot of the immediate
integration that you need to run those
applications efficiently and outcome of
that is pretty significant in that it
now opens your java applications up to a
polyglot world they can coexist side by
side with applications other languages
if you want but more importantly it
opens up them to a natraj inist world
where you can enter leave these java
applications with a lot of dependencies
that they might rely on so you could run
a Cassandra database for instance on the
same core infrastructure using the same
underlying Orchestrator that your
application uses which is very powerful
what that means at the end of the day is
that as you have a lot of enterprise
concerns like governance risk and
compliance you can rely on a simple
single consistent underlying framework
to deal with those problems for you and
as a result kubernetes is effectively
creating this distributed systems this
is a distributed systems operating
system a natural environment we can run
not only a java applications but
anything else and you can do that in a
way that is perfectly decoupled from
your cloud provider it works just as
well on premise or in the cloud gives
you a great degree of choice and
flexibility around where you want to run
those applications now as we look to the
future there are a set of challenges
that exist when you're starting to move
away from relatively traditional large
structured applications into this more
modern micro services based environment
that kubernetes naturally pushes you
towards the first and foremost of those
is the weight of Java if you want to
move into this environment that is
intrinsically
more bite-sized it makes sense to have a
mobile sized runtime environment and
it's very heartening to see some of the
work that's being done to reduce the
weight and spend up time associated with
Java so that you can actually get these
more dynamic applications running
another result of that intrinsic
dynamicism is the need for higher levels
of and introspect ability you start to
live in a world where JVM your java
application is no longer tied to a
single physical machine so to really
understand what's happening and to be
able to diagnose things in these new
worlds you need higher levels of
vlogging observability you need to have
access to structured information about
the application to have a better sense
of what happened after the fact without
necessarily tying that to a single
physical machine it's also hardening to
see some of that coming out in this very
conference the third thing that I think
a lot about as we look at this
environment and and the needs moving
forwards is the libraries themselves as
I said kubernetes provides essentially a
distributed system environment an
operating system for applications and
while it is relatively uh opinionated it
does offer up a certain set of
primitives that are necessary to allow
an application to find another
application access it and consume it and
I would love to see over the coming year
or two a lot of focus on making much
more natural Java Runtime environment
integrations with the underlying
kubernetes substrate the final thing
that I think about a lot when it comes
to the Java community is a little bit
nuanced when many people start looking
at Linux application containers they
think of them largely as a replacement
for virtual machine just a way to
package up and run something but if you
look back at their origins historically
they provided a very robust and rich
resource isolation framework a way to
tease apart the set of resources that
would be a scientist something and allow
you to pack very densely a number of
applications onto the same set of
physical infrastructure and one of the
most heartening things that I'm seeing
coming out of conference is a lot of
effort to make cgroups integration much
more natural into the Java Runtime
environment so I'm very excited about
the future of kubernetes I think it's a
very natural environment for you run
your java applications if you're
interested in learning more I'd
encourage you to go to the website
kubernetes dot IO and if you
want to get closer to the community feel
free to take a look at the cloud native
computing Foundation which is a
vendor-neutral home where the kubernetes
project and a lot of new cloud native
technologies are being honed thank you
so much for your time and have a good
day enterprise music it's um kubernetes
in your life call Craig before we move
on what I'd like to do is give you some
helpful information about how to get
started with Java and career Nettie's we
put this together so worker Oracle
acquired them earlier this year it's a
fantastic container native CI CD service
lets you get some containers in your
life importantly get some kubernetes in
your life it's where we've launched all
those kubernetes services I mentioned
we've actually put together our they're
a curated set of Java getting started
guide tutorial quick steps libraries to
help you get some Java into containers
and into kubernetes so this by the way
there's a community edition completely
free no strings attached there will
never be strings attached
so hopefully you find it useful if not
let us know if so please let us know
alright this Craig said he totally spoke
a lot at the end about observability and
operations I think that's what we should
talk about next we talk about cloud
services because operations are
fundamentally hard they're one of the
hardest parts of building distribute
systems and importantly if you don't
really know this or you've never done
this before that way think of them that
way now importantly though like
observability we always need more
information we need more insights right
we can never have enough we have tons of
data but we need real-time information
now the set of the beginning of this
talk that we're open sourcing all of
those commercial features in the Oracle
JDK one of those things happens to be
Java flight recorder if you're not
familiar with JFR JFR is this amazing
like super Swiss Army knife to let you
diagnose any JVM or any job application
right you can see in real time what's
happening up and down the stack you can
do with no performance overhead so it's
fantastic but we need to help you scale
in the cloud and they help you with this
in the cloud so what I'd like to do is
actually give you a sneak peek at a
service we're building in the cloud to
help you manage JVM to scale help you
give you real-time diagnostics so please
welcome for my team Varun Madden and
George Matthew to talk about this thank
you Mark
we're super excited to be here today and
share with you all a service that we've
been building for a while now the
service is focused on making container
narrative development in Java simpler
debugging any issues that you guys run
into much easier and just helping making
your applications more performant I'm
sure almost everyone over here how to
deal with profiling applications and
Matt kind of referred to this Java
flight recorder makes this really simple
for a single JVM but the problem grows
as we move to the cloud and even more to
micro-services as we all are doing right
now the issue is no longer just what is
my performance issue but we need to know
when it's happening and where exactly is
it so I would like to introduce a
container diagnostic service that helps
you do exactly that
this service runs in production it's
always on provides real-time data with
very very low overhead it gives you the
depth of data that JFR provides and the
breadth across the service Gorge here
will actually give you a live demo of
the service now cool thank you very
there's my screen so quick note about
the setup for this demo I have three
replicas of my service running on a
cobra nettie's cluster with the
diagnostic service gathering continuous
chair for recordings of my service now
one thing I'd like to re-emphasize that
Verne already touched on is that this
diagnostic service is a very low
overhead service that's designed to be
running continuously in your production
cluster because like he said you don't
know when the problem is going to show
up where it's going to show up or that
you even have a problem now JFR has this
has a lot of very useful and deep data
but today I'd like to focus on the on
the issue of memory leaks so if you look
at this graph up above it shows you
memory usage by each of my pods right
after garbage collection and it looks
like two of them are doing okay down
here but one of them is having a little
too much fun and using up more memory
than it should probably means it has a
memory leak now we do a lot of
interesting analysis on this data that
we gather from J afar so that we can
find the problems for you and you don't
have to go looking for them
so let's go look at this analysis tab to
see what we found I know how we did find
a memory leak and as you suspected it's
only affecting one of our pods Jeff for
has this cool new feature that tracks
the lifetime of a sample of allocated
objects and using this data we can tell
which objects are hanging around on the
in the JVM for longer than they should
so let's dig in and see if we can
pinpoint the source of this leak it
looks like in this case we have some
samples of a byte array hanging around
for longer than they should and if we
click into an individual sample we get
very detailed information we get a stack
trace showing us exactly where in our
code this object is allocated and a
reference change showing us the chain of
references that's preventing this object
from being garbage collected so let's go
look at the code so it looks like line
63 here of my leak appropriately named
leak work item class is where I allocate
this object
let's go to line 63 right there is where
allocate the object no surprises there
let's go back to the reference chain it
looks like this hash set right here in
progress items is where I hold onto
these references and if you look closer
it looks like I do add reference to add
these objects to the hash set and remove
them but it turns out that I forgot to
override equals and get hash code in
this class which is causing the leak now
if you've ever had to troubleshoot a
memory leak issue in production before
you know how incredibly difficult that
can be and how much easier this is and
this is just the tip of the iceberg when
it comes to the power of JFR and we're
excited to bring you all of that power
to troubleshoot your production systems
thank you thanks George this was just a
sneak peek of a small little thing that
we demoed over here if you guys are
interested there's a much more in-depth
session tomorrow morning 8:30 I know
it's early in the morning but believe me
it was your time thanks everybody thank
you
oh cloud which is serverless all right
it's not everybody's mind today but if
you're not familiar where the service is
this compute abstraction that takes away
all notion of infrastructure from you as
a developer it applies to many things
applies to compute databases to storage
but importantly we talk about applying
service to our code to what we deploy we
think of it as functions of service all
right and it's it's kind of a beautiful
model right because it lets you focus
purely on the logic of your code purely
on business logic not worrying about
infrastructure not worrying about that
like muck that's in your system and
importantly gives you an amazing
economic model too but again having
worked in the cloud space for AI you
look at this and honestly where we are
in the space of the industry is actually
pretty nascent right what's out there
today is literally triggers for the
cloud right every cloud provider has got
one of these things something like a VM
goes up the VM goes down it publishes an
event to a bus you get some code that
executes so you can take some action the
super helpful it's amazing for that use
case but it's easy to be tricked into
thinking that's an app dev platform when
it's not right the fundamentals of
computer science are always with us
right things like concurrency and
synchronization and state management
these are hard for any reasonably sized
application or reasonably sliced micro
servers you need something better to do
that what you need to solve those
problems is what Java was exists
invented for in the first place right
you need a language 22 years ago Java
solved this problem is why it is where
it is today for running on top of an
operating system whether there was linux
solaris windows whatever we talk about
the distributed operating system right
then going to the cloud we need a
language to help us with those problems
so we're super excited to talk about
what we're doing next we're gonna talk
about an open source project we're
creating that is container native
completely language agnostic but there's
importantly an exciting java layer that
we're putting into it to solve those
problems so what I'd like to do is turn
the stage over to chatter a remover for
my team to talk about what we're doing
so Chad stages yours
thanks mark my screen I am super
thrilled to introduce to you the FN
project the FN project today consists of
three components number one the FN
server the FN server is the foundation
of your functions as a service platform
it's what enables developers to build
deploy and scale functions in a multi
cloud environment it runs locally on
your laptop so you can get dev prod
parity working locally both in the cloud
it's fast scalable and container native
number two we're announcing the FN Java
fdk or function development kit the Java
ftk allows you to easily bootstrap your
job of functions it gives you a data
binding model to bind the input to your
functions two common java objects and
types and finally we're announcing the
oh and finally it gives you a test
harness to test all of your functions
using j-unit rules so I don't want to
forget that and finally we're announcing
FN flow flow is a system that enables
developers to build higher-level
workflows and orchestrate your functions
in a more complex environment you get
things like sequencing and chaining
parallelism fanon fan-out air handling
state management all from the language
of your choice today of course we're
announcing that Java is the first
officially supported language that's
actually what I'm gonna demo today so in
order to show this we built a demo app
called Vista if you look at this
application it consists of five
functions and basically what it's doing
is pulling images from Flickr of cars
detecting the license plate on that car
getting the actual value of the license
plate used in the open ALPR library
which is an open source library and then
it uses open CV to draw a box around the
license plate and send all of that
information to both Twitter and slack as
you can see we have a number of red
arrows here and those are no no's that's
where we have hard-coded invocations of
each function from the previous one in
order to call them it's almost an
anti-pattern when it comes to micro
services
functional developments enter FN flow FN
flow gives us a programmatic way to
remove those hard-coded indications and
move them into their own function called
a flow function what we've done is
decoupled all our functions from each
other and now we're back to the proper
architecture for functional development
let's take a little bit look at some
code the first thing we'll notice here
is that it's short sweet and simple it's
really a great thing if you look at the
top we have our scraper that we invoke
little lag here once we integrate once
we invoke the scraper we get back a flow
future object that flow future object
implements the standard completable
future API that was introduced in Java 8
along with that API comes a number of
promises like methods that gives us all
the nice workflow that we want such as
then compose then composed add steps to
the compute graph and returns a future
that represents the completion of those
steps once we do that we get basically
the nice fan-out capability that I
talked about before so then we fan out
and we run the plate detection and we
also run draw and once we're finished
with that we run all of which gives us
both the Twitter and the slack function
which posts to those and when it's
complete we have a win complete method
which then tells us whether it was
successful or it failed that's actually
something that I had no concept of
before in the first version of Vista
because we had no concept of a complete
workflow so a couple things I want to
point out of course this looks like a
single Java program in fact it can be
reasoned about just like a single Java
program we can test it we can use j-unit
we can put breakpoints we have our
familiar IDE it's a single function
codebase but behind the scenes it's
being broken up into sometimes hundreds
if not thousands of function invocations
in fact every step is a different JVM
that we're running in a massively
parallel environment so you get all the
benefits of the functions as a service
system such as the economic model of
only getting charged for the
milliseconds that these things are
running massive parallelization and also
the operational benefits without the
complexity of dealing with
functions of the service system and one
other thing to note any variables that
were created inside the enclosed scope
whether part of the heap or the stack
gets reconstituted in all future
invocations of any functions inside that
scope so it's a very powerful concept
that no other workflow system gives you
today so I quickly plugged in the
internet right as I came on stage so
we're gonna see if I have Internet but
we're gonna try and run a demo yeah I
was on the Wi-Fi before don't ask me why
so if you look here all I have is a
simple payload JSON file it's just your
standard JSON three input variables
license plate car USA we're gonna pull
20 of them and because FN the functions
actually take standard in as their input
it's very very simple I can actually
take that payload and I can pipe it
right into FN call FN call is a wrapper
around curl which hits the server which
in this case happens to be running
locally on my machine and then my app
name is my app and it's flow so once it
starts running the first thing we'll
notice on the left is a number of
functions are starting to spin up we see
that we already have a couple running we
have a number of complete and in the
middle this is the flow UI which shows
here I'll make this big which shows the
fan out so at the top we have let's make
this bigger we can see now we're
starting to fail this is a visual
representation of all of the functions
that are being sequenced and ran from
each other including the nice fan-out
capability if I click on any particular
node for example this one I can actually
view the entire call stack of how this
particular function was called this is
really extremely powerful I have it was
composed from detect plates here's the
log that I got from detect plates I can
view all the way down to the scraper
which is what the first function is in
our sequence all the way down to the
flow function and if we look on the
right of course it's already finished I
wasn't able to show much but we get all
of our images in slack and finally it's
finished scraping so I know this demo
was extremely fast but I hope that you
got to see just a sense of how powerful
the f-m project can be and why we're so
excited to announce it to the Java
today thank you this is gonna be open
source right that's the plan mark is it
open source right now it isn't well it
probably should be like weird Java one I
say we do it let's do it all right open
source the Epping project right now oh
there it is
here we go alright we do this was gonna
happen well I'm in the danger zone
alright hopefully my two factors Oh No
okay don't worry that's an advertisement
for one password boom it's open its open
source right now thanks
alright so please go try it out but
we're really excited about where this is
going
FN project i/o by the way if we didn't
say the name so please come try it out
please give us feedback please come
participate in it now one thing I want
to say about this like the last thing I
want to say on this Chad showed you this
demo it's a super amazing demo I I get
chills every time but he talked about
the completable futures API right and I
think the way to think about this is
think of this is like a v1 right this is
our first step we talked about setting
up java for the next decade imagine we
can do we actually apply the language to
this in a much bigger way which is
actually an excellent segue to the next
of our talk so what I like to do is now
transition to talking about where we are
at Java 9 on the VM and where the
language might be going and who better
to do that then the one you know and
love mark ryan hold the chief architect
of java mark come on out
thank you Mark hello everybody welcome
to Java one job at 9:00 is here that
means yeah
that means the jigsaw is here III heard
those boos in project jigsaw we set out
nine years ago believe it or not to
solve two fundamental problems in the
Java platform one is the brittle and
error-prone class path the other is the
massive and monolithic JDK I'm sorry I
need to interrupt right now and ask for
the prompt screen to come up when when
the DSM's
or I can just totally wing it
yeah I've done that before
at least it's not a demo fail we'll get
to those later
all right thank you very much no I'm not
done don't worry
all right so if these two fundamental
problems we address both of these
problems together by employing our
standard recipe for evolving the
platform identify the missing
abstraction figure out what it ought to
be add it to the platform in a way that
fits it well with everything else that's
already there and of course while doing
that preserve drop as key core values of
readability simplicity universality and
compatibility for these two problems the
missing abstraction as we all know by
now is modules what is a module well
it's actually pretty simple at a high
level a module is a set of packages
designed for reuse in jigsaw modules are
a new construct of the java programming
language they work the same way at
compile-time and run-time because
they're known to both the compiler and
the virtual machine this greatly
simplifies development you declare a
module in a module declaration it's a
little bit of Java code
you give your module a name you name the
packages that it exports for use by
other modules the modules that depend
upon it and you name the modules upon
which it depends whose packages it will
use where do module declarations go well
they're Java source code so they go in
little Java files by convention these
are named module - info dot Java files
what do we do with Java files we compile
them you compile one of these files you
get a little class file the use of class
files here is is intentional it was
somewhat controversial but it's
intentional because it makes it Masek
it makes it easy for existing tool
chains to adapt to this new world to
package up a compiled module for
distribution all you have to do is make
sure that the module info dot class file
is in your jar file right there at the
top level then you have what we call a
modular jar file so the module system
helps escape from class path hell
because it provides a cleaner and safer
alternative to the class path that is
the module path
when you put modular jar files on the
module path the module system can
guaranteed two key properties when you
compile or run your code these are
properties you can't even express on the
class path much less ask to be
guaranteed the first property is
reliable configuration reliable
configuration means if one module
requires another then that other module
will be present and none of the modules
present will conflict with any others as
an example here we have our module comp
who live again note their use of reverse
DNS for the module name that's the
convention we're trying to establish
Campu Lib requires a module named com
futile so the module system goes off and
finds it and establishes the proper
connection between them now suppose the
confu Lib also required some other
module called Kongfu whatever but there
is no comm for whatever well what
happens when you try to compile this
module at compile time you get an error
message error module not found come
through whatever if may become for
whatever used to exist but now it
doesn't at runtime you'll get an
exception module confu whatever not
found required by confu Lib
the second property guaranteed by the
module system is strong encapsulation
strong encapsulation means the code
outside of a module can only access the
classes and interfaces in the packages
explicitly exported by that module this
means you can conceal your internal
api's and change them whenever you want
to to continue with our example suppose
there's some code in kombu Lib that
instantiate some secret internal class
in the confu util module while you try
to compile that you'll get an error
error message sorry that's not
accessible
if you matter if you've somehow managed
to run it because maybe come through
what it would compute and come through
foo util used to export that package but
now is it no it doesn't then you get an
exception the illegal access error and
note in these exception messages we put
a lot of information to help you
diagnose what went wrong so reliable
configuration strong encapsulation this
is a much saner world than the brittle
and error-prone class path the module
system helps with the massive and
monolithic JDK that's because we've
taken the module system and applied it
to the platform itself starting with
this spaghetti bowl of tightly coupled
platform components after years of
painstaking refactoring we managed to
divide it into a set of 26 standard Java
SE modules I'd like to call your
attention in particular to the Java base
module there at the bottom you might
notice that there are no connections to
the Java based model module I haven't
drawn them in because every module
implicitly requires the job a type base
module that's the module you always have
to have it has important classes in it
like java.lang object and java.lang
string so all those connections aren't
draw but grande but basis already is
always there and of course base does not
depend on any any other modules the JDK
of course has these modules plus many
many others including models for the
standard development and debugging tools
service providers and JDK specific api's
since we have a modular platform we now
have modular dock Javadoc which I'd like
to show you
there we go so this is the front page of
the of the Java 9 Java doc II it gives
you some guidance up front is divided
into three sections SC the JDK and Java
FX at the bottom you can see it's
organized this fit therefore this front
page is organized by modules so you can
go click around let's look at look at
the Java base module here we go there's
the base module it's got a bunch of the
usual stuff in it drop IO java.lang I
was all those important things we can go
back say and look at what's another web
no not that let's look at a more
interesting module Java dot sequel
rosette so see Quattro set is more
interesting model because it depends on
some others we can see that here the
export packages that it exports and then
later on we have in the Javadoc a
specification of what are the additional
modules that it requires intern and if
you just want to get to want to learn at
a glance what's going on you can go up
here and there's a little hover bowl
thing here you get the an image that's
shown you and this is actually generated
by the JDK build zoom in on it if you
like that shows you the subgraph of the
module graph for just the java sequel
rosette modules means if you require
Java sequel rosette you're gonna get all
of these others ok if we go back to the
deck please
all right since the platform is modular
it's now scalable most applications
after all don't need all of these
modules and now we can reliably
configure consistent subsets of them for
example if we have a module that just
needs the job at a sequel module and
whatever else
Javad a cycle happens to need we can
configure a custom runtime system that
contains just those all the other
modules just fall away we produce these
new these custom runtime systems with a
new tool in Java 9 called j-link GABAA
finally has a linker it's it's an
optional step but it's a very important
one we switch back please
all right so I packaged up a little demo
here let's take a look at it it's org
open JDK hello hello world I know very
very original let's take a look at the
code so this is a tiny little web
application about the smallest you could
possibly make here's here's the ears the
main class the only class in fact this
uses the built-in comm SunNet HTTP
server API it's been in the JDK for a
few releases now very handy if you just
want to want to whip up a little a
little app that talks to the web I want
to explain all the boiler boiler plate
here but the important part is the one
the method that makes the content and in
response to any request it doesn't
matter what its gonna build a little web
page that that says hello modular world
tells you what time it is and gives you
a list of the modules in the running
image so it's just using the stream API
to get a stream of all the modules and
then format them nicely it uses the Java
sequel timestamp class just for
amusement in order to show the time of
day
let's take a look at the module info
here we go very simple module he
requires two others Java Seigle JT JDK
HTTP server and it doesn't export to any
API is because well it doesn't need to
it's an application okay let's compile
that I've just pre packaged up the steps
here to make it easy now we've got org
open JDK hello jar we can look at that
look at that and we see inside we've got
just not only the traditional manifest
but our module info class okay now I
could run this directly but what I could
what I'm actually gonna do is run it in
a docker image I'm gonna make a little
docker image here there's a little
docker file that just runs this this
hello world app on the class path using
JDK 9 this is using that the early
access build up JDK 9 that you can get
from Oracle 4 out for alpine Linux so
it's it's more compact let's make that
docker image
don't worry their message is normal goes
off if that's the doctor thing add stuff
read stuff da da da whoops
no let's run it and let's see if I go to
localhost
hello modular world this message brought
to you by all those modules only a
handful of which we're actually
necessary alright so let's look at
something let's do something better
let's make let's link a custom image
this custom image will have just the
modules that we need so I'm using the
Alpine Linux build the J mods from there
that's what this depths with this the
module path up here is specifying I add
the modules that I need I tell it just
for amusement that there's a launcher
command named hello and I do some
compression and drop the header files
and skip debug information to make it
small so I've got a custom Gary here if
I look in its bin directory it's got a
little hello command along with Java and
well keto Tiki tool because and it's
nice and compact 33 megabytes right
whereas if I look at my docker image
images that I just image that I just
built about a minute ago it's 266
megabytes ouch ok so now I can make a
docker image containing just this
and that new image is a mere 38.9 well
round up to round up to 239 megabytes
and I can run it and now we see we
relived this page tada
it's just the subset of modules only the
modules that we linked in alright if we
can go back to the deck please okay so
the modular platform is scalable and
that's available in a technical sense
not the not the people community sense
that Mark mentioned earlier but it has
additional benefits strong encapsulation
means that we can conceal the internal
api's of the JDK this makes the platform
more secure by limiting the damage that
malicious code can do it improves
platform integrity by ensuring that
libraries and frameworks and apps don't
depend upon the internals of the JDK and
finally it helps make the platform
faster link time is an excellent
opportunity to do whole system
optimizations such as resource
compression early verification and ahead
of time compilation plus a whole slew of
others we've implemented some of these
in JDK 9 there are more to come we have
a module system now in a modular
platform you might be wondering well
what about existing code do I have to
convert all my code into modules in
order to run on JDK 9 no you don't
earlier I described the module path to
something that's better than the class
path but it is just an alternative the
class path is still there in fact the
two can peacefully coexist jar files on
the class path can even refer to api's
that are exported by modules on the
module path ok good so the clasp of path
is still there it still works but you
might have heard jigsaw breaks
everything that's not true jigsaw breaks
some things
remember one of Java's core values is
compatibility we took this extremely
seriously in project jigsaw that's one
reason why it took so long if an
existing application runs on JDK 8 and
if your code only uses standard Java SE
8 api's then it will most likely work on
JDK 9 without change I said most likely
here for a reason there are some minor
differences we removed a few obscure
rarely used methods and mechanisms to
enable a clean modularization of the
platform otherwise it simply would not
have been possible
we deprecated these ahead of time in
Java 8 now what if your code does use
some non-standard or JDK internal api's
and by your code I mean not just the
code that you write yourself but the
code and all those libraries that you
downloaded from maven central over the
years what if those libraries use
internal API s or depend on other
internals if your code depends upon JDK
internals then it may require change
even though many of these changes are
pretty obscure they have obscure they
have affected some popular libraries and
frameworks and tools happily in many
cases they're maintained errs have
already fixed them I wanted to get an
idea of what is actually ready to run on
JDK 9 today so I asked a question on
Twitter last week do you maintain a
popular drop a library framework or tool
if it works fine on JDK 9 then please
reply with its a name and version thank
you to everyone who replied here's a
list all of these things work fine on
JDK 9 probably a lot more stuff does but
these certainly do there are some
important things in this list for
example all the major build tools ant
maven and Gradle are there J unit tests
and gr they're essential libraries like
Jackson log4j hibernate bye buddy and so
forth
and yeah the whole spring framework
itself just released runs fine on JDK 9
so I keep talking about internal changes
you might might wonder exactly what do I
mean well let's look at a couple of
examples one is our old friend Artie jar
are cute jars is the zip format file
it's been in the JDK since 1.2 contains
all the internal classes of the JDK this
file no longer exists in JDK 9
it no longer exists because we replaced
it with a file in a much more efficient
format and there was just no reason to
keep it around but they're a bunch of
tools that read this IDs in particular
use this to figure out what's in a JDK
so what we did was we provided a
supported way to get at this information
there's now
nyow virtual file system at the jrt uri
you can open that up and grab all around
and it just like used to grumble around
in our queue jar another example is the
Sun security x509 x500 name class for
manipulating expects 500 distinguished
names this has been around for a long
time there's actually been a standard
replacement for it for quite a while in
fact that stand roof replacement has
been there since 1.4 nonetheless there
are many libraries that still use the
internal class and the problem is all
the Sun security packages are strongly
in capsulated now what does that imply
in JDK 9 well in general if your code
uses JDK internal api's then it will not
compile on JDK 9 and it may generate
warnings at runtime now wait a minute
you you might be thinking why won't I
get errors at runtime like you showed
earlier for the secret class and confu
util if I have a jar file built with JDK
8 that goes and tries to construct one
of these X 500 name things why don't I
get an error message like this the
answer is a lot of developers deployers
and users just aren't ready migration
takes time migration from bad habits
especially can take time so we've
deliberately relaxed strong and
capsulation of like to see jdk internal
packages in jdk 9 at runtime only so
that old code will continue to work for
a while but I do mean for a while
eventually we went to JDK to enjoy all
the benefits of strongiy capsulation
that I've mentioned earlier so we will
eventually re-strengthen that so the
addendum to this statement is in a
future release code like this will not
run to help you get ready for that
future in JDK 9 there's a new tool
called Jade EPS that you can run
your own code if you're unjaded swith
the Jade with the JDK internals flag
against a jar file or a class file it
will go do some static analysis to
figure out most uses of internal api's
and suggest standard replacements if
they're available I highly recommend
that you check it out it's been a long
road to jigsaw it's been a long run to
design and deliver it it will be a long
road to it's wide adoption and that's
perfectly fine
many of you will make use of the newly
modular modular nature of the platform
long before you use the module system in
your own code using module and new code
is relatively straightforward
modularizing existing code however can
be a lot of effort as we learned with
the jdk itself if you do modular eyes
jigsaw does make it try to make it
easier by providing tools to support
both top-down and bottom-up migration
you can modular eyes your own
applications before all of their
dependencies have been modularized and
if you maintain a library or a framework
I encourage you to publish a modular
eyes version of it as soon as you can
but not until all of its dependencies
have been modularized from the bottom-up
jigsaw lays a strong foundation for the
future of Java it also supports the
broader themes we've discussed here
today it's scalable as we've seen it's
easier to evolve and it's easier to
evolve more nimbly we can now remove
entire obsolete modules we can deliver
new yet non-final api's and incubator
modules for early testing and feedback
and thanks to strong encapsulation we
can change the internals of the jdk
whenever we need to jigsaw of course has
been part of the open source JDK project
developed in the open JDK community so
it's open as well we received tons of
valuable feedback along the way thank
you everyone who contributed good
insights and experiences and I'd also
like to thank the long-term contributors
to jigsaw who in some cases have been on
this project for almost as long as I
have for more information you can visit
the jigsaw project page in the open JDK
community if there are links to all of
the jep's the JDK enhancements
for proposals and the jsr for the
standard parts of the module system
itself my colleagues and I are giving a
number of sessions this week
these are the times they all happen to
be in Moscone Rhett West's room 216
you'll notice the prepared for JDK 9 by
Alan Bateman was given that this morning
there are likely to be repeats of all of
these sessions they just have not been
scheduled yet so pay attention to the
online schedule and you can probably
still see it at some point
Alex Buckley will present the middle two
and I'll present the last two for an
even deeper dive I highly recommend a
new book just out from O'Reilly Java 9
modularity by Sandra Mack and Paul
Becker it's a comprehensive and
pragmatic guide to both the module
system and the modular platform and of
course there are other books that cover
jigsaw 9 and they're either available
now or or will be very soon so jigsaw is
here it's part of Java 9 but it's not
the only part there are many other great
features in 9 large and small I'd like
to show you a few of them right now
all right so the first is J shell I know
I talked about it last year but it's so
cool I just have to talk about it again
J shell is finally Java has a
redeveloped print print loop woohoo
you can type little expressions at it
you can declare variables and assign the
values it has tab completion I can do a
hit tab right here and it says oh
there's a link method you can invoke
that you can even show you the
alternatives that you have at any given
point
so here's substring and now I can type 0
comma 3 and just get foo you get the
idea J shell is extremely handy for just
doing exploratory programming figuring
figuring out what's going on before you
write actual code not gonna work now of
course it's not is that yes and it's got
history so you can go back actually save
your history for a long time here stuff
I did like three days ago okay that's
cool so another another cool thing in
Java 9 is collection factories how many
people wish Java add to the CAD literals
for collections yeah it's a pretty
common request going back 10 years well
we thought about how to do that and it
turns out there's no great way to do it
but we now have collection factories
that makes me make this much more
convenient you just need to create a
little collection that's got constant
content in your code today what do you
do well you do something really boring
like a raised list of you know what do
we what do we do are you do this you
know when you think about it's kind of
stupid cuz it makes an array containing
these two strings then converts them to
a list just like oh well that's dumb
yeah we can do that what if you wanted
up what do you got what if you actually
wanted to make a hash said well you can
do that new hash sub and yeah that works
but oh yeah you wanted to make that
non-modifiable because well it's a
constant constant hash set it shouldn't
it shouldn't be modifiable collections
dot um modifiable whoo set tab
completion for the win
now and now it's an unmodifiable even
worse suppose you wanted to make a map
how do you make how do you make a
constant map well there's no there's no
syntax for that there's this really
gross dirty ugly hack some people call
it the double brace video I'm gonna show
you this but you have to promise not to
use it
yep why did you run I don't know oh yeah
thanks see history is great okay I just
made a hashmap but at what cost I had to
create you know there's a there's an
internal left there's an anonymous class
created just for this purpose
oh geez it's it's it's insane so happily
we have a much better way to do this in
Java 9 there are some convenience
factories on the private the primary
collection interfaces I can now say list
list of how it makes me list I can say
set of I can even say map of and there
you go
maybe not quite it quite as slick as
built-in as lent built-in language
feature for it but it's just about as
good ok another cool feature is Java
Docs search you might have noticed that
my browser got tripped up on this little
earlier let's go back to that Java doc
page Java doc now has a search box you
can type it you can type things up here
it's all--it's doesn't talk to any
servers this is entirely in the browser
shows that javascript actually is good
for something so suppose we wanted to
see the Java doc of that mapped out of
method that we just used it does does
you know search ahead tells you all of
your all the alternatives you can see
here if you look carefully how we
implemented like the first ten
combinations as explicit methods Justin
just to be efficient but in the worst
case it'll take an array of elements so
map of click on that whoops click on
this and boom there you go you can find
the entire module suppose you want to
learn about the goggle the new module
java.lang module contains api is
specific to the module system there you
go there's java.lang module you can
scroll around in it learn about what's
in there
you can also yeah let's look at a couple
other other modulo here's here's here's
a popular module
so here's korva it's got his little
graph you can find out what things that
exports what things that requires it's
all that all the information is there
now something I'd like to point out
about this is this annotation the korba
module as well as some others have been
deprecated in Java 9 we've enhanced the
deprecated deprecated annotation to
include a since value identifies the
reason release in which it was
deprecated and for removal if we removal
is true that expresses the intent to
remove this so beware CORBA is on a
limited lifespan okay if we switch back
to the deck please
okay so that's just skimming the surface
of some of what's in 9 of course to use
to use 9 you know most people won't be
like me and use emacs on the command
line most people use an actual IDE all
of the all of that well sorry IntelliJ
and Eclipse already support support Java
9 NetBeans I'm told will support it
pretty soon to demonstrate how IntelliJ
IDEA in particular supports Java 9 I'd
like to welcome you Jean Petrenko from
JetBrains
hey Jane what have you got for us thank
you for having me
so I have a demo with IntelliJ and
currently I use IntelliJ 27.3 this is an
early access build so anything can
happen okay so this is a small
application and just prints hello world
it brings the version of the job machine
and then it brings the module which is
associated with the cause as you know in
Java 9 anything is a aided cast is
associated with the module even if it's
on a class path yeah exactly
so little tricky yeah and here have a
really nice thing this one is associated
this main class is associated with an
unnamed module and here's why if we take
a look closer in the common line we see
that IntelliJ still runs it with the
cross path so it's definitely the same
way is we tend to start our applications
like years for years and its benefit
from modules we need to turn this
application to moderate application so
for that we can simply create the module
info in the root of sauce folder like
this so we call it some kind of org demo
for example and and here you have
anything what we need anything which we
use to code completion for example it
helps me to write anything I need and so
on so if we turn back closely to the my
example we have we have a compilation
here over here and the problem is that
the image beans on the long green and
Java base there are in some Java
management module right yeah right so
and if we take a look on a highlight so
it shows us that we need to include this
requirement to make it work and instead
of typing it manually I can simply click
here and say please include it for me
and if we switch back we see that there
is now I requires that does the trick
for us so now let's start this
application once more so if I started
here we see that the module of my main
class is now exactly the same I
specified over here and if we take a
look closer to the conga line what we
have we see that intelligent stands that
this is the module rest application so
do you see module path
- B for sure and the module to start it
that's it
and of course dealing with one module is
not that interesting so let me switch to
another example here so I have some more
information here and if it's tricky to
understand what's going on here I can
just navigate between modules for
example I can take take a look one into
Java sources if I need some information
or insight for example what Pecha
dousset experts were what services it
uses I recognize that model declaration
here so and if we need to take a look
like from the height how how I might
dependencies are so I can do this one so
I can a diagram I see that my module
depends on some three modules there are
transitive dependencies some static
dependencies for example can navigate
over here and see this aesthetic
Aquarius this is transitive acquires and
so on so and for example if I decided to
add some more requirements for my
applications say I in decide to use like
that one I can switch back and take a
look how it looks like now and if you
take a look closer to this so far we see
this highlighting this is a really nice
feature Java 9 and it's called it's an
ability to say in a duplicated
annotation that it's going to be removed
so it's not it's it's kind of variable
thing that IntelliJ shows it's figuring
that out and striking this out - yeah
think about using something else
but of course it will compile but still
it's quite verbis now and you see the
year over here and the right top corner
showing that there is a problem here
cool cool and I really like this one I
tend to write Java code for years and if
I need some unmodifiable wait I told you
not to use that oh really
sorry I gonna I gonna fix it now yeah
horrible an idiom - a new API excellent
yeah okay thank you very much Eugene
that's great
so Java 9 is here at long last what
comes next
to understand more about the future
let's take a brief look at the past for
20 years
Java SC in the JDK have evolved in large
irregular and somewhat unpredictable
steps each release has had one or a few
really big features and the schedule of
those releases has been adjusted as
needed sometimes more than once in order
to accommodate those big features that's
good for the big features that gives
them time to bake but it's bad for the
smaller features because that means it
take can take a long time to deliver
them even if they're ready long before
the big features are finished so we wind
up with releases that are grand and
majestic but they're just rather
slow-moving for Java to remain
competitive in this day and age it must
not just continue to move forward it
must move forward faster that's why
we've proposed doing a new feature
release every six months on a strict
time-based model and this bottle
features go in only when they're ready
if a feature misses the current released
that's okay because it's only six months
until the next one it's not that big a
deal we think this is a good balance
between fast enough to deliver
innovation at a regular pace and slow
enough to maintain a high level of
quality so the next feature release is
five months away March 2018 the one
after that will be September 2018 when
after that will be March 2019 there will
be a long term support release every
three years starting in September of
next year so if features are going to go
in only when they're ready then we need
a pipeline of features that we're
working on so that when a release comes
around we can late bind to it and figure
out ok what's ready let's let's put that
in and ship it we've even been investing
in that pipeline for years in the open
JDK community here are some examples
project Panama seeks to improve the
connection between Java and native data
and native native code project Valhalla
is about specialized generics and value
types project amber is right as about
right sizing language ceremony and a new
project not yet proposed but being
discussed right now is project loom
which will aim to bring continuations
and five
to the Java platform to greatly simplify
concurrent programming to help us learn
about one of these projects please
welcome Brian gets our job on language
art
hey Mark hey Brian so project amber what
do you mean exactly it by right sizing
language ceremony well you know as you
might have noticed Java has a bit of a
reputation for being a little bit
boilerplate intensive maybe it takes a
little too much code to do a lot of
common tasks and so you know project
amber is a is really a collection of
smaller features that are aimed at
reducing the overhead or the ceremony of
things that we do every day streamlining
you know everyday coding but also making
code more readable and more reliable and
you know these are features that we can
deliver over time and I think a lot of
them are a very good fit for the kind of
programming models that are popular in
the cloud like the function as a service
demo we saw earlier or reactive event
event based systems you know like on
message based systems or actors right
right so I know I know when one of the
sort of sub projects of amber is called
local variable type inference yeah
what's that all about
okay so the local variable type
inference is is a feature that we've
seen in a number of other languages you
know before java's had type inference
for many years and we've used it in in
some places in the language and we've
expanded the set of places that we use
type inference so you know over over
time type inference is basically just
the compiler figuring out the type of
something without you having to write it
down and you know it can make code more
readable by getting unnecessary
information out of the way and so we you
know this next iteration is simply
extending that to the way we declare
local variables you have an example yeah
so here's some typical Java code so you
know the way you have to you know
declare things in Java is you say the
type first and then the name but one of
the things that we've noticed is that at
least in well-written code the name is
actually more important than the type
because it talks about how the how that
variable what it means in your program
not across all programs and so if we
allow the compiler to infer the type for
you well the effect that it has is to
sort of bring the name more front and
center and put some more important
information where we can see it like
this like this exactly
so the almost the first thing you see
are the names and of course if you pick
bad variable names then your code will
be unreadable but we might never be I
never I never do that either I mean no
no but this is not dynamic typing this
is not dynamic typing it's full static
typing that were the same static typing
we've always had it's just the compiler
figuring out the type of thing from
information that's already in your
program great okay um when can we have
this so it is already committed this
will be you know either this has been
committed to the JDK ten repositories
and should be you mean you mean 18 dr.
18.3 yes that right there's the actual
commit message from last week where it
SEOs come in so it will be in a
production release in March excellent
that's very cool so what else is going
on in amber okay so the next thing I
want to talk about is actually a much
bigger feature and it's a feature I'm
really excited about it's called pattern
matching so a pattern matching is a
feature that's been around it's been
associated historically with functional
programming languages and more recently
you've started to see object-oriented
programming languages like C sharp and
Scala adopt this feature as well and we
think it's a really good fit for Java
and so sort of to motivate what you know
why we think pattern matching is
interesting Minh has the ability to
simplify the kind of code where you have
to do multi way conditional operation
write code like this code code like this
so your hands in an object whether it's
a parameter or you've read it in from a
socket and it's gonna be one of ten
different things than if it's this you
do this and if it's destined to do that
and this is how we write this code today
and on the one hand there's nothing
wrong with this code cuz it's really
kind of what you have to do on the other
hand there's like everything wrong with
this code right so it's verbose right
it's repetitive and the problem with
repetitive code is it tends to be
error-prone you know we do this by cut
and paste was that a secret chip and I
said that yes and it's easy to make cut
and paste errors and you know the
repetition is it's really overwhelming
right so not only are we saying are you
an instance of this organ instance of
that but after we do an instance of test
the next what's the next thing we do
cast early cast it like but but but know
what else were you gonna do right so
there's a lot of repetition in this code
and as a result these are places for
bugs to hide we can do better we can do
a lot better so morally the code on the
previous slide wanted to be a switch but
switch is really pretty limited switch
can only switch on certain types it can
only compare against constants and so
you know I if we enhance the switch
statement to deal with patterns
is what we've done here we can make this
code a lot easier so what so the new
thing that's going on here are these
case labels they're not constants
they're patterns and a pattern is a
combination of an applicability test are
you an integer with some kind of
conditional operation that you're gonna
do if the test exceeds cast it to an
integer and bind it to a fresh local
variable which in this case is called
eye noise and so already the code is
becoming more readable and it's more
obvious what's going on because we've
eliminated a lot of the craft but you
can still see there's still some
repetition here we're kind of doing this
in a very roundabout way where since the
switch is a statement not an expression
we have to make an assignment in every
arm of the switch statement and it's
easy to forget to do that in one arm and
if your tests don't have good enough
coverage you just have a bug that that's
long around so we can make this example
even better by turning switch into an
expression like this right exactly like
this and so now this is probably the
code that whoo that you had in mind when
you were writing the code on the first
slide in the first place
but you couldn't write it like this so
you had to write it in this very round
of that way so this is code that's more
readable more maintainable much less
error-prone and as a bonus faster
because you know the first code was a
linear chain of tests but by expressing
it as a switch the compiler can turn
this into a sition tree that's probably
gonna be faster as well so you're less
verbose less error-prone faster great
effect so so pattern patterns are cool
but these seem fairly because somewhat
limited can they be generalized to
bigger cases yes so this is a really
simple example but more commonly when
when we're called upon to make a
multi-way decision we're handed complex
objects which we're gonna destructor and
take out their state and then do
something with so you know as an example
like let's say you know we have a
hierarchy like this where you have a
shape and you have circle implement
shape and it has a center and a radius
and squared and plinth shape and it has
a corner and an edge and let's say we
want to like calculate the the area of
one runs things so we know it's gonna be
one of these three things we know we're
gonna have to take them apart so we can
use what are called D structuring
patterns to to rip through all the
boilerplate that we would have had to
write right I mean so if we were writing
this the old way it would either be big
nested ugly if-else or even where
visitors yeah so pattern-matching lets
you express this in the sort of direct
way that you want it in the first place
so you know what we're saying is we're
switch on the shape and we're saying is
it a circle if so cast into a circle
extracts its center and you know radius
properties and then use that to compute
an expression for the area of the circle
and similarly for the square and
similarly for the rectangle so it's it's
kind of saying what you mean without all
of these layers of boilerplate very nice
now that now that's that's a much bigger
thing than VAR right so it's gonna take
some time to do this how are you gonna
do this given that features are only
gonna be future releases will only be
six months apart so you know we're gonna
break it up into smaller pieces right
you know so you know the the first
example we showed was type test patterns
we can do that first and then we can add
more different kinds of patterns more
different places in the language to use
patterns over time although in a way it
makes the job harder because we have to
be really sure that we're laying the
foundation for the thing we ultimately
want to do yes we do
yep all right thank you very much Brian
thanks mark
the project amber is just one of one
example of the long-term investments
we're making in in Java there are other
large projects not just the ones listed
here but but but many others there is a
continuous pipeline of smaller features
that are smaller but no less important
we hope that all of this work will not
just keep Java moving forward but moving
forward faster thank you very much
all right thanks mark and Brian well as
promised you got to see a lot of
interesting things today and there's a
lot more interesting stuff to happen at
the conference one of these things I
will mention tomorrow there is the
Oracle code keynote it's at 4:15 at the
Marriott Marquis and you won't want to
miss this
Patrick Dubois is generally regarded as
one of the founders of modern DevOps and
Buster Benson is from slack please go
and check it out
it's free for all JavaOne attendees
thanks everyone and enjoy Java one
you
you
you
I believe every human being is a
potential coder quizzical mind somebody
that likes to solve puzzles someone who
can work within a team I think you have
to persevere you can't get enough to
understand the logic of the have empathy
for their users posting is patience
likes to stall breathe all's a good
holder is someone who can think through
fairly and implement their idea into
hope 10 years ago we're cutting for
computers but now everything is a
computer a lot of the redundant in the
rudimentary stuff we do as the developer
will be taken over by these automated
processes things like human brain
interfaces and machine learning and
neural networks potentially a new
language that doesn't even exist yet
she'll believe we have a bright future
despite self-driving cars and the
artificial intelligence interacting with
our keyboard less layout I think we're
gonna see a lot more voice interaction
with devices hopefully not computers
coding themselves this would be like how
it's called the singularity right eye
code because I love it for me it's like
a brain puzzle because I'm a builder and
I I ran out of Lego bricks there's a lot
of creative juices that flow when I
write for because a lot making things
bicycle coding stuff it's a fascinating
wide open field where you can do
anything you
to do having a problem that you turn
into a solution through code is one of
the most beautiful things in a job I
could imagine doing so what is ERP and
how can it help your business
er P stands for enterprise resource
planning companies have relied on it
since the 90s to streamline processes
and improve data visibility around
finance project management and
manufacturing however the cost of
ownership began to climb significantly
and on-premise ERP couldn't keep up with
modern security demands or technology
trends so ERP evolved to embrace the
internet with new features and
functionality enter ERP cloud the cloud
offers a more affordable alternative for
ERP because it eliminates the need for
software and hardware or additional IT
staff ERP cloud enables organizations of
all sizes and across all industries to
make significant cost savings improve
business insight enhance collaboration
and increase efficiency Oracle ERP cloud
is built for the digital age delivering
on the promise of the end-to-end process
visibility and speed all at a lower cost
opera cloud is the next-generation of
hospitality products what we're being
able to do now is leverage new
technology both in the database tier an
application tier to really empower the
hotel EUR with new screens new flow new
functionality soft design more intuitive
with the ability to capture the
Millennial employee that's utilizing the
system in a look and feel that they're
used to with the Opera cloud deployment
you're really looking at being able to
reduce a big IT footprint and cost upper
cloud lifts all of that up so now we're
taking that ownership and we're putting
it within our four walls of our data
center where we're running Oracle
products on Oracle hardware provided to
you in an Oracle data center let's get
that into our space where it's got
security
it's got redundancy it's got failover
it's gonna be upgraded automatically and
we remove this the annual support cost
that you're used to paying and we wrap
that all into one SAS software as a
service fee what we've noticed is that
the IT costs go down from an operators
perspective think about the the training
aspect the training aspect should
decrease significantly and then think
about all the integration points around
it right when we look at the the
cross-training perspective or we look at
a cluster of hotels that are all in the
same city and you can pull resources
from hotel a and put them over in hotel
be that the front end of the application
the similarities and configuration it's
all there whether you're checking in a
guest at one property or the other
property the flow is 100% the same it's
the ability to customize your
application for your independent
property so turn on parameters or
functions that are specific to you right
you don't necessarily need to take an
off-the-shelf product and use it in an
off-the-shelf way
what we found through our own cloud
journey is when HR and Finance
collaborate together everyone wins to
really look at HR and Finance and how
the collaboration between these two
areas can really help an organization in
their transformation to digital what
that study showed us was HR and Finance
when they work collaboratively together
can not only find their cloud path but
more importantly exploited there's 35
different processes that we see a
finance and HR need for integration
skill development the people development
the management of change the
organizational restructuring now in a
cloud-based environment both HR and
Finance can reap the opportunity of
having a much stronger underlying system
that can serve a shared service
environment it really allows us to have
a single source of truth we're creating
the information once and we're using it
many times the business wins HR wins
finance wins IT wins and because we're
here to serve our customers we believe
the entire ecosystem wins
the bad news is I t's not keeping up
with the business bro the business needs
to chill the good news is the CIO is
ready to fund a hardware refresh so I
want the two of you to figure out the
best way to run our Oracle database
that's two together so what do you think
about Oracle database appliance
it's purpose-built to run Oracle
database plus apps though what appliance
Oracle database appliance basically it's
a complete Oracle database environment
compute OS networking and storage and
you can set the whole thing up in 30
minutes yeah but what about networking
and storage I literally just said those
words dude I definitely found our new
solution with Oracle database appliance
patches importantly updates are
automated and pre-qualified I could do
that stuff in my sleep yeah but remember
when you forgot about that security
patch hey I was thinking you totally
jammed on that last appointment no doubt
so why don't you make your
recommendation I'll make mine then let
the director choose 14 minutes bring it
on
to sum up Oracle database appliance is
simple optimized and affordable it
deploys in minutes it requires fewer
resources it provides a path to cloud
which future proofs our IT investments
we reduce expenses with capacity on
demand licensing which means we pay as
we grow and it starts at a very
affordable price impressive so what have
you got Dave
so how does Oracle database appliance
provide a path to the cloud that's gonna
be key for the CIO it's architected for
the on-premise world but also engineered
for hybrid cloud environments so it's
really easy to do backup and disaster
recovery we can move workloads like dev
tests to the Oracle public cloud I think
you and I are ready to take this to the
CIO let's go Oracle database appliance
simple optimized affordable and ready
for the cloud our vision is 100% slave
free chocolate one of the major
challenges we face is to have enough
beans for our 50 percent year-on-year
growth the backbone of the company the
supply chain and the IT systems did not
always catch up with the growth we will
be using a planning and budgeting cloud
service to roll up all the data from all
the countries in order to make the right
amount of products in the right flavors
for all the countries to supply them
with I would definitely recommend
cooperation with Oracle because although
they are really a multinational they are
really able to work closely to a
medium-sized company as we our planet
implementation of rakla planning many of
our systems had been living with us
since late 2005 or prior so when we
decided to implement Oracle planning the
first and foremost it's all about
integration that now the data is flowing
seamlessly
automatically and no single person
taking copying data from one spreadsheet
to another the implementation of issue
align planning in my opinion is really
the integration between our data science
we had Adobe tools beforehand for all
the images then someone physically
manually copy paste images into Excel
spreadsheets just to make it look useful
for the further processes whereas the
visual line planning now is an
integration between our PLM solution
that hosts all the product images so all
the images automatically flow into
usual line plant solution so as you come
in to the system you start planning your
line at a master style at a style level
in the style option level so on all
those levels depending on how you create
images and it's not just one image per
style so you could have multiple images
and then the system would pick up all
those images and you can see it visually
in the tool as you are planning products
coming into the store it sells through
for the next four to six weeks by then
you get the next two new flow into the
store so you could see all the flow very
visually and you can adjust accordingly
you know it doesn't look right which is
a huge benefit as images change or
getting updated we automatically pull
