iog with Java and Jamal tokens on board
implementation so this prototype is an
IOT fan so everything you need to do to
turn on your phone is just a cow so in
this case I'm using my cell phone
simcard in the Jamal toes board and I'm
calling my word so let's wait oh here we
go we turn it on and we can cancel the
Kali and ok so these implementations is
very simple one we have here a concept
board we have card and we have here a
relay board and this is the battery that
is powering the concept board because
this port is very nice and useful for
IOT implementation because you have Java
ME embedded inside and you have power
saving features you have / dr
provisioning and updates and you have
everything that you need to make a real
IOT implementations now let's turn it
off calling again my concept board so
just call my number and here we go is
very fast
here we go we just turn it off we just
need to call the the secret is the
number anyone can call me and turn on
and turn off the call for fun so this is
kind of fun and fat together and we
using a real IOT Java and implementation
and you can start developing using
NetBeans and we have many samples just
go to the java.net / Java IOT that's it
see you for the video class so you can
replicate out his demonstration in our
post next Monday see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
