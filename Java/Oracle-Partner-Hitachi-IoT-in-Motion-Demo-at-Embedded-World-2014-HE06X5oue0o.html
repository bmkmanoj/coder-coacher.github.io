communications here at headed world 2014
at the oracle we are partners with
oracle demonstrating our super Jay
framework a middleware platform that
works on our jobs we've been a
long-standing partner with Oracle and
here to demonstrate the capabilities of
technology of embedded technologies for
more dignity the Machine fourth inning
space we look at we're trying to
demonstrate here is we're doing people
County there being two people counting
with a technology that utilizes a lot of
core components and has many market
applications here demonstrated here is a
people Connor the stereoscopic speakers
they use infrared illumination account
people as across the threshold how this
works is it is mounted few meters above
the doorway you have multiple counters
across a large doorway and captures the
images of people going in and out of
that passive rishil this can be used for
a lot of applications we're using it
here to monitor ins and outs to the
Oracle booth at embedded world how these
are physically interconnected would be
and part of the IOT infrastructure is is
these devices are connected to a smart
gateway the smart gateway has the
intelligence to collect the people
counter data and pass it to the cloud as
everyone knows providing
machine-to-machine communications or
Internet of Things is providing the
things connected to the Internet by
intelligent gateways they utilize the
coracle JVM and takis middleware
technologies
how this infrastructure work on left
hand side of this diagram have the all
important software architecture we have
linux running on us one of our partners
eurotech provides for the Gateway a
cloud and the people counter
technologies within there is the Oracle
JVM on top of JJ be m is Itachi super
Jay osgi framework this frame workers is
an application management framework
provided for a number of applications we
utilizing it here for the people counter
demo well that is the eurotech ESF
application which makes the data from
the people counter and passes it to the
cloud from the cloud it fast dude a
hitachi cloud which uses horrible
analytics capability so we can provide
business intelligence to data being
collected at the booth if we go to the
left will show the installation of the
people counter at the booth here we have
the people counter mounted at the
doorway it counts the ins and outs you
can see as well well disguised well
hidden he provides an unobtrusive way
for County people as they enter it but
we have many applications for this
technology is being used here at the
booth it's being deployed at other
venues were restaurants or the retail
environments we are looking to see how
many people are coming in the time of
day measurements of data people coming
in and out of here you're a facility and
then one great application we have is
for transition when you're counting
people coming on and off buses trains or
other some order other mechanisms of
transportation so has a broad variety of
application capabilities it provides
unique insights to your business of the
all-important need for County
which is the main draw of understanding
how your operation work right now we
have wall powers who can show the actual
data of how this is collected and
displayed for demonstration purposes hi
and this is a couple of our dashboards
of showing how you can visualize some of
the data to be used as we look at second
analytics right here in this first
screen is some of the analytics that
we're pushing gathering from the
original database that Paul is talking
about from the Eurotech cloud system and
here we're showing the total occupancy
in the booth right now you can also see
the day totals that we've had of the
first couple of days so far in the show
some other things that you can get as
you look at this you can see trends when
people are coming in and out the current
counts based on each counter and we
total this based on individual counters
and also individual doors as well as the
total booth the other thing is another
dashboard that we have up here is the
tachi consulting back in analytics which
is taking we take the data from the
Eurotech database pumping into their
cloud system and then they do analysis
on the booth and all the business
analysis so that's where you can get
your business trends and make your
business decisions based on the data
that gets sent back up into the cloud
for that light pulse talk about retail
stores you can track winds your peak
times with your not peak times when you
need to have sales when you need to not
have sales tracking your occupancy also
with your point of sale and when you're
actually selling things so that is the
people counter demonstration that we
have here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
