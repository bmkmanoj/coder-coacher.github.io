Network and I'm here today at devoxx
interviewing Martin fab fab AG yep grits
ok welcome thank you so well introduce
yourself first photo you may not know
you my name's Martain most people work
conferences know me as the diabolical
developer for some strange talks I do
but I also help run the London Java user
group and I guess the reason why I'm
here today is that we run a couple of
global programs for developers and yeah
we're here to talk about that today I
guess yep so the adopted usar explain a
little bit what it is ok so a JSR is a
java specification request and that is
what defines the java standards today so
if you're talking about the next version
of servlets or the next version of java
itself that is governed by a JSR so the
idea of the adopter jsr program is to
have ordinary developers like myself get
involved in these standards a lot
earlier than we have in the past so
traditionally we would be given the new
standard we would use it and we would
find the occasional part of the standard
which was was not that well thought out
for for us to use so the basic idea is
through heck days and workshops and
talks is to get people involved nice and
early give that feedback to the vendors
and the other experts who are building
the standards and make make Java better
for everyone really so how can people
find out about it or what can they
concretely do yep so we have several
chapters that have sprung up around the
world mainly based on Java user groups
themselves there is a website so adopt a
JSR org and if you go there that will
redirect you to a java.net community
project and there we have lots of
resources we have talked so you can
download a news we have heck day
materials we have wikis full of
information all the contact details for
the different jrs you can join and most
importantly a long list of practical
things you can help out with so it might
be
unloading some code and testing it it
could be helping out on a mailing list
it could be doing some graphic design
for a website for Jessa is quite a wide
range of things people can do so you've
been running this this program for a
while right I think Aramina yeah so what
what is what what did you feel about the
program and how people can participate
in how people participate in general
yeah it's been really interesting a lot
of people have been very enthusiastic
initially but they just don't quite know
how to get started with it because there
are so many options of what you can do
and also it's a little bit people feel
it's a little bit daunting to to help
out with something like Java the
language itself seems quite big and
scary so what we've been focusing on is
doing what developers like best and that
is to write code and to work with code
so we now have learnt to focus on
providing workshops and hack day
materials for other Java user groups and
it's just sit down and code with your
friends and yeah so with that I think
we've now had between 10 and 15 Java
newsgroups join the program so we're up
to about 100 hundred and fifty active
participants so it's ticking along
nicely so you've been working also on a
different program that is called open
yeah stopped OpenJDK it's the sister
program to adopt a JSR jess has more
typically revolve around the Java EE
space or the Java ME space but in
working on Java the language itself and
the platform the JVM that is governed by
the OpenJDK project these days so we
also have a program there for day-to-day
developers again like myself to work on
Java itself it's a very old projects
it's been around for a very long time
since the mid nineties as most people
know and it has a lot of low-lying fruit
or a lot of small bugs and documentation
issues that you can very easily get
started with and then start doing
something a little bit more significant
so for example in London we've been
working on the new date and time ap is
for Java rate so hopefully fingers
crossed will have lovely date and time
libraries to use going forward
nice so um any other example so people
being involved so who should be really
involved with this we we kind of
encourage Java user groups to get
involved initially because they already
have this great structure on how to hold
a host an event then most of them have
venues pre organized they're very good
at buying pizza and beer and and other
such things and there's just a common
interest is you want to learn to work on
a piece of code together that said we
have had some financial organizations in
London in particular adopt this program
inside their corporation so they have
lunch time coding sessions so yeah it's
open to everybody which all we all have
open mailing lists and an open issue
tracker and that sort of thing so any
any java developer or java related
developer can join wonderful cool thank
you so much for talking to us too no
problem always happy to talk about this
program so thank you very much for
having me thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
