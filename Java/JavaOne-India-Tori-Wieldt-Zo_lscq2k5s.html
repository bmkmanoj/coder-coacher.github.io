hi this is Jim Weaver and I'm at javaone
and India interviewing Tory wheeled of
OT n and Satori how is the the Java
oneindia experience been so far for you
it's been really great it's been fun I
got to watch you dance up on stage
during the keynote okay that was very
entertaining what you what kind of dance
do not watch me do it was the IPL dance
ok so it's some symbols from cricket
turn into a dance interesting that's
very popular Aaron India okay and we've
been working here in the otn lounge
talking to members of the java community
and just finding out what's going on and
I hear the sessions are really good
they're packed and people are learning
new stuff they're finding out about Java
effects from you okay and it's been
really interesting hows it yes well what
are some of the more interesting
interviews that you've been doing here
in the OT o TN lounge um mostly it's a
lot of the Java user group leaders okay
so we've had leaders from Delhi and Pune
and Chennai okay and it's just really
interesting to hear what they do and how
that's helpful and I've heard that the
kind of the notion of the user group is
a little bit new to India oh really oh
sure well it just it's just not a part
of the culture like it would be in the
United States or Europe or Brazil so
people I don't know are a little bit
more hesitant to join or they just don't
understand the concept so things are
moving a little slowly but I think it's
excellent and once people get it get get
what they can get out of it then it's
then it then it's really exciting so
what's the what's the the most enjoyable
thing that you've done so far on this
particular trip whether it's inside the
conference center or outside that the
conference center what's been cool to to
Tori what's been cool Dettori um the
food is absolutely fabulous really oh
yes the mangoes
are just delicious yeah they have a
breakfast spread here that's a little
embarrassing it's so generous and
actually it's hard when I go back to the
United States because food starts to
taste a little bland oh really yeah
because the spices here the food is very
delicious I understand you recently got
