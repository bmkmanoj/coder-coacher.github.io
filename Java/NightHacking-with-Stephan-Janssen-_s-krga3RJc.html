hacking i'm here joined with stephanie
onsen at the DevOps conference and i got
an exclusive interview with the busiest
guy at the conference it's exclusive you
did tell me that in advance as anyone
else on DVD yet well the google will be
pissed off no I think you launder we'll
do that later but that she also works
for a congrats i gotta i gotta behind
the scenes yeah we got the real stuff on
you get the real stuff off the cuffs the
really nitty-gritty greasy details
you'll get here for sure it's a mountain
yeah yeah we do we do alright so for
those of you I'm tonight hacking before
go 2nite hacking com you can see the
live stream and also the social chat if
you type into the social chat it'll show
up on the computer here and will will
respond to heckling or comments or
anything else people so mom mom if
you're watching make sure you chat with
me right since I've been a long week
yeah I'm sure she's one of the regular
night actually uh yeah your son is
definitely a nerd i saw that maquina I
don't know I'm trying to get him into
the discovery but I'm not yet really
succeeding but so so for those who you
haven't I all the keynote talks will be
online for dell box to Washington
parlays yeah run Christmas there was a
great video devops for kids which was a
pre-event that the DevOps crew put on
and it was really cool they did robots
and they did legal mind silica my night
Doris will scratch different technology
focused kids projects and did events
both here in Belgium involved two events
in Belgium but in two languages when a
guy let me finish and also French and
that was that was really cool and I was
I was glad to see that like I was afraid
that
when when you you know when you get on
your ears like you know 30 years from
now what will happen to dev box yeah but
your son is clearly he's ready he's
ready to pick up the her so he was like
really pissed off with me he came into
addy likes it like six months ago dad I
want to learn to program can you help me
bit because he wanted to know why I was
always sitting in front of computer
right and as I started thinking looking
up like information for flemish in dutch
any material and it's not that much on
there so i started thinking talk with
other people and then the idea came from
dev box for kids so I said like son I'm
gonna organize an event for you one day
with other children between 10 and 14
you know we had like about close to 70
children and then they were interviewing
him of like yeah how do you like it and
he was saying man I'm really pissed off
because my dad used my ID and he didn't
name it after me and that's what you saw
at the video right yeah I got mad and I
didn't tell him to say that fing service
so I can see he's gonna get it she gets
that from his dad it looks like goal so
that was one new exciting thing at
devoxx that was the first first this
video was it was the first one I'm ever
gonna do another one next year I I
thought I heard other another new first
yeah but you're now staticky now well
our problem that and it's a it's not a
problem it's an opportunity is that we
sell out every year six weeks in advance
we had more than 200 people on the
waiting list another probably another
200 people who didn't even try to get on
the waiting is so last year we organized
and announced the devlocks France and we
were hoping for 600 people that doubled
to 1200 people and it was also sold out
to two weeks in France and I was like
hoping okay all the French people who
are here
one of them going to France well but
they didn't listen we got Kurt story and
we've got a whole friend imitating here
or no and I think it had the opposite
effect I think so too actually a night
hacking stream was was dominated by
French read emmanuel Bernard Antonio gan
cloves and Julian ponds did a whole
bunch of French people on the stream
like hex laying in them it was a huge I
mean I think that's the maybe part of
Brazil has more but like France has
really large number never a
well-organized I was impressed when I
went to the Paris oh yeah they're really
doing Java here's a grip so sorry art
yes Paris didn't do it beres didn't help
and there's like 400 people left out in
the cold so I had to sort of that
solution and for me it's really
important to work with the right people
I mean okay the brand is something but
you need to have the right spirit the
right community right field you know the
right focus and I was like looking
around who can help yeah and it was
really that hard to find the right
people I know if you look at hoops
working on the openjdk dr. J sir the
London java community you know benefits
under obviously you know I on my list
and I didn't have to really convince
them I mean I found and say like okay
let's do what the Fox UK there's nothing
yet really for developers there's a few
high ends which like 2,000 pounds but I
want to do a low entrance dev oxidation
and have the developers instead of the
managers of the defender yeah that's a
good idea so that's what we announced we
announced the DevOps UK usually using a
really cool multibyte and click where
the French and the English ever like
from historical yeah I was sitting next
to you on Thomas for Marco yeah and I
didn't I realize how good he was a movie
quotes that you ruin the whole clip
because I'm saying they're watching and
he keeps saying the lines haha but yeah
that was a great that was a guys move
and then they were storming us nights on
the stage and saying basically so what
you're going to do is give it back to
back so we have three days France we
have two days in England and we'll do it
back to back in the same week
next year it will be end of March the
last week of March but that's because
the marriotts we were too late to
actually seal it for April so in two
years and we really want to have it in
April so it's like five months from
Belgium so have basically every six
month is a big splash with the
devexpress cool no that's a real
exciting him and you guys hop between
the two events on the Eurostar yeah it's
two hours 45 minutes so what I'm gonna
do is like get some rock star speakers
let them speak in London first put him
on the train then they can speak in
Paris yeah I heard I heard a certain
company yes I don't know anyone who
works for them but a certain company
that was really might be I need to say
if Roland smart looks at this video
Thank You Roland for making this happen
you're my hero and we need to talk yeah
yeah I'll get rolling a big thumbs up as
well making it happen a very short
notice so oracle's now sponsoring their
the first European platinum partnership
for devils and that's the animes it's
awesome that's really really nice and I
mean we only announced it last week so
Oracle really had to jump into different
groups and so on some people had to step
up but basically that means that Oracle
will be our platinum sponsor in Belgium
next year france and UK and that's also
good for us because that way we can
really just talk to oracle one time and
it's ordered yeah very seriously I mean
you take a lot of energy and
negotiations but now that is just sorry
so yeah hopefully there's going to be
other companies following in the steps
no I thought I thought you said exhort
not sort that I'm not a native English
speaker so but yeah that's great guy so
so excuse me you can see you can see
we're really at devoxx because we're all
getting my voice as well by the end of
the week you from all the events and all
the technical knowledge your brains
gonna explode and a lot of sleep
distress yeah yeah sailing around
so how many atmosphere a weapon that's
the eleventh eleventh year of the rock
so this this idea of the gray hair
that's 10 bucks that's for my wife
casitas so i can say that but it's a lot
of work nonetheless yeah yeah oh yeah
you know give your web credit she she
does a lot of work load of oxygen she's
great Chris yeah she does all that mean
everybody's their info just in case she
says that watches this ya gotta take
care of thank you yeah she she didn't
mention like why didn't you explicitly
mention me during the opening keynote I
said but honey your picture was there
twice on the slide oh yeah so there's
always there's always a strong woman
behind it yes I will say this again on
the record if she would not have been
there I would we would have been broke
already ten times yes yes because the
money would not come in the invoices
would not be paid and I would be paying
penalties because the taxes weren't paid
and all that stuff and that's a lot of
boring administration things that need
to happen but it needs to happen so you
stole you still invigorated to keep
going with dev ox after 11 years I see
the enthusiasm is still down seriously I
mean you get so many positive feedback
people really appreciate it I have the
energy it is getting more and more
burden on your physical and your body
last year my necklace completely blocked
us I used three kilos in one week
because running around and things like
that but after one week of good sleep
you go like that no I mean I do hope
you're making a small difference why
would I want to thank you for adding me
to the devoxx team this year about time
yeah so for the very first time I'm
actually part of the program committee I
got my own personalized version first of
all I study and you have to work for
that one so Steph yeah definitely and
helped out a lot especially you know
with all the Oracle
we wanted to get in but also non Oracle
engineers no but I like I really like
the conference because it's
community-run it's for developers buying
something from side developers and it's
really you know in my opinion one of the
funnest and conferences to hang out and
be at mm-hmm I'm excited about DevOps
France inter box UK well it's to be
honest me really to it because I can
then go as a tourist actually the
contents because here I don't really go
to many talks right yeah so that's funny
yeah so somehow you managed to not let
me enjoy much this year although I guess
I did a little bit of bit myself as well
so I can't blame you entirely yeah all
right well I want to thank you for
taking time out of your busy schedule
today sure and here's to the road and up
getting killed on the way to devil
because that would have been bad
publicity Stefan King dies in traffic in
London because he had to think he drove
on the wrong side yeah so but I was
really a nice move for that was a nice
build-up 2 words level so thanks for
doing that as well yeah and it was a it
was a lot of fun and you're you're also
you're one of my last interviews for
though the road to tell us it is nice so
it's a nice closing of the of the
official tour all right thank you thank
you very much like II happen and you can
watch all the videos on night hacking
