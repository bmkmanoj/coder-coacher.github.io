night hacking interview with me i have
bravia groans burger hi how's that for
my poor German it ain't pronunciation
it's okay and today we're going to talk
about some tips and tricks you can you
can use with your ID to improve your
coding techniques and effectiveness so
you also give a session on this i
believe was it already given or your its
upcoming now it's my sessions tomorrow
just off the lunch some giving an
50-minute talk on equal of snap beans
and IntelliJ and how you can use your
IDE more effectively and tell us a
little bit about your your backgrounds
um I've studied computer science and I'm
the University of Bremen which is in
Germany and I got a diploma on 2008 and
since I am I'm working for a small
software company located in Bremen too
and I'm working as a developer project
and Department late cool all right so to
start with I'm going to switch to your
desktop so everybody can see what's
going on on your screen and it looks
like you have IntelliJ open and a.j
focus project I mean eclipse eclipse
open and with a.j focus project so i'm
gonna show you how you can quickly write
code by using content assist cuz it's my
little logo and the way I'm there we
don't have a video up there we don't
have video either okay well the people
online can see us how about that cool
so now I'm going to show how you can
quickly write some code by using content
assist and quick fixes in your ID so
I've really a blank my taking project
here and I'm gonna create a new class
and come Mary technical package so when
in this new class we're just gonna start
from the main message and we are just
gonna start with love you know we didn't
we need a refactoring before you get
started what I'm picky about spelling
you need to give a class a capital H
alright so what's that what's the
shortcut for refactoring but it's a
control shift are so you can see all the
shortcuts in a little window and we're
giving it a little okay I'm happy thank
you a big inch no problem so I guess
Steve on seven you motorbike yeah yeah
long overdue by old sis you're gonna
create a new motor bike um with their
own on Steve and this is in your car so
it doesn't exist yet so we're just gonna
create a class or no we're just gonna
yeah we're just going to create a class
from eclipse by just using the the quick
fix which is control one and Eclipse and
it will just create the class for me
then we can go back to our previous
editor with control Q and eclipse and
ctrl shift backspace and IntelliJ for
example and now we need a constructor
because we want to pass on the parameter
so I just let it create the constructor
with a string parameter and I give it a
name owner and
then we're quickly gonna assign this to
in your field and doing this I can use a
quick fix again so I just quickly assign
the parameter T in your field and now we
have a new class so what else do we need
on a motor work oh so method maybe we
need some site bags so let's first grade
of arrival for the motorbike it's also
shortcut and I'm sorry and then we're
gonna use motorbike dot I don't know dr
wayne that's good so that's going to
this is a this is a internet of things
bike it writes itself yeah right um yeah
so the first stop on my tour is is
actually germany so we're gonna go to
Munich I'm just typing in and gentlemen
yeah you have to teach me how to do
though a lot of things on my keyboard I
can't ok I find someone else's when
Watson I copy paste them to cheat ok so
next we're gonna drive to Munich so that
is our destination and now we want to
put that stuff in a neon hashmap for
example so let's take a list
destinations at destination and I can
also create a field of the nation from
it and when I go hero was pretty much
the ID is doing all the work for you yes
I'll do whatever they need us for now I
don't know I was saying I'm not program
anymore I judge his control space to
complete our auto fix this program is
fairly easy so you can also use a camera
case on it Wanda new era desirous I just
type and AML upper case and it should
auto complete to our list very nice and
now he is a special thing if i do
organize inputs it directly completes to
java.util.list so no java.awt list
because actually you have some photos in
your ide a lot of people are complaining
that they always get the wrong import
and here you can just say okay oh that's
good that way i can please fill out
although java.awt imports and you're not
seeing about bringing switch my god so
chassis the right javafx classes instead
of old swing classes yes yes yes so
that's a pretty neat thing to do so one
of the folks online Jim Weaver had a
question mm-hmm okay he's wondering what
I td's will be like five years from now
uh-huh I don't know i'm not sure i think
a lot of movement and now basis to bring
them all to to the web so you can for
example also program on your ipad that's
a big advantage if you're having it on
the web and you don't have any java
installed on your ipad so he came out
burger big yes properly for example you
can just do it from everywhere you don't
have to install your tools on a new
computer just log in enter your normal
account and then you can just start
going nothing go
that will be a very interesting thing
have you tried any of the current web ID
is like the knife lips my buddy no I
didn't Ken's walking around he's gonna
be part of our panel this evening so
well we'll see how strongly he advocates
for dynamic languages okay alright so
anything else you want to show us for
cool little things we can do I like the
filter that's something I didn't know
about yeah and we have in the debugger
we have some very nice options so if I
just start a little problem here and
debugging wrote ah remember remember the
shortcut for it and so it switches the
debugging mode and what we have here in
debugging mode is also it's called
detail matters for example in Eclipse so
if i put in a detail for merton I don't
want to see here that this is a
motorbike it's not really interesting so
I directly want to see what zone of the
motor bank so I can just say um
motorbike and the gonna so I bhatia
directly and in the debugging window so
far step one step further than I see you
so it's your motorbike here and I can
still display the actual type yeah so um
I really like to do it with estates
Oracle honest with the old dates and
calamus they never have a nice to string
her presentation for the current country
so i really like to do that and what's
also nice thing um we don't have a tea
right now what you actually can do is
show some internal structure so if we
step a bit further to the destinations
if I have a destination now in the list
Munich and we can see the destinations
arraylist year it's make a bigger and
now we see all those grumpy stuff like
element datum modification concise we
don't really want to see it so here we
also have an illogical structure which
will
shall just the elements directly but so
there's some some cool features um what
I also like is that the IDE can actually
show deadlocks in the code so i have a
nice example young concurrency code it
should print bank account doctrines for
once per second but stops after two
transfers so we don't know what's going
on but i started it in the debugger so
now we see all the threats running yeah
and now i can click falls on the
debugger and it has a nice little
feature i can just turn on if i find it
which says she'll monitors and show
monitors will show me directly that i
have a deadlock here so it's directly
marked in red and it says this one was
waiting for the instance 19 and instance
19 is waiting for instance 20 yeah now
that's a very cool feature when you're
trying to debug an application and
figure out where your where your
deadlock is hung up so we're we're back
in sessions here at j focus yeah but
that was a quick lightning tour of some
different ide features yeah and you've
also enlightened us on the future of
IDEs yes let's see how it turns out yep
alright let's meet in 10 years thanks
very much for the for the short
interview thank you for inviting me yeah
okay so we're still</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
