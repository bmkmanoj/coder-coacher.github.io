is the implementation of the actress
system on the JVM and the actor system
was invented or the first created in
back in the 70s by a gentleman named
Carl Hewitt and the actor system became
very well known I guess in the
telecommunications industries back in
the 80s and 90s I think with Erlang they
wanted to build systems that didn't
break didn't stop they could be upgraded
while the system kept running because
they were handling the phone exchange
systems things like that so for us back
around I think was around 2009 general
Spanair became was familiar with the
actor system and he wanted to bring the
actor system to the Java community usin
JVM mm-hmm so back then is when he first
made it an implementation of that so an
actor system is it's fairly simple is
it's that there's a software actor and
the only way that you talk to actors is
by sending them asynchronous messages so
time different than say doing things
like with object-oriented programming
where you're calling methods on a class
here is your one piece of code is
directly interacting with another piece
of code with actors you're sending a
message as a synchronous and
asynchronous lead to each other so the
analogy I like to use it's like almost
like you and I are texting you know we I
text you a message I can continue to do
things I'm you know waiting for you to
respond you may or may not respond to me
those types of things versus with
software if I you know invoke a method
of you right I'm waiting for you to
respond to me things like that so
there's a very fundamental difference in
the way things work but it's also very
powerful way of doing things so what
would mean in which cases would you use
actually in a car framework so where
what one thing where it starts and it
works really well is for concurrency and
really it's a it's a nice alternative to
threading because with
the possibility of say one actor Colin
sending messages to another actor that's
inherently multi-threaded in that I say
I'm an actor you're an actor I'm running
on one thread you're running out of no
thread we're only using threads when we
need to actually run when we're not
doing anything those threads are used
somewhere else but I could send a
message to multiple actors say I'm I'm
delegating work out to a bunch of
different actors so I can fire up
messages to multiple actors at the same
time all those actors are running
concurrently and I'm not doing any you
know me the the instigator of all this
activity I'm not doing any really
complet complicated thread programming
and things like that I'm just basically
sending messages and maybe I'm waiting
for responses back things like that so
it's a very fundamentally different way
of doing highly concurrent operations
without getting all caught up into the
intricacies of doing thread level
programming and so and you can do this
of course that scale right so that's a
big big scale in fact it's it's a little
for most people that when they first
come to NACA they have a it's almost
overwhelming the things that you can do
because you end up when you finally
settle in and you kind of understand how
to use it it's not unusual to have a
system where there's tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands or even
millions of actors individual actors
that are doing things and another kind
of learning process is that instead
having big actors that do a lot they
have a lot of code in and you kind of
decompose problems into collaborating
groups of actors so you haven't
necessarily focused actors that are
doing very focused things and and in a
very distributed way it is a different
way of doing things so and what other
tools do you or do people usually your
customers for example use with akka so
like what would be a complementary
solution if you you know the other thing
did they use it with within their
application but they're probably using
like a different cloud system or
yeah so so how what kind of setup to do
your customers have like to start with
it's one area there's a quite a few
areas one area with just fundamental
actors Anaka is that akka can run in a
cluster so the way I describe it is that
you're not constrained to a single JVM
anymore you can write a system that can
be a collaborating a very tightly
collaborating group of JVM is running in
a cluster distributed across the network
and then the programming for that is
really straightforward there's a very
nice abstraction layer that you have to
do things there
that's just fundamental actors right you
know doing highly concurrent things are
running in a distributed environment but
there's many other things that akka
provides the next probably the biggest
thing is akka streams mm-hmm so it's a
whole new you know stream processing and
it's very functional and you know you're
doing things like map and flatmap and
and filtering and things like that but
it's the reactor the whole reactor
streams implementation and we've been
doing that for a couple years now right
from the very beginning when we when
everybody started talking about reactive
streams we were heavily involved in that
from the beginning
and that's a that's an entirely
different way of doing programming and
you're really not even dealing with
actors at that point you're it's there's
actors happening or helping underneath
the abstraction layer of streams but
it's just a different way of doing
things and these the streams and akka
streams can be non-trivial they can be
graphs that fan out that fan back in
they can they can invoke other actors
they can do things asynchronously
there's a very very rich set of
capabilities that are part provided with
with akka streams
so so how do people find out about a cow
all right can you can it just download
it oh yeah Arcas open source fully open
source it's been a bit again it's been
around since about 2009 a lot of a fair
number of the Java community are
familiar with it especially in the scala
community certainly instantly aware I
came across it in a Coursera class when
I was my first introduction to Scala and
part of the class had akka in it and
that's why I came across it but it's
open source just a kayo is a website
we've been working very very hard the
Aqua team on enriching the documentation
because again there's you know it's a
different paradigm for doing things and
it's not just a framework either it's a
it's a pretty rich toolset we refer to
it as a toolset because we have actors
we have akka streams but there's many
other things that come with akka so it's
a it's a big ecosystem but all open
source and anybody can take it and use
it and it's also you can use it in Java
mm-hmm which is surprising to some
people because light Bend is known as
the scholar company or the company but
Scala but my own experience before I
came to the company light Bend was
working in 8 HP using akka with Java
you were a big Java shop so it's Java or
Scala you know pick taker pet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
