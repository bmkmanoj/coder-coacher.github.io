hacking show with Sven unlike unlike
what the label says is actually is
swimmers are you see your how do you say
your name properly smell I'm us so
that's that you yeah I can't I can't say
it that way and your netbeans dream team
member yep I am conference conference
guru you go to lots of conferences
speaking or attending or I do yep way
too many conferences I think that's
where I see you yeah yeah probably so
all the time all the time that works
Joel one really meet the first times it
Brazil maybe I think we've got a double
but but but I'm probably hiding out
there yeah I'm on Brazil yep yeah let's
say a small one so it was a small yeah i
bought it grows it grows each year that
yeah so well instead bucks I mean
javaone Brazil or Latin America is
december four through six this year are
you telling us that the Brazil that
Brazil too but that West take a take
your girlfriend I'll show us go to
Brazil next time yeah sure alright so
anything else you want to mention about
your job or introductions on the way of
introductions so I'm working here at the
LA Constance is the 30 ND com thats a
satellite communication equipment
provider ground station facility
provider and i'm doing a test on things
so actuate the moment i'm a hardcore
swing netbeans RCP guy or night and so
that's probably pretty much why I'm
looking into Java x2 now so it's now
it's java and so it's john pretty slick
api to mature yeah new nice controls and
things working the way you probably
always want them to work a swing yeah
that's funny because they are a lot of
the John Fox team are actually X swing
team yes they learned from the mistakes
for them this is a great opportunity for
them to fix all of the the things they
wish they could change but can't because
the swing api's are so heavily walk
around yeah we can't change them anymore
yes you keep things compatible and
making things right is Posey but then
they're kidding and we're like a sea
because they're maintaining pure
backwards compatibility so yeah very
careful once it goes in but once it goes
in it yes I I think there was a block
entry from any Fowler describing why
restarting everything and doing
everything from scratch was it pretty
much good idea so she just changed some
of the things in swing well it would
never feel right yeah and if you want to
do right well you probably have to break
backward compatibility so start from
scratch and get it right the sink try
yeah yeah a little bit yeah probably so
I'm once you're out what's her stuff to
you how two shows today are we gonna go
get ya so I'm just yesterday I received
from Joseph qfd on a pincer architect an
email from a guy on the NetBeans
development list ask you for a while
will there be some java vex netbeans
thing so trying to use java facts on top
of the epics platform somehow somewhere
so there there are different different
things that um we're shown at saw one
for example there were people showing a
charts I bet it in the top of the rapids
platform so it's just using swing and
batting feature from from javafx so look
up just using a J a text panel and put
your coat in there and that's quite me
but um I was taught well maybe it would
be be way nicer to get rid of all the
spin on the start and get a pure java
Tex platform running so I'm i started to
a project called EFX so source code
still not available but i promised you
to get done by a box finally but so do
you realize that's ago ok week away yeah
so but um it's getting closer I have to
get it a done by the data well too many
other things happened yeah there's
always in software projects and plump
lips cool all right what's up let's
share your desktop now so people can see
your cool the cool stuff you have gone
yeah turn on layer all right yeah okay
so I'm probably wash do so you show the
those actual working prototype
application let's say a visual vm clone
using pure FX front end so here we go
splash screen coming up and get the
let's make it a bit more it smaller so
it I am it comes up you see that I say
yeah let's tap thing you're the toolbar
you already got the integration with the
mecca menu bar at the top nice so let
everything so the eval is still in the
wrong place so we have to talk to the FX
guys gotta get you how to change
greatest there yeah so at least we got
the tool bar up there somebody bought
there and that's quite good so on they
see a list of running VMS so this one it
could attach to well yeah i'm running it
on top of them the latest HD Bell oven
pills so let's say yeah FX 8 da light so
um sometimes it's just really a v62 yeah
so if latest build yeah so from 25th
October probably so the latest bill is
available to the outside world
if you give for the default bills so if
you want to FX without going default
builds well openjdk is nice but no
effects in there and the moment on the
way okay really like to keep track of so
i end up with the right data both other
weekly builds from from the decade
gentlemen download page so you can see
it's a passion that was ashley that's a
that's a good um yeah i could be good to
show people how they can grab da builds
so you want to pop it up and i'll type
in the URL into a browser preserves and
that getting the the java 8 bills with
javafx is a great way to start using
some of the new features we've
questioned about oh yeah rich text and
garrett respond he's like up it's an
early access so we go to jig or it was a
tree table was in le access I don't know
if your stay was there yet um so you go
let me go to snapshot release well that
you are oh and I'll size be 68-63 I said
you're a little bit morning so it won't
be a little bit behind yeah weho you
won't build so I'll take this
opportunity okay demos we can do a
follow up at den box and you can show
them yeah sure she completed yeah
already working in version for doing a
follow-up so yeah so that contains on
the let's see if can can show to you so
you may believe me
completion box see you see there is a
tree tableview already in the NSA our
data bill but still on the comp review
java vaccine control and there is a
additional repository if you like to go
to the surface it's the open JFX sent
box 8 and then it's already living under
layer the javafx package so well yeah
probably place to go and probably the
young the daily bull so quickly builds
will pick up there your package netting
on someone so you can already use it now
but there you just have to well
literally breaking API changes as long
as you tap into those private things
alright so yeah so you see some of the
properties and just to make more fun or
edit them i'm running this with the g1
garbage collector and so well just
figuring out if i can can make this work
as well as that one so you can see you
could open up the tabs you can move
those around put them somewhere else
let's see see you can really see it's
happening ok so it moves down there and
on the back the editor oh and you can
even know your untalkative so it gets a
floating view cool so but you still can
see you can move on together so on the
other thing is i tuck it back end well
this is like heaven right but well
there's always room for improvement
alright so now that i got a for people
who knowing that beam stuff so there's a
property sheet
so let's see go here that should be
properties coming up so you see all the
system properties then it's nicely
styled yeah so I started with the normal
labeled and things will Adam but well
it's looking quite ugly and papa there
was something that looked like it I seen
below yeah okay say well I want you seen
below look at what simpler they're doing
now but well yeah I probably can do the
same so I put a bit styling and the good
news is using the NetBeans facilities
and the the API is it's like that means
you can brand the CSS so if you could
last just use this application of binary
way and you can just a add your CSS at
the same place with the same name having
the same tags but different colors
additional gradients whatever you like
and netbeans within the platform would
use this CSS file and to lotus and style
for this component so just getting any
reason why he chose left alignment here
and right alignment oh no not really
already uh maybe I just forget to put
the lime in the left-hand side sir I
know maybe just figuring out different
things so you Swan jet you want to
demonstrate that these are style yeah
maybe yeah yeah the different leadership
yeah you can style them so i should put
in different different cars as well
probably yeah just to make a point of
fur you can't do with you so yes over
dumb yeah I'm my you know my developer
oh don't do graphics artist so yeah even
this is getting so sorry those are
pretty charts yeah well look at the
charts you you'd think you were graphics
designer well yeah let's take just two
XL applause so well yeah so it makes you
look good yeah if we look at yo why
pedalin these fingers so um yeah you see
try canopy usage CPU stitch just putting
in grass there and tapping into the de
monitoring things from Z from the
so I think it's quite quite funny and so
there's still more more components you
can look at so good tree implementation
so just browsing the m beans that are
available from the olivium me so let's
see looking into I'll have some garbage
collection and you see following the
selection from here you get updates on
the property sheet yes so with a little
I emission effect yeah let's say um well
stop exclamation you know so that's
nothing that i would alter just swap out
the attributes and properties I'm
splaying and so that's when you update
it then automatically yeah yeah yeah
yeah so it's more wiring these these two
views together by by play and that beats
look up thing a selection thing then I
programming animation stuff Sam but
still probably can yeah other people can
make it look way better so okay so I'm
the light beam as well so you get a very
fancy thing so that's why I'm from
Garrett was her happen solo underscore
so now you're looking really good yeah
so on those are all right I got it I got
a change we got to make because we're
not we're not doing proper justice to
carrots controls I want to make the
background for that darker dark gray the
background fold over this pain for this
pull the complete paint yeah all right
okay let's say you won't can do this
soon as it there's a hacking session we
can't just just hacking said yeah yeah
we got ya prove your stuff for for
DevOps you'll be glad when everyone is
impressed all right you're finished you
can go and down what we're doing this
think a question think about skier Jones
on the live stream edgartown pressing
his name around a hot second right here
here here to catch on her chest
infection got some hey hair shine so
then the question for van is canet
beings plugins be installed into this
app
I was people see that was a feature
request as well if it's not a swing and
better than you should be probably big
enough so yeah that doesn't know you you
don't know here John Key's the product
manager for netbeans I think product
manager or or well I'm not good at
titles but he's mr. Depp against inside
Oracle so let's see where those
vegetable there's this book ok so this
is the dashboard see you see here's the
registration of the view so go at six
tangible so I'm just annotation
processor is registering all the stuff
on the typical way netbeans does it so
just copying of the ideas and Pattinson
opens users so they say we are getting
the data from our last group pain so
probably we could just make a good paint
grey icon glade ok ok so let's figure
out some of my stuff so since they say
hecking session could just try to do
that way since it's so no you would like
to have publishing fallout hell yeah
that would be nice it would be nice so
that these guys out there we would like
to have any destination I think it does
it in CSS files it helps you out if you
have a CSS file gives you more so to go
to assistance i'm pretty sure so you'll
think i'm going to hear we get CSFs
completion sometimes you do ok well and
sometimes you do the videos that you
have before the FX wants a fair hands
life well probably not anyway i'm using
the vi de so i probably have to tell him
let us say somehow FX things like you
should pick up ok I get ya here Jones
making fun of us he's talking about our
paint components over a pink component
to change in background yeah yeah
so you know I don't have any talk
components anymore so yeah do you buy
well-run framework so what yeah but so
we don't have to gasps no okay yeah we
could just stay a cheat you won't have a
bug while dude dark Dougray so dark gray
I think there's a doctor in there yeah
there's that should be like this there's
it's spelled both ways to for those yeah
those English English English
particularly American English guys yeah
i know this specialized for europeans
who never can figure out which one is
which one yeah so you guys use more UK
English or American yeah probably say
yeah where's my bye-bye teaching
beginning we we got more British British
UK english and american actress probably
we end up with a speaking more American
than they ever so um yeah so let's see
oh yeah nice there you go oh mama I'm
happy now hacking session yeah well
there you could do some work thanks okay
girls would be proud yeah so um just
depends on what you like to do yeah but
those are really nice controls yeah a
deadly so I'm go to AIX trust there's a
you take extra laps at github on where
you can get all those most controls and
many many more and yeah so Garrett is
the guy who's doing all those nice
things mm-hmm so I think you'll meet him
tomorrow ah yeah yeah come on guys wanna
come on my own a big motek accession to
share that can do yeah so I'll be a
canoe and we're gonna we're gonna do
that so i'll become i got i'm going to
put up the euro 4jf extras labs on real
the social stream if you guys are
following so uh yeah and they probably
one of the very very famous things
though
you have to have ones they embedded web
browser let's see it works yeah so I'm
better web browsing labeled nice so and
what I really like is saying you to do
know people can't see it but huh well
they can think I see it they can't well
I can't see your fingers but they can
see it growing industry taking i sees a
zoom zoom yeah nice so it's pretty
pretty pretty good so yeah so um do you
think I'll i started is a oh yeah one
more thing to scenic view anybody should
have a scenic view ja-ack thakur scenic
views they a must probably so ok sure i
got the laser but i'm pretty much show
you multiple latest versions so what I
do is just a I take the the draw file
and just a call with my my stage invited
so Adam no fancy extra starting at the
moment so I just can't have a look at
how things work that's a pretty good
thing you see events coming through you
can even if you have a network
connection it's working you see this
trevis thing answering this you go there
for the Javadoc so that's amazing so
yeah yes another example of love you
another example for you without seeing
thats a browser yep so just done yeah
let's say yeah yeah no I mean examples
like that are what own HTML is really
good at showing documentation yeah yeah
yeah it's good showing defecation it's
like gift for you documents don't
limitation text sometimes images well
you know in your documents you like even
flow images yeah absolutely yeah well
that's probably one of the reasons that
I like javafx it's not JavaScript
it's at html5 yeah it's just java all
right so um I'm i started talking about
the street table view i said well i have
to have to have a to table you so what
we always kept saying to table you as an
essential part 44 javafx is it have you
seen any application during a tree table
view and relax already ok you don't have
yeah ok so I'm all the way there but um
what I try to do is say loading a hijab
so you know how easy it is to specify
those filters probably for the file
chooser speaking of hacking yeah is it
easy at CD it's just easier than the
swing like well I think it's a yeah it's
really straightforward so you see that's
the way they the menu the action is
registered and that all you do ok so
you're using a standard file chooser
yeah yeah it's just a simplified user
and you just set a young extension
filter is that before so um ah i see it
takes the distribution just yeah there
you go yeah so that's easy yeah that's
pretty easy that's pretty easy so now
selecting get dumped opening the dump so
that's a table and i think from there it
can go to the tree table browsing all
the sleep things that should be a nice
game before using yeah yeah throwing a
lot of data out to you you'll be testing
out in your control yeah so in attorney
this really so let's do follow-up them
cut that box probably cool so I already
get the instances show and get the c20
what percent is characterized so and
coming back to Gretchen's a question
about honey can you use netbeans plugins
with it yeah sure you can so I didn't
write the depletion and reading
scaling of those the victim file I just
put in a dependency to the chain of Java
profiler library that's a part of the
normal a pious distribution and is risk
used by visual vm as well well so since
as they distribute under GPL class but
inception well just use it and if you
don't want to use the original napkins
version well you can probably put a
wrapper around the pitar file and fixing
the problem that you now have to have an
implementation dependency so you know
depending on one version and if you're
using a new version well you have to to
repeat our lady of your plugins yeah
yeah yeah yeah so that way of doing
private api's and telling you well we
might break them yeah yeah so that
that's okay for me and so I hope to to
dig into this list amor winkler see you
mush but I think ya allah straight
already see that's huge and it's very
performing yep so I didn't put in any
any filtering at all so it's just
throwing one tabs of the table so yeah I
think say I'm a good way to to
demonstrate the different come polities
so you have to charge you can table no
than probably that Street table view you
got a tap so one thing I'm struggling
with is I want to move those taps around
you know just pick them and drop them
down ah yeah so and I yeah ok so for I
would like to drag the columns on the
table yeah i can click yeah it always
yeah that works but rearranging rear al
like you would like you would do it in
the ANA beans or I collapse or whatever
well so there's no default support for
this image on effects right now Fire
Chief Joe denial on file and enhanced
right here I think there is already one
we don't think there was a guy you to
route a preliminary patch I think we
have to wait for um for the new way of
doing controls I think I can say it bake
together some probably can dig into
something more so yeah looking into some
more ducking favorite things like a tool
but here at the left hand side and to
also get Chan is wondering how you know
I'll bracelet means plugins he's one ear
keep it fun times that runs out I think
I think what he wants is you have your
depending upon plugins in kind of using
those to build your thing he's he's like
well that's an IDE I want to be able to
have Netherlands plugins so as long as
they don't you swing yeah the good rid
of everything swing and a lot of the
swing api's let me just depending on
well yeah so and yeah a lot of a lot of
those API sleek swing some way or the
other so we could say okay I try to use
them still but I just don't implement
all the all the services and so things
like a you think of as bestest progress
and that beats down here it shows you
some processes running that's quite nice
thing but um well there are three or
four methods on there well there just to
progress happening and then there are
methods welded interactive swing so
Philippines that's fine but for me is
hfx reason why you want just the
implementation which handles the
progress yeah be in your area so now I
probably have to to yeah I ripped off a
lot of those api's I would really like
to reuse from the beginning
maybe we can talk to the but if these
guys to make this a bit more more easy
to get another more of eggs in there and
one of the other hand you will not
expect any way to to rewrite it big
application like ned benson drama x from
the stretch so you suggestions because
he's not giving up on us he really wants
that's another bag of measure there so
there's no you lie for a plugin manager
but it's an epic module system let's get
out yeah so got the file system that
pigs module system I think I think he's
so excited about your javafx ide that
he's gonna you think again if he'll
start using instead of being so I don't
know nobody's that's probably the body
dirty that is so always some one of his
major points so he likes what you learn
to you a lot yeah so I'll I'd say yeah
the cool thing so yeah I'm writing oh
yeah that's a very nice application
shows a lot of features of javafx
integration with netbeans this is going
to be the basis for your toolbox talk oh
not obstruct for me to see you so well
it's just a fun visit so I'm meeting
friends and getting too noisy on the
whole way track yeah yeah yeah so these
sessions for a joe you must assign it
for DevOps pretty early because it sold
out this year yeah a month ago yeah yeah
say what I think they'd a video and I
just came what my people whatever yeah
yeah so I think they they even they put
blackfist and lunch sure I think it's
something the Hollywood room so it's not
not anymore index Peoria something I
don't know so I figure out I just saw a
schedule for larger crowd control logic
routes yet so that should be exciting
that's the other than that I'm gonna end
up next week as part of the torso be
taking my video camera bumping around
town box I'm thinking for a lot of it
i'll just have my video set up and just
stroll around a box and show people with
conference and shy with random folks and
pick people and drag them in front of
you
well they can't they'd have to they
can't dodge this it's not fast that's
good yeah so yeah but there's a echo
garden yeah yeah that'll be come on yep
so um like we've had alerted and Andre
are running out yeah it should be very
exciting I think that's a thing that we
i think i read a post from from which
bear this morning lost i don't know
about a Gradle build system for pajama
effects at a devil sega garden nice so
the elevator due to to like the edges a
lot so maybe make it easy to build open
traffic's no it's up there alright so i
think we need to present you with a
night hacking laptops trigger wow that's
cool so that's all abuzz about about so
select select well you have to you have
to get to get sticker you have to be on
the stream yeah so no show no sticker
yes i saw people on the other stream
lighting like one pump i wonder why
don't you say yeah beyond the streams
that exactly cool yeah exactly so all
guys in the enemy Nick judge now do you
think you're on the stream all got one
yeah will be crowned Munich yeah yeah
listen we actually got real projects
working we cut off the stream once we
start the hacking part but we took
pictures of rolling do color wall and
then people animated things and finish
real job defense projects and they're
going to post some videos on that later
ah that's cool smells awesome yeah so
what are you still missing from my java
X so sad what sort of things do you want
in Java fact um dancing Duke dancing you
didn't get what we nice here dancing
dude control I don't know that is just
turning knobs so yeah how about they
getting some of those noise I say pages
into Java of X which ones okay just que
dia yeah I heard I heard um they were
talking
thought I don't know I don't know if
it's going to make the next release but
there was interest in taking some
Garrett's gauges yeah LaBrie would be a
natural complement to detroit's yeah
they'd be it'd be good and a lot of
people are using them yeah I think the
trick is whenever you have standard
components they need to be fairly
heavily style able yeah so people can
integrate them cleanly with your user
interface and you know the controls
garrett does it really nice but they're
not they're not really designed to fit
in your UI style they're designed to be
his style e me up said something they
have to figure out before they actually
do gauges yeah and they probably um
they're probably talk to the API so if
you are going for it being part of the
Eastern a distribution well you get your
API lockdown so that's very flexible
anymore changing API so I think it's a
yeah a ducking framework a real bucking
framework would be nice as I standard
control yeah say I love EJ it's a big
thing that everybody's starting from
scratch so you can see there's one SWT
there's netbeans one there's the drive
one so everybody's trying to build
something like this yeah but it was it
wouldn't be bad I like a third-party put
together the docking for first for Jon
effects and later on the team picked up
yeah the best yeah it's all about the
the what kind of team too yeah results
of why sundown it's quite as it extends
and Digger on things in javafx new years
later on dr. probably not the proper way
yeah from the pub way to build a control
how they did this better well this is
just one fans right reasons yeah just
say so the pendant retains its protein
saving yeah the one thing I like about
this place there and split so you know
the old stood painful sway yeah there
are two split yeah so maybe we did
multiple splits in the same row yeah
yeah it got all messy when you yeah so
no you can examine cool
it'll split pains you just embed into
each other so so gear chance ones right
you know for your cool BFX clip de
working people get it once you do
publish it because you haven't published
it yet but where you put on getting over
they'll probably give her a EFX touch on
that and there is even a EFX platform
thing so you can go to the sea
let's see what works yeah this yeah we
already how the parchment so the project
is there and so on we expect to be yeah
I hope you got the code up there and I
already have the vm effects project at
all of it as well and then Catholic at a
pellet gun down put the curl up there so
it's the next major steps cool and then
you know hopefully you'll get some
contributors and you can turn this into
yeah there were a lot of interest yeah I
listen to a live evolved or one platform
yeah so people don't like to write their
own mainstage you whatever they were
supposed to ride there at the business
kill black things together so they got
used to it I'm like the other but um it
was one of those part the discussion
forum well what are you missing well
yeah I'm missing a really Java X
platform think so like any well that
beans ups for clips are swing
application framework try to do um
there's no such thing for a jar of X and
then registered yeah oh well yeah we
would like as well but there are other
things we have to do first yeah so go
put parties try to go things cool
alright so anything else you wanna chat
app / show off her know what well thanks
thanks for coming on the night hacking
thanks for having me thanks for being
here so and for those of you following
tonight will be at Terrance bars house

late central european time which is I

features in the future right how long do
you estimate before a big school
infatuated yeah okay you know someday
he's gonna be a product manager and give
you like a road map and you'd be like I
want delivery with functionality

probably farmer I think what you can do
you can show the chicken you can blaze
the path for what's possible and then

pick the software so i think the i will
be nice film if you could probably move
things like a scenic view to a more
pluggable platform oh yeah yeah
absolutely see you there will be the
last thing so but that's still just
those tools binary drop the only thing
well when we should fix that so there's
really do to people packing on it and
delivering boundaries because it's a
quite quite ugly are hurt inside so yeah
