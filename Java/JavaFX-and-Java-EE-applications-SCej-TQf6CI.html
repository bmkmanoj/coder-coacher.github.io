technology Network and I'm she at devoxx
interviewing Johan Voss Johan pie and
and Jim Jim who will help me with the
questions as well absolutely so John
tell us what you do I'm the CTO of
floats on which is a small Belgian
software company we focus on the social
media applications in Java and when Java
from the backend Java Enterprise Edition
and front-end sometimes web applications
sometimes I viveks applications so I've
heard you are javafx fun so tell us how
you use javafx well we try to use it in
as many projects as possible and the
moment that we have a customer that
wants that greece with having java bags
we couple our Dali Korell back end which
is a framework an open source framework
that we created and that's the concept
of users content data integration with
social media on top of Java Enterprise
Edition we couple that framework with a
javafx client where we use the Java vex
control the chat box controls to
visualize all the data that's available
in an application and especially in
applications that connect with social
media like Facebook Twitter and so on
Wow very impressive so you have really
clients who use well have Java effects
as a result of it so it gives us an
example of a client that you work for
okay one of the clients at using Java
vaccine production i wish i could do
native land on which is a an
organization of the flemish government
they have a batch system where many of
everybody can gain points when they
attend events and so on they can also
share this on Facebook and whatever and
at a number of events they have
registration desks there are laptops
with NFC reader and that contains the
job of X application so the people they
swap the swipe their match at the NFC
reader and it's immediately recognized
so the
of X application talks to the back end
we know who it is we know how many
points we already had we can also give
some suggestions for that person at the
first thing and then check in or
eventually find out who else is at the
same location or World Order events
might be interesting for him you know
one of the things that you may not know
Yolanda about Johann is that is that
four of us wrote a pro javafx book a
couple years ago and we updated it for
javafx too and as we were going through
the writing process there were some
pieces that were missing and we were a
little bit behind on but there are also
areas of expertise that we're missing in
the authoring team and so because of my
relationship with Johann we asked them
can you help us with the enterprise
chapters because Johan has a deep
background on the ee side on the you
know glass fish and those kinds of
things so can you help us with the web
and enterprise chapters and so Johan I
you must have dropped everything you
were doing because literally in three
weeks he was able to to to write that
chapter of the book and saved our
publishing deadlines and so I'm very
deeply indebted to Johan for that and I
did it kept him on the charts as well
after wise that's right no that was very
good but um yeah I think it's acquired
an important piece of Java affects how
do you connect the Java client
application to a java ee back end
because that's where the data is and
that's where lots of the value
especially the business value is so
connecting the job of X client with the
enterprise back indistinct quite
important well you have a philosophy now
Johannes a as a doctorate in Applied
Physics I believe is that chance that's
correct applied for the kiss okay good
yeah believe that yes no that's very
good and but you have this kind of
holistic philosophy that you've
expressed before about the relation
ship of client and server with another
kind of larger philosophy that you have
and I was wondering if you could kind of
go into that you mean the small
connecting the world of the small with
the world of the large things well yeah
actually that's a the thing that really
interests me in physics is how do you
combine the relativity theory which is
the world of the extremely large stuff
like sterling systems and so on with
quantum mechanics the worth of the small
things and that's the current unified
theory the Holy quail of physics I think
in Java this translates to how can you
connect the backend servers the exalogic
and the expensive resources that you
have in beckons with the small devices
like tablets phones or embedded devices
running a Raspberry Pi and so so these
are two completely different worlds but
they have one thing in common and that's
they both want Java so the challenge is
its Java in one world and Java in
another world so you need to be careful
when you connect these two words but I
think that's a it's one of the most
important things in computing today how
do we connect the the part where the
real enterprise value is with the
departed the end user uses the consumer
you're a you're a member of the
GlassFish community what what are some
of your experiences been there lately
and in that in the GlassFish community
yeah one one thing that I noticed and
I'm I'm very happy with that this the an
increased interest in the West
interfaces okay because in the past web
frameworks were rising as a Champions
and every day there was a new web
framework and you can use web frameworks
to create websites no problem with that
but it creates a dependency on that
particular framework so the good thing
about rests interfaces and the jax-rs
api provides a standard for that is that
you create your application you don't
care how it's going to be used by the
front-end developer so it can be used
with a web
education but it can also be used with
Java vexa for example and one of the
project an open source project that I
created together with Jonathan jars
which is called date effects what we do
there it's a job of X client that
connects to a rest-based to any rest
based back-end and think the good thing
of the end of evolution of the
enterprise standard is that the rest is
becoming more important and jax-rs to do
Oh built on top of texture as one it's
it's an evolution then i c'n I'm pretty
happy about the decoupling the output
format from the business logic do you
have more questions at gym oh I've got a
lots of more questions for Johan would
you like me to ask them okay very good
very good well one of the things that
like like I said Johanna have you and I
are good friends and we have a
professional relationship over the last
several years and he has I've mentioned
how he's bailed me out before on the on
the approach of FX book more recently
for the DevOps conference he developed
this application we kind of collaborated
on it I wrote the specs and Johan worked
tirelessly on a short deadline to
implement those specs but what it was
was an application that would that would
render Twitter tweets that would
represent presentation slides so the
idea is that you know how there's this
syndrome of death by PowerPoint right
where
too many bullets on slides so the idea
is that is that if you could represent
if you are limited to 140 characters in
the slide and maybe a graphic then that
would do the world a lot of good and not
having to suffer through slides that are
way too complicated so that's the idea
so I relayed that to Johan he really
liked it and thought it would be a good
idea to implement that for my
presentation at devoxx and so he created
this application in javafx and with this
data FX infrastructure open source
project that he talked about and
implemented that in time for my
presentation so that I could express my
slides as tweets that then our are read
in by the program and then displayed as
you would see it in powerpoint on my
presentation so it's a really really
nice thing that you do yeah actually I
didn't have to write lots of code
because with the two things are already
mentioned data affects the connection to
the backend and with a leak or we have
the connection with Twitter because if
your account is private you can't be the
tree so you need to be authenticated
it's often a complicated process but
that's with dolly core and we hosted a
dolly cloud it's a it's a no-brainer so
no codes required for that and for
getting the tweeting or application we
use data avec so no code required as
well so the only yeah we had a few lines
of code for visualizing it and making
sure that you could click left and right
for getting the next and previous fight
or reloaded so you can really focus on
your business logic on the coat that's
specifically or Portugal judge okay I do
appreciate your help in that all right
welcome i don't have any other questions
okay well thank you so much for coming
and talking to us about what you're
doing with java effects this is very
impressive thank you welcome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
