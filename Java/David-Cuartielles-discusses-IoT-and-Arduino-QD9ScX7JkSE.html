technology Network we're here live on
the floor of Jay focus in Stockholm
Sweden and I'm speaking to members of
the Java community and I have David
cordelia's with me
hi and I hear you our master of the
curly bracket yeah master kundo brackets
I like nesting things all the time you
know that's pretty cool so you are also
co-founder of Arduino direct yeah that's
right yep so tell me a little bit about
what's going on in our do we know Lynn
well they are doing a platform as you
know it's a it's a it's getting bigger
we're using it and we started teaching
designers about the use of technology
and then we jumped into other fields and
one of Phil's we're working very
actively is in the Internet of Things
because we have a pretty nice hardware
abstraction that allows people calling
for the physical world in a very easy
way and that's actually why I came to
this conference to talk about the
relationship between the Arduino or the
physical world and how can that be made
right and I noticed your sweatshirt
which I have to say is pretty impressive
there's no little bit old-school there I
think I also think that copyright has
expired on the double types so I think
for the next day focus conference you
could actually make that the see instead
of the K with a Commodore C I was
totally calm that was the Commodore 64
if everyone were luckily yeah I mean I
read about correctly so tell me what
you're doing on a Commodore 64 well I
was actually very active in reselling
copied games I bought myself a bicycle
out of that when I was 12
yeah I would I would Mike I got my first
computer when I was 9 and I was always
very interested in electronics I wants
to make an LED panel so I made an LED
panel with like I think was 6 x 6 LEDs
it was controlled from the Commodore
so I have to make my own program to
control it through a port and stuff and
you were talking about maybe putting a
JVM
on a couch yeah yes you know brick prior
to this
interview we're talking about just it
was really great to actually add JVM to
kuhmo 64 because in a like know things
that don't require like high refresh
speeds like if you know measuring
temperatures today or something right
yeah yeah kind of like thing I'm short
programs like two lines like reduce
variable and printed out things like
that right exactly but it is kind of I
mean even though it's a joke it kind of
is a good point that you can put the JVM
on almost anything and your imagination
is just your limitation on where sensors
could go and what they can monitor in
the real world yeah I think I think it's
all it's only about I'm a strong
defender of the tools in the right
context so I think what Mars really is
the context you are working with so if
you're in a certain context you could
totally apply whatever tools as long as
they fulfill the needs right that you
want to convey so it's like JPM 164 why
not yeah 64k I mean look at that yeah
well it depends on what your monitoring
is we discussed write something actually
know that the first basic for Commodore
was actually written by Microsoft so I
wonder if Bill Gates will be up for the
quest right yeah yeah maybe the theme
happen okay so what is the coolest
Arduino project that you can see over
there that's the question I get along
yeah it's course thank you look I mean
for me is really hard to answer because
one of the founders of the platform I've
been amazed since day one you know it's
like people were started to make things
really really fast and not only our
students but people we don't know about
we'd never saw before and there's
everything there's DNA replicators or a
sequencer sorry there is a the three
open-source 3d printer community is
built on Arduino technology to one or
the other either the use Arduino boards
or they use a Arduino IDE that by the
way is made in Java to to program their
program their printers there is a
satellite a Californian company called
nanosatisfi
that runs experiments in space for high
schools you can like friend your slot
and make your experiment is having eight
arduino like computers inside that's
cool so it reads really everything so
and many people are like using the
arduino hardware abstraction to run
other things because in the end what we
do is that we provide people a software
layer on top of the physical world that
allows interact in a very easy way with
basically 15 basic commands or something
like that right so you can read the spi
board you can write to the I Square C
you can write a pin with certain
frequencies like very basic level things
so it can be ported to any hardware
architecture easily and quickly to the
point that last summer we were actually
got a request in our in our office in
Malmo to hack the sony smartwatch and we
made an open-source version of the sony
smartwatch operating system in arduino
Wow so so yeah just give us hardware you
guys make it run we are at a gay VM but
we do our work where we are the we know
in the community so if I'm a developer
and I'm like oh yeah IOT is hot I want
to get in on this where is a good place
to start
without T well I have to say IITs a
complex is a very complex system because
it implies you need to have sensors and
actuators in the physical world they
need to talk to some sort of gateway I
like to talk to an infrastructure so I
think like a very easy way to start
really is using a sensor board like the
same Arduino Uno that will read some
source and temperature sensor or
whatever from the room you are at post
that into a computer and use a computer
as your first gateway to the Internet
and then build an infrastructure that
will operate on HTTP requests then like
of course very easy ways make is nothing
on PHP you can write something on 20
lines of PHP that runs on any Apache
server anywhere most people have a
Apache service for their personal
websites and stuff the things that that
doesn't really escalate well the
question is what happens between that
okay no under under 20,000 users per
mile from hack to production there's a
big difference
I think that's really where Java comes
in the game right like all the
infrastructure is where we see a huge
use with as well as on in great ways
like smaller sensors probably more like
low-level like very simple you know like
Bluetooth chip with a sensor on a
battery start talking to already like
gateways and infrastructure is right we
see the bigger languages right so I know
that cars right now are moving data
centers correctly yeah alright there's
so many sensors that are they have up to
a hundred or hundred processors and
other smaller operations you know we
want to work with a paradigm of thinking
that every single sensor will be digital
of course the transducer to the world is
feces is analog like LDR its amount of
light in the room and that gives you a
voltage and under it goes to an analog
digital converter and so on but in our
mind we believe that in a very short
time about body of processors will be so
low that the sensors themselves they
will just answer directly with a digital
value so the discussion will be between
sensors may be a Villita level it's like
right now let's say this is a Borg and
it's a sensor I'm also it that's what we
are doing is at this sensor which gives
an analog value to my board and then my
board eta is 8 and then I use it right I
will see believe that in the future this
will be digital right away like if you
if we're like half a euro you can get a
sensor that gives you directly like
that's an XML data out of this sensor
right then you will totally want
everything digital will make the whole
thing system so much simpler and I think
we're really close to achieve that you'd
really processor right now reaching that
sweet price of life 20 cents 30 cents
you know it's about time yeah so we're
in a really cool space than a cool time
right yeah yeah I mean we get even
cooler but at this point is already very
nice because I think it is possible to
foresee the possibilities so it's we're
really at this point where we can
imagine a lot of situations where
sensors are we are going to be relevant
and we can clearly see an anticipate you
know
potential uses and businesses that can
be built on top of them great well thank
you for dropping by I know you have to
take off so I appreciate it David it's
good talking to you thank you thank you
very much this is story wheel with the
Oracle technology Network thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
