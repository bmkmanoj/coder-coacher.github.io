and he's going to show us a little bit
about javafx somewhat of it that perhaps
an oddball question but um so why you
know someone who's using groovy and
Israeli you know this is real easy and
you know it seems very appropriate to
use Ruby to access the FX functionality
why would I want to use Java to do that
like can you can you know my job lobbies
job you know what it is kind of a viable
options for accessing lee up at the mex
api's sure so it is actually a very
interesting question for me because in
the first version of java effects you
know we had javafx script and what we
found was that there are a lot of
developers who just are not really
interested in you know going through the
pain of learning a new language and i
think that the same thing we will find
here as well that for a lot of people
you know they fer scala instead of
groovy or they prefer java instead of i
think for example one thing is that when
you're working and this is something
that java the language has really going
for it if you're working in a large
diverse organization the likelihood that
you will find other people who really
know agreed and maintain java is very
high the likelihood that you'll find
other people who can know and maintain
Ruby not as high so there's some
learning curve involved in doing so in
small development teams I mean heck you
could use Lua use whatever programming
language you are but for a large amount
of teams Chavez is very good no me toca
kitchen you should update which once I
saw no not have infection about each
other King go Devon activex that's how
it they they they keep good no kind of
shot what you are and also at all she
can move but your body pink you started
I do you think I eternity of day they
need Java technique era solo good let's
announce crypto gainfully when I stay
nope it's no job are they no topics API
always very very much stay a particular
model not confuse happy birthday when I

you
ribbit oh god no you are Skidmore no

Charlie tiny and on montana demo dick I
take you looking for the one I talk and
all shall I tell him orange and I can't
watch Ibaka showed you in Tahiti are you
know kajika arribas
no especially not Daniel kyosho posted
on facebook today I are born that way I
think of your 30 postera oh boy in this
article and it's ian had talking to so
so he's got a macbook air and he's
trying to run the in simple application
on it and it takes like over a minute to
start up and it's like the cpu goes
under it and it's still not starting yet
so our yeah it's very bad did you have
plans to fix that well I guess I haven't
seen that and of course I work on a mac
so we'd have to see what's going wrong
in potentially there could be network
related issue that's going on because
ensemble talks to the remote server for
javadoc in order to display the javadoc
game especially
so you can do that already I think we
already do that but um I just wanna do
your honor ji Hui no I will take you
five my x value based on taking finals
cafe
just talk with Ag course hulu client I
pity them or Marley boody access to sort
of way about that anymore oh no no GUI
or take you to the cultivated fields
over there it's just a job in fixable or
maggiano penal car might seek asylum
into that sort of all use cases I
suppose how they do visual reading right
so um in sorting so Microsoft uses
example I didn't know right as their UI
definition language is in their xml file
and their tools work with the sam'l and
for us the equivalent if you want to use
it is f XML which is included in its
very similar to zamel if you want to do
now we have not talked about putting
fxfl on the server side and although you
could have a web view inside the javafx
display whatever the output is from the
GSP for example I don't really / see
that as being a very common thing now
what we have looked at is whether we can
take a job FX application and running in
a web page without a plugin and this
would essentially be four thick client
web apps as opposed to fit client web
apps and in that case we would just
write your application in the normal way
just learning work frankly but that's
not a product and it's you know we just
something that we've explored
investigated
listen to saga it goes to do with all
this example example those ugly to you
my signature bass in all of you I market
taking it you know my water effects
effects similar to you much on Tony do
or external a single day this also
attractive asahikawa day no my JSP no

thats Sarah are no my email or email at
all I totally meet your criteria ocean
tomaste no viscosity so no Jade modulus
kinoshita nope no naka de you know well
kinoshita chronically know javafx no
application or take your stay mr. Logano
