going to be speaking at the upcoming
javaone conference in san francisco from
September 22nd through September 26th
today I have with me Robert Savage who
is the creator of the pie forge a
framework how you doing Robert doing
great so tell us a little bit about your
own what you do your company and why you
decided to to write this library well
I'm a computer nerd from way back when
I've got my Commodore 64 shirt on as we
speak and really you know that when the
Raspberry Pi came to be you know it
brought me back to the days of when I
was hands-on you know working with those
early computing devices so I've been a
big computer guys since uh you know the
early 80s and a dope in that vein I also
have a big passion home automation so
about almost 15 years ago I started
working for a company called AMX they're
based in Dallas and they are a big home
automation type of company home
commercial automation so I've been doing
that for a number of years and then most
recently when the Raspberry Pi project
came along I decided to kind of start
getting involved in the DIY movement and
start working on kind of a project to
help different job of programmers
experience some automation of their own
okay so Jim Weaver is on the stream and
one of his questions was what was the
sweet spot for Piper Jay and he'll
probably also help folks who who don't
know much about raspberry pi or embedded
hardware yeah so sweet spots the what I
wanted to bring to the end to the java
community was the ability for java users
to get physical to be able to interact
with the world through electromechanical
devices like relays sensors that they
wanted to work with um you know the
Arduino projects have been around for a
while that's a fantastic platform but I
think that these new low-cost arm
devices with full linux operating system
give us a whole new
world of power capability so I wanted to
kind of start the Pipers a project to
help job of programmers to be able to
play in that space with interacting with
the physical world so that's kind of
what its mission in life is supposed to
alcohol no you know one of the things I
like about the Raspberry Pi platform and
also the API is he wrote which are
really nice to work with is it's really
easy for Java developers to transfer
their skill set to a mobile platform
whereas before you have to do either
specialized c or work with a very
limited subset of Java or some other
language on the device right and that's
still that this case so underneath the
piper J is definitely a platform layer
where it's direct C code for which only
I was able to take manager a Jo Ann
Mangrum Henderson's work who produced
wiring pine which is a c library so
Piper Jake on top of that it exposes
that world of io communication to the
java community so that all Java profe
mess with J&amp;amp;I or Sarge a day or anything
like that cool so let's switch to your
desktop so um sure so my session I went
into titled it let's get physical
because really it is about interacting
with the world so I do too I personally
see this then of these low-cost arm
devices coming in in really taking over
in this space and that coupled with your
this DIY movement of people programming
on these kinds of devices I think we're
really going to see a lot of unique
projects emerged over the next several
years you know that you can't there's
nothing you can't do with these kind of
thanks extremely low cost and incredible
amount of power for an embedded platform
and that really hasn't been in the hands
of end users in the past that's
something that's been relegated to you
know see firmware programmers and
companies that can afford to buy
prototype boards and things like that
this
absolutely
well I'm going to keep it pretty simple
the the mission for Piper J is to make
this interacting with these are the
equipment digestible to any Java user so
I'm going to perform some fair you know
show some projects and share the source
code for some very simple things turning
on and off lights sensing a many
distance sensors where you can measure
distance between two points using you
know some some kind of a little ir
sensor and then interacting with serial
devices i got LED reader board that I
print out messages so maybe I'll look it
up to Twitter where an incoming tweet
can be disciplined coming through
Raspberry Pi and an interview
interfacing to real harbor commercial
Harbor
well at the moment it's still a project
that's in in development um it's
certainly very ready to do simple things
but where I really focused on movie
taking it forward is producing higher
level interfaces for you know more more
equipment so I'm not just turning on and
off gpio those or sending data bytes
over a serial bus but more I want to you
know bring in some device that has
meaning and create an API around so you
know bring in a garage door controller
interface and in venient in a java
programmers have more fun a device io
device API rather than lower level e yes
sir pushing the technology up making
additional interfaces for more concrete
real world things alright so um that was
that was a good test and I Jim nicely
pointed out that I screwed up the audio
so what happened is on when I switched
to the slide where my video wasn't
present the audio cut up hey Becca so I
think we should do a take two okay where
my audio is not missing from the
questions once we switch to the slide
alright so thanks Jim oh he can't see me
now I'm not on screen where's my side by
side alright so thanks thanks Jim for
pointing other slight audio issues and
we will do take two
due to do I would so anything I might
change about the script or how we're
going through stuff or is that
comfortable know if it works for you I'm
good okay I'll try to remember what I
said not I mean we can we can be fluid
and do whatever we want the second
ticket doesn't have to be exactly the
same and where did you want to close
things out because I wasn't quite sure
how much more you had to show we're
talked about was that about the end or
did you have anything else big you
wanted to highlight um maybe one more
thing and just turn you know are you
showing some webpages that's where a pie
for J project it's actually doing
something okay got it all right and then
I'll all kind of close it out and we'll
make it nice and short and sweet oh one
thing I other thing I figured out what
we're doing this is my window is
obscured by the title bar so I had to
drag it slightly over your face to get
rid of the UM the subtext which is no
good all right so stopping recording
welcome to night hacking calm I'm
interviewing different speakers who are
at the job one conference in a couple
weeks in san francisco from september's
22nd through September 26th with me I
have Robert Savage who is the creator of
the pie forge a project how you doing
Robert very good so tell us a little bit
about why you created the pie forge a
project and what you think it's sweet
spots are for java developers well when
the Raspberry Pi platform became
available you know I was one of the
early people in line waiting to give on
it I was very excited about the
opportunity of having such a low cost
low power consumption device that could
run a hole in it stack and capable soft
water and having Java as a background
working in the java programming i'm a
big believer in the you know write once
run anywhere they're kind of owe us to
be but the reason I created i purged a
because i wanted to extend some of that
philosophy down to the io layer
traditionally communicating with the
physical world through gpio and serial
LM and spi i squared see this kind of
buses would require you to write more
firmware level c kind of code so the
sweet spot for pie for j is to provide
very clean oo style interfaces for job
of programmers to be able to communicate
over the pie to that little level access
so they can do things in the real world
they can turn on and on we like it
slides since different things using
hardware sensors ya know this this opens
up a whole new world of physical
computing which previously was relegated
to low level c code or AP eyes which
were fairly difficult to hack for um for
developers so do you want to talk a
little about the upcoming session you
have a Java 1 i'm going to put your your
screen up sure so you have the section
titled it let's get physical because
really Piper J is about I oh it's about
being able to turn things on off to be
able to communicate with other sensory
devices or other control devices you
know my background is in home automation
and building automation so I'm a big you
know it's a passion of my life just to
be able to automate things so this is
really kind of an introductory course or
an introductory session to expose people
to be able to get physical you know do
things with Java program on a raspberry
pi or similar device and be able to
communicate with the physical world cool
cool so this is the the getting started
on Raspberry Pi hacking for your your
Java geeks absolutely so what sort of
what sort of other stuff can you do at
the PI forge a library in general um
well it predominantly is focused on
being able to commute to turn on not to
sit them miss GPI that communicate over
the serial bus on the PI hardware spi i
squared see those kind of data buses so
it lets you communicate with with
physical other quit so that's kind of
weird
today where I see it going and we're
starting to work on those kind of
interfaces is higher level divisive
faces so the ability to create sprinkler
controllers garage door controllers
things that have you know meaning lies
it may have more logic than just
physical I built on top of those core
constructs here cool we look on top of
those core constructs for the I squared
C bus and the different protocols the
device has talked right so bringing it
one step higher and make it easier for
your average consumer to be able you get
hands-on create things with it cool do
you have any examples of projects
created with Piper J yeah I have a on my
blog called savage home automation calm
that's where I just like to write my
journal thoughts or things that I'm
working on in my house so last Christmas
I used a pie for J and a raspberry pi
device to create a Christmas lights
sunrise sunset timer so the goal for
several of my projects is to keep it
extremely simple to make it easy for you
for people who come on board to be able
to create these kinds of devices and not
you know they're not having to get out
siren irons and know how to do this and
be kind of you know complex development
so here I've coupled this with a power
switch tail device would you buy on
Amazon look just two simple wires
connected up and then I provide the kind
of step-by-step instructions and sample
program to to set this up where now this
Java program running on our Raspberry Pi
determine sunrise and sunset based on
your longitude latitude and then
physically turns off this power switch
device which your Christmas lights are
plugging so some very simple concept
very practical but an easy thing to get
started nice nice that's a cool project
that they can folks can find on your
blog so let's take a couple questions
from the stream one of the questions
that came from job from Jim Weaver was
he was wondering if you know today when
doing PLC or plant for automation ladder
logic using your libraries or the
Raspberry Pi in general
um I haven't heard of it there's
certainly a lot of different kinds of
people using it as in flux with a lot of
emails and tweets and things like that
where people are using pi forge a
different way so it's pretty cool but as
far as a concrete example of a better
I'm not aware of it okay how about other
industrial applications of pie for JS
anyone contacted you with projects or
things that you're using it for in the
industry yeah I've been contacted I
think there's some people working on
kind of a car type applications where
they're they're doing sensory devices on
board of you know kind of DIY car kool
kool electric are kind of stuff no I
wouldn't say that in contact from the
fermenting agent commercial market I
mean those guys have their own yeah but
definitely Java hobbyists and your
average java developer trying to get
started with informatics oh and Carl had
a question too he's wondering how you
control motor servos using pi for j um
there's different implementations well
we have some stepper motor
implementations and i think just
recently into the deaf branch on github
and committed one of our contributors
provided some servo capability so I
haven't personally run that but there's
a brand new class setting out there to
communicate with her a little microchip
for server control cool all right so
thanks for taking time into your busy
schedule Robert to chat about your
upcoming pie for jo session and I look
forward to seeing you at javaone San
Francisco absolutely thank you very much
alright so I cut the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
