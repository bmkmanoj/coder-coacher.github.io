Network and I'm here today at devoxx UK
talking to Angela like I said oh hi hi
so Angela you've been doing demo about
3d and Raspberry Pi and so tell us about
it so yes so I really like building
demos that's kind of my passion and I
think being an evangelist let me do that
so they give me the freedom to do
whatever I want with technology which is
really great so nowadays we have the
Raspberry Pi is a very cheap kind of
small computer it's only like 35 is the
expensive version and you can really do
a lot with it so we have Java running on
it so we had to have Java SC embedded
and you can actually run we just
released Java ME embedded for the
Raspberry Pi 2 so it's actually pretty
cool and it right now have a SC install
so I have things like Java FX so believe
it or not I can have a nice java
application using Java FX technology so
what I wanted to do is I always think
about nice-looking user interface where
they used to really get immersed in the
application and well you have this a
small device that you can run java we
have screens like touch screen small
touch screens and what about getting
some information about your environment
like sensors right solder accelerometers
they're a gyroscope they're a bunch of
sensors that can give you a little bit
of information about positioning so I
thought okay what about putting
everything together I mean that's what
things get interesting all so hard but
that's when things get really
interesting when you start putting
things together so with the Raspberry Pi
you have some pins then you can actually
use connect things to so you have like
the general Europeans you have what
pings you have
SPI and you also have a square see there
is a kind of protocol that a lot of
devices today are using so for example
that we remote that we MotionPlus
actually has an interface for I squared
C so eventually my next project will to
connect Wii Motion Plus to the Raspberry
Pi to do something cool
I'm not sure what but it will figure I
was coming to that yeah so right now I
have a simple cellular meter and a gyro
in one chip and it actually communicate
using I square C to the Raspberry Pi the
Raspberry Pi corrupt that information
that sends her information and using two
displayed the JavaFX interface I wanted
if you think about constrained devices
and better devices it's really hard to
have a 3d environment I mean it would be
a little bit too much so the idea was to
use some techniques that were use
previously and on actually game
development something like parallax
where you have your environment is
actually created of multiple layers the
closer the layer is to you it will
actually move faster so in that way the
farther away of the layer this lower it
moves that gives you an impression of a
death in the environment so it actually
kind of simulate 3d so it's kind of a
treaty kind of movement without really
having to implement any 3d so that was
kind of the whole idea of the demo just
put things together make a nice
interface that can immerse the user into
the interface and this is actually the
first part of the demo what I'm going to
try to do is hide components in their
environment so you actually have to
discover as things move you can actually
discover for example treasures in the
environment things like that so make a
little bit of a game kind of application
for this but yeah the first part the
talk was about how to have this working
what do you have to have on the
Raspberry Pi to enable i-square see but
actually find out that it's not enabled
by default so there's a couple of things
that you have to do libraries Java
libraries that we have to talk to such
devices so there is actually available
to libraries one is the wiring pump is
to see a native application that allows
you to talk to those devices and on top
of wiring paths there is another library
that's called PI for Java that I
actually encapsulate that a wiring PI
and display provided with a Java
interface so programming for this is
extreme extreme is simple it's just a
Java interface will you just say okay
connect me to the boss
get me the device I want to get the
registry that has their cell aroma
treated and then you have so it's I mean
there's a lot of things available for
you and on the other side so that will
be the hardware hardware part for the
software part so Java FEX great way to
manipulate images so you know that in
Java phase one of the feature is to do
binding capabilities so you can actually
bind the layers and have them move so as
you change the binding variable the the
layers will actually move according
accordingly to those changes another
thing that you have affects allow you
that is it was really important here was
multi-threading functionality because of
course you have to have like a
background process that is getting the
sensor information so you have to have
that sensor really all the time so
constantly you need to know what's going
on with the sensor you have to inject
that information into you you are so
it's important to have a back-end thread
doing that JavaFX provide you with that
we task so you know it was a great way
of merging different technologies to do
something nice huh
maybe not very useful I like doing very
not very useful demos but very cool
demos so that's the whole idea to really
have fun with technology well it's a
very also showing all the aspects of the
technology my friend was calling was
calling day the pie pad because it looks
like an iPad but it's followed by a
raspberry pie so is a very low price pie
pad so yes so so what we're really doing
is trying to get the information on how
you tilt the device so for that I'm
using the gyroscope is giving you the
angular acceleration so whenever I move
a kid the angular acceleration the
problem with the gyroscope is as long as
I move it because I'm stopped there is
no more angular acceleration right so I
don't have more reading from the sensor
at that point but there are seller
ometer would give me that extra
information so their seller ometer will
actually measure acceleration against
gravity so the acceleration against
gravity will be different when you tilt
the device so the gyro will give me the
information yes you're moving once you
stop the extra information is being
provided by the accelerometer that say
hey yes you're doing an angle against
gravity so you're still tilting the
device because I need that information
if I'm tilting the device move keep
moving the user interface so you really
have to combine I really needed to
combine those two sensors to have an
accurate reading of the environment
great so the the your session will be
online in Polish people can actually it
was very funny this is always fun to
have you know play with technology and
have a lot of fun I like that I'd create
games yes I mean on top of that they pay
me for play with toys so I love my job
thank you for talking to us thank you
very much thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
