technology Network we're here at devoxx
talking to members of the java community
we've done a Raspberry Pi hackathon and
we're getting some amazing things in
just a short amount of time so I have
hot mouflon hot mutt nice to meet you so
tell me what you did here in terms of
your hack well I did my first project in
raspberry pi the interesting thing is
that I can do everything in Java I can
the tools that I know so I use netbeans
and maven I made a zip file that I can
download to the Raspberry Pi and run it
so it was a very easy to use some rest
interfaces to use the sensors which God
provided we have this little nice blinky
device which had some LEDs inside so you
can change the color this is connected
to my Raspberry Pi which actually talks
to this stuff the other raspberry PI's
until to this sensor and the sensor if
you get closer to it the blinky device
will stop blinking in red and you didn't
know Raspberry Pi at all when you walked
in here today no nothing at all so
actually this I bought this device this
morning so it was my first project on
this Wow fun yes yeah and you're using
your existing Java skills right yes also
all my normal Chavez kill that was
enough excellent so very cool thank you
how hot but we've got some really nice
hacks going here you can learn more
about raspberry pi and java at OTN java
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
