all of you here and right now I'd like
to share some some details some short
talk about completable future a little
bit details about that slide probably a
lot of already familiar with that slide
but I in anyway I have to put it I like
that's like really and if our company
didn't have such cute lawyers I would
ask them to do that because this slide
is my savings
I could bring total crap from from the
stage and this means I'm not responsible
for that
okay a couple words about me I'm working
in Oracle and my goal in Oracle my job
at Oracle to make GDK Java Java Virtual
Machine faster I am a performance
engineer so I have to check that it is
reasonable performance past performance
and if not to fix it in any areas I
didn't tie to particular Java libraries
concurrent stuff etc whatever needs to
management or to customer and this week
I am working on that so okay what we are
talking about a completable future is a
very nice class these are very nice
features which appears in Java 8
unfortunately completable future itself
wasn't used in any other parts of Java 8
just does exist and that's all I'll try
to understand how many people around
stars started to using that I did some
short throughway on a twitter asking how
people are using completable future you
could see results and I want to ask you
about that
first of all please raise your hands who
is using completable future in your code
cool who is just play with that and who
do nothing about computable future guys
I just want to you I'm sorry I won't
tell about completable future I am
trying to explain performance tricks
performance syncs how to use it faster
and I have no time to explain the huge
details about computable fish itself but
I hope it'll be and again yet another
question to that guys who are using
completable future in production please
who is a satisfied and happy with that
class and who is not okay please come to
me after the session all may be in
Grenada questions I want to talk I want
to collect it back about that stock
really you could see that less than half
of answered people are using completable
future now I try to understand what's
happening on github just try to make a
search in completable future and we
could make conclusions that adoption of
completed which is not very big but it
increases increase in each year what we
have a new in Java 9 first of all I'd
like to say that in Java 9 we already
have usages of completable future inside
our libraries it's such libraries like a
prototype and the most interesting part
is a new HTTP client most of results
most of performance tips which I will
give it's not assumptions that I just
invented it a practical practical sinks
which were found when I was working on
HTTP to client performance so it's a
practical findings maybe I lost some
ideas but
so it just didn't appear on that okay
a couple of words about new HTTP client
which appeared in Java nine it's a new
API which should cover boss HTTP 1.1 and
HTTP 2 is new API
unfortunately this client is not a part
of Java standard yet because of it was a
lot of discussion and arguing about it
and we decided to put this client into
incubator incubator is a new feature
it's some kind of sandbox where a new
API will leave for some period of time
and after that we have only two choices
you'll have choice change a penance to
the ties that or we could choose to drop
it drop off completely so 4 gdk9 HTTP
client in incubator that is why it's
quite important for us to get your
feedback and to change and improve that
existing API anyway you could download
gdk9 and play with that I won't tell
about HTTP client I just will try to
concentrate it about asynchronous
request because of its a goal of our
discussion so in the HTTP client we have
two ways to send request
it's the synchronous unblocking request
and asynchronous how they looks like
synchronous or block in requests looks
very simple we are preparing request to
do in sand and waiting until our HTTP
response arrives we are blocking and
that invocation of method set after that
we got completely final finished
response and could extract all
information which we need from that and
also our plan has a method sank send
async synchronous in that case we don't
block in that invocation
we just return completable future of our
aspirants
and somewhere we could do that future
whatever you want we could just walk on
that future to wage results so we could
attach the chain of action and process
them so and the other thing which I want
to emphasize for our HTTP client is a
ability to set up the executor
so in general we have a lot of a lot of
options to make a client
bla bla bla what what's required to do
proper work is HTTP protocol even to
choose below you could see we are on
HTTP to the new standard but as I told
we are providing two methods blocking
method and asynchronous and if we have a
synchronous method we should we should
somewhere do with that execution because
of our original method is not block and
in order to provide user its API it's
not of a standalone application some
control of our execution we should have
ability to set up external executor
because of and user could narrow or
expand that area whatever okay what I
was think about blocking an asynchronous
API particularly I will think these two
kinds of methods the first method which
is doing something and returning
completed result for us and asynchronous
which is doing national moment of
invocation and return completable future
I won't talk about different kind of a
scene who knows providing call bags etc
it's out of scope of that discussion
just let's talk about completable future
ok the question is do you really need
boss
such methods simultaneously what do you
think
but I just want to show you the
following the the one sinkers the
following it's it's very easily with a
greased in API to convert I synchronous
to synchronous on vacation just to do
join on completable future and throws a
society we could make we could take our
blocking API on pass to the supply ships
made up of completable fusion will be
executed in salmon as a thread and we
will get completable fusion that's
enough so the question is maybe make
sense just leave one of the fellas and
don't explode our public API let's talk
about them first of all let's consider
the first sinks if implementing blocking
API just having a synchronous API as the
base basic stuff it's the whole three
lines which we need to make our block in
a pan working will it work yes exactly
it will work but let's see how it will
work so what we have we have set of
users threads users that I mean it's
rate of user environment where we call
methods of our API and because of what a
synchronous there is a some executor
where we should do useful work and we
are doing useful work in an that
executor of course such kind of transfer
from one state to another and back it
should cost let's just just check how
how much does it cost
let's do some execution I did it's
relative chart I have some execution 100
nanosecond useful work 100 microseconds
useful work and 100 milliseconds from
work it's a blue line it is taken by
100% and orange
it's our overhead of transferring that
execution to
yeah and for the first line 100 a second
I have no place it should be ZZZ these
orange lines should be passed here here
here there but it's looked like for
quite a large part of execution with
large box like 100 milliseconds 10
milliseconds even one millisecond it
doesn't matter how big is acute okay
let's check later
let's check when I do execution of to
stress in case of some stations ever hat
is increasing and cleanse the execution
of fosters I know I did a Greek ution on
that particular my laptop which a way of
showing your presentation it's a Lenovo
ThinkPad blah blah blah
it's Casa it has to to your course and
to hyper thread so we generally have
four Hardware threads for our execution
and the letter K is letter chart in the
situation when our system is situated i
have threads the same amount on more
than my hardware allows me to do and in
such situations they ever had of a
synchronous accusin even in case of very
large blocks like 100 milliseconds it's
already quite feasible that is why i
think it's responsible for the first
question why we need separate
synchronous employed can appear black an
api we need when we have to provide
maximum performance in terms of
throughput don't do something in
parallel it will rocks better so okay
it's somebody also transition form of
execution tasks from one thread to
another thread costs so it's quite a
simple idea makes sense to try to avoid
it
ok let's talk about the second way if
you have block in API could be easily to
create a synchronous a page just by
submitting our tasks continuous threats
and in this classical way usually we
have a legacy pair when we already
have a block in a parent we just want to
add a synchronous API
will that work let's just change it from
our abstraction do something and let's
back to our steep climb in a steep
client it would be looks like this I
have to say that it will works but not
in all cases and I'm sorry we have to
spend maybe less 10 minutes to explain
why and so two cases when it won't work
so how typical HTTP request looks like
we send header to server will send body
we are waiting header awaiting body it's
it's very very simply kated picture of
course there are a lot of other details
what these receive means it means that
we have to wait we have to wait and
block something okay count of possesses
let's check it how hard work we
transferred our execution to digital
thread and we have to the block wait it
could be message wait on object monitor
or it could be measured away it on a
condition it could be some kind of
blocking cubed ultimatum beneath of
blocking queues there is a wait again
anyway we should stop on some way to
wait and we will stop execution how a
traitor's not working anymore
what we have to do is in that case we we
have to execute somewhere the methods
which will receive response from a
server and the method which will send
notify signal to our great condition and
continue execution is that's right I
have to warn about such scheme which I
wrote here don't do that
why in that key my eyes and receive
response in the same executor what does
it mean it means in some situation my
executor could be blocking all stress
and I have no place where to process a
response and where to wake up so in
reality I need some
and more than just user set executor
says I need some amount of oxygen
Astraeus it could be zero it depends of
goals it could be a lot of them but for
httpclient
it's one is enough some kind of folks to
the street which will never block and
which will do proper processing of
received data and waiting in our stress
which we are waiting results how it
works it's the first part of the second
part I showed you the meta executor of
ship client which narrow the usage of my
visa cuter allows me to configure the
system and I think that it's a good idea
that if we don't specify some we really
don't put some constraint on that method
it should allow to our library truck
with any kind of executor more including
default executors default executors
caches thread pool let's think about
little bit about cassia stress pool it
just copied Javadoc and won't read it
aunt emphasizes what a nice think about
caches thread pool it means that if all
hours rest busier will create new sets
and our new task will be executed cool
but the same thing is a negative power
negative things about caching cesspool
because of we have to create thread and
thread to the resource it could be
expensive let's just do some experiments
it's a sound very beginning if you try
to implement our HTTP request via simple
wrapping of existing block in API we
just some moment measured and realized I
don't know why but the single HTTP
request general uses 20 threads
doesn't mean that 100 simultaneous
requests will required 200 stress any
ideas other than 200 layers more
yes maybe on the sandwich machine with
configuring and expanding stacks pipe
spaces etc it will work but I could unit
for 100 simoleons requests but someone
will get you to 101 requests ok what do
you think how to fix that problem if you
blocked in what innovate thread in our
executor so we have to solve it what we
have here we have a send methods which
doing a wait and waiting result the idea
of how to avoid blocking is quite a
simple it's consists of two steps first
of all it's very nice things that
completable future could be considered
to the condition it's only single-use
condition but for God's sake it's the
same code as before
it's block in the same way as before
because of inside drawing there is a
weight but it's only the first step the
second step what we are doing here we
are trying to perform supply a sink sent
code and some web block
let's inline that and drop into
different set of action in order to
understand how it works we are making
chain and here is the chain way we just
blocking on completable future let's do
this
who all knows what made a design compose
Doom does how it works
nobody's guys there were a lot of hands
that you are using completable future
how you could use complain of future
without than compose definitely it's an
almost impossible to do Samson Samson
interesting without than Campos aye
then well then composed on the compose
is made at which perform lambda function
action that action return completable
future and then compose return another
computable fusion which is
encapsulate results of our hidden under
our previous complete level fish which
were what like a method flat map in a
functional programming but then the most
interesting part she is that if that
completed of fish is not completed at
that moment we are not blocking we are
just we are not executing our chain of
action here
we just finished which is construction
we are not going to be secured this
action here and that means that our
stress will be returned to execute errs
if it's read from skilled it means we
did not captures this thread from
execution that's ready to review do
something useful its key part of that
sink in reality it's completely
eliminated blocking when we use
computable fusion making changes Quietus
things nothing so what we have here we
have here our threads we are here we are
doing them compose method there is an
object's our future and from our oxygen
threat we just send in signal complete
it means that when future became
completed somewhere maybe another threat
we execute subsequent change fractions
and doing what was required that is
simple results on HTTP client by simple
emanation of all blockings we got and
change replacing them to Zen compose you
got 40% of speed-up of work enemies
particular how an you should be client
and this is blocking elimination is the
most important things how to make
completable future faster it if you are
making chain of our confusion
you shouldn't block if you don't block
our stress or the return
snails and that is quite important the
slide is just it's just related to
performance and just for educational
purposes moment then compose I thought
it's the most interesting method in the
calculate above huge actors this example
show you how to make infinite recursive
chain of completable fusion if you want
only with that we could do this Oh as
adjust does Google guys it's very
amazing stuff ok let's move further
before we will continue our talk I just
want to ask you the following question
let's imagine I have two strands and
from ones that I'm doing future complete
and from other straight I am attaching
chain affection which thread will give
you to our action who will vote for for
case a b c d r how we could educated for
that correct answers that it could be
executed either from set one or either
from so true and also that is quite
important point where the chain of
computable future will be executed for
processing and without understanding
that we can't talk about complain about
future performance it's just some
summary I will later I will show
examples but here a little bit summaries
I just saying is that if we are using
methods then apply then compose etcetera
the this action could be executed
anywhere it can be executed from a
threat which perform completion of our
future it could be executed from chain
construction in places where we are
constructing our chain or even it could
be written from a place when we call get
join users here I want to show you a
couple several examples which I did
using distress
it's some such tools which were done
sometimes for analyzing tasting some
concurrency G tricks inside inside GDK
side job it's the first example little
bit about notation above its
precondition it's that performed before
we executed our threads on the left side
that's one threat on the right side it's
not a straight they executed
simultaneously a lot of a lot of type
times to get to capture all kinds of
races huge we could get first example
from one threat we are doing complete
from another state we are doing shank
instructions below you could see results
it's an exact number of that execution a
lot of action inside construction said a
lot of lock action inside completion
strength another example what will
happen if you do future complete from
two threads who know what's return type
of future complete return type of future
complete method is boolean could you
guess what does it mean what know
yes mail complete reasons true if that
invocation completed future or return
false if that location failed to
complete future because of it could be
race okay let's make an action and make
an action before trying company it's
just future action and I to the
completion from two strands
before I wrote that that test I was
thinking that it was a journalism action
should be from successfully completion
thread but it's not a true it also could
be executed from another thread which
failed to complete okay there was a
second example we are just doing one
complete and one join just getting
results from our future and the same
that action could be executed from both
stress due to the rains nature of the
threat and the last example because try
to be questa when I have a future and
two action it's parallel independent
action I just attached like two chains
and from our one straight I'm doing
complete from another straight time to
enjoy and again both of my action could
be executed from the single thread or
both of my action could be executed in
different and it's an issue so why we
have such where's the behavior in
reality all methods in computer we know
future has several forms like then apply
and corresponding methods then applies
in query we could specify particular
executor where we want to be our action
for execution why we definitely needed
and to get an answer for SATA and trying
suggestion to compare performance of
that I have a simple chain of two
actions not a lot of and one chain is
doing then apply it means that we don't
have additional submission for executors
each time and the knowledge in a supply
Synchron
action zipper separately submitted to
execute in here the performance also
because of very different numbers I'm
showing only relative differences for
small tasks so a difference quite
visible for large tasks maybe doesn't
matter for our transition but again it
still exists until our system is
saturated when they have a lot of
threads the difference between the
single thread chain and Martin guitar
chains could be different so the
conclusion is simple we have to form of
methods n Samson Samson I think by two
reasons a sink gives predictability you
have control way to execute your code
but then something gives performance way
not to go back' and also it just the
same about transition or execution from
one thread to another
why we need predictability there is a
simple example particularly from the
same way as our HTTP client we have only
one single aux fleurs ready
it's called selector manager it just
really sleeping on new selector getting
notification read data from network and
dispatch data to particular receivers
very simple okay how it works in the
situation we have a future and we have
set of actions action foo is action
which change to a future inside our
executor thorough internal action but
after that we return our future to user
and a user could attach any kind of
action to confusion its idea to of
completed future to chain actions so we
have chains of actions if you are doing
complete from a selector what does it
mean it means that we could boss actions
foo and bar execute from that particular
selector manager why we should not do
that because of you don't know how much
time
Foom okay you could know about Excel
fool you could measure you could do it
you could write but you don't know
anything about action bar and it could
be any kind of dos attack for your
system we have one important very
important beeps read and you do a lot of
action here
that's right won't read anything from
Network dispatch as a request and all
activity who stop so you can't do that
you need predictability you should avoid
such kind of education here we just
can't from executors read make them
compose some actions and here's a make
completion of our action what happened
oh there are several ways to solve that
problem first of all in Java nine we got
a new methods which absent in Java 8
which called complete I think it means
that we won't execute anything from our
selector menus latent will complete
execution to us available straight in
executors nice the same way to solving
the problem in and Chara eight we are
doing complete here but we know and by
using design compose sync we protected
our select managers right that's nice it
works right now you got really working
solution but it costs and it caused that
if we are have for example already
completed fusion making them compose we
are making them compose as sync and we
are doing it from a one executor said we
have the same problem we be very
frequently doing transferring tasks from
one is in theatres and the cuter trap
and that is useless activity maybe we
could unit somehow it's a quite simple
trick let's check it if our future done
or not done before
and if our future are done let's do them
Campos and in that case will be executed
directly in that top point from the same
thread without any issues if our future
is not completed yet ok
say if we have to move into executors
and provide such kind of protections of
the identity function with a sync option
to move it in the executor and that tree
could not tip that is the tree a tree
but that give for us 16 percent of
execution time for our HTTP client it's
it's quite a nice result just just just
change just just write three lines of
code to get sixteen to send you really
can do that and yet another trick I know
we have the following chains of action
to our completable fusions like King
inside of medicine nursing and methods
and AIESEC is called from user start and
we are expecting that it will make all
details return completable future almost
immediately
our API because of it should basically
on practice it realized I checked that I
did some measurement and realized that
in very rare cases only 3% of requests
but in 3 percent of requests when we
passed the last composed actions we
already have a completed future because
of server respond for us we got results
but we have to do some some other
results and process like but getting bad
etc cetera if we have for such chain we
have already completed future it means
that the last chain the tail of chain
actions will be executed from user
thread we transfer but we wanted
everything transfer to executor strength
not do it from users okay we could use
then compose I think as I told you
thread will be protected we will not
doing something but again the same
station
unnecessary switching when we don't want
how to solve that problem it's
the simple idea let's do chain of
execution just make a complete ball
incomplete futures beginning make the
whole food chain of our completable
fusions full chain of actions which we
need to do and only one our chin is
ready to trigger the cue ssin just
sending the matter complete a sink and
providing middle voice really with no
will be enough it enough triggers to
diffuse the whole chain and delayed
start give us some practical examples
plus 10% two synchros request any
questions
it's quite a simple I have huge I don't
need the result so I could make a
computable future void complete about
fusion avoid what's complete about
difference between complete stable
future of wood and completable future of
boolean who could guess how many states
a happen completable future boolean and
completely future void what
for complete o future of boolean I have
States complete normally this true
complete normal use false incomplete and
complete with exception for void I have
less debt I have incomplete complete
with exception and complete because of I
have no any other values for where it's
then no but I just want to have complete
or incomplete future need details here I
could use any kind of type here but void
is minimal enough and the last and lyin'
lyin' I'd just triggers execution
because of I completing my future and
there is in start running before that my
chain is protected because of the
topmost future want to be executed I
just constructions chain and and just a
simple simple trick gives me ten percent
real HTTP requests examples yes yes
because of the KD of all I synchronous
requests for completable fuchsia is not
about completable future
it's about threads the threads is our
key resource we don't need a lot of
threads and we don't need a few months
we need a right amount of stress usually
comparable with this amount of course on
our machine or somehow else limited by
our environment and we have to avoid
unnecessary stress we have to avoid
inefficient amount
and we have to avoid unnecessary
transition from one server to another
that's all and if we delay the start of
always if usually wheels just making for
us better understanding where my actions
will be executed to avoid all kind of
races and just do it and select the last
trick which I want to show you it's not
related to complete the fish itself but
I can't hide it at should know as I told
the default executors for our ship plan
is cached at pool is that a really good
choice why no no all after all fixes I
did a lot of execution it didn't grow
more than 100 strats anything what what
i doing
except of user action of course which
could block but it's it's you submitting
the actions but the problem is that as i
told it's not really the best read the
best executor for HTTP request i didn't
try to do something unethical and cetera
I just did practical evaluation because
of I have a benchmark I could different
executors and check how it works and for
particular HTTP to protocol fix its
report the cuter with just two three at
maximum gives me the best results lately
it's easy for me to explain that because
of I know how the ship it works it
limited to write Internet or colita me
because it's sequential part of which
hardly to paralyze it limited to whistle
encoding because the cell encoding also
hard to paralyze that is why I to stress
as more than enough to get the fastest
but the right tools of the future could
give you a huge difference of I think
incipient you should check it for your
application ok a little bit conclusion
we were talking about completable huge
performance and I definitely asking guys
where what's the problem what you'd like
or don't like incomplete no future and
such kind of complaint I am getting for
many many times
everybody told me that completable
future has particular completion stage
as a key interface of computable which
has a very difficult phase a lot of
methods hard to remember we have four
minutes remaining and I hope in last few
means I will show you how to speed up
not computable future but to the Java
developer okay completion stage it has
exactly 38 methods and 36 from this 38
it's a duplicated method in three forms
something a sync with the explicit
executor something async without its
final executor and that sums let's check
Samson I think it means that that
actions we should be submitting here we
are given and that invocation will be
passed to that Spitfire to execute that
action all subsequent change its I show
an example it's quite important for
predictability
the second method it's the same as
before just we are using a fork join
pool as an executor means NASA and the
short method that means that if future
is complete we will execute action in
place if not complete that will be
diluted from other situation which is
much more difficult combination so as a
top 36 method has three forms what it
means it means we have only 12 methods
for understanding transactions now in
from these 12 method could be separated
and three forms apply except trap also
they have completely the similar
behavior the difference is a polar apply
is taking results from a previous future
and I think new results for subsequent
future accept just getting
results from a future giving it to
consumer no more results and final
computable future has a type words as
shown for us that execution is finished
when that completable future completed
this means that our occasion is finished
and run again we don't take any results
you don't prop from previous execution
we don't provide any results to
subsequent change of the question we
just execute runnable and these nine
methods it's quite a simple so we have a
simple in consent applies and accepts
around we have a binary or operational
in binary and operations when we have it
in or we started our chain when Isis is
in port aliza this input is ready in
binary and operation as usual we're
waiting when boss results are ready for
us it's quite simple with these two nine
methods we have three metres for
exploration which means methods and
again you should forget that all matters
before half-alien without some new visa
sink and I think version we have another
the methods ramirez then Campos handle
and when complete I already told you a
little bit about and Campos you could
read something about that late of
understanding how to do is that there
are a lot of interesting blogs around
the stuff probably I have to add links
I'll do it maybe later and handle handle
it's a method which works not only we is
normally completed future but at me is
exceptionally complete description we
just taking results or exceptions as to
pair of arguments pass it to a function
and provide new results and when
complete it's the same as handle it's
accept version of handle we are taking
result so exception but it doesn't
matter which result will provide the
results of males when complete will be
the same as region that's all employers
are 2 menno's with which don't have
a sink form as exceptionally which
allows to convert exceptionally
completed future to normally complete
the future with some results and method
converts completion state to complete my
future from my point of view that's all
it's not so difficult to remember all
methods from completion stage to work
result okay
I'm sinking of out of time so do you
have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
