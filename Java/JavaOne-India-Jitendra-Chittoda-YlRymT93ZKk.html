technology Network we're here at JavaOne
India talking to members of the Java
community I've got to tender with me
agita Naru hi
yep everything's all right good you I'm
doing well so tell me about your role in
the Java community yeah I am the
co-leader Delhi and NCR Java is a group
and we are trying to come up we are
trying to catch up all those all those
employees so they're working in that
part of area so we are covering out and
we are trying to connect to all those
right okay and you just you did a
session yesterday what was that about
yeah it was related with the sequential
concurrency so it's a kind of a new
design pattern that most of the
companies do use that pattern but they
do not have their implementations
already there in means they do not find
that Emma implementations and somewhere
but so that's why we came up like this
is the implementation that we are
providing and you can use it and you can
make you right now companies are doing
it from scratch they are creating it so
this design pattern from scratch so
that's the problem
most of the companies
okay so and you're solving it with this
new design pattern yes we have dr.
Henske boots have provided a new
implementation that is called a scribe
executor service so we are solving the
problem desired and how can a developer
find out more about it if they're not
here at Gavilan India yeah there is a
special tax on the github there is a
github and they stripe executor service
service so maybe you can go with a
doctor hands covered user ID or maybe
they can connect their with my ideas
Jade or off on and Kitab okay we'll put
that in the video yeah so tell me a
little bit about the user group in Delhi
and what it's like and how often do you
guys meet yeah our Delisle group is
pretty small one and so we are recently
started at three months by economy so we
are actually looking for more
professionals to join us that's why we
haven't had any meetups or so far but
maybe in in a month's time we were just
on time okay and there's a Twitter
handle they can follow over we don't
really we have not created any
two-terminal we are on we are working on
special and I use a group that is called
DNC a jerk
okay and we call it a caller user
profiles Bangkok okay that's cool okay
so here's your chance delhi developers
to get in on the ground floor of an
up-and-coming Java user group jokes are
a great opportunity to meet other
developers learn what's going on in the
technology trying out new things and you
can try something out and do a
presentation yourself it's not that hard
and other people love to learn what
you're learning so thank you thank you
coming by
