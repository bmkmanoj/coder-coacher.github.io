start it's very it's great to be here
Lacey's a sample from Alibaba GM team
I'll show speaking today about the
optimizing work of Adi data riverbank
okay let's kick out if you look at the
agenda the first part I think I will
talk about low workload we already used
in Alibaba the second part is a we just
talk about al major optimizing work at
Vegeta Alibaba I think Lee is a major
work and the third part goes to talk
about how we provide the technical
support for our Java developers the last
colleges are related to summary and the
QA okay let's go I'll raise our overall
introduction actually all the java
application developers in Alibaba as
well as our up limited companies
including RFA arguing and tenure or all
them are running on our customized
decree it's based on which decrease we
call as AG degree and our architecture
is so it's auntie oriented it means that
request will be processed between
different service so it will involve
multiple RPC calls the second
characteristic is our architecture is
heterogeneous it means it'll involve the
interoperability between native with our
language and Java and actually we use
Java very very massive scale
I just saw your data raise the data I
get from China single day again last
year
you can look look at this picture our
pickle transaction per second
reach to 175 Soren and the payment are
used to upper Valentine Judah Frankie
Soren
so actually in nori Alibaba has a
several mechanism to handle aces changes
made by such a huge Chinese attractive
volume we spend a lot of efforts on
software optimization unity Spock Isis
to share some experience from TVM thank
you
the first thing I try to talk about we
just build some container resource
management technology for GM here is a
comparison between multiple insensitive
deployment and a single useful
deployment and you have known the
traditional you container such as Apache
Tomcat it is just a support multiple web
application can deploy the interesting
theorem instance however in reality with
just the tip or the only single instance
single web application into our
container as in column one our major
agency is Java platform they are not
provide the solid resource consumption
for web application let's let the region
why we come out of this technology you
can kayak up Moscow advocacy unit into a
GM
give amusement and the land will create
attendance resource container for you to
learn actually Tennessee is a very very
virtual concept and that you can map a
tender as for example a single sweat or
a single other group
even our I see a bundle and the land
always considered consumption we made at
her pendant unit edit enter level so
phase the simple application a simple
API to the demo suited for you the
of the class is a technic configuration
reset the user to maintain resource
consumption information for tenant
result open configuration information
for 1010 the container is used to do
parent are specific attendance these are
called a snippet you can see you just
are krutov one tenant under then you put
a post CPU usage and the hyper GG only
to tenant and there just to take a close
look at the low CPU limit we just use
the integer value file 12 actually
listening Q value is a relative Savior
here which used to identify available
time to the pen to the Kiwi example you
were given we have two tenants 10 a and
10 B equal 10 a how worst if you shared
that for example 100 then canopy 200 as
a result that canopy we will receive
with twice table time out in a ok let's
talk about the legit we didn't even read
an attendant the weather will be
attached to lieutenant automatically
when the thread entered into this is
your measure showing you little code
example and the land built detached from
listen while leaving little block under
any sweat equal you focus read English
wrong measure and the lizard will be
attached to list and automatically and
also last we just provide some option to
our developers they can be limited the
maximum so as the tender kind is allowed
to use
let's look at the hallway to see fuel
management of positives for tenant we
just talked about the implementation on
Linux platform on Linux Linux doesn't
provide the group for secure management
by using C group we can position all of
courses for all the processes into a
different group and then you can assign
people in the consumption policy for
each our hood actually process processes
and sewage which begin the same way from
singular perspective or it only sees
both of them at the top so back to our
GM in tax cuts for the implementation
exact increments when to run meddling
using Java third object and a native a
third object so creates a look at this
example without an 8/10 a has a true
native sweat for stable sorting without
the put a little native sweat the list
this underlines who natives words
include a similar group so let the civil
come something made by 10 a we will
subject pool policy made by C group ok
let's look at the detail directories you
know is also Cooper is rear-ended
rear-ended by directory here's the
example just look at later passing we
have what T 0 T 0 is at 10 ID we created
for 10 0 and the gene pgo directory we
have was passed a subdirectory nearly
structure also as owned by 10 0 we'll
put into lace chakras of subjective
under the file cpiotto TR is used to
maintain the stable kata information
found four 10s 0 you will give us wedded
service between 10 and the last word
must we must be put into a different a
single body Roderick
okay ladies talk about how we do capable
crippled management of attendant
actually with little modification based
on gon GC event is the area we have
known divides in clarify Peninsula you
could resize the simple region with us
the curator and allocating context for
each panel under we just use text we
call text to mend you all escape using
used by tenets
most specifically you can look at this
picture and the eternal favor region
will maintain our one point with the
point which point simpler types so that
we can easily identify all the simple or
creepy region for tenant and the one
paper region only contains the objects
from single tenant we also limit the low
crippled tender Hobart consumption by
the maximum number of every region the
tendon is allowed to use we also need to
consider some other things essentially
even TC is a coping connector if it does
the caucus object from from space to
space
so in our 10 as the leasing context we
did win the make sure we copy object to
correct table region please example we
chose a ticket a tender one other as
example all the live objects from
Kenneth 0 must be copied into the
survivor region on the bartender one of
the GC
in severity and we also need to consider
some other changes for an isolation the
one cases he'll ever Culebra is used for
faster object allocation actually the
collab is totally relying on a basis the
basis provided by HIPAA region
so when sweater switching between
kindness for example give a sled a third
one switch switch from an 8 to 10 MP
then we needed refresh that reliable
information for this to add one so that
we need to make sure the PLO collabo use
the liquid region on by tender be if you
persevere to 10v another option is maybe
we can use our relative easy way to
implement race for example Venezuela's
switch between tenants and you can
either just returned pledging our pRb
buffers up this region the second change
is with the senator calculator
I hope you know I hope uses as well
folding is used to trigger mix pieces we
needed calculus I hope of alternate so
the mix pieces might will be triggered
appurtenant this actually leads to last
question absolute we need the TC patent
it means which of the two g's important
one but of without any impact on others
i release things out in very interesting
question but it is very hard we are we
needed for exploration polish
because of extremely complex data our
implementation
earlier we have known all applications
are packaged into the same exterior
mutants so within the provides our
modern stuff for our java which refers
to monitor the status of each audio
application either over our advocacy
unit so we do Clemente a standard DMX
API for our Java developers they can
easily detect the how massive you he'll
be used or hamas chief has used the 14
for CBO sequel already has accounting
subsystem for security
so with our celebrity letter capacity
and reach the data and reporting it to
our Petula a player application by TMX
API for hips we just use tags to
maintain the shape consumption
information and the land use post them
to learn Java developer by DMX API ok
the last page for continued technology
where we use it in Alibaba we already
have a lead on head is a module each of
modified version by Alibaba based on
average home kept it allows multiple web
application deploying to the same g3
container leaders are useless technology
for so we have expulsion for it'll keep
deployed the web application the second
cases are we called the cloud engine
which is the pewte on OS their
technology unit listed scenario latest a
map map is all OSGi bundle as a tenant
land they can use lists for resource
consumption management we also some
other cases this is a some sort of has
some information management platform
latest you know the load crew a script
dynamically and the land they want to
because this equates with our developer
buys some others that he parties they
needle use this technology to control
resources and some buttons me the
ballast whoo-wee
to script little map let's group to a
special container so far with another we
haven't an inkling with any absolute
I'll certain important maybe we consider
in the Nexus the plan the second thing I
just want to share is how we use recruit
him in our situation for our you come
ecommons
application I just use a simple example
them through the impact caused the bias
throughout the context we develop a
sample application it has for iOS and
many other pins in origin which is a
profiling it and you can see the sweater
contacts interval high of four called
machine so it's a temp in theory has a
impact on our soul food we want food we
do sick yes a single API were introduced
unity our seven by using it loom
actually you can easily write a given
driven application in poor actor pattern
his example uses the current process
which request for activity with complete
handle we see designer for protecting
completion events butter however we have
seen some drawbacks caused by a single
API actually it brings hard complexity
to our charitable efforts this is partly
because the separation between the call
colors and the 300 return results also
it's very hard to be bad for example you
cannot simply uses things single step
maybe a single service ability to debug
your code baggage in a visiting
news tree for were the way so it's very
hard I think the last version is also
developed important region all the
existing libraries all the existing
studies so the value libraries are not
working late
for example you just call up restaging I
think this way you have two beautiful
results using notes actually in this
case you lose the pet performance
benefits made by a famous actually it's
done no no makes sense for us to rework
all the listening library to support the
Asian facing asynchronous basis changes
we cannot accept it we cannot afford it
here's a demo example to show how our
approach tires work extreme here's a
simple example to demonstrate our broad
experience only have a three step in
step of an or create a normal user
service and the new step two we just
create a trigger object for waiting
inputs and legends every recruit a
writer object which will send the
message to the reader socket from this
simple example you can see we did not
use any additional API for using routine
we cope with the you recording like the
sweat so in our context coding has a
sweater like us matrix with with by
using this way we can achieve vomit or
asynchronous but maintain simplicity or
coding
before diving before tile into our
detail you can imitation I just go
through two corners stone technology we
already used for our approach the first
thing is as I single you all you know
given coding we see you claimed as a
part of multi languages project you shot
you can create multiple coatings in a
sim sweat by using this stuff and you
can use your the API it helps to
transfer controls from coding a
four-count OB basis let's the basic
technology already implement as part of
a Miriam project okay the second thing
we'll use the user which we are relying
on selector by using selector actually
you can use only one single sweat to
mention multiple channels for example
you can you can register multiple i/o
events including accept connects with
alright with which with interesting
channel and the land you will get a
notify when when some I will event is
ready the clay idea is with the using
selector MacKinnon for our coding
scheduling in local network i/o cases I
think I use a very detailed example to
demonstrate the hotel you can work just
look at the code asleep in the top left
you have web blocked synchronously the
call on this channel so what will happen
to you know underlying implementation
just look at the color snip in the
bottom the answer is there this is our
detail implementation
you know first step which is the check
whether or not the channel is read is
readable if we so then we read the date
and the return results to our color
otherwise to casings we are going to do
the first thing is which acid reaches
the three the human with the selector
actually scheduler and the land with the
counter coating we will be blocked and
the lens scheduled to another available
core working at least time basis that it
helped let's look at the full picture so
we have a thread object and the learning
we have us we have created a scheduler
nuisance for it's also the object please
schedule region is responsible for
managing unskilled scheduling all
recruiting the units whether as we have
said in underlying the schedule the
scheduler you totally depend on selector
reseachers for menu of profile each
profile cases for little sweat when some
our events happen and the bank vachetta
some notification is time for schedule
schedule - schedule next core routine in
runtime we see picture let's look at the
overall schedule process we have created
our terminology based engine to review
parent our scheduler and you can retest
there multiple interesting events with
this scheduler for example I will block
out event as I have shown people and
also you can adjust the sweat department
for example a ricotta pie so asleep and
then when the schedule when according
will be scheduled actually we have three
conditions the first condition is when
some events happen when some interesting
events happen for example some I will
complete right or some time of the
events happen
you call sweat asleep with 100
milliseconds and then time expire then
we have me to that time each time for
scheduled tour schedule next next go
routine all some sort unpacking events
are genuine survive for example object
modifier
we will talk about it in detail later
all the second the second condition user
when new requests allow so the schedule
NIDA have additional coding for lazy new
tasks of all is exclusion the third
condition is a band thread or coding
exceeds for example when sweater meat
weather is about it we need eaten either
schedule all recordings for you for
execution before you see is it this is a
single API we provide for our jar
developers with this engine
we spaniel provides two api's dispatch
it allows it to your drunk-ass feeding
our coding using weather in skewed you
can submit tasks into the coding in a
different as well we also implement
whispers read and execute actually is a
normal sweater extruder you have to use
it likes and normal executor service so
let's for example our our home kit and
our middleware software let us the users
list API change some such a change a
couple lines and uses visual is cuter so
let all stabbing me the task will be
cuting the coding intervals of needed
all sweat I think this is the last part
I will talk in coding part how to handle
synchronization for holding lazy example
as I mentioned with banking has a
dispatch API with helpers to dispatch
London runnable tasks into coding
example you can say we target page it
has the formation including a and the
LAN encoding a new unit food health and
the lab we call object of it so that the
method will get blocked by the cause on
objective reality program because we can
not continue and
the major that gets blocked we have the
measure that has not any chance it was
drawn on the next is patching for corny
B let's talk about the our approach for
synchronization we modified signaling in
Hollis world for support according
scheduling for fast walk is a very
simple as you have known the owner table
of log is determined by a JSON sex our
holding has a separate step so it's
natural support of it we do nothing
polish 4 bytes log so far our counting
implementation standard sort of the risk
we run our application without list of
options which did not see noticeable
perform a job the last case is a very
complex complex case inflated inflated
o'clock just look at an example
I saw you people with one to dispatch to
co-routines
coding at a and the colony be when
coding a gather you secure data and the
D in stable to is access the cause of
the weight of the let the current
occurred in a we will be put into a wait
list and the only difference over from
normal typical implementation years here
we suspect one with after cause you to
log with the engine and the whisper ng
we will help us to yield to the mislead
this is in step 3 and so we have in step
4 the method has a chance to schedule
and a dispatch in Xcode he included P
include EP curve Eve leads us the cause
of the notified and which generates
which generates uncock
events with used to notify or will
collapse coordinate at the end all
coding P in step two variants Table six
and the land will yield control in Tula
misread when Miss went back to mess with
you
that in Feb 11 the method will yield
yield to la cour de estar or more
specifically which of the crews are
viscous in kibum janta per crew team
recently shared costly expenses from
childhood
Joe said is a class implementing your
strategy in repetition for native part
of a JavaScript object in addition that
the business thread encapsulated code
inspecting revision for example it
starts to provide us a book where we can
use the user to calling full of whisper
ng to schedule next core team ok let's
look at the proposals actually we
already used our easy listed technology
for our online application is called a
cup copies for shopping cart unit
e-commerce connects and with the same
amount with the same amount of requests
you can look at the check everything and
check out with us a little comparison
between normal GDP and our hdk by using
core routine which a second Gators are
almost 10% I see with CPU City TV it's
actually a unit better case for our
intensive workloads we already use the
four by using
co-routine we actually can achieve up to
around the 30 percentage e6 if you see
being okay let's the viola
revisited with implementation we just
talked about the caliper mini vlog stuff
we already talked about a network disco
case actually we already modified gos a
staff for example you for your column
you will use some to use a lock and a
catechist block access actually we
already modified and a little chance to
schedule another enough
next available coroutine very similar to
Java primitive lock the only difference
is we tested unique adjusted period
implemented in Java level instead of GML
so far which is not a support for disk
i/o for holding scheduling also we know
the withstand not support any code unity
encoder you give a core sample or IO in
your ti code you standard supporting it
actually our e-commerce applications
that are not only rely on GPI
implementation the last part I just
listed the first thing is the Sarah with
your is G warmup
we come out to our warm-up in issue is a
well known problem in Carol word most
high CPU consumption invaded by lots of
intensive metric get compiled by the
underline compiler its problem actually
our default TDK implementation I'm outta
here comparison it kind of
self-awareness but I cannot totally
resolved our
and not totally resolved our problem
actually when this things happen we saw
much longer respond time or some lots of
time outer arrow let's this region why
we commodity mama to resolve the war
molecules occurred in our e-commerce
application context actually this is
just look at the picture this is the
basic idea for Chima map we have two
environments beta environment and the
product environments people going to
product environments we have with the
strong application in beta environment
the beta grammars has the simulated
infrastructure with productive moments
and the language subsidy list new little
beta environment with acid record all
providing data for need and the leading
the production environment and which
also will compile GD formal compile all
methods based on previously recorded
data
that's a detailed implementation in the
recording phase which we will record all
has initialized information or messes
compounded information and then for us
all along include disk as a log file and
in compiling case faced with a cell
phone
needed equal equally degree load all the
classes based on previously decoded data
and they usually initialize them and
energon last with us some use all the
methods include intrastate acapella for
compilation I think the only the only
tricky case we need to care about Heiser
we need a care about are initializing or
caste creed example the initializing the
initializing or class bar is totally
dependent on excusing our protest
otherwise the counter over path will get
it wrong value so even we need
initializing but people excusing our
photos we will get we will get wrong
wrong results how to do let so I was
looting is we just initialize the class
at appropriate time for example after
some pita mean the penis loading has
been killed
then we can submit language static and
unique equally initialized this loaded
at hub this is results when they use key
warm up for our ump application which is
incremental for discounting calculation
X depends the time web right dream hands
to the CPU in step one which is a users
keep warm up to compile the code method
in advance so you can say some CPU time
has been born and the other stable tool
actually all our viewers request coming
so that you can see the difference the
blue line the parents that share
combustion the red lines of the depends
the G Bhama
you can see
but peer comparisons of the use Scipio
up to almost 100 percentages butter 40
mom with a submit interview as a normal
level other Observatory and because most
our coded message that has get part gets
compiled by cube tier combative so it is
reduced to as to normal level so this is
resulting they're quite Authority we
actually use remember we are we actually
use give warm up for a couple hour call
ecommerce application for our online
some some other consideration for give
warm up actually we do we don't record
any dynamically generated classes for
example class is generated by JavaScript
that's a problem because the cloud me
changed between wrong we also know that
record any class is generated by for
example Java reflection or proxy because
of the instruction gets changed in next
wrong we also compile the measures
without a mess with the information with
it is because we see some unexpected at
the optimization behavior when we apply
metadata profile you actually listen
maybe something we want to figure out
the folder we also T so we also teach in
able natural elimination for similar
region so for our current implementation
standard is not compatible with the peer
comparison we also consider it in the
next line okay let's talk about the
stood apart in let's talk how we provide
engineer support for our Java developers
actually we modify a photo spot for
better profiling and the debugging for
example we increment message switching
messaging is a totally implemented in
given you use the to track color volt
and for including all method we also see
the better shape
fighting we also did some debugging
improvements debugger on the edge I will
discuss later personal is we also have
our internal tools because as a profiler
they provide usually used by our Java
developers to better monitoring
profiling and troubleshooting online job
applications which which is a web tool
totally Webber under the debugger is
also a pluribus debugging tool uses the
kind simply use the plural to divide the
application which is authority pets
which is totally providing Alec rod okay
I think the time is running out maybe I
I quickly called infinite about
antibodies on demand debugging actually
the current engine community or hot rods
that notice about which feature this is
a simple example demonstrate how to use
it when you start java application uses
as debug art little edge option and the
learn after something wrong user can use
this MV command to attach gdw agent in
full targeted vm automatically so far as
our current limitations of the support
very point set and the variable
inspection is a detailed information
this which is an instrumental feature in
our ad DK
this is a detail implementation for it
so we need a modifier in here the hot
spot to make sure blockburger pointers
post logic as a generous event give'em
start we also needed modify given PR
start to add the two capacities the
first is accessing local variable the
second thing is the root pointer that we
also need to add attach focused initi to
gtwv agent which used to initialize give
a which you to use the tool
initialize the gdw agent for example
create a socket or something like we
also extend the GMB as I have so before
for better usability that so far we are
we are also working hard on the garbage
collector of the merchants the Geo time
processing in our pickle data scenarios
they require the meaning of stopwatch
time so we need to create something to
to minimize the stop over time
especially in young jeezy we also found
the law with the error cast error
catchers were advised to be using Ali
Baba actually our modern capitalist
generation peasants and other fit valets
we just want to sink our bodies and the
house we can put Ito for our area ket
follow the second values will we need a
folder performance of immersion as I
mentioned we are service on PIPA
objective is a service-oriented and the
way we also see the heterogeneous so
either it will involve mud for many you
will involve many objects theorize and
officialized so we just want to think
about Alice and how to organize object
objective six single eyes and the D
signalized methanol for our covers okay
this is a quick summary two three
casings implementing a GDK flow firstly
the container
the second is according based on a mmm
project and the last thing is G warmup
okay I'm done cycles about artisan
okay
hello
thank you very much for was this cool
presentation I have a couple of
questions about the internal tools
you've mentioned before is the profile
or first of all are there any plans to
make them public
yeah we have some you know plan but
actually we are very happy to even we
kind of contribute a Bachelor of
indicate something our internal deep
disgust yeah okay thank you very much
some question about binding tenant to
the Java threads okay you talk later
that there is which in between 1002
economy you're accessing tulips
yeah why you have this problem is it's
worth is already binded to 110
yeah I mean so you start all threads
working to work on particularly talent
yes so this rate works on till up and
allocate ordinary object related I
suppose over related to only to this
talent yes why you have problem on the
slight dimensions that you it maybe
Philippines which me maybe share it
between talent okay okay
in our context away just the makers
integration extended technology with
average Tomcat actually up Tomcat has a
common thread pool they use laser
concert approaches so that different of
web application right so when for
example when we deploy to web
application into the same Tomica
container and third a maybe at this time
they saw the web very clever originally
and then in the next time maybe they
need a so to the Nexus next by baptism
for example eventually you reusing
stress yes yes yeah okay
what second question do you change also
change Linux Court uh no because it
needs to go yeah with a unit with the
user list Liberty Google API for maps
the
mitchel Musso other business ago / stuff
okay last question about the warmup
you say you don't use method data what
do you mean providing data we don't use
any providing data metadata is a concept
a new criminal you know how kind of
order then I didn't got what you mean
you drop you you say okay yeah yeah yeah
yes yes right with us you're not without
a recorded message on in a log file and
then with for example with dozen or so
messages are very hot in you know you
know you know jump in on online
production environments which are submit
the mess a tulip 442 compiler but we
allow the onion for finding information
oh so you not reuse profile information
yeah you only collect which means that
are hot and you yeah you compile it yeah
okay yes thanks okay I will stay here
