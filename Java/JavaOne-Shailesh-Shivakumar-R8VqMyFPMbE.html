Oracle technology Network we're here at
javaone India interviewing members of
the java community so I've got jellies
shavack Kumar you're with em Phasis
correct is going to you okay so tell me
a little bit about the sessions that
you're doing right so in this Java 1 i'm
presenting two sessions today I'm
doesn't think session about java web
pages how it's going to help you can
speed up and make it performance blazing
fast so different tools and techniques
what I have used firsthand in my
projects so performance being a key
aspect so it has to be optimized in all
the cases so I'm going to talk about
that and tomorrow I'm going to talk
about small the failures and our
projects what we noticed the causes how
we can actually tackle the leading
indicators the failure so things like
that so basically it's a best practice
and how what can be adopted into two
phases of a project like second ok so
give me one or two examples of things
that make Java projects fail yeah so I
think one thing to have consistently
seen is the enterprise integrations so
almost always other projects what we
have worked upon so they have
ventilations component to it so and if
the individuals are not done
appropriately for example in terms of
performance or in terms of the
client-side components so it is going to
post challenge like it not scale up or
when there is a peak load then it will
just stop functioning Lord can paint on
the server so the yeah so enterprise
integration season of the key components
which has to be keenly looked upon and
it has to be addressed in the very early
stages so there is one theory and coming
to the project management aspect which
is common to all the IT projects not
just for java yeah I was just gonna
stick it's probably true for any project
it doesn't matter the technology correct
yeah so yeah so in that's what my
session is actually divided into two
categories one is a specific for java
and technological aspect and attorneys
project management which can be applied
to various technologies also so in the
project management wat neocons
what we have repeatedly seen is the
requirements management so in terms of
the freezing of the scope to handle the
changes and then to document the
business rules and things like that so
developments management is a very key
aspect right in to talk about it's your
creep right everybody I want this and
this and this so you're like wait a
minute no you have to be able to say way
together right yeah exactly well great
so tell me a little bit about the java
community and emphasises relationship to
it right so within enforces we have
architecture community so basically we
have clothes suit of architects
enterprise architects including myself
so we are basically exchange ideas again
so for example if there are between
architects we have visibility of about
20 to 25 projects right so and we can
actually try to do the patterns like the
one which have to read myself so and we
will publish the blocks and white papers
myself have written about four to five
blocks and they put six white papers on
this one so and we repeatedly exchange
the best practices so and that will be
used by all the developers within
infosys to let's say when they start
development or when they come across
some complex issues that they will use
these documents at a friends or a
prospectus guide so right so that will
actually help them to into the
particularly and also use the best
practices on the compound so that is
this is an internal java community we
have so oh nice so community is internal
in the Infosys you're helping each other
out but I took a look good well I'm glad
you dropped by and good luck on your
sessions I'm looking forward to hearing
work thank you thanks mrs. Torre wilt
