another night hiking a mule employee at
from Oracle technology Network and my
guess right now is Alexei Lopez Alexei
hi hi mom so Alex see you are doing a
lot of things with user groups so where
are you from for a first outer I'm from
Colombia I live in a car in a city which
is called Karli column in Colombia and
yeah I run the general user group in my
city we're a bunch of Java elope with
developers and we meet monthly or
sometimes every two months to talk about
Java to listen to some presentations and
yeah you're not to networking they're
not working so tell us so why should
people join yes java user group having
or be even involved as a leader right
yeah well it opens a lot of
opportunities to you know when you join
to these are usergroups you start
meeting people learning from their
experience and at some point you start
as well as sharing your experiences and
that will give you like some kind of
status and it will be recognized as
someone inside the community who really
knows about Java that lady opportunities
it started starts to come start to come
you know you start to change enjoy
between jobs in the ni I decided to to
quit my job and became an independent
and it's all about you know networking
and learning things and be you know and
well prepared and knowing all about Java
yeah it gives you something else so do
so they are also presentation so you
know
also from your peers like what's working
what other companies are doing and yeah
yeah luckily at some point you start
giving the presentations and idea it
will give you some presentation skills
so you can talk in front of a lot of
people and you know answering their
questions and yeah it's really it's
really a good idea you know to join the
jogs and start start this journey I know
and you also have a presentation oh no
you were involved with the jug forums on
Sunday right so what how did that go
yeah well on sunday at jawan we have the
community sunday which is called away
you know we we are we do presentations
about Java user groups and the community
so I have this presentation about how to
improve increasing interaction I'm
between jobs in groups and it was more
like a discussion so we have leaders
from from Europe learn leaders from
Americans of America it was a great
discussion you know we learn from
experiences from the jugglers from
Europe because you know in Europe you
have a lot of Java user groups and it's
easy for them to move with between
countries and they can access speakers
from another country to come because
it's really easy to move it in Europe
but in South America we didn't have that
so it was great to hear about that and
we actually came to some conclusions
we're starting to do some online
presentations at least and that's
something we are already doing with
hotel spaniolit espanyol is a community
of spanish-speaking generation groups so
we in we are increasing our
collaboration so we give presentations
we we do some labs and that's a good way
to have you know international speakers
coming to your Java group meetings at
least online you know
right and you also have a presentation
at javaone yeah yeah we did the
worldwide collaboration yep yeah it was
really was a great discussion yeah do
you have another session no that's what
that was my only one good yeah and you
just have to you can just experienced
the conference right yeah how is that
going it's being rate um actually I was
really looking forward to hear about
what's gonna happen with java ee act
right yeah because i'm i'm involved with
that I work and that's that's what I
work with so it's good to hear that
things are moving we hope for the best
yeah so you already take the took the
survey as well I did yes sir I did the
survey and I shared on my Twitter
account it's really important for all
