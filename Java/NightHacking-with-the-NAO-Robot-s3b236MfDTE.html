robotics to do a night hacking interview
with a Kim and Dmitri and elder Barnes
creator of the NAO robot so we have one
of the now robots sitting in front of us
and we're going to talk a little bit
more about you know what these robots
can do so first of all Kim can you
introduce yourself and what you do here
sure I'm et Edinburgh for now to the
program we are providing for those two
you'll get a burst of the can bring look
around here to life cool very nice so um
let's let's start out with tell us tell
us a little bit more about kind of what
you can do with these robots well
basically these roads are vulnerable a
humanoid robot what you get a power we
will need to assign these robots you've
got 50 cameras either a Tarleton posture
we've got five degrees of freedom hold
on might help if repair on yeah like
okay so you have a 25 degrees of freedom
and will provide you here is a graphical
programming interface Kia and Hyundai
SDK so you can put on those robots with
a Python or sipping spoons or dot net or
Java very nice but then you mentioned
about getting this robot so how would
you how would somebody actually get one
of the robust so but what everyone is
doing is that they're sponsoring
individual developers want to to join us
and so we are
where we provide you the robot with a
with a software with other resources
forum project tips theories on the on
the forum where you can collaborate with
other developers support for my staff
Auroran T on the robot so provide
everything to individual developers so
that they can create applications and
that's that's what we are we are
expecting in exchange very nice very
nice alright so let's let's dig into
some of the technical details of the the
now robot god bless you too Jimmy J so
it looks pretty cool yeah but kind of
what's the hardware yeah so the very
nice thing about this road is you've got
tons and tons of different sensors so
you've got some bumpers over there
you've got some Sun all over here you've
got two cameras you got four microphones
and you've got tactics in sort of a hair
and on the end and also what is really
nice is that you've got you can really
know exactly at any time where are the
motors doing whatever what are their
position and so on you've got an
inertial sensor also and you've got food
contacts and sources of heat so it what
lots and lots of way to interact with
the robot with lots of different sensors
and of course to express ourselves or we
can move obviously and there are two big
loudspeakers
so he can play music and dog and so on
okay so he'll actually it looks like
he's designed to actually walk yeah of
course so nice a nice nap right now but
yeah we can begin we can wake him up a
little bit later if you want but yeah
for the first part it's better if you
stay still a little bit and yeah of
course you can work and play football
and if you go look for it on youtube you
can simply lots of crazy stuff like a
fling falling down and going back in so
that's very cool how much of the of the
software for like motion control or
walking here things is built-in versus
you have to program oh yeah you can
without lots of very high level stuff so
what you have here is that you've got
lots and lots of smaller controls
obviously directly in the other metros
and then everything is calling it here
in the insert also with a special card
and that was a USB connection from the
head to the to the toxo and so we give
it so you can yeah and in the head there
is a soft opening called no key and so
now he's just expressing the
functionality of the rowboats over the
PA so again if you want to you can
really control the motors one by one but
you also have very high level API that
just saying ok wake up woke go to this
place or something like that ok so you
can either feel very very well double it
guys what is higher level yeah I think
you ever come on top of very advanced
algorithm yet like you can just put the
orbit app and say ok so just look over
there and don't keep your foot on the
ground and it will solve all these
programs and just move the
nobody just to achieve this mission and
basically just start to set just look
here and so we will do it for you
alright cool so yeah it was very high
was very high and very low level so you
mentioned the nail key there what's that
retina yeah so the Nokia is written in
C++ and so you can think of it as own
with kind of a website is raining on the
robot all the time and so what you can
do is that you can connect to now key
from your desktop ok so for instance
we've got this very nice tool called
coil off and you can just drag and grab
some boxes and connect the boxes
together and you can really in just a
few seconds you can do something really
simple like whenever I see someone just
wave it just takes two boxes to do that
so it's really nice and of course if you
want to write more hardcore program we
can just write them directly on the
desktop like any other application like
for instance what we did once is that
you could run a program on your desktop
at just remote control zone between a
connect of a majority or whatever oh so
you mentioned you can do java appears to
run now what else were they look like
yeah so basically all the functionality
of their vote is pitted across something
we called modules so you've got the
module called motion for crews are
working and and so on you've got the
module called text to speech and
basically what you can do in Java yeah
and each module has a set of methods so
that's how they appear walk and
basically in Java you just do something
like okay creates me a proxy to the
aisle Texas which module and not just
call the method sound that and so if you
want those are good to say hello are
just two line of Java so with very
simple
cool so so you want to see some demos
yeah yeah yeah looks let's see the robot
in action I'll run for her focus on the
stream if you have any questions
technical questions for Dimitri about
how the network's then let us know and
we'll we'll ask him I'm not sure you can
hear it now what we're going to do is we
going to put it out there just make sure
that became your ways
okay and you can also you can Mike the
robot put the microphone gear to the
speaker do you want to set up exit exit
what do you want me to do do you want me
to do that you're here you loony I will
speak slowly so you can understand me
welcome to the legend of now so what you
can see here what i'm doing is i'm using
the sensors navigate into the menu but
whether the robot is actually running
now is vocal mouths life it's kind of
the robots autonomous life when you can
do some random movement so when you want
to you see that's a that's what is doing
so it's just trying to catch your
attention and depending on how excited
the robot is in the country you are it
can move more less so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to address him
so the sensor is on top that you're
using are those um light or touch or all
rights kept by Steve sensor also this
yeah capacitive touch yeah okay so for
some kind of reason they're about now is
a not responsive I think it's been a
it's been pretty hot so what we can do
is from podia and cool down cool down a
bit so you can see each other all switch
you off there's a button on his chest
yes so what about I think you mentioned
that you can get data back from the
sensors like the good position of the
arms and the legs and things but what
other inputs are there on the now sure
oh yeah so so you've got some time way
of getting owns same source information
so which is called I'm advice with just
a big black ball with all the values
there and of course you have also
appears to just have a cold bath to get
audio samples or directly getting the
images from the cameras so okay so there
is two cameras and those are just kids
so the canals of here in a second
because the cameras yeah what was it one
I love power head yeah so the first one
is here and the other one is there I can
just look at his foot so you can switch
back from the top competitors button
camera got it so whichever way the heads
facing as the camera direction yeah and
what about the audio and the microphone
is that the one the pawls above the yeah
you can seem when here ends our two more
on the silent ones back so I can
known as a son is coming from and what
you just heard is a key signature of
Zelda Beaudry's booting which is called
organic nook and yeah cool are there any
other inputs on the rest of the body
like what are these holes here yeah so
this is also so now so you can get
towards a surah saying in CA awesome
obstacles yeah and again for instance
you can just ask for work for us all
data or you can just use any page it
says okay just walk in when there is a
lipstick arista so yeah cool and how
many how many murders are there on a on
the robot I so something like 25 25 so
it looks like this quite like the that
the finger is probably are quite and
then basically just once we can just
open them to close at home but you can
look stove in one command for grabbing
yeah presentation he's gonna talk a bit
about his house I had a lot to say
hello my name is now robots imagine to
manufacture delay only vote on robotics
I answer your question and even place so
you can balance on one foot well I guess
that's a requirement for walking yeah
yes counting every articulation in my
body I have 25 degrees of freedom the
Sun ours located in my core so allow me
to detect obstacles that I might
encounter my two cameras give me an
enlarged field of vision thanks to them
I can look right in front of me or at my
feet you know to avoid walking where I
should not the four microphones around
my head allow me to detect the origin of
sounds nearby oh well I think about it
there are four force-sensitive resistors
under each of my feet combined with my
inertial sensor they help me keep my
balance I can use some LEDs to express
various emotions and interact with you
and you on the other hand and use my
actual sensors on the head for example
it pass me some information well I guess
that's enough for the moment thank you
for listening to me we're done Deborah
Pfeiffer alright so that that's like a
pre programmed sequence for introducing
himself so exactly that's that's an
application to that has been a cool
presentation and as does mean the tunnel
did on the robot so yes well whatever
sort of applications for you guys have
which you've developed or which other
people third-party folks at the open
houses that we have lots of different
applications so eat it ranges from from
educational games fun applications or we
even have applications for 46 children
that we had we are developing and were
internally and we have some other
developers external developers working
on so cool yeah no it's very cool this
is something you'd see in like a sci-fi
movie it is it is very honey that's like
working on this this stuff for your day
job oh it's great it's great we're
actually recruiting so if anybody wants
to add to join us and join the robotics
revolution now is the time because we
are we're recruiting engineers and an
expert robotics expert for working with
us very nice do they need to work here
in France or do you have other location
I guess mainly tier in France we have
other offices in Asia in Chiang Kai
and I in Boston many but we mostly
development happens here exactly most of
the development here maybe maybe for
someone who's really good you might
consider a long distance who knows thing
is that if you want to know more about
it you can go and chip the world 34 and
you will see all those are so let me
quickly show folks a couple so I I
popped up a couple websites earlier
which folks might be interested to check
out I'll show them on the stream here
good to rest go to rest
alright so the first one was shape the
world okay here we go alright so shape
the world fr I guess what's this I tell
us a lot about it so that's a
recruitment recruitment campaign site so
if you want information about the roles
available at Aldebaran robotics that's
where you're going to find all the roles
it's been done in English you'll find a
nice little video that we've done 22 to
show what we think the robotics would be
about and you find more about the
company or values the team so all
information are there cool and also the
other bar in robotics website is
probably a good place it's a very good
place to start with there you will find
all the information about the route
there yes the highlight of the of the
month we are you be sharing all the
information about the company on the
other band hyphen robotics calm and if
you are interested in two or now the
Ripper program then the website is a
developer dot autobahn hyphen robotics
come out of RN actually we can just it's
this site just developer in front of it
right yes yeah so I have to actually you
know how to type
all right well here developer okay so
people can check out both those sites to
find exact summation about the narrow
button google so let's let's check and
see if we've any question or focus on
stream okay so one of the questions from
Mona developer is is there specific
operating system for now something like
our rusts Ross well as so you've got to
us British I'll talk to Ma not yet side
as you've got a host bridge and so you
can just use an Okie as a loss not so
it's not done by the libraries didn't
bite someone from the reverse community
but we are considering making it a bit
easier to just plug worse with gnocchi
but it's quite easy basically because
Loki is wrapped in Python for instance
and was also you can if you just really
need some very basic stuff you can do it
in 20 lines of Python or something like
that so the sungari out cool all right
that's a good question um so anything
else you guys want to mention about the
technology or can we maybe get a tour
yeah we can can get a tour of the round
so you wanna you want to run around well
how about we chat for a bit and then you
can set up where we can do is that
before we do the tour we can show you
our Livermore presentation that's up to
you yes yeah yeah yeah it's fine
removing the the the right person so
alright so you're going to go back to
work Dmitri hey yeah boo me all right
all right come up here in front of
cameras folks go see us all right so
thanks thanks very much yeah for telling
us about the technology behind now yeah
and yeah it's very good to have you on
night hiking yeah i'm going to give you
something before you leave because
you're your real developer you'll
appreciate this is a limited-edition
night hacking sticker great so there's
only a few of these that exist and you
can see my stash is getting very low
okay so you can tell folks that you were
okay on night hacking calm appreciates
all right thanks eh all right and in
just a minute we're gonna we're going to
yeah looks like hey policy so what's
your what's your name Amen Thurman yeah
good to meet you and what do you what do
you do I'm different big implication I
know so i can thank you okay okay with
and i can show you some development
under the elderly and now
for the moment we developing an
application on Android and is connecting
to know all that we don't have a real a
Java API it's a simple peaceful memory
and through suzana by the regime GNA
okay so go through Jane I for this tape
yeah okay hello me this week here
microphone that's why it's better better
yeah so what can I show you okay it's an
example just a moment we try to to
interact with Android and now okay so we
have we have the box a box is but is the
choice box the goal of this box it's a
we enter one list and the robot can can
understand what is the word pronounced
by the human okay okay and we try to
display it on the on Jetta bed so I a
true up okay okay
oh yeah true instead okay good
look I try to connect to the robot okay
up I had to change the natural okay
Oh keigwin
oh so the application android
application is written in java and we
try when the when robot wait for when
spoons can try something up I a true
connect to the rover ok
I google ok it's good we can see as a
usually the choice books it's only at
the robot so we we want to develop
another honor than Chavez because
sometimes the human is a doesn't count
out the the robot so we had to to see
the choice for example if I make this oh
I had to lunch up which is a very okay
you can see so you can see the volume
the energy we are mild the crushed and
and on the way possible yes okay and
it's an example it's an example so most
important is it is application it's to
understand the tablet is connecting to
the robot now key provide register bread
distributed architecture so we can
develop module on the tablet and the
robot can encourage the tablet and the
tablet can send the information to the
20 word okay so it's not it's actually
interacting with a rubber over Wi-Fi yes
Wi-Fi or internet is a IP tcp IP
communication acha so for Solomon to the
interface is writing in cypress trees
but we want to develop what is our
system only Angela okay so have a pure
Java API so you can use access it so
right now it's c++ you did you kind of
remote like Jay and I or access a C++
API is from Java
so right right now how is the program
but it's a program written so it talks
to C++ from the Java yes mmm I do to
this day it's okay don't worry about so
what are those sort of applications do
you think folks might develop using a
tablet what ideas do you have for
applications also to controls are
relative to work two to develop two
games or missing lysis so it's the only
new example at after that we have to
develop what we want and as I seen we
don't have a precise idea but we just
want to test to the communication and
because follow the the robot can't
connect with a met only the tablet can
connect to the robot so we are to put
twice to I to simulate event so you do
some sort of like a polling power Vance
back that are Kira yes so are awesome
now kick sistema also no key system is a
is prepared to for the next version with
a real event so we have listener system
we have something like this and after
that we can create our class java class
to develop real event management system
ho ok all right well thanks a lot for
for showing tablet integration with now
you want to that's fine oh gee turkey I
trust your any other demos or stuff you
wanna share you want to see you
it's up to you if you have something you
want you Oh Alyssa honor why I don't
have a loser although it's only an
example for I develop eat a cookie this
is that leading edge stuff but I know we
can we can trust me to page we can trust
me teammate sound and on the server what
is asking ok can you get access to the
the cameras yes yes we can but no we do
is the real or just to an image so if
you want to simulate the video we can
send the image by image at with the test
1010 image per second half ended after
we can try we can develop to control now
buy a tablet to see what he sees and the
world can turn an ad and what you what
we want cool all right so these are the
folks online who are watching so I asked
to have any questions for you before we
start the tour I can I kemas going to
show us around to walk around look at
some of the stuff alright cool and you
you through some demonstration of who we
did the presentation presentation yeah
and that's all that's it you want to try
something else oh yes yeah i can i can
show you a real good demo
now has been connected
so it's iffy if he's making any noise we
need to hear you should put the
microphone next to his rookie I am true
Oh looky
now
all right I just watch my shoes and
guess what
I don't appreciate this one yes budget
freeze it will study so that the neutral
position him sitting with his arms on
his hand unselect to kind of see safe a
safe seat opposition point yes there are
three positions tend seat and two under
the crotch remain on Squatch but with a
bit of a z-table s where so we have to
wait started the different step when you
start the first robot starter exist we
can wait
okay so
I think IRA broadcasting might have died
okay good
nope guess but it's a game to reef in
game it's just a matter of training
welcome to get the sport game try to
guess the sport
or search for sure answer good good okay
what's your guess good tennis Liz go
back I know maybe do you want another
try yes guess which sport it is
well give me your answer these tennis so
good at that game no ok so we can see
the most fun part of now it's a you
mallu it from humana chip and this game
you should state the bhutan share of the
human way we can imitate human and it's
a very attractive we want to talk to
museum and we want to play it's not a
robot is the diamond I think guess what
is a really good example for application
with your binary yeah well that's very
cool that's why I like this game yes so
it's more interactive than the
presentation you want to know it's more
in fact oh yes oh yeah and oh you will
just foolin around
follow me
I
which is a condition
there's a signal
right
notice i gave no
the truth
yes what
all right howsa cool demo Ricky good I
can try to restart we are now so it it
on the internet for us 15 minutes ago I
didn't notice it I think I think the
free Wi-Fi here probably has like a
one-hour time limit so it probably was
one hour since so we log back in we're
back online it's all recorded so we
didn't lose any video footage and the
focus on the online stream can see us
again ok thank you alright so thank you
very much sink you thank you and maybe I
wish to let's do this tour ok Rebecca so
you mind making yourself yes and what
we'll do is we'll we'll take the camera
gently and hannah and laptop and then
walk around and show some of the site
let's see if this can be
okay so we're going to do the tour ok so
for this series I he took your bubble
tea say they are usually my second
camera shows here location aryana bottom
velocity can be hockey is convicted on
it ok also me yeah yeah alright so you
can you hold this for just a second so
before we start the tour I want to make
sure we don't run a battery in the
middle so we will
swap batteries on camera
you
yep videos back and we got a fresh
battery
alright fine without me hold the laptop
yeah I did yeah you you can hear me Moo
fine yep coming through fine okay
excellent what you will see here is the
local the rng so that's where you are or
engineer or software engineers are
creating the OS and and part of it is
the SDK so you guys are parts of robots
around the area yes we have a lot of a
lot of robot so I guess you're
developing robots you need plenty of
models you can test it exactly so all
the testing is being done here cool good
yeah all right sorry so these guys down
here so those guys are what we call jazz
they have made by a company called ghost
I that other band robotics but it's a
French company and they are specialized
in telepresence robots those ones are
switched on now but it's a it's a one of
our customers care about robotics for
those guys can walk around exactly alike
exactly they can go around and they can
thicken the exactly help you to remote
remote little conversating with someone
so what you can see over here is these
are marketing and marketing team all
right everybody everybody else have a
marketing department exactly and then
kinda nice display of different nails
and the entrance here yes what I'm going
to do is I'm going to let you hear you
just for a second yeah
right
so let's go cool so where you can see
here is a new studio at the application
studio team they are working on the
internal applications developed by
Aldebaran so here you've got the main
creative people doing so they do
different poses for the robot exactly
the animation is the position of the
robots all of that is done the show and
events if you see a lot of robots
dancing at an event of the tenses have
been done by the vitals guys so it's
basically the main the main team good go
the rest of their is probably it's
mostly administration ok yeah we don't
care about that you want sicko robots
you won't see the cool parts you've seen
the cool parts most of it has been done
has been done here Oh excellent and I I
heard you guys actually manufacture the
robots here as well yes unfortunately is
not an area where you we can walk to
it's a it's an area where we are only a
limited people have access to ok
I want to see a last application or
share something sure yes did some nice
go back okay and deal with the robot we
have some guests here I'm shading on the
latest now robot so you can tell at wcl
man yes it's a Batman exactly it's a
wonderful employee who won the contest
it was not contest and it was no
artistic contest and he came up with
this limited edition series of now
dressed up as Batman well let's get a
shot of the the now bat
very cool you put the wire over the
chair yeah thanks
follow me here for
what do you want me to do to affect
their community your visit sure start
wars story start wars story for all this
dog was fun out there just hours till
later
ok let's see is living in dark times
again the dark forces are back but
tonight is coming to save the galaxy
accompanied by his faithful friends now
due to eat you so now I can actually act
like a robot me what slavery yeah
finally my anime was defeated and he's
settled again
here we go well done though cool I hope
you liked it yeah sit sit back down for
a sec all right so thanks a lot for
thanks thanks to a Kim for showing us
around my pleasure thank you for coming
on Yura all right so just to remind
folks again how would they find out more
about the now or get involved in
developing applications for who should
they so I look like a honestly before
one of the ways if you go online you go
to delaford Aldebaran hyphen robotics
calm and you will find more information
about the no developer program it's for
individual developers who want to create
applications and that's that's one way
of getting involved if you want to
journal they run as i said before shape
the world at a far and we are recruiting
right now and that's or that's where
you're going to find all the roles
available for father brown and just want
to add to our to rush of people out
there we have more than 25 different
nationalities here english is a is one
of the working language so i can be
afraid of coming down to paris and
having to learn french to know who wants
to move to Paris especially what you
know exactly the shape the world com hey
all right thanks a lot achim thanks
those are you watching the stream thanks
very much we're going to have another
interview this evening we're going to
look at some cool printers and robots
and Brussels nice so I should be
exciting so tune in later this evening
for another night hacking stream and go
to night hacking calm for more info
alright thank you thank you
