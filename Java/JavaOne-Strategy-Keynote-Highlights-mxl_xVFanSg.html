Java 1 2014 this is the 19th Java one
and i believe the longest-running
developer conference this is the best
job one year ever we have awesome
content lined up and huge things coming
this is the first major release of Java
which has gone from sort of inception to
delivery completely under Oracle
stewardship today we're announcing with
eight dot one which I believe the bits
went live earlier this morning early
access to a release which includes
support for arm cortex m3 and m4
microcontrollers you should be able to
write code and have it run on a device
whether it's a small device a big device
whether it's a toaster whether it's a
microwave it shouldn't matter it should
be a device and you guys should be able
to program to it so Oracle is proud to
be supporting this initiative and
believe it has great potential to
accelerate device adoption across IOT
Java EE is playing a tremendous role in
providing the Java platform from end to
end in fact one of the recent statistics
I saw was that that eighty percent of
mobile applications are being built with
Java in them somewhere so an incredible
incredible success of the overall Java
platform glad to announce by the way
that this past week we released java the
java ee 7 which serves as the reference
implementation for java ee 7 glassfish
for dot one server in this release
there's over a thousand improvements and
bug fixes and to show you how we're
working across the entire platform group
this is also the first release of
glassfish that supports and certifies
out of the box java SE 8 and i hope that
in two years standing here i'll be able
to tell you that we have just released
java ee 8 and glassfish 5 open source as
the basis for the reference
implementation so that's that is what
our goal is that's what we're targeting
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
