alright so welcomes the night hacking
tour we have with this terrance bar and
you are a embedded guru and that's right
device guru so what are what are sort of
what's your official title is oracle um
well so you know i've i've been in
venture listen for a while we're
actually on the same team so you know
senior technologist and also product
manager for Oracle's small embedded java
products okay oh so but mostly studying
on the same track of small cool devices
exactly yeah i come from the embedded
space way back when that's where i
started my career is in better developer
and it feels good to be back in embedded
with java i think a lot of the timing is
right there's a lot of you know
confluence of a couple of things
occurring in the industry that makes
embedded java be you know in the center
of things and there's been a lot of
activity lately that i can talk about
that people might not be aware of so yes
cool stuff we also have some toys the
product that we just released a couple
weeks ago i have some not yet released
software that's running on it so there
will be some to hacking involved if ever
so we got we got real we got real
experimental prototype be yes the demo
if the demo gods are willing it'll
actually work alright very cool so what
do you what do you want start today what
do you want to do first well i thought
i'd give people a little bit of a
background of what's happening in the
embedded javis I don't know if everybody
has been following you know the
introductions or the the announcements
rather and the TVD around java one
article has had a big sort of coming out
a couple weeks ago at javaone around
embedded java and the java vision and
just wanted to give people maybe a brief
intro into that and then we can take it
from there look at the devices do the
demo and just you know keep it
interactive cool all right so for folks
who are watching night hacking for the
first time the format here is
it's a live interview so we have being
broadcast on ustream right now you can
go to night hiking calm and there's a
social stream where you can type in
comments and we're watching the comments
here so we'll be responding to folks who
you are watching live as well and all
you do is tweet with pound night hacking
or use the social stream that it will
show up here on our on our screen so
let's switch to your desktop so they can
see the presentation the internet of
things right I guess it you know it's a
buzz word these days but I just wanted
to give us a nice this a nice catch for
is is that going to be the Java one
silicon next year maybe I will see it
might yeah so I just wanted to give
people a little bit of background as i
said on why embedded java is becoming so
so interesting and so this is part of a
bigger presentation that i did at
javaone going into some of the technical
technical details of this product that
we released but i just like to sort of
touch on the introduction here which i
call you know the third IT revolution
tackling this opportunity and if you
look at what's happening in the embedded
space right now right there's this
confluence of multiple factors so
there's the technology that's advancing
so you know ever smaller a cheaper more
performant hardware everything's
starting to be connected whether it's
wireless or wired or permanent or
intermittent but connectivity is
basically a checkmark item at this point
the there is also the shift from you
know used to be that people valued
hardware a lot and you know building
hardware and we sort of point products
and now it's being increasingly clean
you can see that in the mobile space as
well that a lot of the value is shifting
to the software the connectivity the
services that are being provided right
and then finally on this movement in the
industry you know cost time to markets
flexibility scalability is always
becoming more and more important right
and so it's not good
to build point solutions anymore like we
did in the past where we had you know 24
months to build whole stack from device
and operating system and application and
connectivity and middle and back in you
just don't have the time anymore right
so we have to move away build horizontal
platforms where we can easily you know
rev and incrementally improve products
bring them to market quick sets I think
if I'm getting it right then just for
java developers you know all that stuff
before or not with images you're wasting
your time but now now is the time to get
into abetted pretty much we believe so
we believe that java is really the
technology that's best positioned to to
play a major role in this shift going
forward and and why you know java
developers today in the past it used to
be that if you wanted to do invented
java development you would have your
exactly eyes Parker hardcore hacker
specialized tools specialized os's you
know cross compilation you know yada
yada yada and and one of one of the
major parts of this vision of why job is
so important is because it allows nine
million Java developers to become
embedded developers right so the same
the same dramatic acceleration and
services and software that you saw on
the mobile space right enabling all
these people to write mobile
applications we see the same thing is
going to happen in the emitted space
yeah so instead of spending all your
time hacking hardware and doing custom
solutions now you can just take your
Java skills yep start porting
applications to embedded devices and
building focusing on software which is
where you ready not you know ninety
percent of the work is done for you you
do the other ten percent that where your
value actually lies I'm glad I'm glad
you paid all the penalty before and you
know helped us get here I mean there's
no hundreds and thousands of of
engineering years put into the Java
platform right yeah yeah well so um you
know and this is something it's kind of
obvious but if you think about it it's
actually we're in this really
interesting spot in time right now where
you know what I call this third IT
revolution if you look back at sort of
the net mainframes and the sixties right
you had this many people worked on one
mainframe right so the people the device
ratio was end to one and they they
obviously that were very few of those
and the data volume was kind of limited
and then we went into the 70s 80s 90s
you know mobile phones work stations pcs
where we had this internet of people
right the one-to-one relationship maybe
you know now it's more like you know one
two three or something like because you
have to see to get any conference I
think the ratios for Wi-Fi now this is
about three devices right perfect that
sounds about you notice there's a
finite number of devices that any person
could use so um I think I've broken a
lot but okay maybe it's ten in your case
of 20 um but but that's what I call some
of the Internet of people write in and
of course you know the number of devices
has been increasing the data that get
screwed over because these devices
communicate within you know between each
other so we've seen a good ramp up in
the unit volume and the data volume but
but really we're moving now is this
third wave where when the Internet of
Things so we have smart connected
devices where there's a 12 m
relationship right to give one person
has you know 50 or 100 different devices
around them doing you know in the car
and in your you know your light bulb in
the toaster and you know it sounds funny
but once you start putting all these
pieces together it actually makes a lot
of sense you want to enable your
environment to become more intelligent
to interact with it right to analyze the
data that comes from it to affect what's
happening in the environment create
smarter business processes make
processes more efficient right conserve
energy all these things right and and so
um analysts you know floor on these
bizarre numbers you know 10 billion
devices 50 billion devices it doesn't
matter um the fact is that the
these smart devices will grow
exponentially of the cat last next
couple years because we haven't really I
mean we're really at the beginning of
this this wave all right so if I if I
was going to make a parallel this would
be like the equivalent of early on one
like the iPhone first came out and like
smartphones we're just ramping up you
look at now there's so many jobs and
smartphones on the markets exploded this
would be like the start of the iphone
for embedded pretty much right and
you're talking a factor of a hundred in
terms of volume in an in fact analysts
predict that the number of these devices
will outnumber PCs and smartphones
combined by a wide margin and they will
also drive the majority of the Internet
traffic in the future which brings us to
the next slide this is actually not only
an opportunity but it's a huge set of
new problems right because how do you
manage all this how do you manage
billions of devices securely how do you
manage the traffic how do you manage the
software that runs on those right it's a
whole a whole set of issues that the
industry is just starting to grapple
with so things like how do you connect
wirelessly for example intermittent
connection how do you integrate the data
to a back-end how do you make the
services reliable right and and have the
right performance at the same time how
do you make sure that you're connected
your your cost is is being maintained
that you can recycle as i said before
things that have built before that have
been built for so that you you only
invest in the actual value you can
produce on top and then from a
development perspective right you as a
developer you want to be able to rapidly
create software that drives value for
your business right so developer
productivity is really important
standard support is really important my
time to market um and and and in the
past people have tried to do this right
this is nothing new you've done this in
the past with native solutions
those are not scalable right there
they're very expensive there they take a
long time to build it's hard to program
these solutions and really if you look
at the things that you need in such an
environment right it's it's all these
things you need the ability to execute
applications robust and secure you need
the ability these things will be on the
network for many many years so you have
to be able to manage them you have to be
able to upgrade the software while
they're in the field but upgrade the
software without affecting the integrity
of the device right you can't afford to
push down some native code and reboot
the device and you've introduced a
security issue right that's just just
the logo you want to be able to separate
your hard wall from the software right
because you don't want to eat over time
you will deliver new pieces of hardware
into the field that you know improve the
way you do things you don't want to have
to recreate the software stack every
time you change the hardware right so
for all these reasons you know Java
embedded and especially small job for
these internet of things where you
really limited in terms of power and
resources java just makes a lot of sense
from all these perspectives right cool
um all right sir sold us java they'll
see some toys yep let's see some toys um
and in fact you know if we just I just
like to skip to this to this released it
up to the slide orgasm stream agree with
Nick toys yep toys so we did to product
releases at javaone um just to put this
in perspective so the first one is this
product that will talk about today is
this Java me embedded 302 and that's a
java runtime for really
resource-constrained devices so we're
talking like mike recruit rollers we're
talking you know couple kilobytes you
know two three hundred kilobytes of RAM
a megabyte of ROM so really small
something where you couldn't really run
Java standard Java very well in the past
and then we also release this other
product
javab edit suite which is more of a
middleware stack which integrates java
SE embedded glassfish in java DB on to
more powerful devices that you can use
for example as middle tears
concentrators gateways for example right
and that would connect it to the back
end so let's just skip forward to the
demo that I want to show there's a bunch
of stuff here so this is the demo we
want to look at so a typical is the
typical use case for these types of
devices is that um you know that they're
always on door connected they're sitting
somewhere in the field they are
connected to a network wirelessly or
through a wire they are connected to
various sensors and other peripherals um
they acquire data from those peripherals
they process the data locally to make
you know to turn information in to do
the data that they get from the sensors
to information to make it more valuable
to be able to make some local decisions
they might filter the data to reduce the
bandwidth requirements and then they
send it off to a back-end right the
backend server then does some business
analysis some management on the data and
might push data back down to the device
and the device then changes the way it
interacts with its environment right so
you can you have this whole intend
connectivity and you can incrementally
improve the value of your solution yeah
and that was it wasn't always the case
you had connectivity and small devices
like that that's one of the big changes
here right that's one of the big changes
so many of these devices for example we
we had a partner centurion on stage of
job one and they are actually shipping
going to ship and announce they will be
shipping a product based on this java me
embedded runtime and this product that
they actually have these they're
fascinating really small modules which
are complete java runtime they have an
ARM processor on it they have a 3g
wireless modem
it the battery operated on and they're
just tiny and you can basically stick
those in any of your edge device and
make it smart connected you know so the
hay problema here z 1 i'm waiting for
some other surface coming really soon
but they're very so we'll definitely
just given you what they're showing
onstage returns yeah well they they were
holding onto us very tightly but as soon
as these become available we'll
definitely talk about them some more
alright so so what we're doing here is
this is a demo application that we
created for job one actually and it is
we call it the smart solar tracking
system so it combines servos and a solar
panel server control or a light sensor
with a piece of hardware which is a
color board it's it's a cortex m3
embedded evaluation board by harm and
we're connecting that over Ethernet so
it runs a full tcp/ip stack to a
back-end glassfish server and all early
that also to a java fex client running
on a pc so we're showing a basically
local interaction with peripherals by
the ability to read the light sensor the
ability to drive the servos we're
showing local processing of an
application process in that data we're
showing integration with the back end
and we're showing remote management all
the one demo yes I know it's this little
guy on the table right so let's switch
over to this board this is this is
somehow related to what your initial X's
out the Kyle board so this is the
cardboard yep so it's what are the
special features on this little bored
okay so this is as I said this is um the
cortex m3 slc is actually on here on the
this is this is not a board he would use
in a productive as LCD screen yeah so
this basically break this board breaks
out all the i/o that's integrated on the
slc everything right so the soc that's
amazing what they pack into this SOC
suits you no one should remember those a
via the associations for system-on-chip
exactly people so um it has an LCD
screen it's actually a touchscreen
washer pressure sensitive touch screen
it has let me see it has ethernet it has
two USB hosts two USB clients it has a
bunch of buttons joystick is as
accelerometer SD card support it has
debug ports it actually breaks up all
the various um I oh that's on the chip
so you can hook up your own peripherals
which we're actually doing here with
this light sensor FSU pick which one to
put the headers hand exactly i soldered
some headers on here it has its yet it's
an amazing board so as i said you would
not use this in a production deployment
environment because this is too big and
too too expensive but it breaks out
everything that's on the chip and so
typically the way you would use this is
you would develop your application this
is a prototype being bored in the
evaluation board and then you regret a
production with something that's scaled
down to what you only need right cool
because the the system on a chip the end
the cortex m3 is something that costs
only a few dollars in volume right so it
is only the key components here are all
very inexpensive you things like those
inside mass-produced units for a
fraction of the cost of what this test
motor costs this board currently has two
megabytes of onboard memory and a couple
megabytes of ROM and I was more than
enough to run the complete Java snack so
we're still let's see can you show the
the solar panel okay so what we have
here is we have two connections to the
solar panel so you can see this is a
solar panel this is a light sensor we
have a three axis pan tilt unit with two
servos so these are just standard
components there's a servo control over
here that drives the circles the servo
controller is hooked up to the board via
standard serial port connection rs-232
ok so we're demonstrating that we can
interact with serial devices and the
light sensor here is action i square C
device so I square sees of in industrial
serial bus and of low cost and so the
java runtime is actually able to
interact with the serial port and
directly with the icrc devices and we
have a p is for that so you don't
actually have to do any native
programming it's all in down so we have
a java application running on here and i
can show you actually how to install it
because we can remotely basically log
into this device and install
applications start/stop applications
there's an application running right now
which basically provides control of the
solar panel so we can use the local haha
there you go there's a demo the demo
gods are not willing this should
actually move the solar panel so we can
use the local buttons here and the
joystick to move the solar panel so
we're driving the servos through the
several controller and we can read the
light sensor so the local Java
applications reading the light sensors
and communicating to our javafx
application which we can show so why
don't we switch over to that
oh yeah it's reset thee I think this
Hardware suffered a bit when we drag
route to job 1 back and it's a bit flaky
so let's do it was a wrestling rather
you'll all turbulence we'll just reset
it so um Garrett grim walls okay so he's
he's um he's been playing with the
release beagleboard okay um def preview
of javafx and I think he's he's jealous
of your common word that's that's a
monster yeah so that I mean the bigger
board is great for um for Java Sea
embedded for bigger system sorry because
it has lots of memory as a powerful
processor it's also much more expensive
so what we're going after with this
product is really an order of magnitude
smaller and cheaper right we're talking
about ten to fifteen dollars for a final
product rather than you know fifty or a
hundred yeah okay so is the control
system here right well I'm gonna Thea I
can move up side of the way there we go
okay so we can we go yan ya know cool so
I have two windows here so the first
window this is basically a login into
the board so over on Ethernet or we're
basically tell heading into the board
you can see the system come up and this
is the log output of the board you can
see the system starting it's starting
the solar panel application it connects
to various ports it starts the joystick
task it starts using the LED so it's
interacting with all the parts of the
system where many parts of the system
well and then it finally connects to our
back-end statistic server and so now I
can actually show the still not working
G okay let me see if I can do it through
all the server ok it's my fault
a silver controller hang sometime that's
a third third party piece of software
that hangs intelligent we did nothing ha
now it works ok so you can switch back
now are in good shape again so ok yeah
we can see it so here's the sauna panel
again and I can use the local hardware
the joystick to tilt and pan I can go
back to the central position but I can
also do all of this so as an example
what we've done here is we've created a
little javafx application which is
running on my desktop here which is
actually connected to the board so
there's a little protocol where the
JavaFX application basically has access
to the complete status of the local java
application that's running here and you
can see the device state so this is the
IP address we have the device state so
it's connected to the server controller
you can actually see if i move the servo
controller it should change the pan and
tilt this servo controller is definitely
flaky ok yeah now you can see the angle
has changed there's the light sensor so
if I cover the light sensor we should
see the brightness going down there we
go now make a bigger so close closer so
it's dropping down to 40 we can run
different types of applications on the
device so so this runtime one of the key
features of why this is specially
designed for small embedded systems is
it has what we call the nvm runtime on
it so it's a multi vm you can actually
run multiple applications on this
runtime in power low so you can actually
build you know fairly sophisticated
embedded java applications even though
you're running within two megabytes of
RAM right so it's a system that's been
optimized over the years and you can run
multiple applications you can
startstop remotely install applications
and I can show that later but for
example I can remotely run this test
application and you can see that the
yeah you can see it on you the servers
are moving around right yeah that's a
happy little solar panels this could be
set to like automatically reposition
based on location of this exactly and we
actually we actually have different
algorithms so this is another you know
to show another one of these features
once your device is out in the field
over time you want to be able to change
the functionality and so we can actually
update the algorithms are the device
remotely right now you can run different
algorithms so for example you can say
find brightest position and run this guy
and then actually now go and basically
do a sweep over all the positions can
try to find and I should point probably
of and some point it should stop and
point up because that's where the light
is coming from and not quite the light
is not bright enough so it got an
approximation idiot light it's ambient
light um we can also interact with the
panel directly so we can do the same
thing that we did on the local buttons
basically okay and so now an interesting
aspect of this is so not only can we
remotely interact with the device so
this could be you know remote operator
console somewhere but the device also
interacts with a back-end server so we
actually have a little glass for server
running here which on a regular basis
the device because it's just tcp/ip you
can speak all the standard protocols
just sends various statistics back to
the server and we can display them here
on a web page so it's just a little
service servlet running in glassfish and
you can see that it's being updated so
for example if i change the the angle
here you should see the angle down
bottom column change dynamically but so
every every couple seconds right um so
for example what you can do now is you
could do a
analysis on the backend right so for
example if you have a farm of solar
panels and some of the solar panels
aren't correctly tracking the Sun you
can actually do things like complex
event processing where you get all the
data from a thousand panels and you can
actually filter out the outliers and do
some analysis on things that might be
wrong right so you get some additional
business intelligence from this alright
so I'm Garrett had a question he was
wondering do you use rxtx to interact
with the i2c bus right so rxtx is um the
the serial library that you can use with
java SE e that allows you to basically
use the Java io com API no that's not
what we're doing because that would
require native code we actually have on
this product that's one of the features
of this product we have a new API which
is called the device access API and that
is a an API that gives you java level
access to a lot of the aisle that's on
the system so we have API is the Lowry
to talk to general purpose io 2i square
C to SBI to memory mapped i/o and a
bunch of other things um so the way you
would use this is you can basically you
don't have to write any native code and
you can basically create Java device
drivers on this one so it's a very
low-level API allows you to fiddle with
the bits and you can now create your own
classes on top that abstract and
encapsulate the specific functionality
for example let's say you have a
temperature sensor or light sensor off I
2i square c you can create a Java class
that wraps it and exposes a neat simple
API to the application development cool
also that answers your question Garrett
so I told folks if they have any other
hardware key key questions they can that
you ask any times you know if anyone
else if anyone else pops in with any
questions but that's that's some cool
hacking I think
I think you deserve a and my packing
laptop sticker all right so all of our
streaming participants thank you get
stick it on my forehead I'm gonna
probably wear a night hacking sticker
and any other topics you want to cover
stuff you wanna mention about how people
would get the releases yes exactly so um
all rights and if you know to release is
currently out how would they write so so
both of these new releases so Java me
embedded 32 is the release for this
small cortex board um and Java embedded
suite is the one for you know running
glassfish Java Sea embedded for the
concentrators okay both of these are
available on otn so you can either go to
my blog you'll find the links or you
just search for Oracle Java embedded
you'll find them you can get started
with these right now there's actually a
new version of the Java ME sdk which is
the tool chain but allows you to create
these small embedded java applications
it has a star right side actually there
should be if you go to actually to be
just overview so Java me about Java it
bad I don't you know that's right it's
sort of the intro page right and then
you can go from dinner so you have se
embedded in the embedded in bed ensuite
ok so I let me first out yep when I was
just how to pump screen so oops that's
my flickr photostream that's also good
okay so here's the job and Bettie Page
people can go to and all I can also see
only put in a social shot and you keep
going other stuff alright so you can
download the java meet sdk 32 which has
a complete emulation environment of this
the small innovative runtime and you can
start building apps all the
documentation is out there what is not
available yet is the actual binary run
time for this kyle board
for this eval board that will be
available soon okay we ran into some
last-minute technical glitches but so
what I'm running here is is pretty much
the final version so that would be
available soon and then we've also
announced that we've been we're going to
be continuing to develop this there was
a roadmap if you go to the Java one
technical keynote you'll find more
information on that and also in my blog
I have a bunch of information related to
a better job and what's happening there
so I think very exciting stuff we're
just at the beginning um as I said you
know I'm the product manager for this
product we have lots of good ideas so
all right so Garrett also the question
is this going to be available in the
javafx forearm API was a PIV valve all
this so the device access API um so the
plan currently is to make this API also
available for java SE right so one of
the things we announced at javaone was
was the intent to bring together Java ME
and SE and have a much more unified
programming model and the ability to
access peripherals and hardware from
Java is really important something that
Java Sea actually still misses so the
plan is for this API to be available
across all platforms stay tuned for
details cool all right well thank you
very much for being on the night hacking
show thanks Steve my pleasure this is
your correct blog that is yep that's it
okay all right so just to show you guys
