over there right yeah so gently let's
start again okay let's start oh you're
here of Tori and she's dressed as a mad
scientist man haha a mad Jammeh signs
right yes and so you know Tori how you
likin javaone hey I'm having a great
time yeah that's pretty good I'd like
everyone to you know and and and what
are the cool stuff that you're doing
here um well let's see I'm talking to a
lot of Java developers about what
they're working on oh that's so cool
yeah and i went to the JCP party last
night right that was an idiot that was
great very i love the JCP party i was
one of the best part as a java one yeah
it was one of the spectacular parties
and they had awards for people that were
involved in the JCP I've heard of that
yeah you've heard of the JCP yes I've
heard of the JCP yeah being in the JCP
is a java community process is the place
where Java evolved that's pretty cool
place right and you're a member of the
EC the executive committee right right
actually so Java the one of the largest
javi's the groups in the word is in the
Javanese of society down in Brazil it's
a member of the EC of the JCPS as active
community yes wow so that's and I'm to
represent the to have some excellent
okay and so tell me what's going on at
the JCP these days so the JCP is we are
going through a very very important
phase of JCP because no the process
needs to evolve right you know Java has
been around for a long time JCP rules
have been around for a long time and all
this time I think you know the whole
technology word has evolved Java has
evolved in a lots of very very cool ways
also all of the licensing discussions
and all of the ways that people
collaborate have evolved so i think that
the JCP right now we are we're creating
the means to that the JCP can be more
collaborative the DJ that can be easier
for each of participant in JCP that we
can actually you know we are in the age
of participation right you know right
right so so we need to have the JCP
being part of this age of participation
that means people should be to have a
very easy time participation
participating on the future of Java wow
so the JCP is kind of like the social
media of Java right because everybody
can get involved from reviewing a spec
to being involved in a mailing list
right yeah because now with the new
transparency rules of the JCP everything
that happens in JCP has to be very
transparent so all of the meetings are
public you know all of the the
discussions are happening on public
mailing lists all the specifications
it's publicly available from the very
very early on so that means you as a
developer you can participate this on
this effort very very very early on and
now we have every jsr has its own issue
tracker average yes our hands on mainly
so yes I think you're right you know the
JCP is kind of the social the social
network of of java developers and i
think that you know by by making it
easier for everyone to participate I
think we can have more and more
developers involved because you know
Java is a technology the effects today
millions and millions of developers and
true the work of those developers
affects millions and billions of people
worldwide right right so and and I think
that's the more people that actually
participate in the evolution of Java the
better the technology going to be for
developers the battle the technology's
going to be for everyone right the
wisdom of crowds right so the wisdom of
crowds yes that's a good thing sir yeah
one developer and but many you aren't
you are a mad scientist right yeah I
guess you're talking about wheezing off
crowd is on social net yeah it's great
oh you're cool so let's talk about
technology a little bit lately
technology right yeah so I asked you
what you were into and you told me
clouds cloud computing Emily everyone is
in the cloud today right right well eff
yeah I am especially but tell me me
personally right tell me what you're
looking at how you're looking at it from
a technology perspective so so the thing
that for me is very exciting about the
cloud computing is that you know Java
it's really i think Javas kind of
no made for the cloud right we didn't
know that about in 1995 right okay but
but really you think about today you
have you know you're not you're not
focused on your own computer anymore
your focus on those did you know this
vast network of computers that you can
put your applications that you run on
and all those different vendors
providing you know just huge data
centers everywhere around the world
right and you have you know some places
like the u.s. you can have all those
lots of different vendors but not all of
those vendors are everywhere right so in
a private place you have different yep
so different vendors everywhere right
and you have to have your application
running all of those places so how are
you going to do this if you don't have a
portable right a secure a a you know a
standardized environment so that's what
Java allows you java gives you you know
all the portability for you to run your
stuff and whatever cloud vendor you want
right and so that that opens up such so
my application was running in the 90s
it's the same application I can run now
on those huge data set wow so you took
your DeLorean into the future and saw
the cloud and then came back and that's
why you built Java the way you did right
well yeah I think I think that I think
that's the cool thing about job is that
Java is beaut for the future you know
right what a child developers is that
you know they are learning today to
develop for the computers of the
tomorrow right and I think that's what
Java allows us to do and i think that's
that's that's very cool and the other
thing the cloud brings us is the cloud
allows you know it removes the the
physical world right you know everything
everything is virtual visualizations the
main technology behind the cloud
environments and so now i can automate a
whole lot more than I you know before we
could automate our buttes it could
automate our testing but now we can
automate our production all right so
whenever we need a production
environment we can create this out of
the blue or out of the ballot all right
and so and and just just put together
all this kind of just
the servers from different vendors and
put out everything together with scripts
even a lot easier to spin something up
yeah and we can't a mechanic screwin the
good things that you don't need to go to
web page and click on something
correction make that happen right you
script all of this so you have all this
IEP eyes and you can you can call
Institute to start servers to configure
to configure your environments to deploy
your application you know to do load
balancing networking configuration you
have all of that as codes so now we're
we're coding the infrastructure going to
run applications on that's very very
powerful wow that's very cool so I want
to thank you very much for taking a
moment to speak to me Bruno it's always
a pleasure Bruno Souza who has man
extraordinaire if you're here at javaone
just look turn around it looked for the
Brazilian flag and you'll find Bruno
Souza look look for the guy in the flag
all right thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
