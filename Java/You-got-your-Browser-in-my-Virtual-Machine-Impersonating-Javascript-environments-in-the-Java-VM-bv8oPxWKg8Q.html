that has a lot of JavaScript in it
sometimes that gets a reaction like boo
you know the how how many you guys have
to work with JavaScript on a regular
basis this is the case everywhere right
and um but people say oh I'm a Java
developer JavaScript is bad language the
what I'm going to try and talk about in
this talk is that that assumption that
mindset it's kind of an illusion right
everybody is have it everybody has to
work with JavaScript these days because
it's everywhere it's in the browser so
and what I want to do is introduce some
things to in this talk but challenge
your assumptions about whether
JavaScript even is or isn't part of the
Java environment so we'll talk about
that I'm going to talk about web
extensions how many of you guys have
heard of web extensions okay I'm going
to get into what those are and how they
work and I'm also going to talk about
isomorphic applications how many people
have heard of this concept so isomorphic
applications just means getting your
code to run in multiple environments so
the and then finally I'm going to talk
about the project I'm working on with
Mozilla and what it's about and filter
bubbles and we can talk about that and
then I have some robot stuff that I work
on it's just kind of fun and cool I know
do you guys want the the robot stuff is
like three minutes of interesting robot
videos do you want at the beginning or
the end with beginning beginning okay
great
sorry I'm hard of hearing too many rock
shows let's see here so I was roommates
in college with a guy named Dave Hanson
who's become famous for making super
realistic robots I'm going to show you
some of those and then I'll show you a
current video with Jimmy Fallon viewers
anybody like Jimmy Fallon here so I'm
going to show the Sofia robot on Jimmy
Fallon then I'll show you a development
video from 2014 in Hong Kong just to
show you kind of how things how quickly
things moved along
you know where you are of course I'm in
New York City and I'm on my favorite
show The Tonight Show sure what jeez
could never be yours
nacho cheese that's a really fun thing
to work on right there's a lot of stuff
going on inside Sophia there's there's
about 40 motors in there that you've got
to control there are real time message
bus message queue kind of things going
on to control all that there is voice
synthesis voice recognition then the
voice recognition you know pro city
emotional content analysis there's a lot
of stuff that you get a play with trying
to build a system like this it's kind of
like Alexa right but you're then trying
to extend beyond that and get it you
don't think about your face as a user
interfaces but you know or your arms
your hands or gestures but all of these
things are very meaningful you know to a
person we have these very sophisticated
rules we've built up about how we
communicate with each other and it's
interesting to program it because you
have to really become conscious of all
these things so when Dave and days we
doing this stuff for a long time but
their animation platform previously was
more like the kind of system that let's
say you had a assembly line automation
and you're trying to control an arm
putting lids on applesauce you know
going by on a conveyor belt that was
kind of like more what they were using
so each but in that face there are
dozens of motors controlling pulleys and
you know that mimic the tendons and
other structures in your face so a motor
like pull the cord that pulls a net
that's fused into the Hat
rubber rubber that Dave developed that
creates these you know different
expressions right so Dave and his team
we're having to go in and on a timeline
just each motor basically you had a yet
a graph representing the motor position
and they had to painstakingly position
each of those things well in a Disney
movie or like a Pixar movie there's a
way more mature set of tour tools for
doing emotional animation and how many
you guys have ever used blender or Maya
or any of these kinds of tools so
blender is a amazing piece of free
software that gives you a really robust
set of tools for building awesome
animations and I talked to Dave and said
you know you guys should be using this
we could write a binding layer between
the animation tools and the and the
motor control in the robot operating
system so has anybody ever heard of the
robot operating system Ross so Ross does
some really cool things it is like an
operating system for robotics right
robot operating systems so what does
that mean at an operating system
provides a layer of abstraction between
your program and your peripherals so for
instance let's say in the early days
early early word processors like a Wang
word processor an IBM word processor
Wang word processor could work on a Wang
printer and in fact maybe just even a
specific Wang printer so literally the
word processor in its code had the
control codes for this specific printer
you couldn't take an IBM printer and put
it on your Wang word processor or vice
versa because they were written
specifically to work with each other and
when operating systems got more mature
they provided an abstraction layer so
you had you know this idea of a document
that needed to be printed you know word
or your word processor manipulates a
document and it says hey operating
system print this for me and the
operating system takes care of
translating that abstract idea of a
document into the control codes to
control the printer so Ross does this
for
robotics concepts so for instance
there's a two major kinds of motors a
servo motor and a stepper motor a servo
motor has a single control line usually
and it uses the timing of the pulses on
the control line to set the position the
rotational position of the motor a
stepper motor has multiple control lines
and manipulates this by activating the
lines in series also sets the rotation
of the motor your if you're writing a
program you don't really care how that
all works you just say I have a
rotational joint I want it to be at 45
degrees and then the Ross takes care of
the translation between that abstract
idea of a rotating motor and the
physical reality of manipulating some
specific piece of hardware so I wrote a
binding layer that would take the
animation rig in blender and then
connect it to the Ross abstract concepts
of motors so that then it could drive
the actual motors in Sofia's head so I
have a small contracting company in
Dallas you know kind of size business
you know maybe any you guys could start
we have four employees but we do all
kinds of different things most of what
we do that for the to make the rent IR
is to build erp systems usually on
apache open for business and usually
with a modern JavaScript front-end so i
do i spend a lot of time writing java
and writing javascript and but i did
have an interesting piece of work come
in that mozilla wanted me to help with
helped them do something with filter
bubbles which is kind of the you know
whole fake news news kind of the just
medium modern media and trying to build
tools to help users understand what's
going on in modern media and to
demonstrate the new web extensions api
so what our web extensions web
extensions are a new api that was a
collaboration originally between Mozilla
and Google Chrome to allow you to write
plug-ins for the browser using
a script to write the code and HTML to
build your user interfaces so instead of
C++ and xpcom and kind of all these
browsers like the internal
implementation specific details of a
browser you have this very high level
programming environment that's pretty
much like what you're used to already
building normal web pages with
JavaScript it lets you add new buttons
to the toolbar in the browser and you
know this this is just an HTML page and
then you can do all kinds of stuff that
you can't do from a normal web page it
lets you you know you can monitor user
activity you can watch what all the tabs
in the browser what pages they're on you
can tell when they change pages you can
get a call back when somebody switches
pages you can look at the content in you
look at the Dom of every window that's
open in the browser you can see the
history of the browser you can see the
bookmarks you can manipulate the
bookmarks you can create bookmarks you
can you basically lets you control the
browser you know and way more control
way more access than you have from
within a page context and it's it
currently is I'm not going to say it's a
hundred percent portable right that I
mean it's not exactly like you write the
same piece of JavaScript exactly and it
will run across Firefox Chrome Opera and
edge but it is like 95 98% there and
there are more and more libraries
there's already a number of libraries
that create polyfills
right which is an adapter class
essentially that mostly smooth out any
of the remaining differences so already
with a few libraries you can reliably
write a single javascript HTML piece of
code and plug it into all four of these
browsers right and add on to any of
these browsers and that's a really
powerful concept and so the structure
one of these things looks basically like
this you have a you have a manifest file
that sets up the different components
you typically then have a couple of
different UI elements so you'd have your
that pop-up you have a pop-up HTML and a
pop-up j/s so just like building a web
page
you also I don't have it here but you
can also create options pages so just
like if you've used any of your plugins
and you go to settings and it brings you
to a separate page where you can control
the settings for that plug-in that it
lets you do that kind of stuff but then
you also have a background contact
script that when the browser kicks off
it'll run your background script and you
can start processes then that run
continuously in the background all the
time the pop-up basically every time you
pop that pop up and then let it close
it's as if you've reloaded the page so
the state resets every time but the
state of the background script it's
there all the time and you also then
have content scripts and what the
content scripts do is that when any page
is opened in the browser it basically it
lets you inject your own JavaScript into
the JavaScript environment of that page
and you can add additional listeners you
can manipulate the document so you know
you could be like you could you can put
a Content script in there that goes oh
am I in the Google web page context okay
I'm going to make the search field blue
and any time you went to Google on that
machine and opened it the search field
would be blue so you can you can do
anything right it's it lets you add
JavaScript to any page that's your
JavaScript so with that in mind let's
talk about isomorphic applications a
little bit the so what did you do with
one of these web extensions right well
let's say you've got your Java you know
enterprise tool you know they're your
company and you want to have something
easily that when a sales lead comes in
all the time when your sales guys can
just hit a button and here's your form
to fill in a new sales leave um it goes
up to your up to your to your Java
server the or let's say you have two
legacy applications right how many times
have you had this and you have to open
something in some page and a legacy
application somebody's actually sitting
there in another tab and keying it in
well you could make an extension that
you know can see oh I've got I see
you've got the old order application
open and you're trying to enter in the
new order and it could just reach in
pull the data out of the one and paste
it into the other form
so then the user could look at it and go
that's right hit submit instead of
having to rekey everything well I mean
lots of opportunity right anytime you
want to all of a sudden reach into two
pages or anything like that you can you
can do that so how many how many of you
have had to write JavaScript form
validation code alright so one of the
things I want to challenge you to think
about as I go through this talk is how
much could you reuse that exact same
validation logic inside your java
application there's so there's more and
more tools to do this kind of thing one
of the classics is Rhino that's been
around a long time but in Java and in
the VM now standard in the VM there's a
tool called nashorn anybody use national
one so national arne is a much more
high-performance JavaScript environment
that's built into your JVM all the time
I'm going to talking to that but there's
also things like closure script which if
you're writing closure you can compile
closure into JavaScript with closure
script but there's also J sweet which J
sweet you can write standard Java and it
will compile your Java into JavaScript
that you can then put into your browser
pages so what about Nashua Nash born
like I said it's the JD kaise JavaScript
solution ship standard in in the JDK in
the Java VM so they're all the time and
their Oracle is putting serious effort
into making it high-performance in you
know in Java 7 you had invoke dynamic
there's there's improvements going in in
every Java release to improve the
performance of nashorn I won't tell you
that it's at parity with nodejs
but the gap is closing in many
situations it's going to perform you
know close to no js' but it you know the
big difference with it is you're in the
java vm so you have access to facilities
in the java vm that just don't exist in
node.js room right no js' doesn't have
threads right there are no threads for
for node.js so anything you do with a
it's you know sending data back and
forth between workers you have to send
essentially message objects and past day
by value but you know let's say you have
something like the disrupter ring buffer
right which is a super high performance
Java ring buffer structure it's used a
lot like some stock trading applications
use it if you've got an 8 gigabyte
in-memory data structure that you're
sharing between a bunch of threads that
the threads are simultaneously
manipulating that you can't go handing
an 8 gig object between workers right so
you can do things with javascript in the
java vm that you just can't even do in
nodejs right just not even possible so
apples to apples performance comparison
is hard to make because the facilities
are simply not there and how easy is it
to get going so these two lines kind of
show you a super simple example of doing
a little JavaScript the you get asked
for a new script engine from the script
engine manager you ask for it by name
Nashorn and then here you go engine eval
and you can put any JavaScript you want
in there and it'll run it it will
convert it to Java bytecode and execute
it but you can not only you know spit
something to standard out if you
instantiate an object in JavaScript here
and return that you're going to get back
an object handle in Java that you can
call methods on and you can even pass
Java objects into and have that
JavaScript object call methods on your
Java object and that it all works
seamlessly right it's all just more
objects in the Java VM so that's one of
the things I want you guys to think
about is don't think about it as like
there's JavaScript world in Java world
Java is a human language the Java VM
does not run Java source code right it
runs Java bytecode
well Nashorn compiles JavaScript into
Java bytecode so javascript with Nashorn
is just another way to produce Java
bytecode so if you have already have
validation logic if you already have
value in your existing JavaScript that
you've had to write for web applications
before you rewrite it in Java take a
step back and go like can we just use
that do we have to rewrite that and
really think about that right because if
you get in the position of that you're
not only doing your validation logic
let's say in in your web application
but now you're talking about doing an
iOS native app and you're talking about
doing an Android native app you know
that you're going to have to keep your
Objective C version of that validation
like logic your java version of that
validation logic your javascript version
of that validation logic that's all
engineering hours and those are all
opportunities for failure right you can
have drift between your versions and
that's how you get serious bugs in your
platform so you want to you know don't
repeat yourself single source of truth
can you reuse that code and that's what
that's what isomorphic applications are
about it's Ekman script 5 I think
there's some ACMA script 6 coming but
you can you know like you can run
express with babel like you can use
webpack and babel and produce with the
transpiler that will work on nashua so
you can use echo script 6 constructs
they're just transpiled so there's some
performance considerations but like I
said natural one is definitely under
active development Oracle is definitely
gets it the JavaScript in Java is a big
deal and they are pursuing that because
you know the reality is for Java and the
browser applets are gone right nobody's
even thinking about I mean before there
and now that even that they're
officially gone nobody was really that
happy about using applets for a while
now so the web is just getting to be a
bigger and bigger deal and javascript is
everywhere you know with and with tools
like PhoneGap Apache Cordova anybody
ever play with that you can you can
build a simple web application and
package it for the web store you can put
it into the Apple Store put it in the
Android store so there's these powerful
platforms that are emerging to let you
move your code between all kinds of
different environments you can get
nodejs kind of style work with yeah
yes yes so you can you should be able to
call any method on any java object from
javascript using Nashorn so anything you
could write in Java I believe and I
believe you should be able to minute you
can do things like manipulate threads
from JavaScript in using Nashorn like
you know if you have a handle to those
objects you can call you just you can
call methods on Java objects so anything
you can do via calling methods on Java
objects you may you may have to do some
casting you may have to go depending on
like if you try to do something really
low-level I don't have a Pat answer in
terms of you know will it be easy but
you should be anything you can do in
Java you should be able to do in
JavaScript there may be some like there
may be some interesting things when it
comes to getting if you have like you
know a method that you're using casting
you know to that the type detection
plays a big role in it it may get a
little complicated but so you may have
to do something like write an adapter
class in Java that like gives JavaScript
little help in hand just to understand
the typing system so and you know
there's because there's so much
happening with JavaScript there is a lot
of evolution happening in the JavaScript
space with things very sophisticated
concepts that are hot in the Java space
right the same kind of ideas like
immutable operative script callback
oriented programming in JavaScript is
very very sophisticated so like Java
programmers are kind of just now
discovering lambdas and how to deal with
them well javascript has been thinking
that way for a long time and you know
like a big reason that asynchronous IO
is in Java right everybody kind of
remembers the history is no jazz came
out of nowhere all of a sudden and for
for huge numbers of simultaneous
sessions node.js was just hand in Java
you know hand in Java it's but you know
because it
and it wasn't that nodejs produces way
faster code right it's just it's a way
different strategy because if you have
10,000 simultaneous sessions on the old
servlet structure you have 10,000
threads but on no js' you have 10,000
callbacks sitting in an array with a
thread iterating over those and seeing
if data is ready and then just go and
here's some data here's some data here's
some data so that getting rid of that
overhead of all those threads is that's
why they did async i/o you know and now
Java has very good performance so now
that people are using those kinds of
techniques that mostly came from the
JavaScript space in the Java VM you can
get back to parity and performance so
there's a lot of stuff going on around
callback oriented programming in
JavaScript that you may find it's
actually easier to write it in
JavaScript or that there's more mature
tools available in JavaScript because
things like you know already remembers
when you first were doing you know
dollar sign get and you had your success
callback like let's say you're trying to
call a series of rest services in order
and you're having to you're having to
nest on one inside the other right you
get these kind of crazy flying V's in
your code well people in JavaScript land
got sick of that and that's where the
then you know then operator came from
and things that you could then if I
where you're saying I want to call this
and then when that's done I want then I
want this function to be called and then
I want this function to be called and
you can have very clean code for doing
these kinds of nested callback oriented
structures and it's a different way of
thinking so spending some time in the
JavaScript space with these libraries
will really up your game for using
lambdas in Java because it's conceptual
right it's not just it's not about the
language it's a concept just like for
loops or if you know any programming
concept it's really about the concepts
because those it's easy to learn if you
understand a concept it's easy to go to
a new language and understand and learn
that concept in a new language if you
don't understand the concept then that's
what's hard to learn
so I'm doing some work with react how
many people are working will react or
redux so this is like this is an example
of some really cool concepts that can be
applied in the Java space but it's about
the conceptual framework so in a react
app location State is immutable you have
action objects that run that run through
things called reducers that atomically
manipulate the state and because you
don't have threads in JavaScript it's
really an atomic situation that you have
a that you have a that you have a very
predictable state transition I'm going
to talk about that in a second slide
this is just to give you an example how
many people have written anything where
you do you know callback driven like
each swing you know swing programmers or
just in JavaScript you know you go but
button on click and you write a function
and in that function right there maybe
you do a jQuery get well if you have a
lot of this kind of stuff going on you
can have a pretty complicated
interactions between all the timing of
how these events happen right because
you you think you're going to be able to
do that jQuery get and it's going to
come back in a particular order but like
the if you are assuming that's always
going to happen with certain timing that
can get real complicated and debugging
that understanding what's going on can
get very complicated so what happens in
with redux and in react is when you
trigger an event initially it it never
you never do anything right then other
than you create an object that
represents a request to do something and
you essentially put it on a queue that's
going to get processed later outside of
your code in a deterministic way and
then the the thing that actually
processes that this is this is an action
event in react redux land and then later
the action event processor you take you
see that you're going to do this action
and you take the state you make a copy
of the state and you return a modified
copy so this is side-effects free right
because you never directly manipulate a
state you always copy the state and
return a new modified copy
so I have some interesting side effects
because you have those action events end
up being like a player piano tape you
could think of it like it's a mechanical
tape controlling your program you have
an action action action action and they
happen in some order and it's very easy
you can audit right this stream of
actions because it's actually just you
could think of it as an array of objects
representing actions that your program
needs to take and they caused a series
of state transitions and because state
is always modified as a copy right the
transition is all is very easy to
understand so let's say you got your
to-do list right you start out empty
to-do list add it to do two got a now
estate with one to do add it to do two
to dus remove it to do back to one right
this approach lets you do some very
interesting things in terms of testing
in terms of debugging so like let's say
you put a feature toggle in your app
where if you have a you know let's say
you have users that are having problems
with some facility you could turn on a
future toggle that you're going to
record the action that's a series of
actions and when the error occurs here
have pushed that series of action
objects up to the server so then you can
pull that series of action objects down
to your development environment if you
replay them if you write it correctly if
you follow the rules you can playback
the users series of action objects and
you'll get the exact same state right
it's deterministic which is funny you
know that when things get complicated
you start going can it really still be
deterministic if you if you have a
computer program and it's deterministic
no matter how complicated it is you can
replay it and it mechanically you're
going to get the same state so this lets
you do some pretty interesting things
like let's say you well let's take this
let's say you want to you want to test
like you got at let's say it takes you
hours of interactions to get to this
state and then this is where your errors
start happening well you could serialize
this state you know you can then unpack
that serialized state and start playing
actions series of actions against it and
you're again going to just be able to
move forward from there so it lets you
like snapshot time time travel if you
want to do undo right all you have
to do to implement undo is you just snap
the application state back to the
previous state and you're doing that
because the entire application state is
in a single state object that your whole
app will just snap back into place you
know if you say undo that delete well
there's two there's two to do objects
again so that's kind of what I covered
here but I think it's with easier with
the illustration yeah and for testing
again you know like you can have your
mock state that in your test environment
like to test your application you can
just restore this complicated user state
that represents a long-term interaction
start playing it back from there instead
of having to always like replay all the
way from the beginning kind of like in
selenium so filter bubbler is a program
on is a web extension that I'm
implementing it's sponsored by Muslim
working with them and it is to let you
is first of all to demonstrate the web
extensions API but then it's also to
like let you analyze your web browsing
habits in kind of the same way that big
guides like Facebook and Google are
analyzing your web browsing habits right
now and it's it's to let you visualize
your filter bubble so what's a filter
bubble filter bubble is really another
word for cognitive bias right how many
people have heard this term cognitive
bias like cognitive bias an example
would be I'm a Java guy I'm supposed to
not like JavaScript review it is this
other thing right it's a cognitive bias
it's a set of assumptions that we see
the world through so sometimes those
assumptions can be accurate like you you
know shouldn't jump off a cliff
sometimes they could just be things
you've picked up along the way and
that's you believe are true maybe
they're true maybe they're not so the
this has always been typical right we
surround ourselves with people that we
like we read magazines and newspapers
about things that we like you know if we
like bicycling we read bicycling
magazines we know a lot about bicycling
we may not know about knitting so that's
that's normal but now that search
engines and social networks play such a
dominant role in our lives these
organizations are you
very sophisticated tools to monitor our
behavior and take advantage of our
cognitive biases to control our browsing
habits so you know Facebook for instance
they're using the most sophisticated
techniques available deep learning big
data all this I mean they invented a lot
of the big data stuff right why'd they
do that well to analyze their users
behavior and to send you you inputs
theoretically that posts that you're
going to like the most right so that may
be one of the key performance indicators
that they're using is how much you press
like but obviously they have some other
things on their agenda they want to keep
you on the system they want your you
know they want your time on Facebook to
blast a long time so they can serve you
lots of ads they want you to click on
ads so if they notice that people with
browsing habits like yours
click on certain kinds of ads they're
going to try to look in your you know
friends and look for posts that look
similar to the kinds of posts that make
people like you click on ads all right
and we we don't have those tools
ourselves to understand our own browsing
habits and we can't even see these
things right so that in some in some in
some cases these organizations
understand our behavior better than we
understand ourselves our own behavior
because they have a very sophisticated
knowledge so the goal of filter bubbler
is to try to give us some tools to do
analysis on our own behavior so what
does filter bubbler do it's it's really
an essence similar to a spam filter
right everybody uses a spam filter right
who use a spam filter in this room
everybody right you ever think about
what a spam filter does a spam filter
you have handed a program that uses
statistical analysis the authority to
decide whether a message even reaches
you right if you if it decides
statistically that that message it
matches spam it never makes it to your
inbox that's an extremely powerful idea
and the the accuracy is really
impressive right spam filtering people
to ninety-nine point nine nine nine
eight percent
probably accurate and if it wasn't that
accurate people wouldn't tolerate it but
what's interesting about spam filters is
they don't care that it's spam right
it's purely a statistical analysis like
a simple Bayesian analysis mostly you're
taking your messages say breaking them
up into groups of five words and you're
doing a statistical analysis of what
five word groups are present in what
groups of messages so it doesn't care
what the patterns are that you're trying
to match and nor does it have to be one
kind of pattern one bucket of patterns
you can for instance I I heard something
that kind of blew me away which is that
the way that they evaluate SAT essays
now is they use Bayesian analysis so
they take and they make a corpora of
like these are well written essays these
are poorly written essays and then they
just feed essays into this and just like
a spam filter it's got better than human
accuracy gets like ninety-nine point
nine nine eight percent accuracy of this
is a dumb illiterate essay or this is a
well-written smart essay because bad
grammar for instance is a it's a
statistical profile certain words are
used in syriza's that they shouldn't be
right that's bad grammar
so because you can do this with anything
what filter Butler does is it lets you
create a series of text corpora which is
basically your labeling URLs so let's
say real simple when you're just going
to go this page has awesome stuff on it
this page has stupid stuff on it you're
going to build up a list of two lists of
URLs system is going to read the text of
those pages and build up a statistical
profile of awesomeness and stupidness
and so then you can the the whole system
is pluggable so the source is pluggable
the classifier classifier is pluggable
and then the output of the
classification is pluggable so a simple
version might look at the page you're
currently looking at pass it through the
classifier have it compare it to the two
corpora and then make the classification
show up in the drop-down menu you say
this page is awesome for this page is
stupid but you could do other stuff
right
you could woops my keyboard
you could have it that my source is the
last year of my browsing history and my
sink is a full a new folder I'm going to
create in my bookmarks so I could take
my entire last year of browsing history
take each content of each page compare
it for awesomeness or stupidness and in
a new folder have two folders under it
awesome and stupid and my personal
browsing history will be automatically
separated into awesome and stupid think
about what that would take you to do
that yourself to go through and evaluate
your own year of history browsing
history to look for patterns in it like
that and the these classifications are
also pluggable and what we're working on
initially is a we're going to write a
Java server Java JavaScript server as
well but I'm even doing a a wordpress
plugin so anybody with WordPress can set
up their own little private
classification server so that they and
their friends can work together to make
their own classifications of content and
share those classifications and build
them up as a group so you could you know
beyond like this simple example let's
say you could take the New York Times
like last five years of New York Times
stories and separate them by department
so politics arts you know sports and so
then if you want to extract from the
last year your browsing history all the
stuff that looked like you were looking
at a sports page you could again go
through it and it would drop it into a
folder and you could go look in the
sports folder and you'd see your pages
that you visited that look like they're
about sports so that's that's basically
the idea we can do some QA
and I'm going to put these up so you can
write down URLs if you want so that's
basically my talk and I'm happy to
answer any questions
yeah absolutely and you can oh
absolutely you can do that
so with react and redux you they they
have a completely headless mode for
server-side rendering and so like if you
want to preload a cache with renderings
of all your product pages so that when
you when somebody requests a product on
your you know Java based website that
you're sending the HTML as it would be
rendered in their browser using the same
templates on your server in Java to
generate them yeah you can definitely do
that and to with Redux for instance you
can also just take completely not render
the HTML and use like if you just want
to use the reducer logic and the action
stream in you can act you can totally do
that there where you just start pushing
into the state and you just don't attach
the view objects to it like that you can
also do that but no yet yes definitely
and you can do that not just with react
but with several platforms like view
jeaious also will support that anybody
else yeah
same Pat you can use NPM you can
oh sorry again the for nodejs
you have the NPM universe of languages
you can run NPM using Nashorn and you
can actually use run your grunt it
Nashorn is pretty much at this point
where it's at API parity with node.js so
there may be some performance
differences but you can basically run
the JavaScript libraries you can run in
node.js you can run in nashua so in if
you can just use NPM same tools that
you're already used to using to build
your applications that you run and with
nashua if you do it through the script
manager it tends to reconstruct the
national and environment every time you
ask for a new instance you don't have to
do it that way you can instantiate and
you can instantiate a natural run JIT
compiling interpreter and you can keep
it in its state around so you don't have
to have that behavior you just it's not
a one-liner
yeah sure like so pro city is uh is like
the singsong eNOS of talking when you go
really you know so kalbi is an
interesting Java environment for doing
some of that stuff that it's a voice
recognition environment that can
actually give you some tonal and
inflection data from your speaker que al
di yes yeah the the classified that as
far as the classifier framework is
concerned the filter bubbler just is
interested if you go hey classifier
here's some text what label do you think
it is so that it's purposefully very
generic right so then if you want to use
a word to Veck kind of implementation or
even like um what's the google frame
tensorflow like if you want to have you
know it doesn't even have to be java
javascript you know it just has to
result in the JavaScript environment
getting a label bag I don't I don't read
about word Tyvek and I tried playing
with it a little bit and actually the
there's some really cool stuff that dice
comm open sourced for solar the search
and the Java based search engine to do
word to Veck in so that if you do stuff
like if you search for data scientist
you'll get back java jobs because
there's a like a word to Veck
association those that Java and data
scientists has often a have a
relationship to each other they cool
there are a oh s and there are iOS and
and Android implementations and there's
also a native web implementation but
it's kind of the same ideas SWT on
Eclipse
which is that you write a program in
JavaScript it is instantiating native UI
peers and then you
instead of rear like swing rewrote all
the UI peers in Java but in in SWT which
is what it clips is written in it
actually uses the native UI peers from
the operating system so react native is
this kind of same idea but for building
UIs with JavaScript so you could I don't
know if like I said that's an
interesting question I'll look into that
and put something up on my website but
the you should be able to do a if
somebody should be doing that would be a
cool idea is to do a react native port
for Java so that you could take your
react native application that runs on
iOS and on Android you could just run it
on the Java VM and it would be a desktop
job of the a map location that would be
cool so in theory possible like I said I
don't know it seems like the kind of
thing somebody somewhere would have been
like I'm bored I'm gonna try this so I'm
gonna I'm gonna look you buddy else all
right well I guess I'll hand it back to
our tell it in announcer and host
Bruno's hola okay just let me yeah so
thanks again does great um you know
since we're since we have that's a new
thing that we're here we haven't talked
about you know even get his java
javascript talk but we do have here with
us a good friend of ours from Oracle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
