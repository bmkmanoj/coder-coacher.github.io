here at devoxx Belgium and I'm
interviewing several Java champions I'm
the Java champion program manager and
i'm here with martin Thompson hi all
right nice to meet you a person finally
yeah you too and just wanted to give
people out there little information on
the Java champion program you know who
these folks are that are you know so
important to the ecosystem so I just
want to ask you a couple questions if
that's all right sure so first off you
know what do you do for your day job
what I do my day job these days I do a
bunch of different things I I'm a
consultant so I'm freelance I mostly try
to do all sorts of things that lead me
to development because I like to write
code so for my sins I turn up with
places like this and be shy for a while
and talk occasionally sometimes I get
the right code as a result of it but
that's generally my girl like to also do
training sort of debugging performance
problems also interesting thing but
anything that get me the code that's
that's that's important to know what you
like so the second question is you know
other than being an expert in your field
and luminary you know a lot of times the
java champions give back to the java
community and I'm sure you do some of
that yourself so you know can you share
a little bit of how you give back to the
community I try to do various things I
blog for a while I need to get back to
blogging finding the time for its kind
of tricky one of the things I like to do
as much as I can is right open source
and contributor conferences and do
training whenever I can I think open
source is a great thing for our industry
the more we have of it the more we have
real examples because one of the real
challenges I think we have is it when
stuff is done in proprietary and in
private we don't look good looks like if
you're working and all you ever do is
work on a proprietary code base how do
you know if it's as good as it could be
could be better can you learn from other
fails I think our industry has a lot to
learn from other disciplines on this if
you're a scientist or an engineer
another failed you may work initially in
secret but everything name becomes
visible in the end we tend not to say
that so much so we don't see the good
working practices I think open source is
a nice way to show high CO 2 vols over
time so what code looks like what good
patterns look like I think it's a good
way to get that out to the community
well thank you so much for all that you
do and enjoy your time at devoxx oh
thank you very much thank you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
