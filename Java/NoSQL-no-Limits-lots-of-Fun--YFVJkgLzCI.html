explain more what no sicko means
basically those secrets are technology
to store storage information so it's the
exactly something that SQL database does
so I can put information there I can
retry information there I can delete
information there so I can do a large
stuff with no Seco technology but to
have some difference right now because
right now I have with five different
types
I have no standard yet and I have no
transaction and they normally don't use
structure like SQL
let's go deeply on the types the first
word a key value so we have the most
famous one in Redis so I believe
everyone he is a Java developer so the
key value has the same structure as
hashmap so I have a key and to this key
I have has the key value so that is it I
can return formation for the key and
there is death in that is it I have the
document so the most famous one in my
opinion is the Monte B so this structure
is something like JSON as JSON file or
XML file so basically the whole idea is
I have a collection of the document and
this collection has document and this
document has a topple the stop is a a
key where the key is the the name of the
information in the value and that is the
information in the sample here I have
the key first name and the value John I
have the key last name in the value is
Miss in the document I have the sub
document concept so archaic input
document inside documents so I have the
document address and I put more document
inside
dress that's the whole idea on the
document structure let's go in deeply to
: family so I have the column family
here
I hope everyone knows what Cassandra is
but Cassandra is one implementation of :
family it is looks similar to column so
I have my column family at the top and
they have column and the column is is
composed by a topo so the topo is keep
value the key is the name value is a
right formation and one important thing
he stuff here is the column is clearly
created just in time so if you take a
look here I have a Paulo it has very and
just after it has color because the
information was created just in time
that's a little different of the sko
technology because if you have
information or not the column is stood
there with information or with is new
value that's the idea okay right now I
have the grass and no secret database
basically a kink save relationship
between
vertex so I have the Apollo a are
artists both are brothers and I have
kratos I told them nerd so Kratos queue
Apollo and Kratos peel ours believe
everyone who knows what god of warriors
playstation ok basically i keep the the
relationship between this guy here who
knows netflix linkage ii okay basically
to to disciplic edge to gesso informatio
okay this guy has something in common
with you basically they try to use some
graph databases of that and i have the
last one that's a mood model what
multi-model means basically on oseco
provider has mod support modern one type
it's a moot model so our NDB support
graph and document cut base key value
and document so if it has bar to model
one type
it's a mooch model the trivial
relationship normally when you try to
use no sicko
you try to do analogy with the SQL
technology so let's take a look in this
structure if take a look and key value
that's the simplest one so I have the
bucket and a key value pair and the
document I have the collection the
document and the document has a topo
that's a key in value so he is the name
in value the information the surfing in
a column and no one guy she is just as
Cal has relationship so joins lefty
joins are the joints and the graph is
totally different so the first advice
you if I'd let you use no Seco don't try
to emulate SQL and ocq database because
the project gonna fail okay let's just
look in a single application if you are
using Java EE application with SQL
technology so I have JP a data standards
so I have JDBC data standards you so
what happened if I'd like to change my C
code to post we own the java application
what I need to do
yeah just I just need to change the
driver right so no codes to change
basically just a driver and imagine
imagine right now I mean using urban
native limitation and you like to use
open egb from patchy what I need to
change just the implementation because
the API going to be exactly the same
that's advanced a few standards but it's
not going to happen no sick application
because there's no stuttered there so if
I may use Cassandra and let you use
HBase I'm going to break me my towel or
my poster if I may use the moment it be
I'd like to use Couchbase I need to
change my my API is because it both has
different API we right now we have some
solution to solve this kind of stuff so
we have spring data who those bring data
oh nice and we have our Veneto Jim and
top link I will in spring the data is
the most famous one to solve integration
between no Seco in java application and
we have our bonito GM and top link
basically our Benes try to you the same
api the same JPA API to to connect with
no Seco database basically I have JP a
to connect with Cassandra to connect we
have mom DB this does sound a nice idea
because I don't need to learn a new API
but I have problem used that right
because JP a was not made to know sick
database so I cannot save as
synchronously I cannot save you CTL the
time to live in in all secure database
we have a lot of diversity in the
diversity really matter to us so if
every using Cassandra are you like to
use Cassandra query language
if every using Couchbase I'd like to use
like a query if you'd like I'd like to
use a large search a large search has
certain genes that I'd like to use and
so I mean using MongoDB Modi behaves
feature that just moong the be has so
specifically behavior a no sick database
really matter
that's a total different of the FQ
technology so the first channel
challenging on no sick technology is the
diversity because the reverse see really
matter so we have different types who
have different goals we have different
behaviors we have different proposals we
have different ways to communicate you
to communicate if no secure database so
have p2p webmasters live after different
ways to do that so to try to solve that
we create the jano psycho proposal so
they they the idea is okay let's have
two layers the first one going to be in
the mapping layer so something like JPA
does and in fact what you use and they I
have communication layers something that
database it does so I have two different
layers to want to and I kind I can do
divide and conquer
why that because I can have the no sicko
providers on one layer I can have the no
single providers working on
communication layer because they don't
succumb to no sicko providers just the
communication matter so this guy can
work just a communication layer and to
solution guys such as P photo with
spring Arvind age with redhead with
urban age just a mapping layer matter so
I can divide and conquer so these guys
can work together and different goals
and no low key because right now you're
going to have four different API so what
API two column one API few key value
or FBI to grasp and you want to be a
document so have four different api's to
try to solve four different documents so
what what happened with mooch motto if a
know singular abate has sport modern
type its modules to implement module
don't want type so codebase hair sports
a document addressed so it's must
implement document and graph the idea so
right now general Seco is I Eclipse in
foundation project so it's a dog dual
license so a party and a clip see the
idea is okay I have a comb API
oh no sicko but the the different
behavioral matters so I have extensible
I have extension to use this specific
behavior and why Diana were Artemis
basically my product my name so basic I
love history
so I puts name that is it our adventure
I have the communication layer the Diana
so I have four different api's let's
take just a really simple here I have
four different no SICU database so our
guy here our documents no Seco so I have
our remedy be I have multi be I have
codebase and I have already be if you
take a look the code they are totally
different right so I have the base
document to our MTB I have document
among to be but if you take look deeply
deeply they behavior going to be the
same because I have my collection and
let you put one document in the document
has a key value where the key is the
name and the value is the information
right so take a look here base document
age at a table so the beta tribute is
name in value the document append so
name value Jason put name value
a document feels David value so
basically what like to do is put a
document there so we don't need this we
just need a comb API to solve these
problems
so that's the whole idea so I created my
document entity and akavir created my
document that has name in value the key
value the topic and then put this
document in my entity and this API is
gonna implement that idea and also try
to solve the Nemec lecture because we
have a lot of literature to do the
exactly same thing so I have inserts
save delete with remove update merge
find search alert stuff the something
happened with time to leave so I have
long two seconds in two seconds long to
my seconds into my second so basically I
have different ways to do this Akal
something
oh that's a whole idea so I my Diane
approach has four different api's four
different STC keys that is technical
compatibility kit so I have mine that
database I have my API API there I
implement run my tck it's okay it's
going to support they don't make lecture
I try to use the same name macro tool on
the APA when I can and of course the
diversity really matter I will make sure
before so I have here my column entity I
created to create some columns so I can
save with multiple implementation so
spectral here my save API can save as
Cassandra HBase for example but I can't
wait extension in this case with
Cassandra because yes cassandra has
secured because the key out means
cassandra clare language so
merci really matter on oseco database we
have a lot of providers walking this
product right now so I have we have
Cassandra cut Bayes multi be Oracle
eight basil hello class
finca pork a lot of guys we have
communities work with us right now so we
have spring data guys we have some Java
Java Bahia a lot of Java C groups maybe
the future
this job is a group will give us
feedback about the - about the API okay
I make sure I have two layers
communication layer that's a Gianna and
Artemis basically is CDI + communication
layer basically the idea is okay let's
put mapping annotation and on my object
here and our time is gonna convert to
communication layer that's the whole
idea of Artemis so I can put a lot of
stuff here dynamic query so basically I
can do queries use using methods and
interface and Artemis can cared to do
this query to you I can put a lot of
events I can observe on even for them to
put be validation
ow I already mentioned before the
diversity really marital matter so I
have a lot of attention so in scale here
I put the unity a notation you Unity
means user defined type of course that
is not the the coma API that's the
extension API to Cassandra so just
concerned I can't stand you DT and the
something going to have with secure
because just Cassandra can send secure
because the key out means Cassandra
query language that is our roadmap so we
have some code proposal we are doing
this to to receive feedback from
community if
is work or not try to move a lot of
those psycho vendors solution windows
guys put us a kiss products you have
developed a lot a lot of code and then
created ideas are there da is too few
years so on the Java EE 9 but I'm not
sure Korea is so long time so I can't
oldest that's going to happen or not but
I hope so and we have a site so I have J
no secret art that can have a lot of
formation there we have all the code is
open source so you came for work you can
put star can go deeply in the codes of
open some issues please give us feedback
in this product so we have mail lists we
have year we also have week so if you go
to the general secret arc you can get a
lot information there okay that is it
so right now let's do a demo with Gino
Seco basically the idea is give a Java
project a Java version products let's do
an integration between Java and no stick
database in this case you are running
the Couchbase database so basically I'm
running Couchbase in the docker
container
so if you look here I'm running talker I
created a document document collection
of heroes the idea is to put heroes here
of course so let's go to my job
application I have my entity
so that's hero and my hero has some
eight routes such as ID name real name
age and powers and one person figure in
I appear different from SQL technology
is because and I'll seek work in storage
the entire collection it just want just
one document just one row if you going
to be a SEO technology you can see the
import import north from the APA but you
try to keep the SEM dimetric sure so
have entity we have ID
we have column there's something that
the Jaypee ever does we have our hero
empty and we have the hero research
basically the idea is okay have my hero
my hero model in let's put this model to
public as JSON and in the middle and
between the research and the JSON and my
model I created my presentation the idea
is to split what's going show to public
our jax-rs and my model so for example
would like to hide the real name because
the identity of the hero is secret I
can't remove remove this line here but I
think keep saving in the database and to
do this integration between my
application and the database we have the
my poster basically this guy is just on
interface that extend my hero hip my hip
holster this reporter is from our team
so basically I have a common comments on
the post our interface and then I quit
it and you want you
Meadows query so basically I can find by
name fun asier greater than and find a
here lesser then so I can delete by name
basically I created some reader to query
and delete just using no make secure the
madam so the art I'm just going to care
what left to us stick you here you want
to anything like and the foe hero a
pulsar
oh you don't post our implementation
because our times you wanna care to us
this implementation so let's return to
to my research so then see so I can find
by ID use my hand pole star and then
converts to my presentation and I can do
some queries a senior's Heroes test you
older than some age young heroes I can
save hero is post merit and HTTP and
update hero and of course delete hero so
basically I'm reusing just job II
technology stay glue here so just Java
EE technology anniversary Java EE 7 and
I mean running there are teams and as
mentioned before I have the driver the
guy gonna do the connection between
application and oseco so I just have to
on my application just got here just I
have the kind that's localhost and the
user and the password and
everything else and searches okay I'd
like to define my collection so
basically just using CDI so I created my
configuration to read the information
for the profits I created created my
factor and then I committed my manager
and my manager care the heroes document
collection so based on that and my he
posts our interface the items gonna care
every everything else just using CDI
okay another point is I'm using Tommy
sever and Tommy broke it plugging so I
came running as fecha and actually
that's what are you gonna do so
basically I compile the code using maven
and then run Tommy
okay that's running so fast by day to
make either and fast instead I create
some script so this idea behind the
screen should be basically I create some
post metals using curve so to save some
information there at the cloud base
right now let's empty let's do a refresh
show to you there's no information there
and let's run the script if with some
heroes and basically it's a post battle
battle so I'm going to save a large guys
a lot of heroes so right now we have
that
the breadwinner we know kept America and
hook have some heroes of course so
basically let's show some queries so I
can find my ID okay
just use get I can find some heroes
seniors and the zero is odors older than
turn two years old so Vince Camuto and
chala Natasha Romanov chief Rogers and
don't talk and I can find youngers done
some age so basically the idea is a
simple integration between Java and no
sequel database and of course with some
extension to use also the specific
behavior from a physicist database again
we have the website that J no secret art
oops so have some information here the
concept here to tell you about the
layers and some data be that we are
supporting right now some simple using
just the communication layer that's all
Diana and abstraction layer that map
layers and take our name so follow us on
Twitter tweets at Otago Java and the
product has a Twitter account data as
you know Seco that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
