well this is an ish ative Oracle that we
believe that in the mobile world java a
mobile should extend with the web
technology so which means that a java
runtime will be integrated with a web
contingent JavaScript engine it's about
three different topics one is a
JavaScript a web application can use
Java and then through java to get the
device information and the second thing
is for java developers through using jsr
290 and integration of WebKit we can
render a web content in an application
which before when that means you have to
product babe roster but now you can do
it in one application okay and the sort
of thing is more simpler okay is it's
not about a web page or anything is
something that you can use now oh it's
about rendering XHTML content in a java
application okay so this is a package it
called do it that you can free download
now and you can integrate with your
application they start soon ID basically
is a specification for java developers
on the name of this specification is web
UI so basically java application
developer can use this API in this
specification to basically rendered web
content so web pages used in
your mobile browser now so it is the de
facto standard so that is why we think
leverage and it will keep the
compatibility so this is very important
another reason we choose web p it is
this is open source and there's a full
function web engine so we would like to
leverage back now we believe that this
is good for developers in both
technology mobile java and technology is
for web developers through using this
nation of the technology they will be
able to access platform information for
example our gps or maybe a battery
information through java vm which is a
secure platform and proven on mobile so
we think this is good for the web
developers and for like mobile
developers or Java ME developers because
we integrated web kit under chase r290
so Java developers can use systrace are
and to leverage the ability of the
WebKit to render on fancy web content so
this why we think is good for developers
in both technology
