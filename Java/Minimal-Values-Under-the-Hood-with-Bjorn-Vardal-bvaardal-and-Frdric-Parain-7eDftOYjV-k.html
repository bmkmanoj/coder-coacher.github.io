squadron time King and my co-speaker is
the gun model from the j9 team at IBM so
today we start we speak about minimal
website from the Debian plasticky
in case you missed the following two
slides for the previous presentation you
have one more time to read it so very
time for or for it is very Killman for
the Valhalla project and for the German
perspective the verdict government and
only performance how to check that we
want to flatten from the table structure
so we have better spatial locality for
better cache efficiency we want or
thought we exploit immutability and wide
entities properties to enable nor did
optimization that we cannot always do
with object today if you are following
the Valhalla project there is a number
of documents named set of the values
that have been published they are
describing the project and the goals
with this very system mix of high level
semantics like no entity mutuality and
also some very low loader optimization
detailed how voltage could be broken
down in component on the stack how the
project will move forward will realize
that lower or not all these ideas could
be pushed into the Debian specification
in fact many of them were implementation
details so if we are preparing a spec
for the minimum value type you might be
surprised that some aspect of all types
require the state of the values document
then at the dinner table in the
specification it's just that we are we
are considering the unconditioned
details when promoting them but not
specifying them
if you were designed Eventide form for
new language from kids late to that much
much easier the fact is we are the one
tied to an existing already very complex
system the job at form is not only the
programming language as many of you know
where we are supporting multiple
languages but we also have a number of
features like JC's general GMT our
affection service abilities class
loading and loading I'm using lot of
them all this expect her impacted by the
traditional bank tight and loose
features are also in fronting the way we
are designing bank title we can support
them having new teachers to hydrothermal
code is already a tricky task so we are
really careful about not breaking it is
called a greeting optimization just to
put the voltage in so the goal of this
presentation is to explain why some
aspects of the German education
extension extension differ from the
initial design document we are I will
show you how the promisor optimization
are in turn noted even if they are not
visible from the state's perspective and
we also highlight some implementation
plans we are facing that make the ballot
a story not as simple and support we're
usually sort so MIT provides some of the
or the goal is to provide some of the
essential features of value types and as
Mauricio covered on Monday yeah we're
doing this without without language
support we're doing it with by code
spinning in that you can do by
cogeneration and Method handles so no
language support but we're hoping that
MIT is a step in the right direction but
the minimally part means we have to do
some kind of little side steps to make
it happen so how do we do value types
without actually doing value types we do
value capable capable classes and
Mauricio cover this a little bit on
Monday is value
for classes that you can define that is
currently valid Java source and then he
said that we do some interim VM magic so
let's do some magic so you get these
annotated Java classes they get loaded
in as reference types and we whenever
introduced are actually ends up asking
for for a value class we derived that
value class and it's completely up to
the JVM when that happens because
there's no initialization really
involved with it so we can do this
lately as we like in j9 we are
derivation works like this
well let's quickly cover first these are
the j9 class data structures so when we
get a class file we convert that into
what we call a ROM class which is really
just an intro a different data structure
representation of the same thing all
symbolic data and then we put a ramp
class on top of that which is the live
data and then we also need to tie in the
javelin class object so we we can
initially when we started working on
this problem we just said okay let's
let's create a second set of these data
structures the main reason for that was
because they were what it was that the
proposal for MIT said that these were
actually quite different like the DVC
had all the fields the VCC had all the
methods and with some relationship
between them but I suspect evolved we
realized that these are actually a lot
more similar than we thought so we try
the other ditch do we really need
anything other than just to javelin
class objects that so we have some
runtime distinction between the types
got a little bit complicated especially
in the j9 because we couldn't a lot of
the we had someone want to reuse some
code we need the distinguished are we
working on a reference type or a value
type so we ended up with this
representation where we basically have
class mirrors so essentially on the
class file
converted to a ROM class and we split it
into two views so that at runtime when
we for example try to do a get field we
know whether that gets field was
happening on a queue type or an L type
so simple to simplify going between
these two types
we're just typing together so now we
have pointers from the DVC to the VCC so
some implications of that the name is in
the ROM class so DBC and VCC ended up
having the same name that is not
according to spec but because there's
only we don't really expose that name
the only time you see it it's in the
constant pool we're able to work with
that
another question is what's the
superclass of the DVC well the rom class
says this java.lang object we don't
think that's true
currently we just say you don't have a
super type maybe it is object maybe it's
some kind of value super tight but it's
a bit of an open question now but it
works currently enjoying also for
example we can set the HSE value flag
the way we're supposed to because well
it's supposed to be set on the wrong
class while we're able to work around it
so in the constant role how do we we
discuss different ways of presenting or
representing your value in the constant
pool and we agree that we have to make
some changes to make it happen
but the question is should we for
example then so this is the current way
the classes are presented right do you
have a class that references a name but
do we then introduce value or do we
introduce some kind of generic type
constant that can be a value that can be
a reference that can be primitive but
deciding on correct constant pole
representation is not really essential
to getting this working so we said what
do we say to complex VP changes not
today and we all happily and without any
reservations agreed that the best
possible way this could ever be done is
name mangling so we have this notation
our constant class if it is acute I've
has the semicolon cue notation in front
of it and officially the name of the DVC
is the food dollar value part and then
the rest of it is an escape sequence and
as you can see we don't need that
semicolon when we talk about them in
descriptor in the descriptor the problem
with the constant class is that it
doesn't include that heist character
like L for reference type so a cube but
we needed a Q so we had the semicolon in
front because that's not valid in the
class name but in the descriptor for
example it becomes just Q per dollar
value so in j9 again as I mentioned we
don't actually have different names but
because both the prefix and suffix are
both predictable it's time ago and Q and
dollar value we just drop both and then
we can load the value capable class
which knows where the dry value class is
so we have what we need
when do you want to cover hot spots in
hot spot we're all doing the same
mechanic to delay to be why providing
class from the value caliber class that
we are doing slightly differently on
first touch of derive our cloud the JVM
just initiate the process of duration
from the value capable class we have a
Java helper to do that to the vehicle
back joy purposely the class order and
the value cathodic flattened argument
from the value table class the class
dojo help regenerate the byte array in
turning the definition of the deride
very class and then called fine class to
inject it into the fixon dictionary of
the JVM then desert Java hyper returns
than the JVM
perform a lookup from system to the
dictionary and great respond dua website
when they were valued class and then
from the association between the value
cattle class and the derived class so in
hotspot we have to completely click
independent metadata and they are
Lukie covered for with a reference from
the derived class to the very capable
class or do that very derivation process
is just walked around yeah because of
the minimal aspect of in modern site and
we do that among great support towards
the real work starts when we have the
value type when class is defined in the
end because this is where we can stop
automation the first optimization has
been fattening and the goal is to have a
better spatial locality especially for
rails and 32 we do the footprint by with
by removing pointers and hello today if
you have a lower object you are in fact
an array of pointers and each pointer
refer an object with the food hello
we need the hello because each object
each element of the array as on identity
and we need the hello to keep struggling
identity if we are here a value
advantage with one class at a point when
card would not have any identity so we
do not need the header to keep track of
diagonally of each element and the array
is emotional of the type of the same for
every element so we can factorize and
have type information only on so we can
fasten away have only the field of each
element store in the contiguous chunk of
memory and having the type information
between through the metadata of the
array itself it was very well with flash
point with just two fields that are int
but certainly it is not like that with
if we are looking at all the value type
here we are value types the key one is
along in the body the JVM we are to deal
with a language constraint for each type
to preserve preferences so the rail to
the array is one we are today we have to
add padding from time to time that
because some type of Ragman constraints
we have to to respect
we are we had it go from all the more
compactly I want to get rid of this
padding but none of them I've been to
complete so far if you look at the
second value class the t2 is a object
reference string in it you can idealize
on the DC harder before value type you
like what you see what very simple be
the way because primitive arrays have no
reference in them and object array are
only references now each array of one
side might need a special map from
information that had to DC to find where
the reference are because of the spread
across the world way to rank right by
definition are immutable but the
container the rate of feed containing
value types might not be immutable and
if they are not invisible
there is a risk of being too up having
cannot read and white but with each
viewing you still an arab equation right
now what we are almost convention with
is when we need some decoration site
information about either ethnicity
requirement for an available value type
or seasoning value type because the
depth the JVM might need to do some
special work to ensure that atomic added
are possible and the only the general
could decide resulting different
strategies like flattening anyway you
just want to be small and smaller than
the size of the atomic operations can
decide to not open any flattening for
big value types might result some cyclic
octo field or project so we have a way
to ensure authenticity of your date we
have some issue with 100 because vandals
are trying to do atomic operation
without without any preparation work on
the declaration size we have to work
with that we are continuing the language
which by some constant by the element
inside an array is at the rate sake so
it is still an open question do we need
to expand
the syntax other ways on earth all this
work our expression works and you don't
have this in minimal data types yet one
important question for us is eastern
region issue for you we'd like to have
your feedback about do you think this is
an issue for you or just don't care and
receive status so I won't go through
this these cycles again they were
covered on Monday but what I'd like to
point out here is that none of them
actually talked about they all talked
about behavior they don't at all talk
about implementation with respect to
data layout or backing storage or
anything like that so we could specify
that behavior of course but as we just
heard their implement the different
implementations have different
limitations so instead of specifying the
optimizations we want we just let the
specifications out of the capabilities
like you know identity immutability and
then we're free to do the optimizations
we'd like to do and in terms of J
Knights implementation that made the
starting point very easy because always
allocating all the heap is a completely
valid approach to this so we start off
there and then we add real value support
as we go along
so the first area where we wanted to add
real value type support would be the
flat on the race and the reason why we
want to do that is because that is that
is something that is shared with the JIT
so you could do a lot of optimizations
of the Java stack but it's not really
going to pay off as soon as you leave
the interpreter old elements are gone
and you only left what you had in the
heap so flatten the flap and raise
flatten fields so if we take that step
back and look at state of the values
what it actually said it suggested that
values should have a flat representation
on the on the Java stack and in
registers and it further suggested that
values on the stack should be broken
into their slot size components so a 3d
point of
three intz will then get stored in three
slots so let's explore what that would
look like so we have a value class
record it has int height width and depth
and the what record add will then push a
record our on yeah in record add record
our would pull will be pushed onto the
stack as an argument to DB associate and
then it also pushes a string so the
field wise pushes will look like this so
you get the slot for each so the fact
that the if you're not familiar with a
the Java stack here basically the
pending pushes so we push height width
depth string and because depending
pushes and the arguments both deal with
a fixed sized slots we just use those
pending pushes as the arguments into the
method we're invoking so DB associate
also knows about record so it says oh
yeah I'm expecting a record and that
should be those three imps so that's all
good it expects the right thing
unfortunately it's really easy to break
because what if we recompile record with
a new field like weight and obviously I
hope adding a field to a value class is
a compatible change so record add now
we'll push for in and see yeah so for
ins and then so the extra weight and
then the string yes at the end but DB
associate still only expects to three
because it wasn't recompiled so we could
try to solve this we could try to have
some kind of runtime resolution of value
types and we say where you ask a value
type for its descriptor string and slam
that into the into your method
descriptor but it starting to sound like
the approach suggested by state of the
values wasn't really the best
Ellucian definitely a costly one so
Freddy want to talk about some
alternatives for the work of the third
design kept busy for months and so we
are trying to explore many different
solutions we just saw that the neighbor
project just pushing them and the stack
would elevate it working by separate
application we we mark with we could add
some adjustment processes at one time to
deal with the situation that the cost
were quality so we explore other
alternative light using bigger excite
search but for any reason in earthside
third you will always find a value size
of bigger and doesn't eat and it was an
issue for some other platforms to
support which has we are tied with such
a big size of all these floats we're
just not acceptable for them let's
explore viable site flood and the other
side good good work we'll do the high
complexity here especially pool
interpreter and cycling viable sites not
trying to do a dirt or sweat operation
it becomes very very complex but then we
realize that the way the value are
handled on the stack ingest in fact an
accommodation detail you don't have to
speak he fight to eat just fate
let's set the design specification
consider all values only need one Scott
on the stack we do decision the
specification of byte code verification
rules and stack map a flag state becomes
much easier even the generation of code
and stack Maps is much easier even if
the state fails once wrote on strike the
JDL incremental are still free to
implement thread design of the toys they
just have to be compliant with the
semantics to the behavior that it means
that we are giving up to the scale
placement the fact of broken down the
values of the components
of course not in fact this work will be
handled by the deep compiler and we see
that in this presentation we're doing a
lot of work
so the D compiler could do that as much
as possible so now we present the
transit we done to the interpreter in
the head by diem for the first step of
course was to support a new bytecode and
the fuel rod by code without impacting
governance of existing ones when we look
at optimizing the interpreter event ID
and fortunately the hot pot interpreter
can only see one vital as time which
significantly limited the possible
position so we end for enjoy great
optimization if you cannot optimize
interpreter mainly interpretation do
something that we help another feature
of the JVM and we decide to implement of
hip allocation for value table of values
on stack and local Bibles and here the
goal is to reduce the workload on this
is by avoiding heap allocation from the
interpreter don't give the students
because values can have reference of
them if you are not careful and putting
value values outside of this Java heat
but the GCC has managed them you just
had externally the Java heap so you have
to be careful focusing on structure
local variables
allowed us to have three local
management and recycling
abiding global version father so like
just like j9 the very first
implementation divided in a spot we are
using the single skirt on the stack to
thorn and direction to value allocated
in the Java heap because we were unjust
in the data heap we had to follow the
rules of the GC so we have a header so
the value can be managed by the DC but
this is not a box value if you still run
type with all the semantics of the value
and not on an object then we had a
logical buffer so now the and Direction
can either be induction to the data heat
to a photo caliber fault
frederica buffer allocation our
performances like in collapse by
incrementing pointer the management of
the certified buffer is performed with
with the frame based on the per method
frame base in each time a new frame is
created on the stack remember where the
allocation pointer board our friend can
reference values from a parent frame or
can I'll get new ones are getting to the
buffer if not mandatory you can still
aggregate values on the data heat the D
allocation is pretty simple because we
are managing with a per method frame
phase when we are removing a frame we
know where was the limit where the
allocation for this given frame started
so we know all the value beside this
threshold are the values and we can
collect them the ones that will be
corrected by the GC later righty
slightly more complex scenarios one you
want to reach some value in this case we
have to move the value just after the
threshold so the color can continue to
allocate values the bank cannot enter
the counter we did not want to for each
thread to have to allocate a static
photographer because just like
excellences tag we want talking much
more dynamic what we did is we
implemented a global memory pool for all
threads and each thread is building its
own photographer by taking pages from
this global pool so the thread local
buffer is not a continuous piece of
memory or a linked list of pages taken
from the global pool we are trying to
avoid too many global operations so we
are not returning edges to the pool
immediately we are rather local cache of
one page so it's really depressing
boundary of two pages who can avoid
going to fetch our wish on page
supercool two of em if all the of all
the pages from the Gobert pool I've been
used and thread tried to advocate as I
get a new one to get a failure and the
value cannot be buffered so we just
report back to the surrogate it in the
Jura heat the hot spot you can cite
values in value format there aren't
delicate you find them with the header
followed by the field just to be to get
the uniformity of all yogic located in
the Jura heat so DC do not need to be
modified to handle them but there are
still too tight they are not airtight of
the allocation and performance
interpreter we will rather the header is
still something very useful just
constant to keep a class pointer to
prevent the GC from unloading the body
classes are dealing with finally we keep
a header with same size as the one in
the data heap which has an advantage
which is to interpret record event time
most of the time can deal with one child
without having to consider whether they
have been allocated because they're
exactly the same offset for the field of
deep allocation bottom of the Jeep
values are broken down into pieces on
register and start it with the deed
program button values in a rate of field
to be in front values with a loot header
packed
if we need the top information while
retrieving it to the metadata of the
container anything so now we figure out
jetty port in the noble type the goal
listen
the first goal was to support all the
features selected by code but the new
data layout of coming from happening the
preferring the position but also just to
get started then the focused on
optimization and the first one was
passing values very tight in registered
in tech and visual images as possible
because we do not we do not have to
return identity the GTA also trying to
avoid heap allocation it's going to
remove or avoiding boxing from the
deriving type to the value K level class
and always important avoid a good
version for tight belt for code not
using value tight so this section is
employed by the valid compiler team
thank you for the side and the world did
so to be a fat man from worker from
Western and from head Red Hat and Jordan
module from co-worker and from
unfortunately the atmosphere today so
here an example with regular July class
each holding a complex and we have
measured composure just perform a person
simply portion with this data class if
you look at the code generated by c2 for
the complete bottom a so you see a very
complex code you can see that here the
scape analysis has not been able to
detect that the allocation well not
necessary so each branch of the code you
can see some allocation and you have
some load operation to get the feeds
from the allocated objects now we are
changing the code very very small change
to 32 byte type so it is not minimal
side project you are using here
experimental what a drastic compiler but
allows us to directly type and code with
very types is much more convenient we
have to compute body size method which
is almost similar to the computation it
shall be afield before if we look at the
code generated by T 2 for the complete
bedside methods we can see something
much simpler
we are the notation we don't even have a
lot of persons everything in inverse
register this is what you can achieve
with very tight
we do try to avoid education we die on
the property of no identity all
connected and not suppressing they did
that by introducing a newer presentation
in the RFC to and by building completely
neutralization taking advantage of those
properties inside see two vectors are
treated at identity that aggregate and
each field can be passed at optimized
individually so they are not trying to
take escape analysis by using value type
is like the optimizing verified by
themselves without using a scale values
at all the still if you can see where
the rigid needed some allocation and
some point when calling a method with
the right type in angle ins are written
in a bank type and organizing and when
working to non threatened see doorway I
will speak about the first two and oh
they solve this problem this problem the
problem of planning method and flashing
an argument is the interpreter is
respecting a single float with an
aversion to an allocated by night but
the compiled code would prefer to have
everything in registered which is much
more efficient for it by totally between
register they're avoiding allocations
and store and load operation persons on
code boundaries which make a huge
difference
the solution is one we have a method
with value type argument what is the
compiled will never been compiled in
fact as a slightly different signature
internally which is made of the
individual fields of the value type this
way this field can be passed in
registers fortunately in hotspot we
already had some adapters for calls
because the interpreter and the compiler
have slightly different coding
conventions so the modifier we expand
the adapters turned on the schedule
white height
so when comparison is cutting
interpreted measured initially order the
value had been broken down register the
fee to adapter we allocate very tight
filter field would form value from the
filter field values in registers and
then when the interpreted method starts
execution it has a little downside
available when an interpreter method is
coding compile code within your budget
the i2c adaptors take field form
delegated value type and load them into
register so the compiler that can run
with all everything orbiting registers
of course on the compiled methodical in
compiling code interpreted or insulin
interpreted referred you have no depth a
Shinto to make sure we are boarding
education not or loading written already
that has been our most challenging
problem the reason for that is we did
not have adaptors for returning values
for return from drive some some problem
interpreter want refer or any direction
to help able tide cycles once we turn in
registers
without adaptors we took a radical
decision that very tart are now always
returned in registers even put
interpreters it has a used code for the
suppressor but it allows the compiled
code which is the most important one to
be morticians and is always the work of
the interpreter to rebuild value type
from values in time from killing
registers is needed the problems had to
reconstruct the event type for until in
registers you need to know to know the
type exact type of the right type that
uses get it from the signature of the
Kali and fortunately not because in the
method under linkers the signatures is
erased so the neutron Convention has one
more argument
so when we're returning from a biker the
first thing we find which is the the
portal to the class of the value type in
return so we enter a class pointer
interpreter can be built the right type
when we are returning from interpreted
code the first argument is in fact the
indirection to the already existing
educational type equal simply returning
to interpreter can avoid creating a new
very tight the challenges of the
comparison has been detected to evaluate
the communication because we had we were
expecting from crash we had no code no
use cases very limited code very limited
tests were - with everything we cannot
we use anything in listing we had
limited benchmarks to see the
performance now where you are we are
from benchmarking with getting some very
amazing wizard method handle chains are
being a very hard thing for them for
them to optimize the middle the method
handle chain is due to the fact that
lambdas are arranging signature so the C
compiler is wracking type information to
perform the optimizations did a used
work in situ less than the type system
the column convention is the really
really huge work the limitation so far
we are that we all need about 886 64-bit
not all CG optimization available though
it will see one support which means if
you are enabling value type you won't
get the compilation not all simple
physics are supported and most of our
internet tests are relying on our
incremental data and we are not using a
minimal value type in most of our tests
we live so before I continue I believe
there were some slides missing in here
about array flattening so if you're
interested in
caring about j9 work on that we can
maybe talk about that in the workshop
later today so MIT it takes a step
closer closer to value types in the JVM
but the still more that is needed before
we get to full valhalla value type
support we will look at a couple of the
areas that are more they're not really
an MBT but that we are exploring
instance field flattening applies to
both object fields and value feel so
flattening a value field it's similar to
the way that we do that you have a
superclass because the same way that
when you load a class you need to load
the superclass to get the food layout
from it because you're supposed to
inherit that the same thing actually
happens when you try to flatten the
field because you need to load that type
as well to figure out how to drop the
field layout from your value field into
your own field layout so in terms of our
field layout we we could optimize for
density we could say I'd like the
problem we saw earlier with the arrays
where you suddenly get a lot of padding
because you needed to align the Long's
at the beginning of the value type but
there's a single byte at the end so lots
of padding you could optimize for that
shifting surround them and fill in all
the padding holes but that would be a
really bad hit on performance so so they
we don't do that we take the whole value
lay a few layer at the value class feel
layout and drop it right into the into
the rest of the field layout for that
object the static fields are not
flattened that gets too expensive when
you try to load a class and it
immediately starts loading all those
skills with instance fields you can
delay that at that event so as we talked
about before before the flow the
specifications for MBT and also probably
the specifications for value for full
value types
it doesn't require this
I doesn't require flatten fields it's up
to the implementer whether you do it and
how you do it
so let's take a quick look at the j9
approach to this if we start off without
any value types if we have a very simple
class hierarchy with a few fields in
each class
j9 we'll do the following it will start
off with the 64-bit values in the fuses
so the fields for 64-bit values and then
we'll put the references the middle
because they could be 64 they could be
32 and then follow that with the 32-bit
values and so where are the rest of them
where the 16 and 8 actually j9 doesn't
do that
j9 the smallest field you get an object
layout is actually a forward so the way
this will look then is that you get you
get your if for instance of C you get
your header you get the lot of the long
J and then you get your string s and
then at the end you get your your single
in and now we're not ADA lined not
really a problem because when B comes
after it doesn't need lineman so we get
a couple of bytes there now we're still
not aligned and C actually requires it
to be aligned so we get a little piece
of padding in there the side effect of
the way this is done is that you will
ever only ever have one padding because
we keep rolling it in as we if we can
but where's the values fit into this so
what we do is if we look at a if we look
at a similar example but with the value
so we have this value point 3 D with 3
Long's X Y Z and then class a has a
field that we'd like to flatten an
instance of B that extends a we'll start
off the same way we get the 64 bit value
you get your 32 bit int then you and
then now we have a similar issue as
before except that we suddenly get it in
the middle of a and that is that we're
starting with only starting over again
with 64 bit values so now we need to
align in the middle
of the field layout so we pad after the
32-bit value and we start over again the
64-bit and then when we get to the byte
from B we put it at the end or we could
get smart and put it into the padding
right
so now we speak about a few work in
progress or just expulsion I with more
thinking about the problems and the
solutions that we don't have the
solutions yet value ties in the long
term we even Felicia both methods so
we've no doubt about that
they will live on for the support
interface but we don't know yet which
can interpretive we will be able to
support the current of services do we
need a new tack on surfaces is still
question because we have a lot of issues
right now with the relationship between
interfaces and dragon design and object
so many people think that with the
passage of subclasses of the round
object because they're both the method
in fact no and the toughest cannot
exchange a class but in the JVM
specification there is some specialness
obliteration world that stage that
predict non-static method of junk object
but always without successfully when you
are dealing with an interface
unfortunately the mount is method we can
fight way notify modify all which have
no meaning for value types who do not
have an identity if you load senator and
all the semantics enter faces at transit
considered a site which is an issue for
two types the royal tax we also have
issued with different methods because
the body of the different methods expect
the receiver to the an object and
we are also working on one cart and
generate code today general code is data
on a razor and so everything is handled
as subjective or during object but very
tart are currently not subclasses of
junk object we not only they will be on
at open question to their honor and get
a bit take here so there is an search
for new tripartite object or something
else do we need a super title already
tight do we need to support ID for
everything object line type which be
printed type would be nice if it's
feasible worth working on it so use of
generate and super tight my theorem some
GT optimization passing value the values
in registers only work is the caller and
the callee agreed on an exact type if
you're using a super type or journey
type you cannot perform this kind of
initiation anymore the comparison is
really trying to solve each problem with
lambdas because the problem exists in
numbers too if you want to get involved
there is not many lists on up angelica
the regional repository where you can
download the the first part resource and
forget to switch to the MVT branch
otherwise you won't get Valhalla bit in
the long tradition of the any question
whether you the page of is a huge list
of the options you can pay me we hope
most of them won't arise the project but
so thank you very much if you have any
question whether or 45 minutes why don't
again thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
