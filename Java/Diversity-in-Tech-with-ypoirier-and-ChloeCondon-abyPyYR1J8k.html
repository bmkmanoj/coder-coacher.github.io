an evangelist right good fresh okay so
but you didn't start that way so so what
did you do before yeah so before I was a
developer evangelist I actually got my
undergrad in theater performance both of
my parents were artists I had a
playwright director for a father and a
costume designer for a mother so the art
seems like a pretty you know reasonable
thing to go into and actually what ended
up happening was after I graduated with
a degree in theater I worked a lot of
day jobs in tech so I was an office
manager I was an executive assistant so
I was working at startups but I really
wanted to learn how to code and I
actually saw talk at Google where they
were talking about getting more young
women involved in tech by adding more
characters to Nickelodeon and Disney
Channel shows and I was sitting there in
the talk I was totally 25 thinking well
where was this when I was a kid I would
have loved to have done this and my
partner is a Android developer so when I
mentioned to him you know it's too late
for me he went actually you can still
learn so I ended up studying on my own
and I went to hacker bride Academy which
is an all-female software engineering
boot camp and many months later I am
here congratulations because that's a
and so did you did you have a formal
training done or or you just like
studied but it so tell us more a little
bit of about us yeah so I am I was
performing as an actor for many years
kind of got to a point with it where I
got a little bored and I started
studying on my own I started with Swift
I kind of started the difficult way and
then I went I learned from a bunch of
resources like team treehouse use code
Academy and I'm very much a structured
person so it was very hard to be
disciplined because I was working 9:00
to 5:00 Monday through Friday and
spending all of my evenings and weekends
when another code so when I heard about
these boot camps that were popping up
all over the Bay Area I started looking
into hack reactor and app Academy and
hack right their mission statement of
changing the ratio of women in tech just
really resonated with me so hack write
is a 12-week software engineering boot
camp
in the city full-time so I quit my job
and got into a crate was accepted to
hack right and my completely changed my
life
so any any recommendation for people who
have who may be like wondering I can can
can I learn code and can I mean how
should I start how should I go about it
yeah so I think learning the code anyone
can do it I definitely think you have to
have a passion for it for sure the best
advice that I can give personally is I
think a lot of people are intimidated
especially if they get started later in
life like myself but you know many many
kids now are learning to code in
elementary school and it can be very
intimidating to go to some of these high
school hackathons where everyone knows a
lot more than you but I benefit actually
to coming into tech a little later is
having that experience and I think
diverse candidates are really
interesting because I come to the
software engineering world with a
theater background and as you know
engineers don't really like talking in
front of people very much so I'm a very
rare person who knows how to code but
also really loves speaking with people
and speaking in front of people public
speaking is something that it's hard to
find developers who like to do that
similarly in my hack write cohort there
were some women who had worked in
education or they knew a lot about
mapping or you know all of these very
interesting backgrounds that you can
actually apply that to computer science
I actually think it gives you a leg up
in a really cool way yes absolutely like
diversity is very important I mean and
diversity also for building software
right because I mean not I mean end
users are not necessarily developers
right so at the end of the day it makes
a big difference
want to comment on that sure yeah I
think that a lot of times when we talk
about diversity um we always assume race
and gender but I think that diversity
can also come in the form of background
I know just coming I'm a very strong
advocate for boot camps I know there's a
lot of like we interviewed a boot camp
grad once and it didn't go well
but you know not all boot camps are
created equally and I think that if you
really want to hire diverse candidates
because I always see these talks that
they're like where are these candidates
they don't exist these magical unicorns
who you know are diverse but
they're they're very much trying to get
through the front door and something
that I say a lot to companies is a lot
of times the application process
especially for junior engineers like
myself when I was entering the workforce
are kind of a barrier to entry for
people with diverse backgrounds because
oftentimes a recruiter will be given you
know a list of things like okay they
need to know Python they know JavaScript
I personally can check off those two
things but I don't have a computer
science degree and I think that if you
make certain limitations on the
credentials that you want for someone
coming in you're really limiting the
amount of diversity you can you can
bring in so I'm a huge advocate for
could you talk to a lot of developers
and they they're self-taught or you know
they don't come from that traditional
Stanford background so I'm a huge
advocate for for non-traditional
education non-traditional backgrounds
getting more cool exciting products out
there because the more people like
myself I mean I know personally I really
want to make a lot of technological
advances in the theater industry since
everything is on paper so and also
getting that artistic I just in in the
technical world I think can be valuable
you can be and you don't have to code
you could be a designer you can there's
so many different you know stage
managers are basically product managers
so there's a lot of really cool avenues
for from the arts specifically that you
can go but I think this applies to all
backgrounds yeah I so agree with that I
mean we tend to segment also our alive
right so with like hobbies and then like
engineering or work and sometimes like
we can find out actually ways to merge
that all and to make it more interesting
for yeah I'll say that as an actor
performing on stage I never got to come
to NASA but now I get to perform on
stage and come to Napa so I kind of get
to put the two things that I love
together thank you so much Chloe thank
you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
