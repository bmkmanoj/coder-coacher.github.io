all the sensor nodes I have nine sensor
nodes connected to the network this is
live data I can also have some graphs
where I can see the last week the data
of the of the sensors and I created this
little radar chart where I can switch
through the days and see the behavior of
the the temperature here you see how it
was outside I just see it's and you see
it's quite responsive and and works
quite good so this is you can also see
that one next week all right geek on I
would show it I have the same one
running on my on the watch and on iOS
device and also on my cue box I it's
running right now I'm let me see if I
can just fill it up you see here's the
same demo right now because you see the
difference is the the screen orientation
is different from the nexus 7 but it
runs exactly the same code and on the
cubox I it's also really fast I have the
for the Raspberry Pi and I have no demo
at the moment I have a code but there I
have to really restructure the menu I
don't have this radial menu and all that
stuff because the animations on the pyre
just too slow I used a different
approach where have a more simple you I
don't have this fancy animated menu just
another one but yeah you can use it on
all these devices and I'm really
fascinated by the idea using the same
code everywhere it's really good even on
the watch which has just a very small
very small display if I use the same
code just the graphics code is different
just the layout of the controls is
different but the everything else is the
same yeah it's really it's awesome I
love it really good stuff
so is there anything else we can talk
about I think hacking doesn't make sense
right there's nothing special i can
teach people most of them no more than
me all right well for folks on IRC or or
Twitter shout-out and let us know I've
been Ivan I'm hacking the background
here let me cut this one again yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
