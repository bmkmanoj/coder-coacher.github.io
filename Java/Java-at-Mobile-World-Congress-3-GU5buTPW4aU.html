technologies and the Java ME this
technologies were adopted by more and
more mobile devices in this booth we
collected a lot of demos from the
isolates all of work the first one I
would like to throw as for the fill the
max made by experience this application
actually has a client and a server the
client is running on a mobile phone
which can be used by the sales man
infield and the server side is running
on a browser normally on the pc and the
management of geyser will use the server
tools to manage the data collected by
the salesman in the field the second
application is caught zephyr which is
made by a company called coupling and
this software can be used to listen to
some to rock band music and in this
software the banned list can be updated
and is synchronized with the server
downloaded and listen to it zephyr use
air WIP which we read the loot to
implement its UI so this is very easy to
adopt such kind of application the third
man is called snap to in this
application it integrates a lot of daily
used web applications including Facebook
tutor RSS news and blogs NM AP weather
services they can get any useful
information from their mobile device no
matter where they are
what I'm demo here is about the Java
plus well this is an ish ative Oracle
that we believe that in the mobile world
java our mobile should extend with the
web technology so that which means that
a java runtime will be integrated with a
WebKit engine javascript engine it's
about three different topics one is a
JavaScript a web application can use
Java and then through java to get the
device information and the second thing
is for java developers through using jsr
290 and the integration of WebKit we can
render a web content in an application
which before when that means you have to
pull out very browser but now you can do
it in one application ok and the sort of
thing is more simpler ok is it's not
about a web page or anything is
something that you can use now oh it's
about rendering XHTML content in a java
application ok so this is a package it
called do it that you can free download
now and you can integrate it with your
application java developers can use
estrellas are and to leverage the
ability of the WebKit to render on fancy
web content so this why we think is good
for developers in both technology
