Network as the java community manager
and i'm joined by anton araboth how you
doing man good good good I see you all
over the world at different conferences
today we're instead of yes today we're
in Malmo Sweden I think I think you were
at javaone last week last week es I'm
still under the weather after trouble
yeah me as well this is this is not my
best forum but yeah we re cool industry
guys so what do you think about or dev
is a conference what's your what's
what's the the professional speakers
opinion of the conference is Swedish
conference the confidence is really cool
I I like the style of the conference the
venue is really great I also liked the
format of the jokes they're shorter not
the full hour but 40 minutes 40 minutes
and you are supposed to finish in 30
minutes actually oh really or 35 and
that one me to meet you i just realized
that but it's yeah it's really great so
far yeah yeah no I like it and you know
we get the free pinball machines during
the breaks and they do a good job with
the food and the bands in the evenings
yeah yeah yesterday we had summer and
playing yeah really cool music so cool
and you're chatting here about Java
agents so tell me a little bit about the
topic which you have premiere me I just
had a talk a few minutes back about Joe
agents it's called taming Joe agents
it's basically an overview of the
technology the java agent technology
that is in jdk yeah that provides the
hook into the class loading so that you
can transform the classes the way you
like when they are loaded either and
startup time or after the fact by
attaching to some remote machine and you
know changing the behavior of the
classes some probably fur for you guys a
terrible this is an important hook to
kind of instrument stuff on the fly yes
I guess it's an important in the
important hook for pretty much everyone
who is in tooling space let's say if you
are doing application performance
monitoring your pretty much
using Java aging technology to hook into
the application oh I think like all all
the modern monitoring tools are actually
Java agents they're obviously terrible
also any of the profilers would also use
this technology I know that some mocking
frameworks are also using that by Jane
market or power mach opr agents Rafael's
fight buddy well it uses for testing yes
in like for testing itself all right for
testing itself it actually spins it
starts a java agent within the process
and then doing some magic there nice
yeah so yeah if you find any bugs in the
java agent framework which you've had to
report back to the boiler don't you
stable machines you so the good fact is
the deck technology is pretty stable the
bad fact is that it's not actually
developed further it's the API so stable
it hasn't been changed for years now
yeah and now new features are being
added so for instance very annoying in
fact when you are developing Java age
and you have to repackage it every time
when you add new functionality you can
get around but then you have to build
some kind of an abstraction within a
with your base asian so that it would be
loading your classes from where from the
disk somewhere from the disk right but
generally you would have to repackage
everything every time you want to make a
change Wow and jerebo doesn't help their
sub hahaha sorry yeah yeah so Eddie like
what was the focus of your toss to help
people learn how to use the job agent
framework or well the dusk is thought to
myself is to get people interested in
the technology yeah uh to go and try and
research more about it so basically I
give an overview of the existing
commercial tools first without any demos
I just show like what what they are
doing what kind of cool stuff is there
and then I'm showing one open source
project that is called bite man by jboss
because it's open source you can
actually go there and check out the
sources and play with it and maybe
experiment by changing the sources and I
have a few small demos that demonstrate
different aspects like glossary
definition transforming like adding
traces to the execute the program the
running program and yeah this way I just
you know give the introduction like it
doesn't go deep so it's it it can be
grasped from by everyone if you don't
have enough base to actually for this
topic then it's pretty introduction
everyone okay but a good way for folks
to get exposed to it I found that
getting too deep basically shrinks the
audience and yes may be appropriate for
like the JVM language summit or a
language implementer com yeah rather
than just a general attendee conference
right cool zactly so what's your what's
your next event after this ahh num
actually oh you're taking a break I'm
taking a break for a few months so maybe
I nation will be somewhere similar in
spring somewhere it's spring maybe uh
maybe your own conference in Estonia it
will be in summer summer geek out is
coming up June number nines yeah now I
remember you guys had very nice
conference took good care of the
speakers had excellent coffee at the we
hope to make it even better this year
big plans new Thank You bigger crowd Wow
more speakers you know yeah cool sounds
exciting I'm looking forward to it
alright thanks a lot for the short
interview so I don't know if I've given
you one before but as a ages ago ages
ago as a
speaker on the night hacking program you
get a night hacking sticker exclusive
benefit of embarrassing yourself on the
live stream all right thank you and I
hope you enjoy the rest of your time
here in Malmo Sweden definitely thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
