the night hacking dot-com stage here at
haka garden space in the box village in
2016 with me is fellow java champion dan
allen hi dan how are you are you doing
so then what do you do on your daily
work oh my god what do I do merge pull
requests great issues respond a mailing
list posts no I I'm really trying to
engage with people as much as possible
in development a big believer in you
know in community engagement so a lot I
mean honestly a lot of what I do is is
communicating with people working with
people collaborating with people you
know I find time at night to do my own
hacking but you know what I really enjoy
is getting people involved alright so I
ya ass a java champion what else do you
do as part of the community so one of
the things I really like Java and being
a Java champion is important to me
because I I don't like language silos I
don't like when someone's written a
program and it's a really great program
but they're like oh that's Python
program and I and I right pearl or I
like Ruby or I like JavaScript and we're
all like not able to collaborate so i
said before collaboration is very
important to me and to have that shut
the conversation down it's like you're
in a conversation with someone you know
and they're telling you about something
interesting you find out what language
is it and then all of a sudden what it's
not interesting we need to have a way to
have all ideas percolate you know and an
intermix and I think the JVM is the
perfect opportunity for that in the ask
a doctor project I truly believe that it
leverages this and it almost
demonstrates the extent to which we can
do this because we work in various
languages and we can write we can write
plugins in one language and use it in
another language and a lot of that is
enabled by the JVM so I'm kind of a the
polyglot champion if you will within the
java community but i also live it and so
i'm not just saying it would be really
cool I came here because I was very
frustrated by the fact that we can have
two programs that can't work together
and so even though sometimes I'm off the
JVM like I'm doing Ruby stuff and I use
Ruby the severs
Ruby to do a lot of the ASCII dr.
development I know I'm going to be able
to use it on the JVM and I know we'll be
able to use even things like ask you dr.
jay s which is the javascript
implementation I know that we'll be able
to be used on jvm and we test it on the
JVM so I like the fact that i can leave
the JVM and do other stuff but I can
come back so that that safeguard for me
is and that option is critical awesome
well thank you very much dance for this
inside and thank you various for
watching see you next time all right
great thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
