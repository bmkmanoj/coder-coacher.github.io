hacking stage of Java one Heather van
Kyra and we are having a panel
discussion about Java EE java ee being a
big topic of discussion recently in the
last few months so at javaone this year
we've had some updates on what's going
on so I wanted to ask our panelists a
few questions to give the community an
update so we have Linda hey Linda I have
our subpoenas all right so first
question I wanted to ask Linda and then
we also have Patrick current chair to
JCP mark littell hi mark I have a so
what's going on with Java EE we've had
the community's been a little anxious
about Java EE and we've been discussing
it in the JCP executive committee
meetings if you've been looking at the
summaries and following what's been
going on we've been discussing what's
going on with java ee for the last few
months so there was some big news here
at javaone this year you want to just
briefly share with us sure yeah we had
some great announcements here at javaone
as well as some detailed talks I guess
the big news is that we are again moving
forward with java ee 8 we're making a
few changes in our agenda for java ee 82
better orient towards our goals around
support for cloud and micro services so
for java ee 8 we're doing a little bit
of a refocus for some of our Jas ours a
bit more emphasis in jax-rs on clients
reactive client api's and circuit
breakers and then we're beefing up our
agenda for the security jsr with support
for OAuth and open ID and we're adding
we planned to file to new jsr s1 in the
area of configuration which will be
important to externalize configuration
for apps that run in cloud-based
environments
and in complement with our circuit
breaker work we also plan to introduce
an API for health checks those are all
in the context of Java EE and then in
parallel with our Java EE eight work we
plan to launch work on a longer term
more ambitious agenda for support of
cloud and micro services in java ee
night so the java e9 work is intend to
leverage what we do with java ee eight
but that will start in parallel so that
work will be ramping up much sooner than
we would normally do with the jsr well
that's a lot shaken so that's good news
i from the people i've talked to it i've
gotten positive feedback about being
able to continue the work on the jrs so
mark you are an executive committee
member and active also with red hat on
several of expert groups what's your
perspective on this news it's good news
I mean we've always believed that Java
EE forms a critical backbone of
enterprise middle where it's grown there
over the last 20 years and despite the
fact that there are these new waves of
cloud and mobile and micro services we
still think that Java EE can play a
critical role there it may have to
evolve in some of the directions that
you know we've just heard but we
shouldn't be thinking about throwing it
out of the way and starting can scratch
that doesn't do anybody any good there's
a lot of good experience good
implementations would cure effort
inspect and implementations that are out
there that we need to build on and cee
continue forward is it's going to be
good for the industry as a whole and I
can I add that of course a Red Hat has
to tjs ours in our plants for the java
ee platform namely CDI 20 which we find
instrumental in contributing to ease of
development java ee and bean validation
20 which was just recently filed but
will also be in addition to the Java
platform so we were very glad to see the
bean validation from forward I can say
that in the hacker garden so we've been
in a hacker garden all week that CD I as
well as being validation have been two
of the most popular topics so we've had
respect for CDI here he's waving his
arms wildly at the moment Antoine a
Antoine we're talking about you yeah all
right you come up and say hi if you want
you can wave to everyone okay so the
plan is that java ee 8 is actually going
to be finished end of this calendar year
was that way well um our target is java
one next year we think we can execute on
that agenda and so okay so at nick's
javaone next drop of one all right
Antoine I'll say hi to everyone so we
have the CDI speckling you're just
talking about CDI to point out being
instrumental for java 8 I want to say hi
to the folks what you've been working on
we are working on finishing CDI too so
the release of the CTI two should be
January fit me from was writer
plant go for a cute one to be ready to
add a respect for Java 8 &amp;amp; 9 have to be
fought I want to hear more about that by
the way yeah that's that's why we're
here in the hacker garden so we can work
all these things out right the community
coming together and working on the plans
and getting the different perspectives
from the community members of expect
leads everybody working together that's
how the JCP works and you're always here
you're one of my favorite spec leaves
thank you alright so we'll throw Patrick
a question now he's okay to episode
Patrick so from your perspective as
chair of the JCP how do you see things
moving forward and are you pleased with
this announcement and I'm very pleased I
had some concern like everybody else six
months ago back when it seemed like we
had a whole bunch of jrs that were not
making a lot of progress and obviously
the main purpose of the JCB is to help
and to enable people to develop
technologies and to promote them and to
standardize them and when it seemed that
Java EE was kind of going slowly that
was not a good thing but now I'm very
pleased obviously we're going to have a
bunch of existing jrs will weaken
revving up again we'll have some new
ones and now we have an opportunity to
do what we like to do which is to go out
and talk to people and explain to them
how they can get involved through
adopted ASR or other means we also have
new membership classes that we've just
introduced so we have a new associate
member class which is a very easy way
for individual developers to join the
JCP and to nominate themselves to to
work on a particular jsr in a way that
they can do something less complicated
and less big and scary than they would
have to do if they became a member of
the expert group so they can become what
we call a contributor they can get some
formal recognition for their work and
that's obviously going back to what I
was talking
at a little while ago obviously going to
be very good for their careers so this
is all goodness the more joyous ours we
have the happier I am alright yep like I
said positive feedback that I've heard
from the community so many of the jrs
that have been progressing through the
JCP will compete continue and complete
and then another big topic at javaone is
micro services so how's microservices
fit into the plan for ja ve i'm going to
start well yeah it's certainly on our
radar and support for micro services
based architecture is one of our goals
for java ee night we're going to take
some steps in that direction with what
we're adding to java ee 8 but that is
obviously very important it's the key
emerging technology so we are definitely
moving in that direction mark it's your
perspective on how this fits in micro
services
um I mean we we obviously think that
Java EE has a lot to offer microservices
even today we gotta you understand that
people fixate on the micro aspect of the
term microservice when really it has
nothing to do with the benefits of micro
services whether you've got six lines of
code or six hundred lines of code or six
thousand lines of code you can still
have good Michael services and we've all
had a lot of experience of trimming down
our application servers or our
containers with web profile full profile
is obviously little bit chunkier but you
know very simple mentation that are out
there can provide of Java EE can provide
a very good base for micro services
today so the reason I mention it is
there's there's a as a view that Java EE
has nothing to offer microservices in
2016 and we've got to make sure that we
tell people that that is complete
rubbish that's fabrication it has a lot
to offer microservices developers today
and your favorite microservices
frameworks are probably using it where
we go beyond 2016 with things like info
from Linda things like we're working
with IBM
profile that that's been making it
easier maybe to trim down your your app
server in a way that allows you to do
much services in a much more portable
fashion but it's still going to be built
on the rock solid framework of Java EE
that we've all been working towards for
the last 20 years we've got to make sure
that people understand that most people
who want to move to micro services today
we're going to do it from a brownfield
perspective they do not have the luxury
of throwing everything away and starting
from your clean slate and that's wearing
jari moving in a much more microservices
direction as as a huge future if we do
it right and do it collaboratively I
think that's key right so the community
working together so I think Java one is
a great opportunity to do that so
bringing people together like this here
in the pavilion the Java hub and the
night hacking stage the hacker garden
great place to have these conversations
and sure that the community continues to
work together did you have a comment
yeah I was just going to amplify on some
of what Mark said namely that we have
api's in place already today that are
going to be critical for developing
microservices based application stainle
jax-rs Jason Jason Jason key Jason b/c
of course don't see our favorite over
there our favorite in the internals I
was thinking more of the service to
service communication but yes and what
we're doing I should be viewed as a
migration for java ee applications is by
no means any kind of break so we want to
carry on our application on our
application path for existing customers
and just add infrastructure that will
make of the ability to write for
powerful like reservist based
applications possible and to provide
some of the infrastructure I mentioned
the what we're doing in terms of
resiliency we're also
looking at you know state services that
can take service just providing
infrastructure to make your apps more
portable and more easily written all
right well this has been a great update
for me I personally enjoyed it and to
amplify what patrick has said we
definitely encourage everyone to get
involved and contribute and participate
in the jsr discussions give us your
feedback any closing statements from
anyone before we say goodbye on this
night hacking interview we call it the
java community process because we want
community involvement so come and get
involved i would say for more deep yeah
for more details of the the talks that
we've given in these areas should be
made available both the recordings that
were made of the talks and the slides
will be available in the java one web
pages so people know what more details
could get them there alright thanks so
lemme panelists okay yeah your time
thank you thank you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
