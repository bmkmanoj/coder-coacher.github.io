hacking interview of the afternoon with
Mia Nikko Kobler and model Steve hey we
were going to chat a bit about an
unusual topic this is going to be
JavaScript yeah cheffy sing bass horn
and project avatar on the JVM yeah right
so tell me a little bit about how you
got interested in this topic and what
you've been doing with okay I started
again programming JavaScript one and a
half years ago and before I stopped
programming JavaScript in 2007 round
about where all this different browsers
stuff came up and and was not funny
enough and some some years ago I won a
half years ago I started again came back
to Java Script just the server-side
JavaScript came up again and I think
this is a pretty good approach modern
approach for programming on the server
side and then last year on the Java one
I saw this project Avatar and the
approach from Oracle to put the nodejs
programming model onto the java virtual
machine and with project avatar to you
know to have it on the server side and
have a framework also and and the I yeah
so for folks who don't know the history
of this Oracle announced a project at
JavaOne last year originally I think
three years ago well ok so my
understanding is the project Avatar
Dells 3 years ago is not related to the
project avatar which was reno's less
this past year but anyway short story
they announced the nodejs version of
project avatar at JavaOne this past year
and what it was was a full no js'
implementation on the JVM using NASA
earn and I think at the tar that at the
time they called it no jar yeah for the
nodejs implementation which is fully
compatible with the you know no channel
running on v8 yeah yeah so what's your
experience been using project avatar
real projects not yet real projects
unfortunately I played around with it in
the in the last month and tried to get
to use node libraries on other town and
it works pretty well yeah there are only
some libraries which don't work out of
the box you have to adjust some
parameters but it's not much and you can
you can use it too right so compared to
doing direct the Jas development have
you noticed any differences in
performance or capabilities or I didn't
recognize yet some performance
differences but I didn't some I haven't
made some tests with million requests
per second but I think that's not a real
bad approach yeah yeah for just regular
applications I think there's even the
same the same performance as note okay
and you know theoretically you get the
advantage of being on the Java Virtual
Machine yeah one of the big advantages
not only on the on the java virtual
machine but in the whole java
application certification application
server ecosystem and to use java
enterprise resources right from
javascript so if you use the bridge
between a java ee and avatar
applications to do any take advantage of
any ejbs or other services running on
the east side you know how does that
work in your experience seamless in
works pretty seamless yeah they are no
big challenges using the persistence
layer for example um Jamis it's a bit
tricky but it also works um but the the
persistence is quite quite cool you can
you can directly configure your rest
service with the persistence layer you
don't have to don't have to code
anything else just define a persistence
layer define your push service or rest
service and put them together and
everything will work out off the box ok
and so let's say you were coming from a
java ee background yeah what would you
tell a java ee person are the benefits
for trying out avatar in their
infrastructure um first thing because
you can it's always a good reason that
yeah good software developer will try
new technology just because they can ya
know not only um but javascript is
becoming more and more popular
yeah even specially the client-side but
people are using it more and more for
server-side application as well all big
companies also start with implementing
server-side javascript this noches and
why not
starting implementing javascript on the
virtual machine where you can access
your already they've been there
enterprise resources yeah I think one of
the big selling points of Avatar over
deploying for example in v8 or another
node.js implementation is if your
existing infrastructure in your company
and application servers and you know
possibly even restrictive model and what
you can deploy to production you know
this lets you mix and match Java EE and
JavaScript node applications together in
the same runtime environments which you
know hopefully should be easier than
getting something new deploy to
production um just go to to a server
administrator and tell him oh let's
let's do some no chair stuff he says no
no I don't know this and I went on point
this on my widget chef application
service for years and why we should
change now they don't have to change
they can use JavaScript on the virtual
machine why not go so have you given
your talk here yet at Leonards on
knowing the the avatar talk will be
tomorrow at 4 p.m. but you I assume you
give this talk at other places other
conferences before or is this your
friends the first time I give the other
is but there are some other conferences
in this year I will give this talk also
but what's your what's your impression
of the reception of the project avatar
in the Java community from the books
you've talked to so far many people who
have asked me why should I do that and
even so you do and but I think we're
under we were at the starting point of
JavaScript on the virtual machine with
NASA on ok we could do that in the past
this Reno but Reno wasn't as performed
yeah as as NASA honest and I think we
can we can use it in production now and
JavaScript will become more and more
popular this is yeah so for folks who
who haven't before the whole
conversation so NASA is one of the
features coming in Java 8 yeah which
allows you to code JavaScript on the
java virtual machine and project avatar
then lets you put note applications
inside of your Java EE application
service at which which application
servers are supported for doing project
avatar right now sorry which application
servers can you so far it's only the
GlassFish for server about erectus
providing a runtime for web logic which
will be released in the summer I think
over 12 1 3 and
I think this is not plant from Oracle
directly support for for other
application service but advertise open
source so the do community can comport
it to to other applications of a Sofia
maybe that's a good question for a ring
to the interview scheduled tomorrow so
we can we can ask it a wildfly will
support um yeah project avatar in the
future
yeah can do it cool all right well
thanks very much for the short interview
how can folks find out more about
project avatar if they want to get
started on hacking their own node
applications on the JVM they can talk to
me here in the conference I'll be here
today and tomorrow yeah
and on the project website HTTP avatar
dot java.net there are all resources in
the meantime there's a pretty good
documentation also and the starting
there were no documentation at all it
was a bit hard to find out what's
possible modern art and but now all the
resources are up on the website and can
go there and have a look all right thank
you very much Nika you're welcome see so
for folks in the room here javelins we
are going to be doing our live Java 8
launch stream at 6 p.m. and that's going
to include a stream from the official
launch stream that's being broadcast
from California and we'll have a local
panel here will be where we'll be on
commentating or heckling or something
like that
as the live stream takes place hopefully
with lots of alcohol in our hands so
should be fun
please join us for that after the
sessions end thank you okay-y</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
