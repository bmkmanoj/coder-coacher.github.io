to use a tool to automates configuration
that is Jeff all right that's you know
it's it's usually thought about this as
using for enterprise kind of things you
know the you all to major your
infrastructure you if you put together
beautiful machines for your cloud
environments so we're thinking about
what we could do with that in in our
project and you know basically this is
if you would do like an enterprise kind
of clouds environments you could you'd
have you know chef series a series of
chefs chef scripts community repository
and then your Jenkins would generates
using Packer for example who generates
the virtual machines the image that you
would deploy in the cloud right and so
of course this is like the sophisticated
club thing that you do on the enterprise
system and of course we didn't have any
of that and so we're trunk but we try to
replicate some well some of that so
basically the idea was to get you know
chef scripts that we could use a tribute
knotts berry pies and they want
interesting things that we have
chocolate since since we're talking
about job on the cloud right the idea is
that you know can we actually do this
with more device not only the Raspberry
Pi so we had an opportunity that we had
a mean old ward here that is more
powerful the Raspberry Pi we also had
the Gemalto board its last partner us
verify so we could kind of try to see
different things we we didn't we weren't
able to do all that right that was kind
of kind of the idea of the prod that we
want to test it out so it's a little bit
more less less exciting because more
down to earth things that you would do
in your enterprise but you know trying
to do good by the ideals more like you
know you have with those $35
machines right you could basically have
hundreds of those in your house so once
you have hundreds of those in your house
can you actually put an application in
and distribute duplication several dose
of those machines &amp;amp; Howell implications
interacting with sensors and think like
that we're just kind of prototyping this
and so that is where we to use one pie
to do like entering point entry points
of the application install like a load
balancing on it help me tow boards and
other pie running deputations we didn't
get to gemalto aboard and it actually
made maybe work which is just work with
a pie and the russ berrie I mean did the
mean oh boy right so basically the ends
what we have this is the setup that
we're just going to quickly demo here
you know is have an application running
on on the Raspberry Pi that's load
balances to to chew up the device one
Raspberry Pi in a meter board and each
one of them have access to two sensors
and and you know what actuated
everything and just just as a demo here
we're just showing the lights you know
sequel thing but trying to get like a
full development development
environments like enterprise development
that could work so I think we should
have to show oh yes we're just gonna
hold the hands you know just a little
bit when you talk about Chef right yeah
yeah is so there's you know this spindle
contigo here is a guy that has an open
source chef scripts to the pie so
basically idea is that you know you want
to you want to build that environments
and you don't want to connect yet every
one of your of your your machines and
those hundred of machines you don't want
to connect you have one of them and
configure what they have to have in and
this kind of thing so you know you can
use an insertion for such luck chef
that's will basically buege you know
connected to the Raspberry Pi and imbued
whatever you need to
donde right so there is there are a few
projects that's that try to do that they
have to put this this enterprise
infrastructure into the small devices
this no just a little bit what what you
could do here and in the end all you're
just gonna run from there so basically
Ronnie we have oh sure oh you got to
read there oh this show 300 it just it's
my idea okay nice time T we try to make
kind of a privates embedded club
computer virus so I thorough James one
so we view to load balancer it does not
provide the autodiscover of the notes
but we had to configure if I have but it
has two notes I mean award run our
patient is connected to the strike and
another design application deployments
on the Hosmer running tomcat aids
connected also connected to the strike
so it's a oh it's kind of a cluster we
have load balancing I'll have failover
in fact today it's morning it failed but
it's kept running the hour has to didn't
work but since it's a failover cluster
the lemon bar assume the request and
that's what we're trying to show when
the middle board serves a request we
will turn on the blue lights and when
the husky serves who have the red lights
so middle hospet you sure if I have more
than one at your request at the same
time low cover both the lights at well
light it up and it's a fail over because
if you turn off the husky please chop
visual this one this hassle okay you can
unplug it which is what happened
just just the blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
