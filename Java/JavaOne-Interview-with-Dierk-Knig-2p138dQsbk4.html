calm and i'm doing a series of
interviews with different javaone
luminaries speakers at javaone to get a
little bit of insight into what they're
going to be presenting at the upcoming
conference in San Francisco javaone San
Francisco September 22nd through
September 26th and it's the premier java
conference in the world so today I have
with me Dirk Koenig so how you doing
Dirk thanks I'm fine how are you
excellent so Dirk is a fellow at canoe
software and he's been doing javafx for
as long as I could remember is one of
the folks behind the groovy effects open
source project recently started open
dolphin which is a open source data
binding framework for javafx what else
what else am I forgetting your Dirk oh
that's fine what's good okay so um tell
me a little bit about what you're going
to be speaking about at javaone oh I'm
very much looking forward to having a
free sessions first one is above I'm
just evening about improving your groovy
kungfu so this is playing groovy at the
language cool stuff that you can do with
it with closes in yes Italy was like
this what when did you get started with
groovy because you your to technology
passion seem to be groovy and javafx but
I'm assuming groovy long predated
Jonathan no I started with groovy in
2004 so that is yeah more than 10 years
ago and I'd say I'm the second oldest
still working core member of the team
the the the oldest one is is the young
new joint like three weeks earlier than
I am betrayed over yeah dial is still
alive and kicking and chunking cranking
out new versions of the language every
half a year yeah i'm at a pregnant
Guillaume in Copenhagen and did an
interview with him there that was fun
yeah absolutely very nice guy and also
the other ones and we will talk a little
bit about the recent changes to the
language you know which are also covered
in groove in action in the second
edition that we are currently about to
finish I'm afraid you will not make it
for java one don't tell my publisher
well sir we'll keep it just between us
and think folks you know the tip that
the 10 billion Java developers you are
watching the stream yeah only those okay
have we really keep it keep it between
us okay and yeah it's it's gonna be
really exciting to have the next edition
of the coconut what else are you I'm
going to be talking about a java one and
the second is open too often of course
the you can say dat abiding framework
between java enterprise applications in
java desktop applications particularly
javafx um this is then on Wednesday
Wednesday half-past eleven cool well and
then on Thursday I can speak about
groovy effects and in all three parts
Ruby itself as a language opened often
as the integration of Java enterprising
in Java desktop and groovy affects all
three technologies are of technology
that I use every day and both best with
my customers and so oh yeah yeah so um
what do your customers they give javafx
you work with quite a lot of both
commercial clients just like a new it is
we do have customers that bet the
existence on all the advance of Java
epics there is no selling software
products that are now totally build with
javafx so you can really say that they
they bet their their existence on it and
happy now and then they need some help
setting them on the right path of
resolving some issues and this is where
we come into play me mostly for the
architectural if you want is you on it
the UI engineering part of it and then
of course the famous han Solo evergreen
park from canoe oh yeah ngidam austin
chatted with him a couple days ago and
today in the truth with no java champion
Garrett Grunwald congratulations to
Garrett yes congratulations kiddo
Garrett's a chelating cheats on the live
stream as well so we can we can
officially give him his own applause
congratulations Gary yep very good and
well well by amateur in quitting I was a
San Francisco yep I even have a second
java champion it can do well i'm sami
ryan yes yes yes Andre a Griffin thing
yeah tell him to to respond to my my
meeting invited to come on an interview
ah yes he's busy finishing the next
version of Griffin occurs one thing I
well that's that's important well we'll
let him off this time yeah okay so um I
ask the folks on the stream for some
things they were interested to to hear
about and one of the things Jim Weaver
was interested was he wanted to know how
you come up with the inspiration for
cool ideas like you know open dolphin
abacus groovy affects all the different
you know new and interesting things
you're working on if I all be you I mean
I have really no idea how the ideas come
to me besides most of the time it's
really from the customers it is a
customer demand they have a certain
issue with certain idea or certain
requirement that is not that we cannot
quite exactly resolve at the very same
second and then this kinds of this kind
of the next on me and I I feel around
this with me all day and light and and
I'm pretty sure my family especially
my wife doesn't like it if i SAT there
and bacon and it goes like this and I
have it in my mind and they cannot just
release it until I have it and
particularly with open bluffing I mean
open coffin is something that we have it
has a structure that we have built over
and over and over and over and over
again in so many projects that we said
we we need some way of extracting this
into once more library yeah and we try
to defuse time and fails and fry to the
second time and failed and it really
took some some really cool decisions and
particularly the help of Androzani right
to come up with a solution that we are
no absolutely confident that this is the
way to go Wow so a lot of it comes
through you know what you're doing for
clients and then you know nice prodding
from your co-workers and family to to
get the good ideas out yeah is that your
official is that your official thinking
lab there we're getting a shot of your
arm you're very nice wooden this is yeah
this is my room there's the distillation
of all four groovy Hannah wall so a nice
in 2007 we have only the European for
innovation price now there is Leonardo
da Vinci another great thinker a picture
of him and he's my favorite you know
he's my so so this is standing on my
shoulders he hit step to speak as it
comes from the camera and and there it
kind of Miss purring in my ear while
that probe nice nice okay so Jim's
wondering and we're actually going to
show a little bit of your arm 3d
application a sec what's your thought on
3d user interfaces yes I mean a lot of
people say that what should I do with 3d
and I have no use case and why do I need
the 3d world experience we have some
forms I good enough and that may be the
case for many applications but when it
comes to productivity apps and that's
we are talking about with javafx we are
not talking about things that you can
easily do dope do on the web like having
a few forms but we are talking about
something that really drags the user
into the user interface and makes him
feel like he is in this world and this
is bear 3d comes really handy and if you
think about it many many applications to
go to to do large extent trying to do
something that looks 3d that isn't
really and then you do like all kinds of
gradients and shading and so on which
you don't need to do with you more live
in 3d work yep so there may be I'm
pretty sure that we're just not used to
the two programming in 3d but the
hallways needs to be a few pioneers in
this and I think consider myself up you
hear it and it's so much fun that I I
just I just hope there's going to be
more use cases for it and we see it with
our customers and there's customers in
the logistics industry the phonetics
nervous application that we have shown
that the dust on one so i also i brought
the factory floor up app in the
background so i'm just letting it play
so okay describe a little bit yet the
use case was for this application which
you built with open Delphia so the
factory floor is based on experience
that we have done in in the industrial
world there really is it's not
particularly a factory floors bit your
friend bet you can see it as a factory
floor and there are so many machines and
engines that have to be monitored that
and they're all sending sensor data life
is easy and you like to have a view
where they are and whether they have
problems whether they need some
hand-holding or whatever and and this
view lets you explore that space as if
you could fly through your Tecla various
floors and you can pick ones and the
you're interested in if you see that any
of those has a problem does computer
America preparations done just get more
information and the whole application is
running on the server it's an enterprise
application that's the cool thing
because they already have all these
enterprise applications but they'd like
to have the best possible visualization
and that is Java ethics and and it's
even 3d if you want ice nice very very
impressive use of Java this is really a
this combination unfortunately for for
most of our applications that are this
way we do have to sign NDA's and we are
not able to show the code not even
showing it screenshots are therefore i
made this stripped-down version with
only the you know not with pictures and
image maps and specular maps and bump
maps and so on that we have in the real
application but only these cylinders
which is pretty much good enough to give
you an impression on watching what we
can displace nice and that's that was
the idea do you have something that i
can show a java one and where i can show
the code in Java one in fact where
people can get hold onto the code
because it has some specifics in there
how to deal with a camera and how to
deal with a lighting and how to deal
with these transitions and so on it's a
little bit about how to deal with the
geometry in 3d and once you have an
example that you can then derive your
solutions from it's much easier gives
you better head start well so I I very
much hope that people will come to my
charts ends and see how that is working
and then have a look at the code and go
from there and share experiences that
they make and also very much looking
forward to meeting all the experts it's
all about because I have questions and I
will ask you all the questions you know
about prospective camera and you know in
I i guarantee she will have some really
obsession 33 you as well and yeah that's
there's lots of stuff that I have
tinkered around and I've made up my own
model on how that's supposed to work and
I'd like to to ask whether my model of
how it should work is really what it is
supposed to be because there's not yet
so many documentation of it there's not
so many examples yet on on the web and
not so many coverage in the books about
it at the moment cool all right well
thanks a lot for the the short interview
about your sessions Dirk it's exciting
to see some of stuff you're doing a Java
3d hear about groovy and look forward to
seeing you at the Java one conference
upcoming in a few weeks yeah just travel
one will be very good it's almost a
great man you to meet all the people and
it has an absolutely awesome program and
who was responsible for that one yeah we
don't we don't know anything about that
we don't know that one okay thanks a lot
that all right thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
