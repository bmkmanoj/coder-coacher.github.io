technology Network we're here at javaone
Brazil talking to members of the java
community I've got landgren printer with
me hi Lani hey Tori how are you doing
I'm doing great you young doing pretty
well so how's your chauvin what great
good okay you sound excited so tell me
about your session first I want to hear
about that I'm very happy that I had the
opportunity to talk to Java one for the
first time here in Brazil and my talk
yesterday was about job jax-rs and xjs
for and how to integrate these two
technologist Wow okay so and what would
tell me a little bit about the project
you were using xjs for it's a JavaScript
framework it's the owner it detention
it's the owner of this framework and it
focused on building reach you I so the
users can have a rich experience when
user using the project cool so you sound
pretty experienced how long have you
been coding in java for 60 years now
most focus on je okay and so you've been
using it for six years and now you're
kind of an expert right I hear you're
right in a couple books kind of okay
well tell me about the book you have
coming out just now okay so my book
about xjs for it's coming out this month
by fact bub-bub shirt and it's about xjs
far and for experienced users in a
framework just introducing the new
version of the framework and I'm also
planning to write a new book about Java
for next year okay tell me a little bit
about that book okay it's a book focused
for college students that can learn java
a little bit and when they finish
college and they are out to the market
they can start working with java without
having to study many more code so yeah I
think what you told me was you learn
some Java in school but then you get in
the real world and it's a little bit
different right yeah here in Brazil
some schools teach Java as the default
language and colleges but they're just
debates when the students are out and
then they finished college they don't
know where to start the data only know
the basis of Java so this book is
focused so that you learn a little bit
more and be prepared to start working
with Java Wow and it sounds like there's
lots of opportunities for java
developers in Brazil correct yeah yeah
that's correct you're right lots of jobs
so tell me you could have this nice Jay
Duchess button tell me a little bit
about Jay Duchess in Brazil okay they
judge it it's a Java user group
worldwide none and now we are planning
to launch a resilient community of the
judges for for women so we can gather
more women in fact to have fun with Java
right so it's an opportunity for women
that are in the industry or looking to
get in the industry to network together
and learn and as you said have a good
time right yes yes great thank you very
much landing for taking the time to talk
to us and have a great job of one thank
you this is Tori wheel with the Oracle
technology Network signing off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
