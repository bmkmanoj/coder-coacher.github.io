you
alright so welcome back 2nite hack
with Joe guys and we're going to we're
going to share the final projects and do
some judging of the votes these guys
been working hard for the past few hours
on there the past few months on their
Raspberry Pi javafx demos which they're
going to they're going to show off all
right not going to switch to the
combines desktop video view and you guys
are gonna be the first group all right
so what do you guys what you guys come
up with we've made an awesome
application it's a game actually and you
yeah it's kind of self-explanatory you
do what it says this swings this image
definitely amazing it's an image and if
you look closely you can see it's a it's
a track clearing snow on the north end
road yeah it's like Fanning the snow
author yeah it actually works haha has
no snow outside now oh really okay I
actually have a mic how can you guys
watch out so we get a good shot all
right so can you bring up their demo as
well they should have emailed this is
off yeah wow I doesn't matter so we
actually did also quite amazing huh it's
a yeah started off by having some
natural problems but now we have a cliq
meet up and as you can see the best GF x
up ever yeah well ok you should yeah
okay now you click the button and as you
can see we have a pie chart floating oil
way long ago I
like this is like the window bigger so
that's it well okay oh yeah the button
actually sticks to sew and I way this is
to show this application was made to
show a little better in the calculations
of tapas in Java so if you click click
for me nine times more hi you're
probably not clinging it correctly try
clicking on the top somewhere okay it
should start over when you click it it
did on my computer that's a nice breeze
ah see it doesn't work well sorry I saw
working apart so but it's a nice this
blue soon so what's let's give it a name
so we can vote on it later whatever went
on call us we got that snow snow clear
no up is the best app ever the best app
ever mobio app actually the process bug
goes on s like a nice for super so we
got the super graph good all right who's
next pass the microphone to the next
group yeah is it on now it's red
hi mr. mute I off me I'm sorry test test
test I haven't liked to let's look at
home test test yeah okay we're working
all right who's next you guys shoot so
this is the pac-man pac-man okay do you
have a super at all so killer at
actually oh so called pac-man you see in
a while why if it comes up and it has a
patent it's just eat knee so that's what
it's you too if you press a button click
the button and it eats all the resources
of the raspberry nothing you have to
think you have to shoot it down put it
was supposed to stop if you click eat me
again but maybe it's more it's more
entertaining to watch them keep going
yeah alright let's do the next one all
right give you can you guys scoot a
little to the side so we can
so is a wrap up do you have our laptop
yeah I would like to point out that our
app is the only one that actually does
something useful the the first option
here tonight that has some connection to
the user it has a user input field none
of the other applications have that so
if you would be so kind as to type into
the input feet yeah and we put a
built-in keyboard yeah yeah type in some
two or three letters knowing into the
input field just type in your yeah okay
and click the button
and wait so it's like fading in and out
heading a note yeah very nice that's all
it does cool night I think you guys did
the best explanation of your ab all
right we would like to point out the
process yeah so like I said the the VNC
this VNC bills you guys are using it's
not optimized so egl FB is much much
better performance okay so we've got I
think that's all the teams right for
projects and let's let's vote for the
winning team so we'll we'll get out
because since we had groups of people
working on and it's not really fair to
to not give the group a prize what we'll
do is we'll just pick a winning team and
then you guys will get the prize pool to
distribute among yourselves okay all
right so let's go through the prize by
clapping who liked snowmobile
okay well the team which built it like
this yeah I think I think this is is
perhaps is not the best way of voting so
let's let's try this so when we go
through the teams if you're the team who
were voting for you don't need to clap
all right so who like snowmobile come on
okay that's good who like super graph
okay thanks snowmobiles a little louder
right little maybe we'll say all right
pac-man all right how about the glowing
letters all right Santa car our winning
team is the Pac Man Group so
congratulations and you guys will get
some some great prizes all right so so
thanks okay all right so um this is this
is the conclusion of our lab thanks
everybody for participating remember to
return the hardware so the next user
group has some toys to play with and
before you leave I want to get a few
photos of the group but I can't do it
until the stream is done so we can use
the camera so so wait just a sec before
you run off but thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
