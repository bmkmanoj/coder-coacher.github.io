with the oh teen advocacy team and I run
the Java champion program and I'm
pleased to be joined today by Peter
Lorre one of our Java champions welcome
thank you a place to be how long have
you been a java champion a little over a
year now okay and you know just here
trying to get people an idea of what
exactly Java champion is you know what
you do and how you give back to the
community so tell us what your day job
is ok so my day job is I have a small
consulting company with open source
software and some licensed software
around say a fix engine we have and
about fifty percent of my time spent
running the company in about fifty
percent is smaller hands on or going to
conferences ok and then how do you you
know besides you know obviously being an
expert or illuminating the field you
know another big part of being a java
champion is giving back to the java
community so you know tell us maybe a
couple of the ways that you find
yourself able to do that sure probably
the biggest one is that I have the most
answers for java in the JVM on stack
overflow ok just over 12,000 now and so
it gives me a good perspective or the
full range of you know Pete from people
who are just starting out with computers
to people who have a lot of expertise as
well I find that really I find often the
best way to learn is by teaching and so
I see this is part of my learning
experience as well I'm also a founder of
a group called the performance Java
users group shows over 2,000 members
it's a really an online group and that
has a lot of resources for people who
are interested in performance in Java
have over 100 video presentations from
from different 40 different speakers
also have a blog and I've written over
300 articles and it's had about 4
million hits so there's a lot of
different topics they're mostly around
Java some of them just thinks I found
amusing but um yes I a lot of it around
jar / as well well we thank you for all
that you do and have a great rest of
your day thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
