technology Network we're here live of
the floor of DevOps UK talking to
members of the java community i have
david alaba say with me hey David hi how
are you doing good good thank you so
you're a java ee evangelist yes among
other things so tell me about the
sessions or buffs you're doing here
today we are running to buff so there is
a java ee buff run with other colleagues
from the Jedi community where we've got
basically talked about Java EE and given
the what we have done recently I suspect
that would spend most of the time on
Java 8 because we have already started
to give indication on what we will what
we are planning to do for java a so i
assume that the community will be i
interested by that so i guess that will
be absolutely and I saw you did a survey
to get information right yeah that's
correct so a few months ago we have done
a community survey so basically we have
asked the community what they would like
us to focus on for july yay because the
issue is that we have lot of ID for java
but if we want to include all those ID
in java ee we won't have something
before the next exercise you see that's
far too long so basically we have had
the community what we should focus on so
that gives us a good idea good
indication on what should really be the
I light and what should be the team of
Java yet now given that that information
obviously is a data that will be used
through the expert book that is working
on Java that will be formed to work on
the weight that's excellent so tell me
give me a sneak peak give me a couple
other things so uh for example following
the latest evolution around the web
standards it's something which is key so
in Java is 7 we have introduced a
WebSocket support jsonp and so on so
those technology are key when it comes
to html5 applications but obvious
we need to do more around that so for
example for Jason it seems that having
support for Jason binding is a
no-brainer that's something that we
should do for java 8 so that's one thing
now something else that is also asked is
sse service and even that's also some
technology that is very important for
html5 applications so that's something
we will probably work for july eight so
you're also talking about glassfish a
little bit while you're here yeah so but
first I should mention something today
is a kind of special day because just
one year ago we have long java 7 so
today is the first anniversary ok
gratulations thank you well done yeah
Thank You community so just fish for the
java ee 7 reference implementation has
been launched one year ago and we are
continue to work on improving glassfish
so a few weeks ago we have announced the
plan for the next release of glassfish
so glass feature for one that should be
really within the coming of month so
what will be the focus of that release
for example supporting jvc 8 which has
been launched a few months ago it's
something which is key for the next
release of last fish for fixing the sum
of some of the bugs we have is also
something we are working on and also
including all the posts the updates of
the components that compose glass fish
such as Cyrus for example for WebSocket
support or Jersey for a rest services
support and so on so adding all of those
indices for one is what we are right now
busy and working on so glassfish is
definitely a community effort right it
is yet and you're looking for people to
get involved yeah that's correct so
glassfish is developed in open source
and we are very keen to get contribution
from the open source community so
tonight after the java ee both we are
running above specifically on glassfish
so basically we would like to talk with
the community around glass fist or the
plan for glass fish for one but also we
would like to discuss how the community
can get involved in glassfish because
right now we are talking about just fish
for because
the specification of the day is july
seven but obviously as java ii will get
more concrete job just fish we
remembered those reference
implementation so we will have also to
work on that so glassfish five is
something that is maybe not too far away
so we need to start to think about the
five as well wow they just the future
just keeps rolling right yeah yep so you
can go to glass pitch org to grab
glassfish and learn information yes yeah
excellent well thank you David for
dropping by really appreciate your time
and it's good to see you thanks thank
you this is Tori wheeled from the Oracle
