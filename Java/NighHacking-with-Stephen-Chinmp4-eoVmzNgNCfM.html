Network and I'm here today with Stephen
chin Steve again so tell us what have
you been up to so I've been traveling
around Europe on this this motorcycle
here is not just a prop it's actually
the bike I've been riding around and I
rented it in London where I started my
trip and have been live streaming
hacking sessions with different Java
developers and posting them online at
night hacking calm so what have you been
hiking canoeing we've been doing javafx
we've been doing raspberry PI's we've
been doing groovy hacking Scala hacking
I just had a little session with Bill
manners and we did some Scala cones so
it covers the gamut of different Java
technologies JVM languages and it's very
interactive I'm even meeting with user
groups where we do live events show them
some technologies they do independent
projects and then at the end of the
session we upload all the projects to
github and showcase them okay so are you
doing more with dev effects eventually
evangelizing people about device X so
the Munich jug we had a good session
where we took photos of some pictures of
Duke who were hanging on the wall
animated them using in javafx
application and then created published
them online at the end and several of
the groups actually finished a complete
the animation with Duke rolling around
in under an hour of hacking so it was
very it was good there was a first
javafx project but it was also a way for
them to showcase what they were doing to
the world so what was one of your most
frustrating moment um that would
probably have been at the getting the
headlights my bike but it was ok so I
was in Germany ok and this is a German
this is a BMW it's a 1200 RT so I was in
good hands and I went to the
headquarters and it only and only took
five guys
to fix the headlights Wow so it was it
was well it was well taken care of
that's really that's a good sailor than
that it's been very smooth rod I've got
good weather I missed the snow by a week
very little rain a great tour I've seen
more of Europe in the past two weeks
then I have flying around Europe for the
past two or three years because in that
case all I see our airports and hotels
is not that exciting so what was one of
the coolest I can you did um well there
was a lot of cool hacking but one of the
sessions which I think folks would
really be interested in is they featured
the now robots of the DevOps keynote so
there the robots about this high and
they're fully maneuverable with 25
motors and sensors for objects from
detecting collisions and I got to visit
all the bar and robotics in Paris then
get a behind-the-scenes look at how they
make the robots and the software and the
design of them and that was that was
something which you don't normally get
to do their doors aren't exactly open
for the public to walk in it and check
out but it was very cool and that's also
posted on the java youtube channel with
the rest of the videos though so where
is it where is all those those hiking
boosted so I'm so you can at night
hacking calm that's a central place for
finding out more about the night hacking
tour and all the videos I post go to the
ustream channel they go to the java
youtube channel which i think is where
this will end up yep and they also go to
parlays which is the dev ox technology
video site ok and so you are doing more
today so what are you doing today I just
finished interviews with Kirk Pepperdine
on performance bill banners on Scala
tests and skull cones I'm going to meet
with a manual Bernard on sale on the new
jboss language and also dan allen on
well something cool we'll all find out
what Dan in his buddies show up and so
all of this is going to be so on the
same day live streams later today
recorded okay well thank you thank you
for the kind of acne thank you for
joining yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
