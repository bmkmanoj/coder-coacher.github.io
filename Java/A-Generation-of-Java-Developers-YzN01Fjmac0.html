javaone brazil on auto TN lounge i'm one
of the directors of so Java and also
labelled code and i'm here with from one
of the most important scientists in the
country given a masquerade as my
grandmother and we have a very nice
story to share with you about java on to
the three generations project can you
tell a little bit about your experience
with IT well what i can say it is that
i'm not a programmer but i always rely
on programmers and the java people it
has been very very useful for a long
time i remember the day when you called
to tell about a very interesting project
on the nuclear reactor and that was the
kind of robotic project can you tell a
little bit about java on science on this
special project well as far as i know
most of the programmers that work in
science they also use java very much
sometimes embedded in the programs
written in other languages also but
anyway i think we can we must rely on
java for both of the programs especially
when you have large amounts of data very
complicated mathematical operations to
do fast otherwise it's going to be very
very long calculations this experience
on java and nuclear reactor was very
interesting work with Vinicius anger on
controlling the arm of the reactor that
was holding the material right and also
use it to generate graphs and do some
calculations on the data that we get
from the nuclear reactor right yes to
arise diffractometer is really a piece
very precise mechanics and collects a
large amount of data
it has to be operated via robotics so
it's indispensable you must have java is
the programming yeah this is true Java
is everywhere job in science here in
Brazil at University of some power with
ivonne mass koreans thank you thank you
very much for the opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
