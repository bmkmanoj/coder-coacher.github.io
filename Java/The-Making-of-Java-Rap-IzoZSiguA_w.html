most inner geek today hi I'm Johnny wow
I'm the executive producer at link
design and we're working with Oracle to
create a music video for Java
programmers sort of an homage to a
hip-hop video it's a ridiculous
juxtaposition of Java coders and Street
hip-hop so we started from the very
beginning with this awesome
track that's just great all the tons of
inside jokes from the code world and it
kind of started from there we figure out
what the visuals were gonna be about
that and kind of built the video around
the song just like you would at the real
music video we storyboarded the whole
thing out to give us a sort of an idea
of our different setups and haven't
given an idea ahead of time of how we're
gonna cut the thing together and go
through a full casting and found our
hero coder dude he's been great just
totally fits exactly what everybody was
picturing
we have his sidekick in this office
crush that he's into and then we have
some random people that are in the cubes
in the back I'm having a great time man
I broke some stuff
I danced with a really hot girl I can't
really complain plus these guys are
really fun to hang out with
shut up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
