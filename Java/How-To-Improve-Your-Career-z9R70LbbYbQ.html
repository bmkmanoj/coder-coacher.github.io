skills as a developer right and you know
the development is an art right so the
best way to get better is doing more you
got to do more development so now the
question is how do i do more development
all right so there's lots of different
ways that you can do you know first of
all you find some interesting things
that you like you know a problem that
you want to solve for you for your
friends for your family for your company
whatever find a problem you solve and
try to solve it right no use use your
skills to solve whatever problem you
think doesn't matter if that's something
oh my company wants me to do no no no
try look around do you see any problems
around TDC do you see any problems
around are your life or your friend's
life try to think about how it solved
that with software and write some code
right also join open source projects you
know a lot of people say oh I had a
question like just today a guy said I'm
a newbie I'm just starting how can I get
experience so I can have a better job go
find an open source project you like and
go codes right solve problems solve
solve bugs help people answer questions
and mainly list you know get involved
there's a lot of open source projects
that you can participate on and lots of
good code now that's one thing the other
thing is to be a good developer you got
to learn how to read coach it's amazing
how many developers think that they can
only be good developers they write code
and they don't read codes it's really
good to read code so if you have a
problem to solve let's say you know
you're working or something in your
project and you have to do some logging
right and then logging something that
you don't know you never done before you
don't know how to do how do you do it go
and code some logging and wrong right
what do you do you go find some other
software an open-source sausage there
has a good logging right so go I don't
know see the Apache web server or you
know some other software that has very
good logging and then you go there and
you see let me see how those guy did oh
that's how they did it that's a good log
in i'm going to do the same thing in my
projects
you have to learn how to read code right
so those are think those are good two
good ways for you to start improving you
know how to be a battle developers like
writing codes okay good more questions
guys we are here taking questions from
the audience on TDC about improving your
career and you can ask in Portuguese I
have to speak in English because we're
recording we are streaming
you can ask him Portuguese there's not a
problem white film type or two gays come
on question about career no no so who
wants to get a better career as a
developer who wants so what's the
problem what probably you have you write
you raise your hands so what is the
problem that you have right now no hit
this guy here won't raise his hands so
what is the problem that you have right
now you know we're lunch we're launching
here a new a new a new program is asked
Bruno about how to improve your career
how I how I motivate the others to stood
with me to create a la a community on my
CD so how do i how do I motivate others
to create a community my city yeah so
you are from Moringa right there is a
very cool Java user group in my nigga
right so no you first of all see if
there is a user group from your
technology near you and go talk of them
first thing right so if there is a job
user group or a I don't know big data
user group or whatever user group you
want to learn about go join join the
user group starts participated so that's
the first step right because once you
know other people that are engaged get
things yet gets better now if you don't
have a user group near you or if you're
already part of this group but you want
to motivate other people to participate
right then you have to think about what
what developers once so what do you
think developers in your region once
they want knowledge they want there are
jobs they want they want you to talk
with people from outside right that's
the things they want right that's what
every developer was so what do you do
you organize something to help them with
that so you organize a meeting to talk
about technology so you bring people in
you organize a meeting like an online
meeting you invites a speaker from other
city or from other country and say guys
you're going to have this discussion
over Skype with this very important
speaker and
and you know it's very easy to get a
speaker to just come and participate
over skype so you just get a burn a
bunch of friends have a discussion over
skype right oh and people want want you
to learn how to code get a bunch of
people say now today we're going to do a
project you can do a very nice thing to
do to a lot of people aren't you
participate is if you do a project like
a social project you say look guys we're
going to do for the weekends we're going
to help this uh you know this OMG here
or this this group there to help kids
with problems we're going to we're going
to fix their websites or we're going to
write their literal application for them
to help them doing something right so
you do something and you get people
saying hey I want to help with that and
that's how you motivate people good all
right other questions why do you want to
do who wants to improve their career
once you have a better career softer
development no one come on you want to
have a very curious off developer no no
you're not soft to developers so it
doesn't help right come on who wants you
have a better career as such the
development you do so he has a question
right there yeah it's very good ok so we
are hearing this new we are launching
this new program ask anything about
softer career yeah I want to know how I
keep up with the ever-changing
technology things are changing very fast
I can't hear you things are changing
very fast nowadays so I did you keep up
with it and how do i do it in an
efficient way right how do I keep up
with technology things change very fast
that's very true so this is part of the
territory right do you want to do
software development it changes really
fast some of the developments not the
only thing that happens order change
very fast lots of things change very
fast and if you don't learn new things
you just you lose right so yes you got
to learn so the first thing is you gotta
like it right if you don't like it you
want to keep up so let me ask one
question do you keep up with your
favorite soccer team
shirt yes so you know you know the name
of the players you know how many how
many how many scores they didn't last
game you don't all this right so because
you do this because you like it so if
you like it you read about it you follow
the news ru uuu follow tweet about the
things right so if you like it you're
going to get involved right you get you
get up you're going to learn more so if
you like if you like soft a lot of
people think I'm a salsa developer and I
just I just don't do those things two
things into work oh I'm not going to do
salsa development I got home well so
you're just going to learn things in
work and how there's a lot of there's a
lot of problems that because then you
can only learn things that your boss
wants you to learn and that's not the
way for you to handle your career you
are responsible for your career it's not
your boss those responsible worker here
it's not your friends are responsible
you are responsible for your career if
you want to have a better career you
have to take time during your busy day
right you're gonna have to take time to
to focus on your career so you have to
take responsibility for that it helps
you learn you have to read you have to
test things out a lot of developers
think that oh I can just come to our
today you know like to procure my
fingers i'm going to write lots of code
driving a very very good that's like a
musician that space i'm going to do a
show and i'm going to learn the music on
the moment i do the show no no that's
not how it works you got to practice
first right it's salt to developing some
arts so you got to do a lot of it to be
good at it you can't just do when you
work you have to do every time so do it
when you're having fun doing if your
kids doing for friends like having cold
parties at your house at night whatever
works for you right the thing is you got
to practice you got to try some
different things so if it's not fun if
you don't like it very no you it's not
going to be nice right but if you like
it take take take the chance so for
example if you go here at CDC you have
the car company selling little kids
electronic kids
wait so you got you got you go there you
spend some money on there and you have a
cool electronic kit that you can hack at
home so you do this and then you you
make your door go closing and open you
make a cheese d turn on and off whatever
have fun right two things that have fun
because that's the way to keep up with
things if you don't speak english your
native language you have to read and
write English you don't have to speak so
this guy keeps poking Portuguese that's
okay right you don't have to speak
English but you have to read and write
English do you read and write English
good excellent that's right he's
speaking is hard right that's okay no
problem so his question was how do you
become a consultant and who hires a
pollutant right yeah so a consultant is
someone that has some particular
expertise that other people don't have
so you're going to hire someone to solve
their problems with a higher consultant
to actually solve some kind of from the
person has they don't they don't know
how to solve themselves so a consumer
need someone that knows more than their
customers so there's anything anything
in your life that you know more than
your customer so there's salsa
development for example you know more
about self development in your customer
so you can be a consultant because you
know more than your customer right so
that's basically what are consuming is
someone in those boar has more
experience and then now it's it's funny
because you can vehicle sutent even if
you don't know that's so much more right
if you just know a little bit more
because there's some people that know
nothing right so who hires a consultant
whoever has a problem that's they don't
have the time to solve themselves they
don't have the excuse to solve
themselves so they need to hire someone
to help them solve that problem so he
tries someone that knows more than them
to solve their problem so they're going
to look not for the skill they're going
to look forward to solution so they want
you know they don't want oh I need a job
developer no no they want my application
deliver it right so they want to help
with that
why do you wanna a security problem
solve it you know they want to solve
some kind of problem now how do you
become a co sutin you have to first sell
your skills to someone that needs them
so first of all you need to find out who
needs your skill right who is your
customer for that I have a very good tip
first we have to find out who is your
customer so there's a phrase that you
have to fill fill out the blanks help
repeat with me I help I help dot dot dot
yes to do or to achieve to do are to
achieve dot dot dots right so they can
help so they can help dot dots right so
basically you have to answer that you
have to know how to say that I help for
example me I help java java developers
tree to improve their soft skills so
they can have a better career right
everyone once you have something
everyone wants to do something right and
you can help them so once you have dance
you now can promote your skills to those
people that need that and then and then
that's where you're going to find your
customers right ok good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
