PhD at the university of frankfurt and I
developed this visual programming
environment that lets you write groovy
code in a visual environment and it
combines text-based and workflow based
programming so here you see
three-dimensional objects that we can
compose in this case we're trying to
create a bracelet actually and we are
taking this cylinder and then this
circular structure here and then we
compute the difference between the
original cylinder and the circle year
and this gives us the bracelet that we
then save as SEL file and you can use
this environment not only for 3d
programming but also for any kind of
work flow based software and it's
completely open source so you you see a
3d printer it's currently printing a
leak motion case this will take like 40
minutes or so and we brought also some
other objects like this wheel here which
is a part of a Raspberry Pi based robot
so I also gave a talk at travel one
about the pie on wheels project and this
is just one piece of that robot and here
we have something more impressive it's a
chainmail like structure made out of
plastic and also generated by the mural
studio and chasey is free software this
takes about 13 hours to print with an
Alta maker too so go to MU softy you
where you can find more information
about virile studio and also the other
project that I do and yeah that's it
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
