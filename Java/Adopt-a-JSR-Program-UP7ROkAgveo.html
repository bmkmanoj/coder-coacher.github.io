sand at javaone one of the last
interviews of the day the hub is buzzing
second take on the adopt a JSR panel so
i'm heather van kira one of the leaders
of the dr j sr initiative with the java
user groups from all over the world so I
have some of the great Jabba user groups
here with me today that are attending
javaone and we're gonna talk a little
bit about adopt a JSR yeah thanks for
all the comments from the odd live
audience here appreciate this alright so
let's start with Bert here on my left
Burt welcome thank you from the NL jug
nominated this year for outstanding
adopt a JSR participant for the annual
JCP awards congratulations I'm you
nominated that is awesome why don't you
share with us a little bit about the
initiative that you started in your Java
user group yeah so we just set up this
year by joining the double J's our
program so at the beginning we were kind
of looking for where to start so you
know a few chats about it where to get
started we did organize Hecatomb on j's
are 371 we're at one of our business
partners we get around about 20 people
hacked on the spec gave feedback
reviewed some some of the spec and we
had a Q&amp;amp;A with evilgram shot one of the
expert members this year at j fo will be
doing a hackathon on the Java 9 Java 9
spec and we're looking forward to keep
contributed contributing and seeing what
up other stuff you can do yeah you got
started pretty quickly so was that
helpful in the beginning having a little
bit of an overview from my one of the
leaders did that help you get started
what were some of the things that made
you decide to get involved well actually
two of our community members moviexesh
at 0 and L converter resultantly and
said well we would like to help how can
we help and where can we start so I
picked
with them and we just we just find a way
to start and some topics we like to
review so that's how we got started well
I hope you continue for next year so
look forward to seeing what you continue
to do with the initiative in your
community thank you yeah and we also
have Marcedes Lewis from Guatemala Java
user group and we actually just met in
person this year in preparing for the
session that you did as part of Java
user groups Sunday on a dr. Jasser you
did it together with bob next to you
from Chicago so why don't you share with
us a little bit about what you've done
with adopted jsr in your local community
and some of the plans that you have for
the future ok well we we are starting
trying to adopt a DSR this year but when
I am till to the audience in my eco come
friends wasn't really a successful story
because we made many things that we
don't need to do for adopted years or so
we will try to improve on be a Phoenix
like I said in my conference and start
to doing right that things so we need
really choose what adopted your size we
will try to work with the community
because at the beginning we only did did
that with the staff community didn't
blow ball all the people so we will
change of leader of the dot IDs or a
project I contact other one for really
can leading in the project and will try
to involve of the community now for be a
successful one no more fail sorry well I
wouldn't say that yours was a failure
was just one of the key things and one
of the points that you communicated in
your session i think was it's important
to communicate right so you decide in
your user group that you want to
participate in the initiative and it's
good you to communicate within your
local community but when you come
together and decide what you want to do
it's important to engage with the expert
group and the jsr respectfully just to
make sure there are in agreement with
what you want to do and they can give
you some guidance and kind of steer you
in terms
what they're looking for and what their
needs are so you know that's that's a
key step just as I always say it's like
a two-way street the communication goes
both ways so you get your interest and
communicate and then just make sure
you're in communication and it's a
learning lesson right to know that you
know things will work better if you're
in constant communication and there's
that feedback loop to give them what
they're looking for so I think you're on
the right track and I enjoyed your
presentation I think you did a great job
you and Bob I was very enjoyable session
I think the attendees enjoyed it so Bob
why don't you share with us a little bit
about what you're doing in Chicago so
Chicago Java user group actually you
were nominated last year for outstanding
jsr participant for the JCP annual
awards you didn't win last year but you
were nominated again this year and you
did win the award
Oh awesome i said that you know to burn
keep going and continue on there's hope
for next year right so you've been doing
a great job awesome job I've been to
Chicago twice this year already
participated in one of your events so
why don't you share with us what you've
been doing sure so I mean our journey
started really like three or four years
ago and and it's funny because ready
gimme our community leader went to the
talk by martine verburg on exactly what
me and Marcedes had talked about so we
were fortunate to have that knowledge
going into it you know we trying to
figure out which ones we were going to
adopt and fortunately we have just you
now in our community who is very active
in the expert groups and started off
with the jsf session about two years ago
and we we've kind of continued to have
events promoting what's going on in the
spec talking about you know what's new
then having our members come in and hack
on it so I mean having the membership
come in and hack you get people that
they don't come to the meetings where
they want to hear somebody speak because
they want to be hands-on so we engage a
whole different audience within our user
group when we do that so and we were
fortunate because we're getting into
Java 9 very heavily now to have yourself
and Charlie hunt come and do hackathons
it was fun I mean you see in the
pictures everybody's heads down working
on their their computers seeing if their
apps are working on Java 9 there's so
much kind of fear out there that hey
when once you break up the JVM nothing's
going to work anymore so having the
sessions like that getting the feedback
from the membership is important too to
get back so that we have a good product
going forward with Josh we've been doing
a lot of online stuff so the other thing
I'd like to plug is that when we do our
virtual adopt sessions you can call in
even if you're not in Chicago and and
talk to us we'll talk through specs will
take feedback you know we'll talk about
JIRA's and these are all things that we
can get back to the spec needs to help
you know make the specs better and and
test things out
yes that sounds good actually I was
talking to Josh last night about
planning out the next online meeting
that we're going to do and what the
topics are so I always try to attend
those if I can and I see in the audience
we even have some up fellow Chicago jug
members Jonathan's here so from the Java
9 hackathon we did the hack is session
we had you know it's important to note
to not everyone douve right into the
hands on stuff but a portion of the
audience stayed and the ones who did
stay you know being Chicago a big you
know financial market there were some
who really wanted to dig into the
details and look at how they could
improve performance so we were there
till very late with our gracious hosts
with IMF trading thanks Jonathan ok so
that was awesome event um so I guess we
want to hear two from one of the
founding adopted jsr members the Java
user group so Java in Brazil we have
Octavio here so won't you share with us
what you've been doing yeah basically
i'm using basically so job alone them
Jeremy started this product there's a
top GSR and quickly so Java help all
over Oh Japanese a group in Brazil to to
this product so we have around 22 jets
does is run these products in Brazil so
we are helping with feedbacks rot
writing codes open for request vs ours
they also doing her card in there too so
basically in helping solve just saw such
as measurement API Mon API CDI 20
revalidation one that's really nice
because when i started obvious are i was
invited to become expecting spec group
and several GSR silly sophistication
right now I'd like to quit my whole
classification next year that's really
nice to start you participating
specification JCP
alright have to share the microphone so
that's great thanks for the update on
that so yeah the other thing I wanted to
say to is participating in adopted jsr
it really is a good way to get started
being involved in the JCP and getting to
know some of the jsr is the Java
specification request so it's been going
for a few years now we have close to 50
Java user groups who are participating
which is great but we have many more who
can participate and the mailing lists
are all open to the public so you're
free to pick a JSR they are interested
in and then start to follow the
discussions there and jump in and
comment when you see something that you
think you have some expertise in that
area or use case you could provide to
the expert group and the spec lead I
know that they appreciate any feedback
that they get i see i have a spec lead
in the audience andres he can say yes
he's giving us a fun thumbs up on that
so i want to thank all of the java user
groups who are participating in adopted
jsr particularly our panelists who've
been doing such a great job thank you I
really appreciate your efforts to
coordinate the initiatives in your local
community and work together with us to
make Java butter final final comments
anything you want to say yes I'll dr.
J's are rules you should do it happy
hacking everyone yeah the PSI is rock
yeah you can learn certain good things
adopting idea sir that is my experience
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
