technologies and each other and these
technologies were adopted by more and
more mobile devices I think the number
is over 3 billion devices in this booth
we collected a lot of demos from the
isolates all of work and I would like to
show you how this device adopt java and
how the application help us the first
one I would like to throw is for the few
the max made by experience this
application actually has a client and a
server the client is running on a mobile
phone which can be used to buy the sales
man infield and the server side is
running on a browser normally on the pc
and the management of guys will use the
server tools to manage the data
collected by the salesman in a field and
the kiwanis I'd usually runs on it on a
phone so this is why if excellent choose
java to implement this client side so
first i need to choose a route along
which and i want to go to visit my
customers and i need to choose for
example i choose this shop and i want to
show something to them so i click order
yes and now you see it a product are
categorized as cell phones and
accessories here so i just want to sell
them some phones here for example this
type of device i said in 1 and this
device to
so I select manual and put in the order
so I here at the chance to input some
discount scheme here I choose one
percent and then I also want to impress
them the other information for example
the user delivery requirement here so
now I put in the order so it asked me to
confirm if I really need to put in so I
say yes ok the other info now is a is
sent back to the server and while the
wireless network so now the management
team can email a process the order this
is the very basic functionality of food
maxx mobile if the sales guy changes the
form and as long as the new phone has a
java runtime that that application will
run on this phone the second application
is caught Zephyr which is made by a
company called Cuban coupling packet is
also a India is V and this software can
be used to listen to some to rock band
music and in this software the banned
list can be updated and is synchronized
with the server and one can then choose
one or many songs whatever he likes
downloaded and listen to it and this is
an outstanding feature that is to share
what he is listening with the Facebook
his facebook friends and families so
that they know all this guy is listening
to this song Zephyr use air WI key which
read the newt to implement its UI this
is really it because loot has a rich UI
widgets and provided little some more
advanced feature so this is very easy to
adopt such kind of application the third
man is called snap to in this
application it integrates a lot of tail
a used web applications including
Facebook tutor RSS news and blogs NM AP
weather services oh this is our based on
web services this application is really
convenient so that they can connect to
the social network the network and they
can get any useful information from
their mobile device no matter where they
are
