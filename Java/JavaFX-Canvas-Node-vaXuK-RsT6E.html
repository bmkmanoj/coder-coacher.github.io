on the JavaFX canvas
my name is Simon Ritter I work for
Oracle as a technology evangelist in
JavaFX 2.2 we've introduced a new node
type called canvas this is based very
much on the html5 canvas and if you've
already used that you'll find that a lot
of the concepts and the API to program
it very familiar there's a reason for
this which is that we want to make it
easy for people to take existing code
that's been used being developed using
html5 canvas and move it into a jar FX
application what we do is to create an
area of our display which can be treated
as an image and then we can draw into
that image and create whatever parts of
the image that we require for our
application once we've created the
canvas we treat it as a single fixed
node so we don't have to worry about a
more complex scene graph being part of
the image it's simply an addressable
area of pixels that we can manipulate we
do that through a graphics context which
we'll talk about later unlike a group
that we use in jar FX all the nodes and
that alive in this we are treating about
talking about a single node and so we
can manipulate that as an image from a
point of view of the canvas class itself
it's actually very simple what you have
is an image that you want to be able to
draw to and that image is going to be
made part of the scene graph in Java FX
there's really only two properties that
a canvas class has that's the width and
the height of the canvas so the area
that you're actually going to be drawing
on to what you then need is a way of
accessing that everything you do in
terms of manipulating the content of
your canvas is done through the graphics
context so there's no sin graph to worry
about simply have a set of API s that
are called through graphics context and
all updates are handled by the rest of
the system graphics context class is
responsible for handling all of the draw
calls to the canvas and it does this
through a buffer
so whenever you make a method call
through the graphics context it will
update the buffer that's associated with
the canvas and make changes to the image
that's going to be displayed through the
canvas the graphic context is
responsible also for pushing all the
necessary parameters onto the buffer in
order to make the updates that you want
from your application code the canvas
only contains one graphics context only
contains one buffer which is a logical
way of organizing things when you
program and manipulate things using the
graphics context then you must issue all
the commands from a single thread if you
start trying to use multiple threads you
will run into things like race
conditions and very unpredictable
results so make sure you use one thread
to access the graphics context once
you've created your canvas and you've
got the graphics context associated with
that before you attach it to the scene
graph you can use any thread you like to
manipulate the graphics context once
you've connected your canvas to the
scene graph then you must make sure that
all accesses to the graphics context
I've done through the JFX application
thread this is very important because we
don't do that
you may will find that it blocks the
updates to the screen and things can
become very unpredictable
the other thing graphics context allows
us to do is to manage a stack of state
objects this allows us to do is to
record the state of the canvas at
particular points in time and then if we
want to we can go back to those previous
States in the same order that we stored
them so we're treating the stack so it's
the lost in first out approach in terms
of restoring these the states in terms
of constructing graphical elements
within our cameras one of the primary
ways that we can do that is using a path
and a path is basically a list of 0 or
more sub paths and each sub path
consists of a list of 0 or more points
so positions within the canvas where we
want to join things up with either
straight or cut
lines if we want to create a closed path
then we use the closed path method that
will create a closed path from the
current point that we've defined to the
first point that we defined in terms of
using this we create a new path by
saying begin path call the begin path
method and then depending on how we want
to create lines we can use things like
arc or arc to Bezier curve quadratic
curve to construct more complex curves
line to for straight lines and so on we
can also do things like filling closed
paths with a particular color we can
check whether a point is within the path
that we've defined and we can also
append a scalable vector graphics path
to the path that we're defining we also
have some other basic graphics type
methods so we can do things like fill
arc fill oval for circles or ovals fill
polygon for an arbitrary number of
points on a polygon for rect four
rectangles round rect for round cornered
rectangles and fill text for text and we
can apply transformations so that we can
manipulate things in the way that we
want to terms of translations we can
rotate we can scale and so on since we
are dealing with an image in terms of
the the pixels that we want to display
on the screen we may well want to put an
actual image into our canvas and so
there's a utility method to be able to
do that called draw image and since the
canvas simply represents a set of pixels
that want to be able to use if we want
to get down to a very low level we can
actually manipulate the individual
pixels of our canvas from the graphics
context we can get a pixel writer and
the pixel writer will allow us to
manipulate those individual pixels
either by setting a value for it we can
set the values based on the Alpha red
green and blue values or we can use it
setting a color explicitly let's move on
to a short demo so this is just a simple
example of the canvas being used in a
Java FX application
so what we're doing here is we're
creating test frame where we're putting
a background in then we're creating a
canvas and we're giving initial size of
two hundred by two hundred and then
we're moving it to a particular position
now what we can do is we can actually
apply some interesting things to this so
we're going to use a slider to control
the size of the natural canvas so we can
modify the canvas size as it's being
used it has properties those properties
can't be changed so we can actually
change the size of the canvas what we're
using it so we simply create a slider
which will control the width of the
canvas we add a listener to that and we
simply call the set width method on
canvas with the new value similarly
we've got one for the horizontal size we
can do the same thing with horizontal
size of the canvas we can change that as
well what I'm going to do is I'm also
going to have a little ball bounce
around in my canvas and I'm going to add
a third slider which will simply enable
me to change the color of that bowl as
it bounces around so we have various
labels and things there and then
essentially all the work that's
happening is in the update canvas method
what we do here is we have the graphics
context of our canvas so we go back up
here we've got the graphics context that
we're using here make that a global
variable and then when we get down here
and we update the canvas we simply make
all of our references through the
graphics context so we get the width and
the height of the canvas because it may
have changed and then we draw a box
around the outside of the canvas so we
can see as it changes and then we're
just basically looking at the number of
balls so we set the fill color to be the
color based on the slider and we fill an
oval of correct size and then we work
out the new position of the ball so we
do various things to decide where it's
going well that's essentially what we
need to be concerned with so if I run
this application we'll actually see how
this works what's going to happen is we
have our canvas and we have to the ball
moving around in it but what I can do
now
so I can say okay well let's make the
canvas bigger in the
cool and auras on tall and you'll see
that the bow ball now moves around in
the right area size of the little bit
smaller and that's all good and then I
say like I say we can change the color
it was being used within there so we can
move that all the way up so it's red or
it's blue they're using a slider flower
one thing that's worth noting here is
that because we use in graphics context
we don't have the same concept binding
so we can't use binding in the same way
that we would if we were using the scene
graph and so that that's basically just
a small demonstration of the canvas cost
in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
