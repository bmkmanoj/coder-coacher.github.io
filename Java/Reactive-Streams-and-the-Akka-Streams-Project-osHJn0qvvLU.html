at the night hacking stage of yellow
poliform Oracle technology Network and
my guest right now is Conrad Conrad hi
hi so can I be here what do you do hi
I'm a senior developer on the aqha team
at light burnt so that's my primary
focus but recently and most importantly
for java one perhaps i worked around
reactive streams initiative ok so it's
something that's already merged actually
in jdk nine and this part of more
concurrency youtube's jump and the name
of the project is called acha project
correct ok so so what is it acha is a
tool kit for building reactive and
distributed applications so we've been
around a number of years already and
yeah now it seems we were hitting
mainstream really so here at javaone and
talking about it tomorrow at the panel
discussion today already and we have two
parts of it so one is the concurrency
utilities so it's much easier to program
concurrent applications using our car on
the JVM when it just is with native
frets and on the other hand we do the
distributed part of it so we do
clustering and microservices and a lot
of tools for that ok so it's all
connected also to the streams yes I
streams is one of our sub projects and
this basically when we were doing a lot
of these messaging systems in the past
acha would be the fastest part of the
system but at some point you need to
integrate your new system with some
legacy systems yeah and turns out well
occurs fast so we ended up killing the
legacy systems so we forget ok so we
need some way to integrate systems like
that preferably in a streaming fashion
this is where we started with erect
extremes initiative we invited pivotal
and red card and the guys from netflix o
RX java to collaborate on reactive
streams initiative which is a standard
but everybody now has kind of
figured okay we agree on that and all of
the libraries or rx Java pivotal's
reactor have implemented the same
standard so it allows you to integrate
with libraries regardless if it's coming
from acha ecosystem if it's coming from
the pivot or ecosystem they all
interoperate seamlessly and the key
feature is like I was talking about for
let's not kill the legacy applications
with just overloading them the feature
of reactive streams is that it allows
for applications to go as fast as we can
but not faster so it's visits with
dynamic mode of adjusting the speed of
processing exactly to the maximum but
not over it and so how can people find
more information about the project yeah
so the best place to find information
about the project is for occurred dot IO
website that's our project website
obviously we're on github as well and
verse a number of other projects so
light burns for company I work for is
behind the play framework and Villar GaN
framework so vets or you can check it
out on light banter com okay great
anything else you wanted to share with
developers should uh no well I mean
let's think about it can they actually
contribute to the project yeah obviously
we're actually right in the middle of
what we call alpaca so a funny kind of
pun what camera did many years ago was
basically provide these many ways to
integrate various technologies and
systems and we do a very similar thing
right now with very active streams
initiative so what r Paco is it's
basically a collection of community
projects but aim to do the same thing
but in a streaming fashion so we're
really looking to have more contributors
and more interaction with the community
in retrospect and more testing I suppose
as well yes exactly we do need feedback
and see what people use what people
would like to see feedback on the
existing implementations as well thank
you thank you for coming to us and I'm
talking about thanks a lot i'm cool
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
