application
welp I what do you need in how it goes
you go to NetBeans and you select the
wizard and I prefer to using the F XML
applications because it's easier to draw
on the scene builder so you just open up
being select Java flex to the category
and then our Java FX FX in our
application and that will give you
sample code with our sample F XML the
code looks like these extend the
application with a start method in our
stage object that loads the F XML file
and if you want to have an idea how it's
gonna work on raspberry pi you can just
add the set fullscreen to for the
desktop for your desktop or laptop and
this will launch your application wait
the full screen mode on your laptop just
press asked and it will bring you a
window a regular window not full screen
perfect really easy to code most of the
things you're gonna do is like define
properties with these classes not using
the product primitives of Java you're
gonna use preferably the for example the
simple double property of Java FX why
you gonna do that because you want to
tie these value this object to a UI
component to show what's inside in this
variable here okay
and why is this interesting because you
have bindings when you use the binding
API of Java facts you can actually
connect property of a Java object to a
component visual component on Java
effects so whenever these probably the
value changes the component
automatically loads the new value so you
don't need to keep changing the value of
your visual component you just change
the data and you can use unidirectional
binding or bi-directional binding which
means if it's bi-directional let's say
you change the data in the component and
then the property of your Java object is
updated it's bi-directional
here's an example so let's say you have
you want to read the humidity
information from your raspberry pi and
you have a component on your interface a
label humidity label the ad f XML
adaptation is what connected this object
to the element configure in your F XML
file and then you code a monitor that
will keep continually connecting to the
rad service and reading the data from
the raspberry pi from there you can get
the property from your humidity label
and bind to the property of your monitor
so your humidity monitor will keep
updating a thread will keep updating the
value in this value probably on that
object and with the bind it will
automatically update the UI for you you
don't actually need to call that kind of
thing you just bind these two properties
okay
you can play a little bit with bindings
you can play with calculations let's say
you want to do some math on conversion
between temperature and Celsius to find
high you can just automatically binding
between those objects let's say I want
to add multiply and you can have an
object that represents something for
example I have a an object that
represents the calculation of something
and then you have the binding between
three variables that represents a value
for you so let's say I want to have a
very high property in a Celsius Park
property so you have all that
automatically for you you don't have to
keep you don't have to keep calculating
manually finally to use Java effects on
raspberry pi you're going to need of
course connect to the raspberry pi and
the things API gateway which is rest
services and here's the cool thing
Java EE 7 came out and we have a new API
called jax-rs 2.0 client API so you
don't actually need to code the HTTP URL
connection or input stream those crazy
things you know just you can just use a
simple API you can go to Jersey java.net
in download if you want but I have put a
zip on this website that comes with the
necessary libraries from the last
version of Jersey so you can just
download from there and put in your job
FX leave directory okay so how does the
jax-rs client API works basically from
the client beuter you create a new
client from that client with that client
at hand you also need an endpoint so
what I like to do usually building these
kind of things is like give you give it
a template so this is the URL template
HTTP the host the port and slash things
which is the things gateway API and then
I get the system property so I can
change this if I want by giving commands
- D
host and given Nui IP address but I
cannot actually hard-code something if I
just not feeling good with parameters
okay with those values I can now put
that on a map and use the UI builder
giving the UI template building the
thing server URI and building from the
map with the parameters hostnet a host
and port and that gives me a client
think server your eye client okay all
right we have a client
so how do you get the humidity for
example we just tell hey things survey
right go to the path slash humidity
create a request and call the get HTTP
command and convert whatever you get to
a string object this swing is the
humidity information from the raspberry
pi that was collected from the Arduino
board okay
so it's pretty much easy to connect to
the rest services using the new drug
first client API one important hint to
dealing with threads in Java FX so you
want your application to keep reading
data from your mothers your sensors but
if you have been working or had worked
with UI development you know that the UI
is updated in a thread and if you want
to do background work you have to create
new threads for that and if you want to
update the UI you have to schedule the
UI update task the job in a queue so
then it gets updated in the same thread
that thing that concept has been since
Java swing came out for Java effects the
same idea we create a primal task in the
run method we read the data from the
client API which is the things humidity
path creator requires get gives medieval
I convert to float and then I create our
enable and send that to platform dot run
later
so these will catch you the UI update
process to be run by the thread UI the
UI thread ok so you don't have a hank in
your UI that's the bindings so ok here
so this is like one class and this class
is updating a property in this object in
this monitor object setting the float
value of humidity this value here is
this value properly so what what I'm
saying is the humidity monitor is
updating one property of the humidity
model service and the humidity label is
binded to the humidity monitor property
so I don't actually have I don't know
where this value is being shown up in
the UI I just I'm just I'm just offering
the data from the humidity module
service and then if you want to connect
that inter label with a chart whatever
you want you can just use this idea
finally when you have your target task
you just create a timer give it a demon
boolean value so if you kill the
application doesn't keep running the
thread and you start your service you
schedule beginning at zero delay and are
timely delayed so you can run for
example the humidity service for each 5
seconds so let me show you what the
automation effects application so this
is the automation effects application so
each each component here is connected
through to a service and these service
offers property JavaFX properties and I
just bind the components to those
properties and if the data is updated
the UI is automatically updated the
chart here is really easy to do you can
look at the source code of this
application if you want an idea
all the components are connected using
rest api using ajax client api</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
