technology Network we're here on the
floor of devoxx UK talking to members of
the java community i have andreas on the
right andreas how are you today fine
fine thank you very much sorry for all
right you're a java champion your canoe
fellow you do all sorts of things right
yes I do but first particularly one of
the things that I really love about
these kind of settings like de box UK is
how easy is to get in touch with the
community and precisely that's one of
the things that we're doing here at
devoxx UK we have a two-day haka gotten
hacker got the meetings differ from
regular hackathons in just one thing
we'd never throw away the code of we do
in a haka garden is that we get people
together they hack on some code they
hack on open source projects and at the
end of the session they push the
contribution back to the community ok
but I've heard the phrase hacker Tigers
the bad guy right uh not exactly i would
say that is the a bad image coming from
Hollywood hacker actually means someone
that is passionate about creating code
about the craftsmanship occurred if I
can say so and most of the time a hacker
is not in isolation actually they they
tribe in communities so what we want to
do in a hacker gardens actually a
portmanteau of the hacker community and
kindergarten so what we're doing is kind
of like a playground of hackers from
different communities coming together in
one place sharing ideas generating
synergy and at the end of the time is
making a positive influence in one
particular open source project Wow yeah
let's say I was going to say a lot of
people contributing that sounds a little
like open source to me yeah exactly very
cool tell me some of the projects you're
working on upstairs well upstairs we
have members from the JCP
working on the D CK for Java money which
will be done pretty soon if I as a cent
also respect to have some news on that
there's also I think he might be the
especially for a big data or some j's
are related to Big Data JC j is eight
lambdas we work also working on a
templating system called lazy bones that
allows you to bootstrap different
projects and we just push the first
contribution is called the after born
and effects template this is a simple
template for you to bootstrap an after
boring effects project if for those
people that do not know what after
burning effects is is a simple it's
probably the simplest minimal framework
that you can have for creating traffics
applications and you do these hacker
gardens all over the world right yes we
do we try to make it happen excellent
and I hear you're gonna come to Java one
yes there's going to be at this this
sign is going to be the second pakka
gotten but this time the name is going
to stick to hack a garden because as you
say something the war hacker has some
negative connotation with some people so
last year we have to rename it to cope
guard and what we were there but just
wait for us could find you nobody could
find it to say oh is it haka garden Zuko
guarded but this time is going to be
haka guarding we're gonna be next to the
Java demo grounds where most of the
people are so just look for us because
we're gonna make a lot of trouble in a
very positive way excellent and you
don't have to be an expert you'll come
in and somebody will be there to help
you out yes yes most of the times we
have the experts and project leads of
the different projects are we working on
on on on the premises so this is a nice
opportunity and a great opportunity for
people that have no idea how open source
project works our open source software
is produced to get in touch with not
just someone that knows but somewhat
actually leads the project and the you
get you really get some much experience
out of it and I can guarantee you that
the least thing that you can learn from
this experience is this new ID shark
trust me because we always do pair
programming this is such a wonderful
experience Wow I just love that you're
doing this is the whole open source
mentality is the java community you're
really bringing two things together well
thank you so much thank you very much
sorry great this is Tori wheel with the
