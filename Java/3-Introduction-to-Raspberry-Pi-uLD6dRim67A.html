to talk about raspberry pi words the
famous single board computer raspberry
pi is a very small with a very
affordable price project that you can
run Linux and make a very good and
powerful types different types of
software raspberry pi runs Linux and
many other operational system on SD card
so the SD card is the hard disk of the
Raspberry Pi and the main proposal is to
make education and prototypes with
Raspberry Pi but you can make commercial
projects it's based on the system on
chip from Broadcom khaled bcn to 8 3 5
so it has the CPU the GPU the DSP the
DRAM and a single USB port and it runs
on 700 megahertz you can actually
overclock to 1 Giga hurt without losing
the warrant and the GPU is a video core
for running at 250 megahertz so you have
in our Raspberry Pi the video HDMI and
composite video and you have USB port or
ports you have all audio jacks so you
can have our assistant in your Raspberry
Pi and the storage is a SD card so you
will need a simple SD card from
our cameras to install your operational
system and you have the GPIO where you
can plug sensors control models control
amps LEDs and things like that and
support for serial connection using UART
I squared C or SPI we have two models of
Raspberry Pi the model way is the simple
one with less memory just one USB port
no internet connect connection and the
power rating is around 1.5 vats in the
model B we have more resource 512
megabytes of RAM 2 USB ports the
internet connection and but you have
another power rating is more than three
but we have other connections in our
board for camera and also for displays
if you want to start playing with
Raspberry Pi you will need two Raspberry
Pi board you will need the power supply
with five volts and at least one end and
don't try to power your your Raspberry
Pi using your PC USB port because it
doesn't have the coolant enough to feed
your Raspberry Pi and the SD card you
will need at least four gigabytes SD
card and it is optional a Wi-Fi dongle
the Wi-Fi or any other one small one or
at the net
action you will need to download some
operational system here is the URL the
official website for downloading and the
raspbian is the most popular and is the
one that we are going to use during this
set of videos so after downloading it
will be a zip file you just need to
uncompress in some directory and you are
going to have an image file this image
you must transfer
you must flush the image into your SD
card and for doing that we have the DG
comment line for mac and linux users and
if you are Windows user you can download
this utility for doing that you have the
tailored information official detailed
information in this URL after doing that
you are ready to boot your Raspberry Pi
so you just insert your SD card take
care with the SD card connector is large
because it's not strong and if once you
broke is very hard to to fix it
so plug a monitor and a keyboard we
recommend you to start playing with
spirit by using a monitor or even your
television with composite cable you can
use with your Raspberry Pi so power up
and the hootch user will be P I PI and
the password is raspberry very simple
and easy after booting you can try to
update your Raspberry Pi if you have
internet connection we recommend you to
do that to make sure that you have the
latest version of your operational
system so we use the sudo apt-get or pH
and ABI grid and you've done so you can
also try to run the graphical user
interface the X server just type start
acts like the old times and you will see
the graphical user interface and you
will need a mouse so we invite you to
pause this video and make sure that your
Raspberry Pi is working and so after
doing that we are going to show you how
to make a network setup
so the network setup for a basic
configuration with Ethernet cable you
have the file with lash EDC slash
interfaces slash network just edited
this file and you will see the I face
eth0 and DA JCP so this is the standard
configuration if you put the Ethernet
cable you will be able to have a
connection but if you want to start a IP
you just edited this file and change
from GA GCP to static and add those
three lines with your network
information if you want to make wireless
setup you just need to add the last two
lines of this slide with your wireless
name and your wireless key is very
simple and easy if you want to make a
defensive Raspberry Pi setup like
improving the video memory or
overclocking you can use the raspy
config is a very nice utivich
that you can use also to make
regional settings and much more
configuration without command-line after
doing that once you have the network
connection setup done you can use SSH
protocol to access your raspberry pi if
you are Linux or Mac us user just type
SS stage by add the IP number of your
raspberry Word
and if you are Windows user you can use
this utility download and use it booty
and it's very simple and nice and we
also recommend you to use FileZilla
which is a very nice utility for
transferring files from your PC to your
raspberry and it will be very useful to
write Java code and send to your
raspberry board now we are going to make
a demonstration how to access SSH
protocol to make a connection between
your PC and your raspberry and also how
to use FileZilla to transfer one file to
your word so I had here the putti SSH
client installed on my Windows machine
and I'm going to open the program and
put my IP address in this case I have
this IP address for my raspberry pi
and I'm going to click open and type TI
as my login and raspberry as a password
so now I'm here in my Raspberry Pi board
remotely connected using SSH and now I
don't need the monitor or the keyboard
locally in my Raspberry Pi I can do
almost everything remotely and now let
me show you how I did the setup for the
network so I have here this directory
and the interface file here and I have
two interface for attach one wireless
another one wired so the wider one is
static connection with the IP number 10
and the wireless is the IP number 11 and
in the wireless connection information I
also have the SSID from my wireless and
the PS key as the key to access my
wireless so that's the basic
configuration
and once you have the network read and
working it's much more easy to maintain
and should transfer and play with Java
applications on your Raspberry Pi now
let me show you how to transfer a file
using FileZilla utility I'm going to
open the site manager and in the site
manager I have my new site here kind of
Portuguese class and I'm going to type
my IP address the number 10 is my
raspberry pi the user by and the
password raspberry and I'm going to
connect
now I have here my Raspberry Pi home
directory listing and here my local
directory I'm going to copy the license
file from the JDK 7 director to my
Raspberry Pi board and using the SSH
connection I can check if the operation
was successful or not
so I have the license file here license
I can type license and check this file
that I just transferred so that's the
basic idea of communicating the basic
communication between your laptop your
PC and your Raspberry Pi and thanks a
lot for watching this video next video
we are going to talk about Java and
Raspberry Pi see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
