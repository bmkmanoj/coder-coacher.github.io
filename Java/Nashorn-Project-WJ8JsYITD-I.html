Network and I'm here today at devoxx UK
talking to Attila sogeti hi Attila hi so
Angela tell us what you do for Oracle
all right well I'm an engineer formerly
a principal member of technical stuff
that I work at the java.lang tools group
which comprises people working on the
compiler the language the libraries and
few other things and my work is in the
few other things category which right
now is writing a new JavaScript runtime
for JDK 8 Java since Java 6 is shipping
with the scripting environment in it and
it used to be Mozilla's Rhino JavaScript
runtime which was an open-source runtime
that Oracle appropriated for use in the
JDK but for various reasons we felt the
need that to actually implement one from
the scratch and that's what we are doing
now and this is the this is the project
that's known as an ass horn so where are
we right now with Nashorn there well we
are in a fairly good spot right now with
the project it is slated to ship with
jdk 8 this fall or whatever or whatever
chips we are feature and specification
compliant completely we are targeting
the the newest
version of the Java keishon actually the
ECMAScript specification 5.1 and it
comes with a test suite of some 11.5
thousand tests and nastran is passing
hundred percent of those tests and to my
best knowledge it is the only JavaScript
runtime in existence that actually
passes all of those tests so we are
fairly proud of having achieved that and
now that we are fully functional the
next next front that we are battling on
as is squeezing as much performance as
we can out of this thing so last weekend
you had an event and organized by the
London a Java user group yes and so how
did it go oh it was quite fabulous it
was so yeah it was advertised as nastran
hackathon and it was the first event of
this kind organised ever it coincided
quite nicely with the first release of
Nass one in jdk because just this
weekend released jdk 8 early access
release build 82 and that's the first
one that actually has NASA on integrated
in it so we we had this event where we
basically had the participants come in
with their own laptops they were either
given USB sticks or DVD DVD discs with
the source code to the OpenJDK and the
NASA nor they could just pull the
currently live repo we worked with them
to have them build OpenJDK en masse horn
and then start playing with it we it was
mostly a so independent assisted kind of
work so myself was there we had been
summers from the Java user community
there and ben evans and they and we were
mostly there to help people troubleshoot
their issues but we gave them hints as
to what they might be doing but they
were doing a lot of interesting things
we got an very nice tutorial of how to
integrate nass horn into your Eclipse
projects we got somebody was
taking the module system that's being
used in most modern with the JavaScript
frameworks they require Jas and adopted
it to to actually run with NASA phone we
had people who were just experimenting
with writing Java programs that that
integrate NASA in it so they were
writing something in Java and then and
there Java program was calling into
JavaScript passing variables to and from
Devon measuring compilation times for
the script we had one person who aside
from building the openjdk and that's
when he also built the Google's v8
runtime and then he was running some
performance benchmarks against computer
comparing the two so overall we had a
lot of interesting projects they
resulted in a lot of lessons learned for
them and for myself as well so this was
a really good because i left the event
with with a list of seven eight items
smaller bugfuck smaller bug fixes future
requests and other things in for me it
provided a really really good
understanding of how people will
probably be using this project in the
future and this still can influence some
of our design decisions down the road so
it was really really helpful i'm
absolutely glad that that Ben and Ben
and the Java is a community decided to
organize this it was absolutely worth
attending so can also individuals
contribute to the project yes absolutely
a mass one is in the open Jay in the
usual OpenJDK repo so the mercurial repo
for the OpenJDK it has a separate so
called forest that is NASCAR and the
contribution guidelines are the same
contribution guidelines as our day for
any other part of OpenJDK so if you have
an oracle contributor agreement already
you can just submit patches to us if you
don't have it you can sign it and then
you can start contributing patching not
just to us and to be honest we
we would really be happy to have a lot
of community involvement we would like
people contributing tests we would like
having people contributing maybe a
browser emulation framework there is a
bunch of libraries that we don't provide
we provide the basic runtime as we
should but things that the typical
browser api is a canvas html5 audio and
so on that are these days are being used
to build nice interactive applications
we don't have them but obviously we
could have all of those working on top
of the Java libraries Java API s so you
know I think people should consider that
as a challenge and we would be more than
happy to see as many people as as we can
coming with their ideas to the project
so yes the project as open source since
December right yes it was a pretty much
a Christmas present to the community we
managed to open source it to on the last
work day before the Christmas holidays
so yep yeah it's open sourced it's out
there anybody can download the source
and inspected play with it modify it and
submit patches thank you for talking to
us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
