tell the system to change now he will
change based on who I am well java code
when I one method cause another method
he doesn't know who the caller is
because because there's many different
colors but he want any he can't
recognize and then he could probably
look up the stack and see the next frame
but that doesn't really tell him who the
application is so if I'm a hashmap and i
know i'm creating a new hashmap what
size should i take so typical hash maps
will take about 16 right and but what
size should i be if i know the guy
that's coming in is going to add on
average you always add to tells it into
the bucket then i probably would like to
create a chosen now rather than wait to
my eventual growth so what i can do then
is every time someone interacts with me
i create a signal set you know different
signals i might not just have warm but
one of them will probably be i resize
the map and i give it back to him and
then every time he comes back to me and
says okay new hashmap this is a piece of
code is going to execute there's a
signal signature stored now i only
understand it giving it to him but he
holds it and he says uh every time you I
talked to you here it is so the next
time you might come in in a request if
it's the same flow I will have the same
signal signature i will look at the
signal signature and say oh I know this
guy I know this person please I'm
thousand yeah he's that one ok I'm going
to change my internal mechanism because
I know what's going to predict so so for
prediction to work we always need to say
is where am i what is the what is the
context for the prediction and at the
moment bytecode can predict what's going
to happen next because it hasn't gotten
ability to see who is a bull he was
driving to work but so the signal is
like it kind of like a code here's the
code give it back to me and I recognize
it and I think it's like a call center
like when you have a year working in a
call center and someone rings you and
it's a particular customer if you had a
previous interaction with them and it
wasn't so good you probably would change
I'll have your ass so ok so sometimes
you don't want the customer to know that
you gave a signal that says warning
because then we will do yeah so but you
might give him something back to say
give her back to me and then I know who
you are because you're going to have
many a hashmap is going to have many
callers but every
he gave a signal then he can optimize
himself and that's how we create truly
adaptive systems let's say we can say we
don't have to worry about which has
hashmap default sizes we let the system
learn and try to predict it every time
and of course the signal set will change
so when I give a signal into the hashmap
or into the context of the execution he
will try to do it and if it didn't work
out he will create a new signals inside
the signals at the last store so this is
how cells work in in biological systems
right it's that they altered their own
internal structures based on previous
interactions that's why they call
complex systems because we can't predict
what's coming next because we need to
know the past because the past has kind
of infected or not kind of changed what
the reaction will always be now so it's
a chemical reaction we don't know what
previous directions there and what the
state is side we don't want to look
inside but those signals are what's
driving the biological system so job on
applications neither wow so this is
mind-blowing stuff is this for the
radical slow this is yeah we think it we
demonstrated hell we can already change
the behavior how we can optimize occur
we're focus on performance in this
regard I see this very applicable to to
any type of system but we IND in the the
demo today I demonstrated the
adaptiveness controlling the workload
determining what's the optimal level of
concurrency and getting faster response
times than the normal JVM running
without changing code because we made
the system adapter so we're not going to
change we actually at the moment we
enhance these applications with this
pool there is it when we talk about the
Java platform well that enhancement has
to come in already India we're able to
enhance typical of more at the
application level but really the
enhancements would be better if they
were put into all the Java libraries
that every library every time it went a
different pathway that's more expensive
that the guy had a signal that said like
cache hits cash MIT that's a signal
every time you go to if you have a
component that's a cash if we go to the
database that's a Miss and then I and
then when it's in memory it's a hit and
if I could know that then I can see that
the ratio and I can understand why my
particular transactions are slower than
not a transaction because maybe they
always hit the cash and the other ones
have to hit the database or something
like that somewhere external data grid
okay so that's the base that's the
forest part for Russian ok so we build
end up because okay so now we've got
this application memory because signals
represent a kind of a memory of the
system that's external to the code
because we can't put in the code we want
the code to have this memory but it's
contextual comes conversational
everything our view is that all data is
conversational that every part is like
when you interact with a company they
your customer that's a kind of a
customer conversation then when you have
a particular order it's a its order
conversation in the context of a
customer so everything becomes a tree
structure of conversations the whole
world is the conversation okay and some
conversations go on forever so you're
you work for oracle here that's a
conversation for a very long time
probably right and so so it's not like
the way we see a conversation is
engaging you know they come and go and
you have sometimes customers that will
only call you every year and so but
that's a conversation that still it's a
long-running conversation but every time
you've interacted you've learned a bit
more about our customer or you may be
changed their behavior no like so if you
think about a service supplier or like
like to take a car dealer I go into a
car dealer I ask for service on my car
let's say the service wasn't good I'm
happy I make make a complaint the next
time I go into that I want him to
remember who I am and to change his
behavior role at the red carpet and give
me better service you want that at least
at least wants to get the better service
now of course then as soon as that he
gives me that he's gonna change his
behavior because bi a tada I become a
normal person because he's he's already
got rid of the previous history he said
okay I gave him a good service now he
can't expect her all the time I don't
you know drew loops or something for
that well okay so so you see he's
adapting so even so what you're saying
is software is kind of stupid right the
software is dumb it's cuz it's
memoryless so there hasn't got this
memory okay it has memory in terms of
there's a database right answer
technical memory but it doesn't have
contact context memory writes a
conversation okay so we had that
then the okay the problem that we have
is we're moving to the cloud and JVMs
are coming up and down this is the whole
elasticity of the Claire the chicken
applications can come up and it can come
down because you're you're you're
dealing that because the capacity issues
and you don't want cost because every
JVM or a machine itself consumes costs
because you're renting it and so
everything's becomes more transient now
and and but the application is transient
today because if i start a java app it
starts up if I shut it down and start it
up again it will do the same behavior
and let's say there's an error in it
well every time I started up it will
probably crash it's not gonna say I
remember when I did a lot going on right
I'm not going to do that code and the
reason I can't do that is because
there's no where it is a memory of it
now okay so this is where we come to the
next stage is it okay where do I put
that memory well the answer is the
matrix okay now we're all really freaky
so okay so before i go into what the
matrix is now i am i'm sorry i gotta cut
off man because we just want to give
people a taste and not a complete brain
don't get here but I'm sure they can
learn more okay for me okay well very
quickly matrix is the memory for all the
JVM s so every time with JVM starts up
it connects to this matrix is a single
JVM right and it stores its memory the
memory in counsels behavior not the date
and not the database is nothing like
that and that's it's the memory so so
what my JVM shuts down and it starts
back up a connection says I am dis JVM
and he says here your neo you need any
downloads his informational pack and
that's the signals that we've astore so
we have signals now in the in the matrix
and the signals are brought back into
the JVM and the JVM looks like it has a
memory Wow very cool thank you so much
I'm gonna cut you up don't lie though my
brains blowing up here so I really
appreciate it and we're going to get
more information from you I bet you I'm
going to make you write an article or
something like that so thank you very
much ok this is Tori wheel from the
Oracle technology Network thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
