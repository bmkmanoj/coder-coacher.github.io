yeah great keynotes last night both of
you thank you thank you thanks for
having us on yeah it's it's my pleasure
so the reason we're here all three of us
is that toral and I were talking about
your AI blog posts which were also the
topic of your keynote and total had so
many interesting questions because you
come from more of a biology standpoint
then well most of the rest of us here at
the tech at a tech conference and I
found myself thinking I wish torial
could just ask these questions the team
and see what what kind of discussion
would get from it with without me
getting in between and sort of
butchering your thought out questions so
that's what we're here and so I thought
we'd start with it yeah from the AI well
yeah because one of the things I really
want it because you sort of gone into
the AI community and one of the things
that I really find fascinating about the
biological systems it's that they're not
just about the sort of raw neural
computational power like if you look at
say Abby Abby has the brain science with
sesame seed but biologically they can do
everything that we can do I mean the
difference between us and Abby is
miniscule it's that we're basically the
same we can do the same stuff and I
think one of the reasons why white
biology is so complex and we can do all
those really weird things with our
brains is that we have those you know
several several systems layered on top
of each other so we have the neural
network but that just the baseline
because then you have the chemical
network on top of that and you have a
whole sort of time lag on top of that
because you have neural transmitters
which you know basically take a few
seconds or a few minutes and maybe half
an hour then you have the whole gene
regulation of let's make more neural
transmitters and let's make more
hormones and you know when you have
growth over timing of changes over time
so compared to technological systems
biologists system have all of those
multiple layers which actually add
tremendously to the intelligence because
the intelligence is that base layer of
neurology that from a biology science
biology point of view is really new and
it's not the most important one I mean
is there anything similar to that type
of chemical system within a I I haven't
thought of it that way I think it's very
interesting I think it's really
interesting to think about the neural
that the neural network and then the
chemicals on top of that I don't think
that people think about that very often
and when it comes to AI i think that
people i think people both overestimate
and underestimate the brain is what I
kind of come to just by talking to
people and by thinking about what I what
I knew in my own misconceptions we
underestimate the brain in that we think
Oh calculators much faster than we are
you know all these things are much more
you know Google search engine all these
fancy a either they're much smarter than
just our simple brain we can barely do
math at all and that's actually really
not true like our brain is the content
that calculations per second is
outrageous and I heard someone called
the brain the human brain the most
complex known object in the universe
which is pretty cool it is it is pretty
cool but you could say the same thing
about a whale brain or a dog brain so
you said that about the Beor about it so
I I guess actually I'm curious about
that explain why why you're saying that
Abby brain is as complex the human brain
because if you look at from a biological
point of view the thing that makes us
human it is this tiny tiny piece of
what's actually going on so if you look
at what Abby does and you know they have
really complex societies so they can do
first of all they can do all of their
bodily functions of course everything in
their body
works right from the region they ate
they digest yeah they work they fly they
grow all the motor skills all of the
motor skills work and they have right
now a complex social society which means
they can recognize different individuals
they have a really advanced
communication systems which means that
they can transfer information about you
know there is a flower with this quality
of nectar in that direction this
distance so they have a really advanced
community they have information transfer
between individuals they have
information transfer within the bee
community which means they can regulate
temperature they can make it bigger or
smaller they can make revolutions kill
the Queen in a hot ball of fire that's
it really horrible they don't do that
they do that is sort of that is so very
interested for the Queen when she gets
old I mean they're all they're all
female foot but so when the Queen gets
old she can't produce the hormones that
regulates the hive which means there's a
revolution and they all sort of gang up
together and they sit on her and the bus
so that she heats up and dies is so
annoying her after all she's done for
them absolutely kidding there it's their
kids kids yes we just talk about bees
sure actually I really wanna know I
don't get talk I don't talk to enough
biologists I've been you know reading so
many physicists and engineers but but
this is this is great it is I mean so
basically and you can do all of this
with a brain the size of a sesame seed
right yeah and more I mean there's so
much more there better vision than us in
many aspects but they're severely
lacking in intelligence when it comes to
comparing to us in right and well they
are severely lacking in the intelligence
that we have right right i mean you can
say all that you know instinct you know
elephants can sense land 400 miles away
they / / or water or something like that
one of those situations when there is
there's all there's all kind of animal
intelligence but I mean the problem is
that we are sort of Lackey
good definition of intelligence yeah
we're lacking something that we can use
to compare ourselves octopus elephant
bees aliens and computers we don't have
tests that will work for all of these
unities right basically because we don't
have definition of intelligence that
goes outside the human perspective so we
deem animals intelligence when they can
do things like us when they can
recognize themselves in the mirror for
example that's one of the key tests for
animals intelligence but you know you
wouldn't really expect an AI to
recognize itself in a mirror either
right unless you programmed it to and
then it probably pretty easily could
actually write yeah um but but the
question is would it recognize itself as
a self I mean that that's you get to a
whole other question you know you get
that that's this entire debate about
consciousness and about about you know
that that whole thing but but back to
what you're saying so so what you're
kind of saying is that there's that
there's a lot going on in biology and
it's not just a matter of a linear
intelligence scale but there's a lot of
things going on a lot of layers like you
said and when it comes to AI the
question is do we need to mimic all
those layers or is that is the important
thing something that is more linear with
AI and can we build something build a
machine that has a certain kind of
intelligence that's important to us that
it's actually a very simple situation
and I don't know but I think as I said I
think we underestimate brains but i also
think we also overestimate brains in
that people don't don't get that
actually the brain is a pretty weak
computer as far as it goes and it has to
be very slow the
the speed at which information travels
inside the brain is molasses compared to
what it does in the computer so it's
this weird thing where we were we're
trying to emulate one component of it
but we also have we easily can defeat
defeat it with another component but I
guess I would probably turn this
question around on you because you
understand brains a lot better than I do
so I would ask you what you think what
you think as we're as you're creating
kind of a I you know how should we
measure intelligence and and are we are
we are technologists under estimating
the challenge of human level creating
human level intelligence by ignoring
some of these these biological systems
and layers that that computers don't
traditionally have yeah I really think
so i really think that ignoring
basically the chemistry and the hormone
input is a huge error because you're
going to end up with something that is
very i mean if we are going to continue
measure intelligence basically in being
like us we do the sort of human level
intelligence of a of an AI and even if
it's going to be completely different
we're going to sort of measure its
intelligence compared to us then we sort
of wanted to do some of things that we
do we want it to be a similar to us
because otherwise we wouldn't recognize
it US intelligence in the same way that
we don't recognize an ant ass
intelligence a quick question I have
those so you talk about hormones and
chemicals and all of that that's part of
the layers we're talking about but
really all that is information right
hormones is just it's just information
that causes some kind of some kind of
synapses to fire in certain ways and
when you're building when really
something as a computer why would you
need that you know we humans human
brains need blood and oxygen we don't
need to mimic that in a computer right
and and sells notes what perhaps not
well but but the point is blood is a
mechanism to carry energy and other
things to cells in the brain we have
instead here we have transistors and you
have electricity and you so so I feel
like when we talk about something like
hormones would naturally be part of the
code wouldn't that be just part of the
algorithms that we build well I'm not a
coder so I'm not really sure how you
have not either but but yes thank you
know that I would say that the sort of
the chemical levels that would be our
sort of you know the core programming
that you talked about yesterday that the
things that really drives us so if you
would make a perfect copy of the brain
of all of the neural firing but you
ignored the chemistry you took away the
chemistry you would have nothing I mean
you wouldn't have anything you know from
the drive to get a Nobel Prize to drive
to go to the toilet it would all be gone
all chemicals that's all chemicals to
the brain without those hormones and
chemicals is just like a blank computer
don't ya interesting so so one of the
interesting things about neural networks
is that you know they constantly
changing it's not it's not a very stable
system to have this constant level of
chemistry that altar set and it alters
it on on so many levels and as such time
scales you have this chemicals that will
alter it you know right now I left well
and I had my cup of tea and I had
breakfast this morning which means my
young URIs are firing in one way it if I
hadn't done that I would be a different
human because my chemistry right now
currently I'm on an all nighter so
was working on my posts on it what what
is what's that doing what what explain
how that is changing me as a human so
what is tin is all of these miniscule
changes are going on where he's going to
say you know prioritize this thing
instead of this thing prioritize getting
your next meal instead of you know doing
something special prioritize this
instead of that you're going to have
mood swings and then you're going to go
why can't my rational brain sort of
override those mood swings but it's
actually the other way around right the
brain is serving the body in a lot of
ways I mean is serving the body right
yeah this is stuff I haven't thought of
it's very interesting to hear a
biologist perspective on something like
AI because there's I there's and and
then the thinkers that I read they're
not thinking about this that much either
I don't think no because but that's the
sort of this is a really human
misconception yeah should've go the IM
brain the body is just you know stuff
that happens to be around me the me the
self that is the brain therefore I can
sort of get rid of all right we don't
realize how much of us yeah our
personalities is related to actually
starving our body's needs like if we I
think you know people always talk about
you know Ray Kurzweil type people talk
about uploading our consciousness
uploading our brains to a computer and
the assumption is that that everything
that that makes me me would be there but
it's like you're saying that's not true
at all actually I'm not serving a body
the brain is a totally different
creature you're probably a totally
different personality if you have one
and I my perception is that that's going
to be extreme it's going to be a lot
easier to transfer your brain to a dog
then it's going to be to transfer a
brain to a computer a lot easier that
would be cool by the way it would be it
would be amazing that look very very
cool I mean imagine if there were a
human level intelligent dog how cool it
what a popular dog and then you would
you know imagine the information that
you could get access to right because if
you had a communicative human level
intelligence human communication
intelligence level dog I mean
they dogs are pretty smart in their own
way but they have access to so much
information that we don't have their
smell system I mean most we have so bad
noses their poor oh yeah they smell on
dog home layers probably we have no idea
because we don't write anything in our
brains that is similar enough for us
right so the person could be in there
and then be like oh okay okay okay
here's what's really happening start
like you know typing with the nose or
hard awkward you know and and and
explaining yeah and I want to do this
but then you even have sort of rebuild
your brain because we don't have that
neural I mean we have the neural system
to smell things but it's so much bigger
in a dog right so you would also have a
change of personality based on that
input right so so what does this mean so
we're saying that it's hard to produce a
human like you know it's hard to produce
human style computers that really will
act like us and feel like us in value
what we value but the question is if
they do build something that is human
level intelligent whatever you want to
call that it has the capacity to solve
problems that kind of problems that we
could solve or whatever if we can do
that then without those hormones without
those things that make us biology you
know I always just assume that it would
be and I always said it's like it's like
my laptop it's not any even if it
becomes super intelligent it doesn't
have any more human to it or empathy to
it or anything like that then the laptop
does without being specifically
programmed so what do you think that's
going to be like if we get to a computer
that can be as smart as we are but
there's no there's there there there's
none of this other biological stuff with
humans duffle well I think first of all
we're going to have a huge problem
communicating with it I mean we have
such problems communicating with octopus
it's not I mean it with this other yeah
I mean we communicate I mean we are not
very good at communicating with other
intelligent beings from this earth where
did this we are not good at it right
we're trying to make
things that are almost as smart as us do
things like well go through that hoop if
you mean yes and go through that hoop if
you mean no yeah and we can only do that
for the species who are extremely
willing to try to communicate so like a
dolphin or a dog or something like that
we can't do that with an octopus because
that would be the octopus with disco
right are you trying to get me to do and
why would I do that and go away instead
I serving me and that doesn't know the
oculus is even have phones you just want
to deal with you he has known issues
that's its own its own and and you can't
really even they don't have a drive to
communicate with humans they communicate
with it with each other beautifully but
they wouldn't have a drive to
communicate with humans and I think you
might have the same problem with an AI
like why should it communicate with
humans unless you really program it to
right why would it want to do that and
wow should we understand it how should
we ask the questions can we really
program it to that kids are trying but
there's so many different things to
think about and it's so easy to mess it
up and I think we cannot understand it
on unless we make it really human-like
because we really bad and communicating
with other stuff right yeah
but then again I think that we're gonna
have to work on this sort of broad level
intelligence test because that's what's
really missing you're going to have to
develop some kind of essay to test
intelligence that is not human based
right I think they'll don't have a scale
for computers that will come up with but
I think it's a bit of a misnomer to say
human level intelligence because it's
like you said what does that mean and
it's oversimplifying the concept hugely
to even say that but but you know
they'll have some system to determine
computer level intelligence that can
equal a lot of our capacity and then at
that point the question is whether it
then starts recursively improving and
kind of skyrockets beyond us and the one
thing I mean one thing I'm really
curious about when it comes to
development IE is that if you look at a
brain it is not only the software that
is continually changing and continually
upgrading there's also the hardware I
mean we get sort of new neural
connections and we get rid of old ones
and you know we strengthen some and we
can some and we get you know genetic
changes we upregulate some hormone that
makes the brain go bigger or more active
in one area and we down regulate a
hormone that makes it go sort of blank
in another area and we do this sort of
constant regulation and constant
changing you both the software end your
hard work where the constant wet where
were ya changes them and is there
anything is there anything even being
thought about you know the constantly
changing Hardware that would have to go
into an iPhone to adapt to yeah I mean
when we talk about that kind of thing I
think that being skeptical about whether
we can do something like that to me is
under estimating just how much progress
is going to be made
and something like that you know that
we'll figure that out or or it will
figure that out if it's a self-improving
situation I think the possibilities are
so limitless for what kind of computer
this can be and and i think the ability
for it to quickly code itself to not
just change its software but to actually
move pieces in and out of the hardware
to physically build do transistors I
mean I think that's all within reach
once we talk about something that is as
smart or smarter than a human so I think
these are all things that are going to
have to be thought about I think I think
that that almost the biggest point here
is just that the average person who is
pretty educated but they don't really
really understand either computers or
biology they're going to nevitt ibly
oversimplify and underestimate this this
is all the situation it is much more
complicated than people realize and then
and it's a little scary because it means
that programming an AI to be the way we
want it to be to serve us in the right
kind of way is really really like very
very hard and and it might be harder
than creating one that's the problem is
if that if the AI safety component is a
bigger challenge than AI development
that's when you get the development
first and once it's once you do that
then you get you lose the ability to
control it anymore and that's why it's
kind of scary about how there are
billions of dollars right now being
spent on AI development and AI research
and there's about 10 million dollars
being spent on AI safety like you know
point 1 percent and it's and and all of
that money comes from Elon Musk who
donated 10 million for the future of
life Institute to you know an end and so
it's one of those things where it's just
it's not like that's gonna change it's
not going to be a huge upswing and
funding free I safety because it's not a
profitable venture and so it's just you
know everyone's gonna say yeah that's
really important someone else should
kick in the money I'm
go do my thing now you know and and so
that's not going to change and then and
so the question is people who are
developing it are they thinking about
this are they are they worrying about it
because I don't know I don't know if
regulations can stop it either
regulations don't have a good history of
being able to slow technology no not at
all no it'sit's mean it is quite likely
to happen but I think it's going to end
up being something very different from
basically anything we can imagine right
because unless we make it like biology
it's going to be so completely different
writer to us and there's just no way of
knowing but it's gonna have a lot of
power it's gonna have so much power over
us if it wants to yes but would it want
it to because they won't have chemicals
and every single element when I say wha
no I just mean you know right now like
if I am if I press call on my phone it
wants to make that call for me because
that isn't programming so it's you know
the word want in the way we use it is
not it doesn't apply but it will have
its own programming you know the every
every machine that we build wants to do
its task because that's what so it's
just a question of you know it that can
be bad for us if it decides that we're
in the way of its objective it can also
be bad if it decides that we're relevant
to its objective and it's causing a lot
of chaos just the same way that when we
when humans came to you know humans
arrived in different places we end up
extinct ting all kinds of animals and
that's not that we don't suck as we hate
the animals usually it's because we're
we're brash and we do stuff that messes
up so if it starts you know if the AI
starts mining our earth for all kinds of
properties for all kinds of chemicals
and
and elements uh yeah that could that
could be be bad for us that could be
that good right and so yeah I don't know
I I always come back to it this kind of
thing like I'm really happy it's not my
problem to figure this out and I can
just kind of go back and like forget
about this in 10 minutes and like live
my life because otherwise I would be
very stressed about this all the time
yeah I'm really I'm really this is you
know such as a inventor but I'm really
hoping that you know if we actually make
a really good AI maybe that I could
communicate with the octopus oh yes i
would love our hands really annoyed by
this lack of communicate it could alter
an octopus's DNA so that it becomes
super intelligent octopus and then it
can talk to us it can do is something is
that smart it can it keep going in and
affect the DNA which is just software
and it'll be able to go and just quick
you know any more like the octopus is
already be intelligent yes doesn't is
not just communicating with us I want
the AI to be the sort of communication
tool because what do we find out when it
does that the octopus has like a great
sense of humor and it's like a very cool
dude action wouldn't be surprised they
seem to be amazing creatures they are
yet the whole time and if you finally
communicate and and then the AI tells us
like oh yeah this whole time the octopus
has just been like very you know just
very unimpressed with you guys oh yeah
sure you know I don't know but it's very
it's very exciting more of me is excited
than scared because I'm you know as I
kind of said what's my personal my
personal faith is personal extension
regardless of what happens at the
species so just selfishly that's pretty
bad and there's a lot of suffering in
the world I mean the world has all kinds
of problems that's pretty bad so to me
there's if there's so much room to go to
get better that I'll kind of take my
chances i think and i think i'm rooting
for this to move forward even though
you know if you take a big step back
that might be kind of stupid ya know I
wouldn t want no I'm the same i'm more
into the whole sort of genetic
engineering what can we do with biology
or how can we meld the biology but it
ties together and you know we're going
to have robots doing the genetic
engineering for us really really soon I
mean completely automated genetic
engineering for us and then it's going
to go why do you want to change only 10
genes i can't a it change ten thousand
genes for you that's right we shall i
actually because you're a biologist I
had a question um I was uh you're
running out of time by the way if you
well catch your blame you haven't I mean
into more we can we can go a little I
mean this is a need to get all the info
I can while I have about just here to
come so my question is I always you know
think about and I haven't done research
on this myself yep I think about reverse
aging and stuff like that and then and
and how the human body is just a
physical device in the end it's just a
machine it's just matter it's just cells
and Adams and it's all stuff that if you
just knew how to manipulate it the
smallest level you could change it and
and and so actually I I used to think
okay so why can't we just you know all
the only one going through makes people
age is when cells age and you have that
thing where the thing gets shortened and
they write T Lumira CMS so I can't okay
we'll just send little nanobots in to
fix that and then I started to realize
is a few problems with that one nanobots
have a surface area to volume ratio
where they can't really do stuff on that
size of that level on their own too it's
not like you're 90 and there's some
people that are 90 and they can't see
well but they can run really fast like
90 year olds are bad at everything the
whole system shutting down and so the
only way it seems to me that you can do
something like this is the DNA level to
recode the software yeah then you have
the program of you know what kind of
cells have really long telomeres cancer
cells cancer cells so we you know you
have this and the the pro
here I think we're going to solve maybe
not solve solve but we're going to
improve aging tremendously in lots of
different ways and lots of different
scales but the problem is that we have
to it's an optimization sort of problem
so the problem is every time a cell
divides you can have a copy of the DNA
making that copy perfect takes a lot of
energy so we have this whole system of
good enough like we don't want to make
it perfect because that would take so
much energy that we would have to eat
and we wouldn't be able to reproduce
because you know we could have spare no
energy for anything else then you're
making these perfect perfect perfect
copies but we can't do that because so
we have this sort of good enough system
and and it seems like basically
everything is so in our body this makes
sense from a biological point of view
it's just a sort of good enough level
good enough to get by good enough to
have kids good enough to have
grandchildren right help raise them and
then you know that's enough and and that
is on every single level from DNA
construction all the way up to sort of
organs and how they function and and how
they fail so going in and sort of
tweeting that good enough level is going
to be very interesting and you have this
a few species that obviously have
tweaked them in another way than we have
so say elephants for example so
basically the more times a cell divides
the bigger chance of cancer and that
equates to size and life span now
elephants are big and they are
long-lived and they very rarely get
cancer so obviously they found a way to
do this optimization slightly different
so that they can do more cell divisions
without getting cancer although it'll
take away from something else probably
partly due to the fact that elephants
have very very low reproduction rate so
is it possible that we've actually
evolved toward cancer because it's
increasing the human lifespan wasn't
evolutionarily helpful to pass jeans on
and actually it may have been a bad
thing maybe positive better if you die
yeah otherwise you have been 120 year
old eating the food of the tribe the
tribes food we don't need him around
anymore ease well this is this a very
clear difference in strategy where
between animals and plants right so a
plant in a few plants they sort of age
but they don't age in the same way as we
do they don't have the same sort of
fixed lifespan they also don't have a
fixed size and shape like every tree is
not exactly the same they don't have the
same number of branches all right ever
and they're also very good at cloning
themselves so most a lot of plants can
clone themselves they don't have to
sexually reproduce unless they really
want to so it seems to be that lives
have taken to extremely different routes
when it comes to sort of aging and the
body basically and how do you sort of be
in a physical place so trees I mean the
oldest individuals in the world are
trees and and that actually is on two
levels so one is the level of you know a
single tree living for a very long time
that we can sort of grass but the other
level is sending out multiple clones
which are still sort of somewhat
connected and war and you know making
new individuals of yourself continuously
and and not sexually reproducing but
it's ending up new shoots of yourself
over and over and over again and that is
a completely different take on aging
compared to what almost every animal
does right so it's like aging is
beneficial in an animal species in a way
it might be or it might be a byproduct
of something else we do right so because
it's not outliers is a thing it would be
if there were some 200 year olds out
there or one person that's left to 150
you'd say okay you know
so the fact that there's none I mean
zero out of a seven billion zero have
lived past 121 or whatever it is that is
um that says that there's there we are
not just you know it you don't have a
propensity to die in a certain age we
are absolutely coded to absolutely
positively die by that age which makes
me think that in order to you know kind
of reverse aging it's not about fixing
cells because you're fighting against
your basically your body's desire to die
in a lot of ways we it's about recoding
the DNA somehow right well it might be I
think you really have a point but I'm
not sure because you can look at things
like heart beats so basically every
mammal get the same number of heartbeats
you can plot them yeah that's really
interesting it is really interesting so
a mouse which has a hot to discuss this
she's gonna have a really short lifespan
whereas an elephant to go like do dunk
do dunk is gonna have such a longer
lifespan so if you know apparently a
heart can only do this thing for this
amount of beats and it's not clear if
that is a bug or feature it was so
unclear because it's in all of these
things as you say they seem to failure
at more or less the same time and yeah
and it's not clear whether it's a bug or
a feature because it might just be that
you know why spend energy arms in this
certain point why bother from FFM it
doesn't care about individuals evolution
cares about getting genes to keep moving
that's what ends up being successful the
things that happened to do that really
well that's the only thing but and you
can do that in so many different ways so
there I mean there's several species I
mean this one sort of Bowl that that
just goes they go on it they grow up to
certain range and the males is going as
a rampant sex rage and they survive for
like a few months after that but they
lose all of that I mean they basically
sort of where themselves to death on
this sort of rampant sex rate and then
they just collapse and die are you know
that's a successful evolutionary
evolutionary same way that you know a
tree you sort of continuously shooting
up genetic copies of itself and
occasionally having sex but most of the
time just doing copies of itself it's
also a successful evolutionary strategy
okay so taking this into account
everything you just said and all the
stuff about AI and the potential for it
to come around and to give us new
technology what is your prediction for
of every human that's currently alive
whichever of those humans ends up living
the longest how long does that human end
up living there so it's
I think that I think it will be possible
to add a hundred years is going to be
difficult and it's gonna take we might
do it eating someone alive now my lips
200 I think someone who is really rich
and who is prepared to go through a lot
of pain and make a lot of difficult
decisions will live to 200 yes that's
fine the way you just said it no I want
it to be like the person's just like you
know like a really cool
two-hundred-year-old checking out okay
and and and and and my last question
because I had to I'm gonna miss my plane
is what are your thoughts on cryonics
creer easing yourself that is that so
that the people in the year 2510 we do
can might be able to very easily say of
course we can like bring this person
back with an artificial body and well I
think apparently we can freeze cells
they are doing fine we can freeze them
and sold them appraised and sold them
and they're doing right so individual
cells sure that works I think the
technology that we have right now is
just medieval I think we're gonna
up quite a lot of things within the body
without intention because not all of it
is live cells but yes I think that might
actually be one of the roots in the
future of the serving information I mean
I'm a very different but I'm hoping that
they become less medieval like in a few
decades when I'm ready to that to freeze
myself so that's what I'm thinking
hopefully yeah all right because
obviously we free cells and they
function beautiful you have every rose
and yeah and we know and we can freeze
them for ages I think yeah it it's more
about that how long the freezers bender
then how long the salesmen though it
seems to work really well that's very
good to know it's good
promising yeah so we're kind of out of
time all right well this was awesome
yeah thank you so much for a fantastic
discussion yeah you know stop cool yeah
it's great I know some stuff you like
know lots of stuff that's great so thank
you yeah thank you so much time thank
you so much all right thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
