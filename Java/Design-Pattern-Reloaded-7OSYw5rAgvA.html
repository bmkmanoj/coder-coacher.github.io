from Oracle technology Network and i'm
here with amy forex kami hai hai so they
me you are a professor at the University
in Grenoble I think no I know Paris east
okay Paris east and then you're also
always part of openjdk or and expert
groups if i remember correctly and there
is always always one so which one are
you currently am an expert for the Java
platform module jigsaw things okay and
more precisely more precisely oh let's
say where were you where we are now in
the development of Java 90 it depends on
us just hop soon soon there will be a
future friends and for jig so we are
little late but I don't think it will
delay something we just have to work
just other more more fangs more details
exactly but but currently the spec is in
good shape we start to have a lot of
feedback so we have to adjust but I
think things are mostly done okay and so
you also did a presentation this week at
devoxx and so about design pattern and
we loaded um yeah it's what designers
and reloaded it's it's to try to
reimplement the design pattern you find
into gamma bukshah in books using
lambdas to see the power of lambdas and
to see to try to understand where when
you can use them for what and when not
to
too okay so do you have like some
example of its perhaps on emergency it's
it's hard without slides but most of the
factories you find in Java can be
written using lambdas and simplify the
way it doesn't simplify the concept so
can't step the concept stays the same
but the way you implement it it's far
lighter it's it's it's easier to to
implement and them that's just an
example but Adam it's free hour and a
lot of examples so anything else that
you would want like people who are
thinking about patterns so design
pattern to how I mean how different is
it with modularity oh it's not related
to modular okay I mean not not exactly i
mean modularity it's it's it's not an
implementation problem or design issue
it's more something to manage complexity
if you are big software you have to
manage complexity you have to hide
things you have to group things in
module and to don't have stupid
dependency because you because it's just
big right so um so and so basically the
idea behind the modularity is try to fix
two problem with 11 stone the first
problem is class pass problem we have a
lot of problem with with the class pass
actually it's I mean
if you use a Wikipedia you will find why
exactly but so mark I'd basically but
basically because as the class passes
can and you end when you feel you find
the first instance of a class so if you
if you put several times the same class
but with different version of things
like this it may work so little and then
at runtime it will just crash or things
like this so this is the first first
issue and I think mark Reinhold has a
nice slide in the keynote this morning
with this long pass that was
unbelievable and difficulties and yet to
figure out Daniel and usually when when
we used up to to create I mean big
application it's not I usually you have
more than 100 jars and it's just add up
to manage and and the module is a is a
tool to manage this so the other part is
currently we we we create big monolithic
software mm-hmm I mean even by example
for Java EE even if the spec is split in
different part usually as implementation
tends to to be big so as our already
solution when people use Gradle use
maven to try to deal with this kind of
thing but there is no enforcement at
runtime that say oh you are using
internal API you are using things
you should not use because it will
change so it's a way to enhance our
capsulation by providing a new level of
our caps relations and module level of a
capitulation right which yeah so you can
customize that module basically to
deploy it on smaller device you can
split your your application in several
modules and depending on the context use
less module and and have clean
dependencies because dependencies are
check aid at compile time and at front
time using exactly the same algorithm
mm-hmm so is all of this is this since
you're working on jigsaw is it difficult
to it's not difficult but but there is
something which is it's out because
jigsaw is is the arm of the sandwich
okay if you take on the on the bottom
you have a drill to like grader or maven
greater la maven use the compiler that
will use jigsaw and on the top you have
things like osgi java ee modules and
jigsaw at runtime is behind these things
so um
because jigsaw is in the middle it's
it's it's up to support and the bottom
and right part and basically it's a lot
of requirement that comes from two parts
right under the integration I'm sure
exactly and so being being aware of all
all the use cases and providing a kind
of clean API for his use cases it's a
challenge it's exactly yeah so that's
why the feedback right now is actually
very important exactly figure out to
make sure that it was fought through yes
it's one part is the feedback and user
is and to be sure that when Java nine
would be released that was my tools will
be okay with that i mean our ideas need
to be change or tweak maven and Gradle
okay and need to be changed a little and
all I mean spring and need to change and
so on I see so change do you see any new
tools yes there will be new tools and
and tools that I mean I know that by
example for grade or have stopped to
enhance the way they do them doubled so
it's not exactly a new tool but it's a
new way to build things which is far
more secure and that avoid to have by
example Denari incompatibilities between
release things that are automatically
check on that will help every developers
I see okay so a lot to consider still
yeah exactly well thank you for this
update on the modularity and the jigsaw
project thank you women bye thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
