actually back online we are here at TDC
and my guest today is easy draw Masetto
yeah so you are a professor yes what's
the name of the University federal
university ave bc ok here in brazil in
brazil yeah so and you are teaching
programming yeah but using actually game
development i have two subjects at
university that i can teach and one of
them are programming foundations for
example we are you use or in the main
language that we use in these subjects
is java and there and there's another
subject that we care that is game
development programming but I try to to
use most of time java because when you
when you talk about game development you
can use several several tools they are
called gain engines because they this
kind of tools make all the hard work for
the developer right and we have computer
science course most of students don't
know how to design I don't know how to
draw but they must know how to code
right I think that's the best way how
can you optimize your game how you can
develop your programming skills how can
you link several different subjects that
you are study at university like algebra
how math physics you can join all of
them on the game so you are so you're
not teaching the front end you're not
really teaching also machine coding
right on the order i would say board
right coating on the board so where
where does
java fit in the gaming java is fits
better on the middle term like a middle
level because you have the high level
tools in the agents you can program on
low level like in c++ for example GPU
cuda but that's not our focus our focus
is how can you develop your game engine
how can develop your frameworks how can
develop your physic model how can you
interpolate some points to give up an
approximation effective on your race
game that I like the example that I
brought here so Java is very very
interesting because you can develop your
programming skills you can use you can
study MVC you can study several of
desire several design patterns you can
apply several design patterns you can
apply math transformations who can apply
matrix multiplications all of this stuff
you can write your code and make your
framework make your API make your engine
yes oh it's almost like applied
mathematics and applied physics at the
same time re films data structures lists
hash maps are very useful on game
development you can integrate our game
with a rest service you can for example
store data owner database but your
database is hosted on a cloud and you
have to access it transparently you can
use some kind of web service or a Web
API and players have no patience for
latency you a 20 count you have to be
you have to have a good connection but
also it needs to render very fast huge
connection to the algorithms and good
protocols because if you if you if you
try to develop a multiplayer game all of
the message that you can traffic on your
network you they must be very very
optimized
because you don't know how how how can
it can impact the performance of your
game right so you must be a very good
developer a very good programming and
think about all of this ecosystem to
make a small piece of game like this so
you have also examples Yeah right I
brought you an example because it's a
very regime entire race simulator so in
this simple game how many fundamentals
can we implement in code for example
physics acceleration how to break your
car how to make your camera follow your
car and in this kinda you must for
example use lots of trigonometry
operations how can you change the camera
from outside the car to inside the car
for example it's a kind of simulation of
your camera but you can use
interpolation that gives a effect of
approximation from your outside to
inside all of them are how simple
algorithms that you can implement on
hard code nothing is already done you
don't depend off someone else make so
you are able to do anything that you can
if you are a good programmer right so
it's really creating the framework of
the game right every your you acquaint
again you don't depend of someone else
to make it to you you can do this stuff
and you can contribute to make your
framework available to other people use
to other people use to other people
improve your framework and when you
don't realize you are creating a
community a community all the anchor
grammars yes around your own game right
yeah that's the main reason
okay so any other example or code sure
i'm actually working on a street fighter
gaming I'm a big fan of street fighter
okay and I have let me see what I can
show you ah that's that's very nice here
this one for example let me check this
one I think it did so we're going to get
live coding yeah live coding let me see
if it's okay let me close this one so
full screen it's I'm a big fan of Cuba
craft paper crafts and a street fighter
so I decided to use the some animations
from Cuba craft there is a website
called Cuba crafts com then I can get
all the textures this game keeps in
touch with this website downloads all of
the textures and applies this
dynamically for example i can change for
today's are some TV show characters the
Ant Man Captain America being Batman so
I can't change and uh some animations
for example it's almost hate it gets
stuck it goes now flying geek just a
small fighting but what's the main
purpose all of these were made from
scratch because you must understand all
of these concepts and you can apply all
of you everything that you study on
university on your high school to
implement this kind of game it's fear
it's it's own the very beginning but
it's we want to see the code yeah that
that's me that's the point so
so you are teaching a lot of students so
do you have any like curry advice like
maybe for young students but also maybe
for professionals since yeah I always
say to my students read read a lot in 42
Brazilian students you need to read a
lot because male the most part of your
problems you can solve extracting
information from a text and read and
invest your time on study I'm I'm a
programmer since I was 12 that was my
first contact with programming language
basic and I think it you can all the
time you invest on studying programming
language study programming data
structures algorithms every day you have
a different challenge and study read and
specify goals because if you specify
some little goals you can reach them and
keep further our goals right okay very
good very good advice I think that also
applies for any developer thank you so
much so thank you for showing us your
new passion for games and my pleasure to
be here thank you so much thank you so
stay tuned we will have more interviews
coming up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
