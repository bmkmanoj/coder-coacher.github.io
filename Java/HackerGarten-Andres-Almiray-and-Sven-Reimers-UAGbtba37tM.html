devoxx Belgium and I've been spending
most of my time in the hacker garden
area so today I have with me Andres Alma
rain and Sven Reimers and we're gonna
hear about some of the things been going
on in the hacker garden the last couple
of days so maybe we can start with
Andres and you maybe want to tell me a
little bit about what hacker garden is
so hacker gardens are plays for people
to come together and discuss ideas or an
hacking code that's precisely the name
we basically work on open source
projects and at the end of the session
we contribute back the code to the
community which is pretty likely that we
pushed on to github or some other
open-source forge and most of the times
we have it attendance the project leader
one of the project members so that
facilitates a lot producing the code and
making sure that the contribution gets
merged back into the project yes cool
and we had spent almost all day
yesterday I mean his time at one of the
hacker garden tables we had about six
tables set up here at devoxx this year
still expanded from last year and you
were here last year as well and made
some great contributions but I was
hoping you could tell us a little bit
about the project that you worked on
yesterday yeah so about two weeks ago
Stefan Johnson put out a request from
getting a tweet wall written in Java
facts instead of a online flash version
and we started working on a 3d enhanced
thing and but it was a bit too fancy for
for reading stuff and seeing it and just
playing it so we we convert it back to a
2d tech layer word layout and started to
write this very very very short before
the conference and so we thought well we
might just finish in the heck
so make it run and deploy it so I came
down on Tuesday and yeah probably the
old afternoon I tried to fix layering
things and stuff and we shipped it last
night so yeah running light so I mean
real nice thing and people came around
for Chad looking at I was done what you
can do with drug effects right so you
put javafx and JDK 8 and I know you are
one of the first people who arrived at
the hacker garden when I was here and
you spent most of the day there with a
couple of other folks working together
yeah so that work um folks coming along
looking at the tweet ball thing I was
working given ideas how to improve the
layout and how you can do lay outing
Stuber groom wise so let us work here
then real time I saw you running back
and forth a few times yeah so the we had
to deploy it and so there was no online
access so we had to to put it on the USB
stake download KDKA put on the machine
that's running the show here so yeah so
the client was interested you it seems
like a little bit of excitement uh I
thought it was fun yesterday was
definitely fun that it was contributed
to part of it actually having a physical
result something that was produced in
the hacker garden I thought that was
really exciting yes said if your would
like to contribute so the code is open
and it's on it's on github just look for
sweet boy effects yes don't have your
coat that'd be cool so yeah I know that
kids kind of the ultimate goal of the
hacker garden but like Andres and I were
talking earlier there's there's other
benefits maybe talk about like yes this
morning we got Raul Gabriella Lerma and
Richard Warburton signing their own
books and after that they they got
together with other attendees just to
hack something with using Java 8 and
landis and I'm happy to say that we got
some recurring customers from hacker
garden celestino Federico from Devil's
UK they attended the hacker garden and
hacked some lambda stuff with Raul and
they have now their own open source
project where they need a little bit of
help with Java 8 and that's when Richard
and Raul jump in and they were able to
push it again so it's just getting the
once the ball gets rolling is
pushing and pushing open source code am
I making sure that everybody else can
can can benefit from whatever these guys
have done and this is just amazing yes
so I think that is an important find a
lot of time we have the recurring
attendees of the hacker garden so even
like spin from last year and then
roberto roberto came here i met him last
year at the hacker garden where he was
working on java ee 7 and he's over there
again today working on Java EE and then
spin and then Raul and Richard we're at
the dev ox UK event and then the guys
from totino where they totally trashed
from Johnny why don't you tell us about
Anatole because he's been doing a lot of
working hacker gardens been consistently
in every hacker garden that I've
attended he's very happy I believe that
jsr 354 will be the first jsr that have
had a lot of contributions from hacker
garden because Anatole he's a machine
he's been doing presenting his GSR for
more than a year now in different hockey
artists at javaone and Switzerland and
dead bugs and wherever he can so he has
had a lot of input from different places
from people are really interested in the
api's I'm really sure that these days
are is going to have a lot of impact
just because the community has been
really a driving force behind everything
that Anatole has been doing yes a lot of
community contributions on the jsr to UT
for the money and currency definitely
since I work with a lot of the spec
Lee's I can say I definitely agree with
you that yeah I've seen him participated
so many of these events and the
contributors always interested in
meeting with him and talking with him
again and then he's also working on the
configuration jsr which is like a coffee
a pre jsr it's not a JSR yet but his
proposal and he's probably gonna be put
in as open source project first but also
again a lot of contributions yeah i just
gotta say if you have the opportunity to
work side by side with Anatole whether
it's a hacker garden of course or some
other place just do it don't don't miss
that opportunity this is really very
good then yesterday as well we had some
people from nepi
in the hacker garden kirtan was there
and I know he pushed out something did
you talk to him about what he could have
some gurjen and the embassy speculate
they worked on an F beans plugin from
for making lot easier for NBC the new
Java EE NBC things and it's pretty good
so I'm not sure if the coves re out
there but i'm pretty sure i canna but
put it out there just look at his son
yes yes so yeah he worked with Manfred
the speculated or the new jsr for java 8
mb c and it is going to be used in
Manfred's talk tomorrow so that's
thursday yeah in his MVC talk so it's
essentially you know improved now with
the demo like you're 10 developed in the
hacker garden yesterday okay so and then
also we had all the java ee 8 the spec
leads that were here so several spec
leads attending devoxx this year i think
five from five of the different jsr s so
we had a bunch of them over there
yesterday and Ed Burns once he'll about
and Andres you want to talk about Ed
Burns doing it he was doing some javafx
patches thank you he was doing I don't
exactly what kind of conclusion was
doing but he was very excited about it i
think he was one of the first before
twitter twitter wall defects and
everybody got excited and say we gotta
take a picture right now we got to make
a lot of noise because it's the first
contribution made at this haka garden
yes sir early he wanted me to take his
picture because he decided we definitely
needed to contribute something because
it was later in the day and we hadn't
actually contribute anything and he
fixed to long-standing jsf issues in the
issue tracker and pushed out the patches
there you go in the hacker garden
yesterday so and then again there's
other benefits of the hacker garden too
maybe my tell us about kind of just kind
of the having all the spec leads there
and being able to talk with each other
and the project leaves sharing i think
that's something that you talk yes
exactly so when you come to a conference
like like that box there's always the
chance that you can do networking with
the expect leads of the experts of just
regular speakers right but maybe some
people say well i'm not up to it or i'm
shy or he's very busy with with other
people asking questions well that does
matter I've hacker garden we all are
equals we are will our peers so
is very easy to approach everybody like
well we're friendly we just regular guy
so everybody's just a regular guy here
so you is very easy to ask questions to
get some conversation starter in the
worst case scenario is that you always
learn a new idea shortcut when you're
doing a pair programming but how awesome
it is that you can do pair programming
with members of the NetBeans development
team the dream team or that you could do
pair programming with one of the expect
leads right right yeah it's really a
unique opportunity to bring together the
leaders of the projects and just kind of
informal networking and I always enjoy
connecting the different spec legs
together project leads that I know since
I in my current role in the JCP I work
with but they don't always know each
other so it's been a great opportunity
for I think the leaders to get to know
each other and exchange ideas I've seen
them collaborating quite a bit yes
that's the case so very exciting any up
anything you want to share about the
experience since you're one of our
regular attenders in the hacker
experience of people just showing up
asking questions recognizing you for you
well yeah once you know about that beans
you know about the platform you've got
ide and there can ask questions and
they're just easy the support there's no
real things that hinder people from just
talking to you so that's the tree pretty
good so uh I getting things done and
contributing really cool that's the
target is really good yeah it's been
really fun yeah it's been fun we also
fun i want so yeah there's still stuff
going on Manny and some of the other
guys from London java community or in
the hacker garden now it's still going
strong and they're gonna be working on
openjdk so still lots more to come but I
think that's a good summary what we've
done here I'll share any upcoming hacker
garden dates or information we continue
the wrong hacker gardens in Switzerland
where the group was born the next one is
a schedule for Lucerne the 2nd edition
in late November and we would like to
continue running acha gardens oh yes
there was one announcement today at the
box which is they have something called
the boxed days so more like regional
ends in different cities ticino in
switzerland is one of them and they are
they want to run a hacker garden in
April when that surrounds April
eighteenth yeah yes exactly so people in
Switzerland pay attention because
there's going to be a hacker garden inn
in Ticino and there will be some in some
other places yes so just look for the
dates online yep well thanks for joining
us today you very much for the Syrian if
a hacker garden
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
