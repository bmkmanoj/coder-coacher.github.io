technology Network we're here talking to
members of the java community and I've
got jose sanchez of gemalto so we are
looking at a windmill here explain to me
what we're looking at basically what
we're looking at is first of all the
console boards this is our prototyping
board and we are producing m2m modules
the m2 modules are cellular devices that
can very easily connect to to a network
so we are customers embed these m2m
modules into all kinds of assets in this
case we have here a prototyping tool
which is a con support that has Arduino
style connectors on it this is connected
to a fake windmill and a solar panel and
windmill moves if there is no sunlight
and if there is sunlight than the
windmills house so it's very simple just
connecting with four wires the the
console board there's a battery here and
then there is a full protocol stack
implemented on Java that connects this
application to the cloud you have a from
the web part you have a Web API that you
can use to build your web application
very easily wow this is cool so if I'm a
Java developer how hard is it to get
started and I Gemalto board so it's just
about getting a con support getting you
a sim card and getting the D let's say
the software from us and we we call java
city which has NetBeans and all the
necessary tools to get started and you
also have examples in our developers own
we have a number of examples on how to
let's say do specific tasks like sending
sms connecting to a server processing
sensor data and so on and this you can
just reuse adapt to your application and
get going actually it's it's quite
simple you have to go to our website
order pre-order right now and at the con
sabor com excellent thank you say I
really appreciate your time and this
looks very cool so Oracle technology
Network will give you more information
about how to get started with gemalto
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
