Network and I'm here today at devoxx
talking to get Bevan yes young hi you
know thanks for having me so tell us
cared what do you do for living person I
work for a company called zero turn
around is a senior software engineer we
make a couple of products that are
awesome for java developers so that you
can get more productive and really get
the most out of your day basically and
that outside of God that I've got a
whole bunch of pet projects like
passionate occupations that get me into
new technological areas and experimental
stuff basically yeah so you're doing a
presentation about leap motion and you
did also I get on a battery motion so
tell us what what is leap motion so leap
motion is a tiny little device actually
I've got one right here let me just take
it out Michaela's long long so this is
is about the size of a packer gum it's
it's really not that big and what it
does is actually measured measures the
position of your hands in 3d space and
then it gives you a whole bunch of
information so that you can actually do
things with that data right and so what
we're doing here in the hackathon is
we've got raspberry pi devices like an
embedded workshop that are hooked up
through a rest interface and then the
leap motion controller is also available
through a JavaScript interface and then
these can be connected together you can
kind of come up with some crazy crazy
ideas like move a motor around while
moving your hands in here and yeah it's
been very interesting to see how people
have actually started thinking about
what they can do because initially they
were a little bit scared like afraid
okay I have to be creative but after the
first two joints I think people really
started flocking to the
on them and we filled up the table so
yeah and it was great so what kind of
project have you built with the leap
motion so the first project that I built
is actually a project that allows you to
make music with your hands since I'm
also a musician and I thought that it
was actually something I've always
wanted to it's a little bit like being a
virtual conductor but in the digital age
so you can i scratch in the air and and
bring instruments up and down with your
hands and that has been quite successful
about three thousand users of that now
and and then when that was put in place
I was so like one looking what was out
there and it seemed to me so obvious to
try to play games with this input device
and there was actually nothing doing
that to allow you to play existing
computer games so keyboard and mouse
computer games and said like well that
seems like a nice idea to explore and
and so I created an app for that which
basically allows you to map series of
gestures towards keyboard and mouse
commands and they've been thought out in
such a way that you're actually able to
constantly hold both of your hands out
and have tiny gestures that allow you to
control various things and this then
bled into other areas where you can
actually control your whole computer
with it not only games and that's that's
been quite popular also about 20,000
users so this is a very interesting kind
of area to see what people are expecting
and how far you can drive things without
being brought out them becoming
uncomfortable okay so are you going to
demo something I want to I've got okay
I've got it set up here so I'm
so I've got the device down here and
what you can see on screen is actually
the mapping interface of the game wave
software and so this is set up now to do
a operating system control with a bunch
of gestures that I that I set up for my
own comfort so what I have is my hand
when I when I when it's in the in in
frame I can actually start using it to
swap between screens right I've got
these discrete gestures something else
that I can do is I can stick out one
finger and unlike turn and turn off
control the volume of my mac right which
is which our operations that I do quite
frequently when when I sit in front of
the screen something else that I can do
is obviously control the mouse so if I
double tap I can actually start
controlling the mouse pointer and if I
clicked and with my with my finger on my
thumb I can actually activate a real
click and then typically what I also do
is when I read a lot of information on
the internet obviously so once I'm let's
see in this this dev box page I want to
scroll through it I can bring in my
other hand and I can kind of scroll
through the page like this so and then
if I step forward cyclic I close the
page so that's one example I've got
another example set up here so you've
got different profiles that you can use
I've got 14 for a game called Diablo
which is quite popular and so let me
launch that real quick so what I will do
is I will be able to actually control
the the character in the game with my
hands I will be able to move it around
and to shoot to end to execute the
series of actions with it so yeah dad
mad that huge amount mask for interests
set up for this demo I don't usually use
matts Porter like that but anyway let's
see if I can connect to this resume game
and so in this in this situation let me
see there is my pointer which should be
much smaller but I can kind of move the
my warrior here well she's not worried i
think she's can't remember what she is
some kind of witch doctor thingy and so
when she moves around i can also start
shooting stuff right and i can go to
here and let's say if i play with
multiple people and i want to ask for
help i can step forward and it will and
she will ask for help today help me come
come over here and then some other
things you typically do is let's say
that I want to show the map I can swipe
left with my left hand and an app shows
or right to show the inventory which are
typical operations and and then I can
kind of start battling so I've got these
monsters here and I think and start
gaming right
so yeah this is this is a lot of fun and
it's actually working way better than I
anticipated it was kind of a research
seeing how well I can get this to work
and in general let's say I think three
out of four games are actually very
suited to this kind of control so so
yeah there you go wonderful thank you so
much for talking to us today yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
