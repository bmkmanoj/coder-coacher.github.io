technology Network we're here on the
floor at arm techcon and santa clara and
I've got Kevin Smith with me hey Kevin
hey how you doing pretty good and and
you're with technical business
development at Oracle and your I hear
you're an expert on Java ME and embedded
right so tell me what is the story here
today well the real exciting thing that
we're doing here today is we're
showcasing some of our partners
solutions that were working with in in
the past with Java who used to primarily
work with OEMs who would get a chip
solution from a company a software
platform from another company and then
we would license them Java and OEM would
have to integrate all of that into a
solution together but we're showing
today is some of the work we're doing
with let's say Qualcomm we were actually
working with Qualcomm and integrating
java at the lowest common denominator on
the chip so then they can ship that
eighty percent done solution to know em
and then they put the final packaging on
it and then ship it to the market
excellent so how why does this matter to
a Java developer well to a Java
developer I mean ultimately they're
going to be writing applications to that
device for the OEM it means a lot
because the time to market is less but a
Java developer can get the application
environment and the board directly from
Qualcomm and Oracle now and start
prototyping a solution before the
devices even ready wow that's really
cool so is this the Orion or document
yes that's the around bored okay so if I
want to get it now or take a look at it
where would I go what would I do it's
going to be available on january first
around that time frame but what you'll
do is you'll get the iran word from
qualcomm but to get the software they
would go to OTN and download the java
platform for the orion board and then
what they would do would go to get
NetBeans from our download sites and the
various SDKs and tools that they might
need for the particular platform wow so
this is really cool because as a java
developer i already know I've got a
really rich ecosystem I've got really
good tools I've got api's that are
already out there and now I've got this
whole new world right well yeah and it's
integrated together right I mean
to do this in the past we would have to
go out and get some strange board and
then go and try to get linux working on
it and then we'd have to get a Java
platform and try to goof around with
that now you get the board you get the
software that's integrated already for
that platform it's optimized you're
ready to go and start coding your
program Wow and so let somebody else do
the plumbing and you can focus on what
you're best at right absolutely that's
all cool so whatever their message do
you want to give out to the Java
development community Oracle's investing
a lot of money into Java in the end to
end solutions that we have with Java
back to the device the device to data
center it's just amazing you know I was
at son for 17 years and a lot of the
visions for my fellow engineers and you
know people like james gosling had these
visions and at Oracle were actually
getting the funding in the excitement to
actually go out and build these things
down wow it's a great time to be in the
java space right yes definitely
absolutely thank you Kevin thank you so
much for spending time with us this is
Tori wheel with the Oracle technology
Network you can go to oracle com slash
tech network java for more information
yeah Kevin's my bud but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
