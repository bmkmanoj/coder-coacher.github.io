time a place where cows British to
revert uh huh interesting it's a typical
anteater it's a nice place so from the
south of south wales mia cara de ok when
my wife's parents is yeah sounds very
nice all right let me kick off the intro
mm-hmm
you
alright so I'm welcome to our fourth
installation night hacking with Stephen
Colbert best known for his work on you
at a time into the new chaser datetime
specification which is Jace are 32 e 10
thank you so I the same age as you can't
possibly can rule the numbers yeah well
if you're if you're a real jsr geek like
it better Martine there they just spout
jsr Jason I guess they probably do yeah
I guess Patrick cotton hope he does as
well yeah he does he does as well and
you also work at open gamma I do yes
which is where we're hanging out right
now yeah but what other interesting
stuff for you involved in all languages
your legendary swords fair bit of
blogging down there down the years and
made a few comments about languages in a
few talks and so not to say my language
expert but I suppose I know what I like
and know what I don't like yeah very
nice so what we were thinking for an
agenda today is we'd chat about some
interesting stuff maybe things are doing
with the date and times back languages
which are of interest to you show some
demos of work you're doing on you at a
time and also things are doing an open
gamma do a short tour of the the office
and we have some nice scenery outside
too don't get as well the weather keeps
up yeah looks like a nice day out yeah
that's like a reasonable winter day yeah
it wasn't even too cold outside no
wasn't too bad today yeah let me
sometimes the view out there you can get
me swirling bat and don't see much tool
if it's my first my first sunny day in
London for Sarah and I get sleep again
tomorrow yeah you'll be back again hey
did you guys eat it yeah yeah yeah
definitely so um alright we start with
with the jsr times fix what sort of
interesting things wellman the Jason's
all like to know about that a selfie 10
being a challenge if you like because
yeah I set up Joe to time and yeah that
you got out there got completely got why
do you
so people wanted to have the same honor
facilities in the JDK itself only things
like the groovy programming language
don't want to pick up another library
but they're happy enough to pick up
something you could kill the JDK so the
damage over time you know it's a great
library it tells the time correctly but
you know it's not in this position it's
not in a stage or a design you'd want to
put it into the JDK so kind of actually
redesigning it has been quite tricky to
actually get it to a point to which it
does make sense to be in the JDK and I
think we've finally starting to hone it
down to the to the final points
basically yeah toast yeah but obviously
so even if it gets close yes all right
so the people are people are really
familiar with Joe two-time what sort of
changes have you making 310 to improve
the api's or well I wrote a blog post
about this i mean for example one of the
things enjoy the time is that if you
have an object like a local date or
datetime and you call the method get
month gorget month year you'll get back
a number now obviously you'll assume
that that's between 1 and 12 but in my
lobby because the object actually
represents a date time in any calendar
system and if you've plugged in the
coptic calendar system you might get
back month 30 yeah and of course but
what that actually means is whenever you
have a method which is passed a date an
object the first thing you should do is
check to see whether it's actually an
iso mm-hmm it's a standard calendar
system but because nobody does that
everybody assumes that if i say because
that's such the common case so removing
things moving to the Hopi people people
write programs which depend upon certain
calendar systems don't break if you get
everybody seems that everybody else
who's working with with the system is
using I say calendar system the standard
sort of one but then if somebody passed
around warner model yeah
so so presumably or you're going to test
check all these weird esoteric calendars
well there's tons and tons but SMS with
George I've been plenty of unit
expertise I've eaten as well it's you
know the nice thing about libraries like
date and time languages it's quite easy
to Union test and come in yet the number
of inputs a number of output is ready to
be small and yeah it's they tend to be
quite functional thank you use any sort
of um like there's there's some unit
testing techniques where you do some
kind of random jiggering to catch corner
cases and I've actually seen products
which sort of do that they're laughing I
thought actually that those products can
probably be ideals for you something on
something like date and time library but
I've not actually had the ability tip
okay the most of us goes pro notice I
don't think there's some open source
products maybe somebody to come away
from salsa I don't know I haven't looked
in to do that but yeah I've seen that
comprises well I mean certainly for
things like nulls I you know I do what I
quite a strong technique we dealing with
null so if we javadoc parameter
specifies either common not now on the
end of it or maybe no or no means false
or okay so basically always defining in
the Javadoc parameter or at return to
specify what nulls means so that means
you've got a straight connection through
to a test which you can then do yeah
sort of the ability for them to be
simple immutable objects is quite means
that you do have a lot more local
ability to test quite easily okay so
along those lines that sort of
documentation programming shows that you
might have some ideas about on things
which would make for good language
features well I'll do you and I've
written plenty plugs in past authority I
mean you know I shouldn't have to type
comma not null on the end of a @ / am on
the end of a nap return statement
because clearly you know different
people are different views on those some
people think nose are the spawn of the
devil
that we should just eliminate them
entirely was I think nose actually can
be can be useful they can actually
represent various things in your program
and actually are I think in general
Enterprise Development really quite well
over used the problem is that the
programming language doesn't really
handle them very well you know now
there's all these sort of annotations
which were proposed low at not null
annotation and a lot of lamentation I
personally don't find that terribly
compelling because it's really down to
that kind of annotation is only checked
if you're running the annotation checker
and so if you don't running the
annotation checker than actually your
cake and still throwing a bunch of
second even when the code looks like it
couldn't possibly throw it up working
session so I'd much rather have a
solution where though usually I will say
my research debacle guarantee it bang so
I remember I was looking at UM also in
the new jboss language set on yeah so on
and i was i was sitting around at devoxx
with like identity now it was Gavin
wasn't there last year it was you an
annual bernard maybe yeah an annual
the one the other guys working language
and they were mentioning they're showing
me how say llandudno handling
differently yeah it lets you specify the
things were not knowing it would
actually check and make sure there was
no possibility of them yet your eminence
acquisition is it was the same way in
terms of you can actually yeah if you
have a variable defined as a string then
I music art a know if it's advantage a
string ? when you can you can book
darling but nolan and you can then do
all sorts of analysis and checking to
make sure that yeah phantom isn't strict
about it because phantoms not a
particularly strict language but a
burning smell which there's quite a bit
of arm yet stuff you could do with down
dish exactly but i mean if you have our
gather a proper static type system then
obviously you can actually make use of
that information effectively guarantee
through the who the system unless you do
some bad casts that yeah you might have
a little okay alright so for folks who
are following us in the stream today
we've we've made some tweaks to the
bitrate going out so let us know how the
video quality and the only quality are
coming through i lowered it to make it
easier for folks to to watch without a
huge pipe going through but it might be
more artifacting on the street so let us
how know how is going in the social chat
and i think it's about time to show some
demos or code or could have a little
book it's lucas and come by and let me
let me swap over to eat your best up get
rid of stuff obscuring it
you
so um thanks thanks Russell Russell
Russell is telling us that initially the
real small blips but it's quite smooth
now but you don't count as your
internets way to some people operating
tonight not everybody something yeah I I
want to hear from somebody who has a say
in normal yeah Russell has like really
good internet yeah at his place
yesterday we were getting some insane
amount like 40 40 down and ate up which
an asynchronous line is pretty good and
this is an office line so this is office
lines a 40 apiece we can because we
could do a denial of service attacks
again but yeah that's a bit different it
helps when you have a seat CEO who's
technical and knows about these kind of
things exactly all right so what are you
showing us here we go um well this bit
of code here is just an example code so
it's really just a case of some code
that I put put into the github
repository and so if you want to go and
look at it just search for 310 github
the word three dead on github and you'll
you'll come across the repository and
the example files in the testing area so
it's just some code that you know if
this gets into JDK 8 then this is the
kind of code which you might be using so
first line here is a we're setting up a
clock and the clock allows us to
basically abstract out the concept of
what the current time is and so we
actually have a variety of different
clocks so this one's using system
default zone but you can also fix the
clock so you can say the clock is fixed
and doesn't actually move forward is no
longer a clock so to speak or we can
have a clock that's offset yeah there's
three hours ahead of the current time or
two hours behind the current time and
we've also brought clocks in here that
tick only at the minute rate or only to
second rate and so the results of those
clocks is is guaranteed to always have
the tick minutes he's never going to
have a seconds of 26 it's always going
to have seconds of
nanoseconds of theory so they're quite
useful for eliminating some of the bits
you don't care about when you did in the
clocks then we got sort of these things
which are setting up a zone datetime.now
yeah there's some final tweaks which may
happen in the date and time area in
terms of the actual classes but as it
stands at the moment as own date time is
basically something but represents a
date a time and the time zone so it's
really similar to what you might think
of as awkward growing calendar
represents today and so in the code that
we've got here we're setting one up from
the clock zone datetime.now passing a
clock or here we're setting one up for
New York so we're doing getting hold of
the zone ID of New York hopefully New
York is still there and not destroyed by
Hurricane yet clock system and away we
go and then their time in Paris say
similar kind of pattern really the next
one is all about local date times so if
you think about the time here in London
is you know a quarter past eleven on the
twenty-ninth of October and you can say
is that it's quarter past eleven but
there's also a quarter past eleven in
New York and it's quarter past eleven in
France so it's it's just saying the
concept of a quarter past eleven
ignoring the fact that this time zones
exists basically we have objects which
can represent a year on its own so you
can have a year or just a date on its
own so you can say there's a date
without a time examples here which would
from today you can just query using this
field here so okay support a individual
they call that you didn't go to Colorado
their time and then we have among the
manipulation stuff yeah probably the
part which is their most interest in
this this is the bar which which kind of
defines which is where the Jojo time
element cameo you like so you have plus
months plus days so methods which
actually so so where'd you come up with
the name shudder and one from
there was a full letter domain name
beginning with Jade it was free in two
thousand cry simple story so there is
there Jonah dot-com regional or its
judge dog is getting educated after all
before basic age of Allah gender
websites yeah so you you that's probably
worth quite a quite a bit of cash now of
four-letter don't idea there is a there
is a slight company epic jodha there is
a sort of a menswear products thing I
think also cool which shortens down to
Jovah say it is this just one of them
drops you huge fortune and then you can
retire a makeup I just wanted to share
this last one here which is sort of so
you can take a date so create a date and
then you can do with and then last day
of month so basically last day a month
is a statically imported thing called an
adjuster and so you can basically
prepackaged things that are standard
adjustments you might make to date so
like you know go to the thursday the
next month will go to next wednesday so
that is that a standard built-in one
when i say less days month is one that's
but then you can build your own building
yep and you can supply your own oh no
it's quite a nice way of packaging up
stuff that was the static import look
like for that the static import is just
importing and a time adjusters a lot
last day of 9th than if i went in there
we have first day of month last day of
month so it's late next month the first
in the month so you can ask for the
first wednesday of a month you can ask
for the next wednesday or the next or
current one of these a fairly easy to
row there's so much in terms of the
actual code that's written to write home
so here's the day of week in month one
we actually have is where basically
setting the day of the month to do the
first of the month and then we're
calculating while we're getting the day
as a week and we're having do some
calculations
modular seven plus seven and then we
have to use the ordinals so that we've
calculated out the ordinal of a day of
the week but we were passed in
originated and we get it back I mean
some of these implementations are quite
complicated because these
implementations are intended to be the
highly optimized ones that we write in
the JDK and whereas if a user was
writing this kind of stuff they could do
something a lot more meaningful shall we
say a big okay yeah yes even though and
that's not too bad in terms of a lot of
code I mean if I actually went up here
we can actually see the first day of the
month is simply 0 with day of month
water no the last day of the month is
with day of month and then how many of
many days there are in the day of the
month so yeah the simple cases are quite
easy actually calculating the first
wednesday in a month isn't it is a bit
more complicated so therefore the codes
a bit more complicated come on say
anyone who wants to can just go away to
that examples file and run it up and yes
want to choose if I run it now give it a
give it a good spin let me let me pause
for questions anyone on the stream poke
poke with questions on the social chat
and well we'll take them for you at a
time before we switch to the next topic
yay great he didn't want I know why
didn't run as you got a nice exception
as you can all see unknown time zone
group tzd be no I should explain why
it's because I'm just changed the
timezone death format of f of the time
seg file so the version of the file
which is loaded is the wrong version of
file so i might give to fix this
SI lo packing because he never do a demo
see what's doing building the code we
build the time zone files that's the
question they was out this whole notes
real yeah exactly last one force
compiler terms in little bit whack it on
there so this windows your normal
operating system it is yes I've always
been a point-and-click person we've
probably surprises some people but yeah
no no no they'll come out Maya I never
never been huge fan of commando I have
to say yeah actually I started out on on
max back when they were like little door
stops and then Apple had really bad Java
support so i switched to windows / linux
for a number of years and then
apparently i'm i'm back on on apple
hardness as you can see from my laptop
he said he is an apple at fault no doubt
about that let's give you one more go
see if it runs there we go it's awesome
alright so there's our nice output yeah
it's just refreshed so they were
printing out the current dates time so
one of the nice things is i'm googling
calendar has such a terrible to string
but here you can see that the two string
of the equivalent class don't say at the
end the date the time like i can
validate that actually is the right time
for a rear yep and there's the
equivalent time in New York so it looks
a bit seven o'clock in the morning in
New York yeah yeah hey what's the game
guys let's see if any was up early in
New York yeah and a variety the other
stuff so we have objects for to restore
year to go down to two doors another
swapping around and then down to the
bottom we've got the more advanced stuff
that you can actually say
a a local datetime that's in the middle
of the guy off that occurs in the
Supreme daylight savings time change and
then what happens if you try and convert
that to a time through something with
the time zone obviously it has to adjust
the app using the gap so where look
that's what's my favorable in the
Brazilian birthday apparently in Brazil
they don't like telling you what how old
they are so they they only tell you do
the month and the day and I so I'm told
I don't know these things a man I know
that we have a bunch of folks from
Brazil who've been watching the streams
you know all the old out all day they'll
melt it whether that's really sure or
not yeah so it is true we have a nice
object called mum today which just
represents a month in the day on its own
no okay I think it's very early in
Brazil know those we likely won't have a
lot of people just totally will be able
to watch the reason I am or you know any
window yeah okay so um why don't we but
we'll do the open gamma stuff I'm taking
office tour first who all right office
too little was good yeah cela me let me
swap back to the camera walkabout time
walkabout alright and for folks watching
the stream there's a slight chance that
the Wi-Fi will cut out at some point but
it will cut out in the camera not on the
on the desktop so the stream will keep
going and then we'll be bad and then
back and find about five minutes yeah
regardless of whether the camera is
working yeah all right this is the risky
part unplugging oh I think we're still
alive well I can still see a picture
kasi my head okay that gives you man
okay all right sir lay down cool what I
guess one of the things about open gamma
is we're a start-up so there's only like
yeah we're about 25 people at the moment
so one of the things we have is a bit
more relaxed ability we can just you
know focus on making the place a bit
more enjoyable we're not quite you know
Google slides everywhere type people but
we have our TVs we have our planets are
so this is the this is a big thing for
open gamma so far we have this award so
we went to the inno tribe startup
contest in belfast where we won the
innovative category and that's basically
organized by Swift who organized it's
kind of a like a financial walls all
data standard basically it's like the
every payment that goes between two
banks goes over the Swift system and so
they organize these sort of event to
support startups and that kind of stuff
so it's a it's a good kind of stuff and
our CEO is now going out to Osaka in
Japan has kind of take you to next level
she's all good yeah very nice now we
have a nice kitchen stocked with food
anyone for a breakfast bar or anything
yeah we have tons and tons of stuff dr.
pepper company sort of founded on Dr
Pepper pick nice yes to and then take
you up the office so so we have an
office in in London that's our main
office but we also have an office in New
York yes there's a chance to plug your
company you guys firing yea though we're
still hiring yeah definitely definitely
hiring at the moment trying to find some
good people good people have a our nice
map of New York up at the moment trying
to decide where the best place would be
to sort of expand our office up to
should be good
good old server room ready to support
the kind of power stuff we're going to
be doing support the great in there and
yeah there's typical kind of typical
kind of stuff that open game I does oh
yeah so we've amassed big complicated
matrices and vector of algorithms all
this kind of stuff so it's an open game
was all about providing software for the
investment banks and hedge funds it's
basically the way I put it is to help
them calculate how risky their
investments are you know so are we
looking like super confidential
proprietor I love them 60 be with us
because open gamblers open source
company oh there you go so there we go
so you can actually go up to github and
you can download open gamma and you can
run the software and basically you can
see see what we're up to it will
probably have a quick run of what you
what you see if you actually downloaded
the code cool yeah so where do we get
the best view out of the office from I
think the best I mean there's a view at
that end is sort of the building side of
the back of tape walk okay so probably
the best views of the shard I think out
of there you want to finish walking down
so don't have it work out yeah cool that
way we get to see the quant corner well
certainly all organized now we have our
nice logos yeah cool where some good
quanti stuff
oh yes i think has some good quality
stacks see one of the things we have
everybody do i or do phd's mathematics
guys obviously their job is to do do the
hard math do the whole complicated stuff
so we kind of divide up our team in open
gamma we have a team who work on the
Java platform stuff so normal kind of
Java Enterprise developments and then we
have a separate team who can focus their
entire minds on on the maths and the
algorithms on the quantitative finance
and bringing those two things together
in a practical way is a key part of what
we're doing in open camera yeah yep it's
crazy cool I don't understand anything
on board no I don't understand anything
with that bull that's kind of half the
point yeah cool stuff
I mean it's quite a nice a nice office
from the inside it's one of the things
is the building from the outside is not
the most attractive yeah because
whatever it wasn't nice walking over
here we were we're concrete building
basically from the outside and the area
is quite good plenty going on lots of
restaurants and cafes and so on and it's
a it's a up-and-coming area as well
because you have the tape modern
development on the other side which is
the big art gallery here in London and
so that's being upgraded and improved as
well
and then out of that window so long as
the shutters don't do it don't get too
much in the way some good ones and views
you can see your highest building which
is the shard there you go just but I've
seen to it yep siren on a really misty
day what you'll end up with is your lend
up with like the clouds swirling around
the building but you are actually going
to be able to go up that and they're
going to have a visitor center on top
where you can go out and you can have a
great view of London well providing the
mist isn't there and it's not gonna be
cheap either from what I hear say it
could be good tourist attraction for the
future in London or could just be
something very expensive yeah all right
let's see if we get a surfer appropriate
interview for me so that's all without
organizing the camera again yeah
alright thanks for the guns are in your
office alright alright so we're chatting
a little cool open gamma work financial
formulas stuff so I'm gonna hopefully
you're some interesting two shows I do I
have I have the the open gamma went with
demo so to speak so this is basically
the current website that we build and
that's part of our product and so open
gammak and can be integrated into an
Excel spreadsheet or it could be
interpreted into a dotnet client
obviously the websites the easiest want
to show to people so basically what we
do is we capture things like yeah a
portfolio of things that you own as a
company so imagine you're a of an
investment bank or a hedge fund
obviously you know what you're doing is
essentially you're buying and selling
stuff and the stuff that you're buying
of selling is known as the security and
you gather these up into portfolios so
here I have a portfolio and you can see
basically that it consists of a number
of positions in this case it's quite a
simple one so I own 190 shares of Venice
company and I own four thousand four
hundred shares of owens-illinois
obviously yes you're pretty you're
pretty well off you're not a real note
about in 45 oh yeah yep and so now we
can see we've looks like your billions I
think you're losing Chilean so travelers
what was that that was Dennis Dennis
he's doing all right but maybe it was
owens-illinois that wasn't doing so well
yeah one of them wasn't doing so well
anyway and I say you can basically see
what that's doing but obviously that's
just about gathering the information
together to what you own the big
question is predicting looking at what
that value is and what might happen in
the future and what I'll just show you
effectively because this is a demo so
we're using similar
market data and the way we do it is we
basically have this calculation engine
and so you take the data and you suck
back up out of databases add two caches
out of whatever and you chuck it into a
big calculation engine and within the
calculation engine you lots of
mathematical functions algorithms and so
on and this is the kind of output in
essence so the output you're going to
see here this first column here Jensen's
alpha so that is something one of these
various different miscalculation
measures which will mean something to
some people yeah all these all these
dials and numbers and I exactly this
looks like a trader screen it's pretty
much a traders got a string yep so so
they can basically look at home depot
and they can see that the historical
vial and home depot in this particular
case is 544 US dollars and where you're
seeing that various flashing up and down
symbols that's because the idea is to
take live market data and straight off
the new york stock exchange or the
fortune 100 suck at into the system run
it through each of these calculations
that the court guys were writing and
then produce it onto the screen and so
obviously then you sum it up so like
consumer discretionary is obviously the
sum of all the things within that and
materials is the sum of all the things
in that and so out of the top you get
some great number which so I have a
historical VAR of 60 1600 US dollars and
to the person using the system that
would mean something to me it doesn't
mean a lot and that's so there's a lot
of attention again we can actually
separate yeah the people who know about
writing jari systems from the people who
know about what the meaning of that is
so it sounds like unlike the date-time
api's in which you're a user this you
probably don't actually use this I'm not
a user this is your I got a hedge
trimmer and I'm not you know
I'm not the best salesman because I
can't tell you what the meaning of the
train'll ratio is all the Sharpe ratio
let you go you can you've got the other
lender the office and I could get them
to tell you exactly what it is you can
so you can hack the Java code that's
running it however the guys at the other
end of the office has written the books
which describe what these things do now
that's the kind of that's the kind of
setup we're trying to get to nice yeah
and like this is an open source product
so how do you guys actually make money
on well we make money because one of the
way things like the finance industry is
various data feeds actually can't be
open source so like the connection
between open Cameron Reuters and we
can't make open source because Reuters
don't up their API is considered to be a
trade secret oh right so we found
publish the cove the talks to their API
because they're aight guys are trade
secret interest so therefore that has to
stay private that's one at one is
leatherman we can sell it's primarily
our support for example if you want to
use open gamma and you're quite willing
to have your company guess as I get
forum I get the negative 8 I get the
idea of the most people doing her
trading yeah or make you enough or they
don't really yeah most most people in
banks and hedge funds are willing
tonight I mean that's that's a reality
of it most are going to pay is open so
Evan why why do it is an open source
project rather than it most companies
would do this as a private thing yet
basically it allowed the doors into the
companies to be opened more quickly ok
now if you're a new company starting up
yeah so it is a server thanks in
particular consider legal of whiskey
from firm and they actually typically
might ask for your source code anyway
you know if you go bust I want your
source code so why not take that
question away and just say what you got
our source code anyway everybody's got a
source go yeah if it doesn't greatly
take away from your ability to make
money then it's not a huge book and
actually if it makes open game of the
center of a new asshole sort of
community around
around the financial community then
that's great as well all right so we
have some additional people downstream I
saw Andre an anchor Jen join us so if
you if you guys are watching the stream
have any questions poke poke Steven and
ask them stuff about either open gamma
or Joe two-time which like SJ sr 3 10
but it's similar yes I mean judge x sr 3
10 yes yes I'll 310 is evolved from gate
from Jojo time basically it's like I
showed a time next it is 80 well I it's
more like overtime three welcomes over
time T yeah cool and that's where all
your energy is going right now until yes
well the thing is trying to get trying
to get Jace off retain complete in time
for it it frayed that's the idea is to a
bit tight but I heard I heard code
freeze like beginning of next year early
well i think i think the code freeze is
in February obviously you have to start
integrating into openjdk kind of my next
13 and you have any you have any
internal focus roller contributors who
are hoping though yeah so i'm working
with water rigs who's a employee and
sherman as well so there are various our
cling to ease are now working alongside
but i also have a couple of guys from a
London java community cool so there
there Richard and Gemma working as well
to keep me saying though so I sort of
thing works out yeah cool yeah so
actually we're doing a month in Java
hacking session tonight yeah so is there
anything we can do to help out I've no
idea about a time- and eyes you know but
the glass of land holding the day is
whatever I decide we do there nothing
speak to the dictator pic and we'll be
on the bloodstream as well tonight yet
doing some hacking but I expect it'll be
a small crew but we should have some
interesting folks there to do some
hacking on projects that matter there
should be fun cool just checking to see
if there were any questions don't yeah a
lot of people people like to say hi on
the stream but they're there to shadow
yeah I think I think they're too scared
if you're imposing blog
for you I'm powerfully reason and
perfectly bachelor I just listened to
people and see what they hide ya ya know
you you just you bring out you bring out
some strong opinions other people aren't
willing to express but you back them up
by actually explaining yourself so
that's what yeah I mean particularly
particularly around the Scala case it
was a case of trying to you know when
she I mean my case is rather interesting
because lots of people worrying
conversations I was having privately
kind of giving me a same kind of message
but you weren't hearing that message
publicly yeah a lot of people were
feeling either they were not in a
position because other other
responsibilities they have that they
could say anything or they felt
intimidated and I just decided well
stuff that I'm yeah I'm going to publish
a blog post i'm going to say what I
think and I'm gonna say not because it's
just my opinion but because other people
have this same opinion as well no know
why I think it helps a lot for folks on
the stream let me let me kind of explain
what Stephens talking about so I think
the the crux of what you're describing
is complexity language there's nothing
wrong with scholar as a language in
terms of it does the things that was
trying to set out to do it is a
functional lower hybrid it has the
ability to you know do far more info
less code than Java does yeah it's just
a totally different kind of language
where where I struggle is where it is
treated as being a replacement for java
anything airy to me it does not attract
or appeal to the same breadth of
developers the job does now some people
don't think that spoken some people
think actually you know maybe if you
just take the few developers put them
onto scholar then actually that makes
the world a better place I banish them
to scholar maybe maybe as a punishment I
don't know ya know it's interesting
because a lot of the things you
highlighted about the language which
which make it more difficult for the
average developer to be productive and
you know maintain it in a large team and
all that stuff are the same things which
I was taking advantage
than the Scala flex project so I so
tired there's less little esoteric
features which are very helpful when
you're writing a DSL or a custom
language are a very very complex library
but if you actually use them an end user
application you'd never actually be able
to read on your else's code I mean I
think if you're using Scarl you have to
be able to lay you down a very strict
set of coding standards that you're
going to use to stick to them to rely on
having a good enough quality team to
stick to them and not to abuse stuff and
whilst keeping your team as a very good
quality might be something you can do
for year two years three years yeah apps
down the line Mexico's going to suffer
maintenance yeah just just just
suggesting that yeah yeah yeah
definitely so but what's what's your
current take on modern languages which
languages are excited about or what new
languages are you looking forward to um
and if I wasn't snowed under with JSF
310 i'll be spending more time paying
attention to what Collins doing whilst
it might have one feature i dislike in
terms of the alternate order of
declaring variables so they do STR code
on string rather than string space str
apart from that it has a pretty good set
of features in a pretty reasonable
design as far as I can see at the
highest level you know I've not had
enough time to drill down in it to say
yay balance it looks pretty solid what
does phantom 24 on stream I'm some who's
written the Java way around basically
what if the tapes missing don't you does
it to type inferencing it can do type
inferencing it'll do type in from seeing
within a method okay within a method you
do SDR codon equals and then the
variable and then then the expression
and that will figure out the factors but
you don't have to declare the variable
before using it you do have to declare
the variable it uses phantom users did
pi think it's the
the Pascal convention say you do colon
equals to declare a variable and use
equals to assign a variable oh yeah no
this is my first compact yeah my first
language I wrote my own heard a great
editing application from my school in
middle school I did that all on Pascal
and yeah I forgot all about the the
colon equals yeah and each one of those
this is DJ as if you know but i think
the basically the problem is the java
style syntax and you see lots of
languages finding different ways of
getting around this it it's not
well-suited for a language for sports
type inferencing well that seems to be
the argument and I sort of understand
the argument but unfortunately the other
way round is not well suited for
readability in certain scenarios
particularly the particular ones i
dislike are where you have to declare
the type in a variable declaration yeah
or in a default in a defaulted method
parameter what you end up with is str
colon string equals food and it looks
like you're assigning foo to us to a
variable names drink you're signing who
are overweight because because in Java
you would do string space str equals
food and food being assigned to mess up
because their next one another but ok
real places after it looks like you're
assigning it to strings on toe and I I
mean hi uncle particularly the return
types of methods I find that it just
feels like it's in Tokyo the right place
now I have an idea in terms of an
alternate way you can write casts and
generics which I keep on meeting to
actually log about so i can get
criticized about it but yeah it's our
Assessors this is interesting i'm so i'm
a little bit of a language geek so we
will wait for it here we go whiteboard
ok and we're gonna move the camera we're
going to do some white board language
hacking on syntax oh dear
let's go get hot embarrassing I could
take that side all right
don't let me let me make this um full
screen so yeah cool people are not stir
yes that make sense are you thinking
about it
that's pretty focused all right so we
got to the top way is kind of the Java
way of doing things yeah except jobless
I mean John knows our soul diameter is
indicating a Nortenos default perimeter
so that I actually understand it's quite
tricky to do now that they've done
project lambda but maybe it'll happen
maybe way so it would be really useful
it would actually save a lot of code in
jazz r310 because an awful lot of code
is basically here's an argument that is
we have to have two methods to justify
this mmm kind of thing well as here's
the equivalent in common or unbelievably
much yeah it looks like it yeah Hey look
like you you have a way ball yeah and
then you have an assignment yeah it just
looks like foo is being assigned to a
string to Anna than the variables called
string okay and I just looks it just
looks weird to me and the other problem
I have is when you have multiple
parameters so if you have str 0 long
string comma ABC colon integer because
the qur'an is bigger than the comma but
i find my eyes do is they declare it as
a string called ABC I see that as as a
spaced interesting and then it all gets
totally confusing so I actually have to
kind of stop my eyes yeah we go through
much slower to read what i can see like
in most in most instances you would
naturally treat the colon as the lower
precedent yeah i mean the caramel is is
something i'm sure want to describe the
colon is the character using language
design when you can't think of anything
else to do I think I'll it feels a bit
like you know language likes Carla yeah
that they will about not having
verbosity and yet we've got an extra
character in here which you can't I
don't really need which does feel a bit
weird okay so what what you you were
mentioning that you an idea for a way of
a way of doing
type inference well this is boy typhoon
cruise along nothing yeah I mean levels
without yeah exactly i mean a lot of
what you're trying to do is to be able
to declare something like vowel well
it's not say str let's imagine it some
complicated type so it's some number
type and you want to be able to declare
out as you know some number over here i
see even even this isn't the best
example but let's say is that so i'll
enter 693 we don't know whether 693 is a
long for an integer or and float or a
double I mean not a good example but
let's pretend it's a good example so as
a result what something like score that
would have to do would be to say well
actually this is really a float like
this and so now then justify is kind of
well you know you want the name there
and you want the name to be on the left
hand side next to the vowel because that
actually kind of reads quite nicely if
you do it that way around I'm so my
suggestion was what if you did it like
this so you did foul number which means
you satisfy the requirement to have that
short hand on the left hand side on the
right hand side you do it like this and
you float wiggle 693 as I say this is
not the best example but in essence what
you do okay is too so you never actually
cast is its cast you know in Java you'd
have to do you put that in bracket but
here I'm using a wiggle side basically
to say here's my thing here's what it is
and therefore the left hand side can
stay all nice and pretty okay now so
you're essentially you're getting rid of
the ability to declare at the type
there's no need to declare it because I
decide if you're using the type of the
first yeah thing and if you need a more
specific time you cast out yeah if if
this was our previous example where we
had the bow string equals foo there's no
need to declare it a string then we call
food because obviously it's a foo and
it's clear what it is so you only
actually ever have to put
in in the way okay so what about like
this is within a method yet what about
you mentioned phantom doesn't support
this but like if you had a member
variable that you wanted to to have it
not have a type have it in for the type
so you could define it as val number and
bow string in that class but then what
if you decided later on that you
actually wanted to add a type to that
because you had a case where it was
ambiguous I mean this would work in
exactly the same way i would say so in
the insolence somewhere later in the
final question is what what you do if
you're declaring something but don't
want to initialize the value yeah i mean
that's the tough part okay and there's
no easy answer to that to that and maybe
it's a case that actually you have to
have something like you know flow wiggle
no it's well because that's what
actually take okay you're putting in
there and it sounds really weird but
yeah that's kind of what it is um or you
could just short-handed potentially it's
a way of of trying to say that actually
what scholar and Colleen and these other
language of doing in terms of trying to
have simple left hand side where you use
vinyl vault I quite like that'll file
yeah either a squire nice sensible
readable way of looking at it followed
by the name of the variable that makes
perfect sense but this just gets in the
way it's that it is is extra stuff that
I'm having to put in there which isn't
totally useful or helpful and so I'd
much rather color yeah get rid of it if
I could yeah yeah I can I can tell this
either yeah okay now as you came to this
looking at it in terms of generics a lot
of if you have a list of strings and you
have our list of objects in Java then
you can't just say you know I equal beat
but what if you could say a equals
list of string we will be and so what
you're essentially doing here is you're
saying yes I definitely know that these
two things are properly incompatible one
I actually want you to do something
about it now whereas over here I was
talking about them in terms of being
casts there's no reason why over here it
can't actually insert a wrap-up glass a
decorator that actually regulates the
underlying list of all place and cast
them on something if it's a dynamic
conversion class basically and so yeah
it would work in that minute and then
more generally if I declare a method
let's say is that covering is it
covering it over there I make long as
uma so they can kind of see all of their
tacos so if we have process taking in
let's say a an integer it's a good
example and I want to invoke that method
but I have a method which is just string
called 64 I should actually be able to
invoke that method using we will be and
the idea here is basically that you can
take an object of any of a particular
type and convert it dynamically into the
argument so this is effectively using
type inference to say or my destination
type is integer my source type is a
string I obviously can't pass obviously
can't just do beyond its own I know I
have to do a type convert now Scott six
you know it we Sarah we've got just do
that rather pre in the first wiggle yeah
yes Carla automatic Skyler does implicit
that's all I call this
explicit explicit status and I think
explicit is a whole lot more readable
maintainable in a typical development
shop environment than impress upon them
and you know I'd end up with it too late
for Starla but maybe scholars should
make their implicit expertise yeah make
the language a lot more well suitable
should we do I think there are many
kisses for some purposes implicit are
nice because you can do like dear solar
stuff and hide it yeah but the ninety
percent case where I'm writing code and
I've used an implicit for some esoteric
reason and I want somebody else to read
it they're never ever going to figure
out an implicit conversions happen again
what's actually going on exactions and
I've read various the cases on the
internet where people to describe I
James one minor implicit declaration
some flat file and it broke my entire
soul space because it changed the
author's implicit are the implicit
ordering stuff is this next I actually
will be an active useful scholar I can't
say yeah caseys you get the idea what am
I one of my favorite um so we we hit
this case in our in our sky effects
library for implicit so like we do the
javafx things you have a node and I'm
making this up enough is a really big
class hierarchy but something like this
yeah so knows the base class and a shape
in a circle it's the yeah and then we do
implicit conversions from this to our
skull effects node it's not actually
different names just a different package
but you get the idea in our skoloff X
shape and our skull effect circle yeah
and you know there's additional methods
in each of those and you need to do a
classic conversions for all of these and
so you have opposed a conversion from
node to node and from shape to shape and
from circle to circle so it all looks it
all looks good so far right now I I'm
going with Tula one of the one of the
problems with this which we hit is when
you now take a circle notes
no it actually works just fine yeah
because it can only be converted to a
node but when you do a shape a shape can
get an implicit conversion to a shape or
to a node that's true and a circle can
get an implicit conversion to a shape or
to a node so yeah the default p acre in
scala flex is it looks at this either of
these and it says Oh multiple possible
implicit conversions same precedence and
it blows up it actually gives you a
compilation error which is not mad too
bad better than nothing but it's not
what you want I mean we need a library
to compile so and scholar fix did you
tell how things go good let's call the
guys about it yeah yeah I figured out a
solution but it's a hack is another
solution sure he knows go the implicit
the input set precedence it never takes
into account inheritance alright class
hierarchy so what we do which is similar
to what I'm losing though wait which we
call it miss mr. Scott mall Santas
Martin yeah Martin what he does in the
collections library is he uses an
extension so an import with an extension
miksa watchamacallit seems it's not a
mixing us go but anyways trait yeah for
the for the include and since it's
included as a trade it gets a lower
precedence and therefore some of the
collections imports have higher
precedence some of lower precedence and
so then we take this to end levels where
know it gets included included included
included and then shape gets including
cle-cle and circle gets included right
and then therefore this has the highest
precedence this conversion left side the
Alara slightly lower slightly lower and
you think it's all fine but actually
that only tix the the precedence marker
by one and occasionally hit want to
gather rules like how strong your tie
or other things in your methods where
you hit other yeah it's just interesting
it's a lot of there are a lot of inter
interleaved facilities in Scala but
sometimes they sometimes come device
user anyway all right so this is not
supposed to be a scholar Chad probably
that was it yeah that's an interesting
idea on on how to deal so you know I
spend some time hacking on visage which
is the old JavaScript language it does
the same implicit conversion callin
things which I'm not entirely happy with
yeah and that's a really compelling
alternative it's it's a different
solution yeah it's one of these things
until you actually write up the language
make it work and actually play with it
you don't really know whether it's going
to work out yeah like I never even
thought about the default case because
well the visage doesn't have to commit
yeah so that's one of those things in
but I think type conversion is one of
the things that object oriented
languages kind of missed actually it's
great you have object orientation you
have all these inheritance hierarchy is
whatever afternoon inheritance it hasn't
turned out to be that well that good but
you end up with lots of different types
and there's nothing in object
orientation as a strategy that tells you
how to convert between these types so
you end up writing lots of methods and
having to call lots of many methods when
I'm also that is just stuff that should
just disappear and so actually implicit
as a concept is actually quite good but
it's too visible yeah so has also to say
okay so why don't we why don't we wrap
up um so we did get some comments as we
were they were hacking from russell and
tom so Russell pointed out that our
characterization of the average
programmer was a little condescending I
wasn't doing my best to notes character
I should we say that
but I think I think we've all had to
maintain code before and haven't felt
too good about we went insane code
yellow code that's written better or
worse and now the reality is that the
Java industry is your item I because I
look at my Lisa good with I've I've
written just like one week ago and I'm
like who's this idiot Laurentiis done
from tiny port I've upset No so we're
always improving yes driving to improve
and be better and then some comments
about Tom actually I going to be I'm
going to be meeting up with Tom tomorrow
in a niekerk at Jay Paul and he said
he's using jsr 310 and the who date to
local death ignorant jf extras so so
what was Europe what was your opinion of
the jsr through ten api's Tom do you
think do any feedback for for Stephen on
them well that's the thing you know I
mean any feedback he's good feedback you
know even if you tell me that you really
thought they sucked you know that's
great yeah be better if you told me what
was hard to use about them but yeah it
is no pajamas are we always has been so
all the all of you that will be listened
to cool until that's all like until it's
locked it thank you do about it so Peter
Coates residents and that's it yeah and
Russell was mission at Valen for have
have readability issues that kind of I
feel like I think bonds are accidentally
find I think yeah it's really neat way
of switching between something that's
fixed and something's not fixed if you
like but yeah it's a case of the types
gets in the way of understanding what
Val involved do is my my experience
alright so so so Tom's complaining about
it's too complex so I won't do this time
when I'm when I'm out there and I Kirk
well you show me do a little bit yeah
show me what sort of stuff you did a GF
extras with um jsr 310 and then we can
we can get Stevens yeah input into that
at that time a big more sense yeah
okay cool well thank you very much for
coming on the street happy to have you
answer everything a mess yep yep enjoy
your trip the the next stop in a couple
hours is I'm going to be up at MongoDB
headquarters interviewing Tricia yeah
well we'll chat about some cool island I
guess she's doing big data stuff at
MongoDB now but she's better known for
her work in the financial industry
previously and also she speaks up quite
a bit of conferences on various topics I
saw a good a good talk on kind of gender
gender issues as she did a Java one
knows yet as you enjoy enjoys doing a
lot of things sort of come from speaking
and figuring out new theory much very
much for comfort speaking these days or
I I haven't had that too much time to do
come from speaking this year just
because of the chaser because of j cell
310 and having a baby yeah
congratulations yeah it's for a girl oh
boy oh boy just on your six months
though okay I got I got a little bunny
challenge I got a little one at home
who's my wife's gonna kill me eight
months yeah seven eight months I think
maybe seven yeah yeah you have to work
out a birthday which hopefully you
remember and then you worry Falls yeah
yeah yeah alright cool cool well thanks
again you do thank you and please join
us for night hacking with Trisha in a
few hours ok take
