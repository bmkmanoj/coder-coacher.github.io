SE advanced management console released
in August of 2015 the advanced
management console enables desktop
administrators to track and manage usage
of Java across their organizations this
provides information like usage tracking
details as well as a guided deployment
rule set creator for running different
versions of Java side by side on the
same systems new to this route to dotto
release is the auto detecting windows
agent that will assist in automatic
configuration of these details across a
wide user base after logging in with
your provided credentials you'll be
taken to the main screen showing all
functionality available within the
advanced management console the details
in the middle are helpful but the
primary point of interaction is up near
the top right the desktops tab shows who
uses which version of Java based on
their locally installed agent the Java
usage tab shows usage tracking
information such as which applications
applets or web start programs were used
within that organization and how often
were they used the installers tab helps
customize the enterprise MSI installer
so that you can keep settings across
different Java upgrades the rulesets tab
helps track which deployment rule sets
have been rolled out across the user
base and which applications will be run
with which Java versions across those
clients this helps manage compatibility
across a wide variety of applications in
a large organization now I'm going to
click on the desktops tab to see my
users the table shows a list of managed
systems running the advanced management
console agent on their windows system
these agent make it easier to configure
clients and use of tracking and rollout
rules I'm going to click on an
individual user to see details about
what that particular user is running on
their system
once I click that I can see that this
user is running the latest Java 8 update
40 from the list installed on to their
system looking further at the details of
Java that they have installed I can see
an older version of Java that was
installed and bundled as part of a local
application on that system called
CrashPlan this demonstrates how users
may have versions of Java available even
if they don't have them installed
looking down further at the command
queue
I can see the way that systems will
interact with the advanced management
console to do things like download
updated deployment rule sets you can
view details about which applications
are in use by accessing the java usage
tab up near the top this will also
display information such as what types
of applications are in use and where are
those applications to help you identify
which applets or standard desktop server
applications are using different
versions of Java if you want to narrow
down by things like type of application
you can select those options over to the
right one improvement in the new 2.0
version of the advanced management
console is that it tracks both web and
non web applications I'm going to remove
the selection now and open up the
deployment ruleset section in order to
demonstrate how you can automatically
run applications and control
compatibility with different versions of
your local Java installation at the same
time the rulesets tab provides the
ability to act on the usage tracking
information creating white lists of
applications as I click to run the
deployment ruleset tool the
functionality is very similar to the one
over j'en of the advanced management
console by entering my login information
I'm taken to a screen where I can
interact with the deployment ruleset
creator and manage my whitelist and
compatibility the deployment ruleset
tool opens to the home screen providing
information about what you can do with
the tool the apps tab shows useful
information about Java rich in
applications launched through a browser
such as applet and Web Start
applications the runs column all the way
to the right will help me identify how
beneficial this application is to my
users by identifying how many times this
application has been run right clicking
an individual application I can go to
create a new rule the first thing that I
need to do with an individual rule is to
provide a name the name should be
something beneficial and human readable
about the application I can then choose
our default action such as run with the
latest available JRE this allows the
application to run automatically on
manage systems without prompts choosing
another application I can take similar
action by providing a different name to
describe what that application does I
can choose another rule action such as
run and use the latest available JRE
many organizations need different
versions of Java at the same time by
choosing a different application I'm
going to create a specialized rule that
runs this application using a specific
older version of Java I'm going to
provide a beneficial human readable name
first and then I'm going to choose a
rule action of force run the version
that I'm going to choose is a specific
product level because I want to specify
that this application is known
compatible with an older version of Java
6 in this case I'm going to choose Java
6 update 38 once you have several rules
created you'll want to go to the rules
tab and create a rule set a rule set
provides the configuration to clients of
how to operate with different rules by
selecting multiple rules inside of the
rules tab I can drag them over into my
rule set in this case main rule set as a
way of exporting that to my clients the
relationships tab identifies how this
rule set will perform based on my
tracked application
in this case I have three rules designed
to target three different applications
we see the green and yellow green
indicating run and yellow indicating
that there's no effect on that track
application after verifying my rule the
next step is to perform an export so
that it can be deployed on to manage
clients by using the local file I do not
have to expose the signing cryptographic
key used for the signature of this
deployment rule set
once I click export the file is saved
onto my local file system
the deployment rule set then needs to be
pushed out on to manage desktops looking
at the desktops tab you'll see the push
deployment rule set section now the way
that these desktops are managed is
through that Java agent that
periodically checks in you can obtain
this agent through the configuration tab
by the download link there's no
expectation that users download this
themselves rather it should be
downloaded and pushed out via an
automation tool such as Microsoft SCCM
or marimba customization instructions
appear inside the AMC to do
documentation and involve updating an
AMC user dot properties file as well as
installing the local agent via a command
by using the advanced management console
desktop administrators can monitor and
manage java usage across their
organization and benefit from the
automatic configuration on Windows
clients for complete details about the
advanced management console please see
the product page and its related
documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
