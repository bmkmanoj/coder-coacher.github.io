play minecraft this is the fourth video
in my minecraft tutorial series today we
will be talking about generated
structures so what is a generated
structure a generating structure is
anything generated by the world and by
the game itself I already have a world
with some of them in there so let me
show you that here I'm at an overview of
a village which is the first thing we
want to talk about now a village is
basically a bunch of houses connected by
gravel roads and some farms and there's
also villagers living all around so this
is first place to talk about this here
is the blacksmith's shop which always
looks exactly like this has some lava
furnaces and this top spin of stone
slabs so I'm going to walk inside and
always have this chest you know she can
open and it has some cool stuff in it
they can have like diamonds obsidian and
iron and things like that the next one
we're going to talk about is a library
which is distinguishable by the crafting
table and all the bookshelves those are
two kinds of houses you can find in
villages but there are many more types
the next part of villages are the farms
here there are three crops the villages
grow potatoes wheat and let me see if
you can find some carrots which are over
there and ability that many farms and
sometimes only a few the last part and
probably the most important one or the
villagers themselves villages can have
different professions such as this white
one here is a librarian hi mr. librarian
I like you here is the butcher who has
faced related to meet this one here is a
farmer let's see some more farmers
farmers are the most common villagers
then this one here is a blacksmith and
then this one more type gonna find one
well here it is he's a priest he has a
purple robe on hi villagers
they even also trade with them such as
this one would like 19 week for an
emerald so let's i took out 19 week or
64 wait really then i trade with him and
they got emeralds that's one important
part of villagers so that it's all about
villages next we're going to talk about
Springs there's one spring over here so
a spring is basically one block of water
or lava anywhere on the map and it can
spill out and make a giant water bug at
this one you see the source block is
here and I all spills down to this giant
River here this river is the next thing
I want to talk about which is basically
does this giant pathway of water in the
ground and they can go on for a long
long distance and squids can also spawn
them so let's go back to this point
because there are some other things need
to show you
the next thing here is a lake this is a
lake it's basically the smaller body of
water and also squids can spawn here
like this one here and there usually
about two to four blocks deep so this
here's a lake they sometimes can have
these little land bridges over them you
see this dirt bridge here and then we're
almost at the end this is a cave you can
go the caves usually go pretty deep but
sometimes they don't and it's really
easy to find ores here because they're
all exposed and mobs not to spawn in
there which makes it kind of dangerous
to go in there lastly we're going to
talk about biomes if you're on a Mac you
can press function f 3 but if you're on
Windows let's press f3 and you get the
debug screen which shows a bunch of
stuff so let me pause the game so I can
move the mouse around first shows your
aversion frames per second and memory
used then it has your x y&amp;amp;z position in
the game and here's feet position for y
ice position for y then the direction
you're facing and the degrees then the
biome which is a desert and we will talk
about biomes in more detail then
sunlight and other light and then
whether you're attacking the ground or
not if you're touching the ground also
true if not will be false so now stock
about biomes here I'm in a desert biome
which is characterized by lots of sand
some dead bushes like these and lots of
cacti too then over here is a plains by
which is usually almost totally flat but
not totally and it's characterized by
glass blocks and these little tall glass
things here then over there oh salt
spring is an extreme Hills biome which
is basically a bunch of giant Hills I
can sometimes reach up to cloud level so
you can see the biome is changing and
right now we're on the edge of the
two hills and now we're actually in the
biome so here is extreme Hills and then
this is a few more i'm going to show you
this one here is a forest which has oak
trees and birch trees which are this is
an oak tree and that's a birch tree and
then there's one more of a year just as
a jungle biome but are usually very big
and they have giant jungle trees small
jungle trees lots of lakes and sometimes
these Oasis like places which are lake
surrounded by slowly downward going land
so now let's talk about what biomes can
be used for let's say I wanted some
cocoa beans in survival the only place I
could find that is a jungle biome
because it can grow on these jungle
trees only pick those ones like leaves
only pointing it right now I wanted to
find a birch tree I'd have to go to the
forest biome because that's the only
place you can get those and if i wanted
to flat good flat place to build without
using super flat planes bio or desert by
only be a good place to go also another
thing that is very important that that
has a very good connection to biomes are
snow golems which are a type of mob that
we'll be talking about in the next video
so if i have this have it for making
snuggle in here a jungle biome is very
humid so the snow golem with died almost
immediately and snowballs leave a trail
of snow wherever they go in most biomes
but in this plane by a plane's buying
for example it doesn't leave any snow
and some biomes like you can forest in
my lips of snow
ya see it leaves to know in the forest
villa in a plain file so if you want a
snow farm you have to build it in
somewhere it's not Plains biome or
anywhere else that doesn't create snow
in and that's pretty much it for biomes
so let's summarize what we learned today
we learned about generated structures
such as villages springs lakes rivers
and caves and then we learned about
biomes and the relevance of them to the
game thanks for listening and happy
