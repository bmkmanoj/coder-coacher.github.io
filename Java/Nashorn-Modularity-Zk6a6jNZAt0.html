I'm Michael hopped and I have the honor
of standing here instead of sundar who
can't be here don't ask me any questions
this is not work i did i'm only
representing so don't shoot the
messenger in fact ideally if you have
questions that are about the last worn
thing i can try to answer them if you
have any deeper detailed questions about
the modularity aspects of this and the
jigsaw aspects of this and I can only
second what Alex just said and ask you
to take that to the modularity workshop
later today this is an important slide
one day somebody should sing it so it's
more memorable still working on the
music maybe next year I'm all right so
topics the nas own implementation in
Java 9 is modular rise it relies on the
jigsaw abstractions already um and I'm
going to first give an overview of nas
horn as such and rough bits of the
architecture I'm then going to cast a
look at the class loaders that our news
there are various kinds of class loaders
in Nassau on that sort of continues the
intro and then we get to the really
interesting bits in the section about
dynamic modules and cross-layer
exporting and reading that's where
modules module creation at one time and
how modules make it possible to isolate
bits and pieces dynamically at runtime
from each other and will be covered so
this talk is interesting for language
implementers
well it's it's about a language
implementation and apparently there have
been questions from the implementers of
other languages that run atop the JVM as
to how jigsaw can be dealt with and how
JT canine features can be used for our
for the best purpose so overall how can
I shape a language implementation atop
the JVM starting in jdk nine in the days
of jigsaw to support encapsulation and
security in that implementation so now
so on well it's as you might know a
JavaScript engine it's fully echamos
grouped 5.1 compliant it has been around
since JDK 8 it does have partial support
for acma script six parsing is fully
supported the features are not all
implemented feature implementations are
coming up take a look at chip 292 which
is a good number and there there are
more details about that incidentally the
ACMA script 6 parsing capabilities are
there thanks to growl Jas so the NAS
horn implementation has adopted the ACMA
script six parts and capabilities that
have been implemented there in gracias
and it goes all looping back because the
growl Jay has passed has started out as
the Nassau on pastor so that that was
what the growl j/s project started with
NASA on is usable in many different ways
you can use it through the java x dot
Script API are purely programmatically
you can use it as a standalone
JavaScript engine through the jjs
executable and also as a rebel if you
just GS without any arguments it also
extends JavaScript with some scripting
features so it supports gbank notation
so if you have a javascript file and put
the shebang and the path to your jjs
executable
first line you'll be able to run it just
like a shell script and the shell script
which you can also programmatically are
not able on the command line with the
minus scripting argument enabled some
interesting features such as here docks
in JavaScript and escaping out to the
shell to execute operating system-level
binaries and such also piping of
processes that you spawn from inside
JavaScript so it's fairly fairly
interesting to write scripts in
JavaScript that way java
interoperability has been a big thing
ever since and naturally because NASA on
written in Java runs on the JVM it
doesn't make sense to also reach out to
Java Java interop is really almost
seamless you can talk to any java class
all java objects that obey certain rules
has to do with accessibility I'll come
to that later security is fine grained
very well controllable you can give
specific permissions to specific scripts
based on the URL say location of the
scripts in the file system and such so
not all scripts are sandboxed also not
all scripts are fully trusted the user
can choose to give specific permissions
to specific scripts based on the
location then the java x dot script way
of using nice one is also are compliant
with the compact one profile of the jdk
nine module system meaning there are
very little dependencies that need to be
fulfilled for that to be usable an
overview of the modules that constitute
the NASA own system the dedicated
scripting NASA on module contains the
runtime this is also the module that
constitutes the compact one compliance
it relies
on only very few external modules javed
scripting obviously jeddak adore Dinah
link and Javed or logging the diner link
module is sort of special because it
initially was placed initially it was
part of the Nassau and implementation
itself but then was taken out and placed
in the JDK as a separate dedicated
module diner link is also exposed from
the NASA on runtime module so that it
can be used for interaction with other
language implementations if need be to
other modules that contribute to NASA on
the jjs shell module that's essentially
the source code of the jjs executable
this is not compact one compliant
anymore that's only two for the
embeddedness horn but it still is
possible to start an ass on ripple I'm
in a compact one profile by running java
jdk torn asunder tools door chill you
don't get line editing and such but it's
still still a rebel for JavaScript Dinah
link is mentioned has been taken out as
a separate module in JEP 276 the source
code is still in the National repository
because it originated there it's being
maintained in that very place so these
are the three modules that make up the
overall an asshole thing some remarks on
the execution approach we do not
interpret anything everything is
compiled to java code then loaded as
class files we use ASM for that the JDK
internal a SMS use
um for most of the basic operations
invoke dynamic is used so everything is
really late bound thanks to Dinah link
this is possible I'm the only calls that
are linked statically are those to the
run time where we know how the
resolution looks I'm not going to go
into much detail about Dinah link here
and now there is going to be another
talk on Dinah link tomorrow in the same
slot so the api's that are exported from
naz one first of all we have the java x
dot Script API that's the usual API that
you need when you want to
programmatically access a nice hole
engine then we have the scripting API
which implements things that are missing
in Java x dot scripts and that is nice
on specific things so for instance for
Script object mirror and jas object very
fine-grained access to properties to
check if something is a function
etcetera etcetera so its language
specific reflective capabilities that
are provided by this extra scripting
interface the three interface three API
allows you to reason about JavaScript
sources in Java or JavaScript thanks to
the Java interoperability it fully
supports acma script six but recall this
is parsing only right this is not the
script six implementation this is really
just parsing and ast access
the link our API exports the NASA whole
internal dyna link linka and if you want
to exploit that it's possible to have a
tight across language interoperability
if say jruby or groovy wanted to
interact with the NASA on JavaScript
implementation they could use a diner
link linker to enable them to handle
NASA on property excess and method calls
and such right these are the interfaces
exported from NASA on and I'm not going
going to give an overview of what the
Java integration is all about so from
JavaScript running in the NASA on engine
you can access any public member of a
public class in Java that's visible
access checks are in place warnings will
be given exceptions will be thrown um
and also what's particularly nice about
the Java integration is that lambda
expressions and functions JavaScript
functions are sort of merged into one
here so if you if you invoke from
JavaScript any java method that accepts
a lambda then you can pass a JavaScript
function in that place reflection is
impossible it's not possible to do any
access to the java.lang reflect back
edge from within javascript the same is
true for javelin invoke no method
handles this serves security purposes
Java extend allows you to subclass and
implement Java classes and interfaces in
Java Script what happens under the hood
here is that NASA one creates so-called
adaptor classes so that JavaScript
objects can pose as objects responding
to the implemented Java interface or the
extended Java classes API we cannot use
java.lang.reflect.method.invoke urn olds
user code cannot user calls are all
linked by dinah link which uses the
public look up by default and that means
we can't access the runtime call a
sensitive should expand on that a bit so
Dinah linked calls apply to a call site
that has a specific look up object
associated with it the dynamic method
handles are all resolved through public
look up so call a sensitive would fail
because public lookup is typically not
what color sensitive accepts but Dinah
link takes care of passing the correct
lookup object through the call from the
cold side through the infrastructure and
to the caller sensitive method so that's
all taken care of
security we have a dedicated sandbox for
JavaScript execution all the scripts and
all the all the invocations that go
through the Java x dot script interface
no matter what the security domain of
the Java color is will end up in the
NASA on specific security domain and the
the permissions are not inherited so now
zone imposes its own secure view on the
world there the Nassau module is loaded
by the platform class loader it has all
permissions it needs um but as mentioned
before it's possible to control in a
very fine-grained way how scripts are
trusted or not trusted and if you're
interested how this is done in how this
is done um it's done with security
policies you can take a look for
instance at the testing scripts in the
trusted directory and the non trusted
directories of the NAS own testing
sources script in the trusted directory
are then executed with all permissions
set so much for the rough background on
Nassau on I'm now going to take a look
at all the various class loaders at play
in a song each of which is contributing
its own bit to the overall story so
before we get to the loaders in
particular one last architectural bit
this is the background before all the
loaders and also later the modules
operate the context class holds all the
relevant information constituting one
NASA on instance there is a one-to-one
mapping from instances of the context
class to a NASA one script engine
instance there may be many such
instances in a single Java process that
they are effective
the isolated from each other the java x
dot Script API can be used to control
Nassau on engines from Java code and
yeah I already mentioned that the
context instances map to script engines
so there's this one to one
correspondence here last load else so um
there are three different kinds of class
loader at play in Nassau on and the
first of them is the structure loader
there is a single instance of that one
per process and it's responsible for all
the engines and all the contexts
consequently the structure load up is
responsible for managing the script
object structures of all engines it
creates objects classes that can be
instantiated and the objects have been
optimized layouts and two nos Han and
any JavaScript they look totally natural
they're just Script object subclass
instances but they are created with a
specific layout so that certain fields
can be a better aligned and accessed
up next the script loader is responsible
for loading the script classes generated
by the NASA on JavaScript source to
class file compila by default there is
one such load of a script this doesn't
have to be the case but this is the
default and so consequently there can be
many such loaders in one nice one engine
depending on how many scripts are loaded
each script loader delegates to the
structure loader which in turn delegates
to the platform loader so there by all
the structure classes are effectively
shared and all the platform classes as
well there is one little exception
sometimes script classes may be loaded
by unsafe dot define anonymous class if
a JavaScript script is broken down into
more than one java classes this may be
due to size for instance all of them
must have the same class loader and they
may have to access each other by name
the generated classes that is if they do
not have to access each other by name
the unsafe defined anonymous class trick
can be used and method handles are used
to reference the JavaScript functions
defined in those classes this allows for
very fine-grained unloading of script
classes so you can think of it as an
optimization in the end there has to be
one little dummy class loaded by a
script loader that is used as the host
class in loading all these classes are
in defined anonymous
the third class loader is the Java
adapter class loader or rather this
class is the generator for loaders
responsible for everything loaded due to
a java dot extend call remember that's
when you implement in javascript a Java
interface or subclass some Java class so
this is a generator the actual loaders
are instances of dynamically created
inner classes to this the parent loader
it's not that simple we have to find a
load up that can see all reference types
in the supertype or interface
implemented so if we implement some food
type and that has a method returning bar
we have to find a loader that can see
both of them which means we may have to
walk up some part of the class loader
chain until we find that that loader is
then used as a parent to the adapter
loader so that generated adapter class
can see all the required reference
classes this will often be the thread
context loader but can also be another
it's determined on an individual basis
as a supertype combination is met so we
end up having one loader for such
supertype combination on two modules the
modules add so to speak another bit of
access control around the class loaders
that we have seen so far we need dynamic
modules that is modules that are created
at runtime other than with a module in
photo Java file these are entirely
created at runtime the reason for this
everything that is not in the jdk nassau
not api
whatever packages is concealed internal
however compiled scripts structure
classes and adapters need to be able to
access some of the National internals
unnamed modules can already access the
named nice own module but those
internals are in a named module we also
want to make sure the scripts and
structs are only accessible from the
national module so it goes both ways so
we don't want stuff in scripts and
structs to be exported to the world
because those containing terminals it's
fine for adapters because they have only
one package with a single public class
I'll come to that again in the end we
need named modules and the consequence
of that is that the sometimes named
individual modules created dynamically
provide good isolation granularity
different modules are well encapsulated
so we don't want Nassau internals recap
to be available for random code and we
do not want scripts and structs to be
accessible by the world modules help us
enabling this the solution the struct
loader and the script loaders create
named modules because they need
fine-grained access control adapter
loaders have unnamed modules because
again there is only one single public
class anyway that can be exported that
can be seen by anybody that wants it
layers as seen before in Alex's talk
layers essentially map modules to class
loaders creating modules is possible
through the layer API and we want to
associate those dynamically created
modules with the NASA one source modules
which live in the boot layer the boot
layer configuration can however not be
modified so we cannot add new modules at
runtime to that it's fixed so we need to
create new layers also dynamically the
structure loader defines the structures
module in a dedicated structure layer
each script loader has its own dedicated
layer and unnamed modules in the adapter
loaders are layer less by default
regarding the child parent relationship
between layers these are organized in
the same fashion as the class loaders
final details of access control
enforcement thanks to modules so we need
to do some access control and to isolate
all those scripts from each other and
the various elements of the
implementation from the outside in jdk 8
including the recent updates the package
that access mechanism was used for this
package store excess is this half
documented system property that you can
use to give access to certain packages
from other certain packages don't try
this at home um what we did in eight you
is we mimicked encapsulation using the
packet or XS plus security manager um
but security managers are really not
about encapsulation they're about
security so it's a different thing um
the package access thing is really a
security manager hack to enforce
encapsulation and by putting some of the
NASA on core packages on that list for
packages or access this was made
possible in jdk nine we have much much
better encapsulation thanks to modules
um it does not depend on the security
manager or any such standard policy just
all thanks to the module mechanism and
the security manager can focus on doing
what it's supposed to do caring about
security so reviewing the access control
requirements that we have an ass on the
nas horn runtime should be able to
access script classes structure classes
adapter classes and vice versa
also script classes and adapters should
be able to access structure classes and
we don't allow any excess between
individual scripts classes generated for
the individual scripts to put these
rules to action we need to make the
excess rights known these are expressed
as the reads relationship so to speak
between the modules we used ina link
which means we deal with method handles
which means we have look up objects and
access control through look up objects
and contexts everywhere we only want
excesses between named dynamic and
Nassau and modules we do not want
excesses from named dynamic modules to
other name dynamic modules the script
modules that is and because we cannot
express these relationships statically
as we are creating the modules
dynamically we use the reflective API of
the java.lang reflect the ad reads and
add exports methods on that class
calling it reads it's possible to let
the receiver module read the argument
module so that the receiver module can
then access the public package members
of the argument module the exported
members calling add exports the receiver
module exports an argument package
that's given as a string to another
argument that's a module so that the
argument module can then access the
package contents the module graph
manipulate a class mentioned here is
part of nos on and the structure loader
and all script loaders load this class
individually and in its static
initializer the required it reads at
exports calls are
done finally the nas own module exports
internal packages to generated code that
is loaded by script logo etc um takes
care of adding the required read links
creating method handles is possible only
if the module access rights are correct
so we need those those read links
between the dynamically created modules
adapter modules as mentioned are unnamed
that is they read all modules and they
export their public elements we do not
need sophisticated mechanisms including
named modules as each adapter loader
will only ever have one package with one
public class in it point being if you
need to deal with this kind of access
control if there is nothing worth hiding
in a module use an unnamed one and Nas
own takes care of exporting to unnamed
modules again via the at exports this
call is also possible with an unnamed
module as a target module alright this
has been a whirlwind tour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
