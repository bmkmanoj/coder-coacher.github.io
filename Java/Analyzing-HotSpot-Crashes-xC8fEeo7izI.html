everybody I'm happy that so many of you
could make it to the first morning
session I hope it will be interesting
enough for you so you really can wake up
so I was speaking today about analyzing
hot spot crashes
my name is focusing moniece I'm working
for sa P in the AP JVM team we are doing
our own s AP Java Virtual Machine which
is based on a hot spot a licensed
version of hot spot at the same time we
are also working heavily in the open JDK
we are the maintainer and contributors
of the PowerPC ax and s/390 port and we
are also in the Java Executive Committee
ok so let's get started with the talk if
there are any questions please ask if
they are quick it will try to answer
them if not we can do it after the talk
so all the examples I have in this talk
and the slides themselves are on github
so if you want to take pictures you can
take picture of this slide I will show
you slide once again
at the end of the talk so you will have
one more chance to get it ok so
everybody ready so what's a hot spot
crash well it's actually a fatal error
or situation which from which we cannot
recover it's not compared to an
exception for example which we can
handle an exception and or an unhandled
exception shows error in your own
program in the application while a hot
spot crash or VM crash shows an error in
the in the virtual machine itself which
should not happen so the only thing we
can do as I say it's an unrecoverable
error the only thing we can do is we can
try to gather as much information as
possible from the crash to analyze it to
find the root cause and to prevent it
the next time so to bring everybody up
on the same line just a very quick brief
introduction about a hotspot VM so on
the very base we have two CPUs I won't
go into CPUs today during
my last 12 years I was working on hot
spot we find some cpu errors as well but
I won't go into this topic today so on
the base we have C++ code we have the
Java launcher we have different Java
libraries Lib Java which is the native
part of the class library we have the
system C libraries which is all C code
or in memory then the biggest part is
obviously the hotspot itself the virtual
machine itself which is in the Lib JVM
shared library it consists of the
runtime then GC and to JIT compilers if
you're using the server version of the
hotspot which is the default today this
is also written in C++ then on the next
level we have generated code so this is
one of the major problems when it comes
to debugging and analyzing hotspot
errors that we have to deal a lot with
generated code where native debugger
cannot help us very much so first of all
the interpreter itself is generated I
will show you a quick example in one of
the following slides how this looks like
then we have various tabs which is kind
of glue code between the native C code
and the generated compiler just in time
compiled code we have C 1 compiled
method C 2 compiled method so by the way
C 1 is the client compilers it - is
there a server compiler which runs
slower but generates by the code and
recently we have ahead of time compiled
message which also appear in the code
cache now and finally we have the data
of our program so we have the Java
objects in the Java heap we have the
classes themselves which today live in
the meta space previously they lived in
a part of the heap the circled term
generation but it was removed with in
Java 8 and we still the VM still uses a
considerable part of C heap so this is
also something many people are not aware
of
they configure the virtual machine let's
say with 8 gigabyte and then they wonder
why it uses 12 so for example a
just-in-time compiler can very well use
up to a gigabyte for compiling a very
large method and depending on the
hardware you are running on you have a
lot of threads running
even if you start just the hello world
program a hotspot VM will today start at
least 10 threads we have the VM straight
which does some bookkeeping you have a
GCS write various number of uses right
depending of the course you have various
number of JIT threads and they all also
of course need memory and when they
while they are running they also consume
Sahib and finally we have the
application threads the Java threads and
these Java threads they execute the code
from here so they are started by the
launch art and they jump into the
runtime they execute some interpreter
code to execute maybe just in time
compile code and so on and during this
talk we will see which places we can
crash and how we can detect that and
hopefully fix it so we have a very small
crash example so who of you has seen
this before when he was running a java
application so may probably a lot of you
that's why we're here ok so what does
this say us so first of all it gives a
short brief summary what happens so in
this this case the segmentation fault
happened at this program counter it
tells us the function which was on top
of the stack when the error happened so
in this case it was in the Lib JVM so in
the virtual machine itself it was a
memory access function it tells us where
the core file was written to and it also
tells us where the hotspot error file
was written to so this hotspot error
file is actually the data we will look
at most during this talk because it
contains a lot of useful information so
there are some Cavett's when you on run
with you limit minus c 0 so core 5 0 no
core 5 will be produced so usually it
can be very helpful to have core files
as we will see so at least when you run
into a problem and want to reproduce it
you should set your limit minus c 2
unlimited so you get a core file also
gnu/linux systems like a bun too even if
you settle in
- unlimited qualifies won't be created
in your file system but they will be
piped to a system application like
airport and you won't see them so you
may have to configure this in proxies
comic or pattern or depending on your
system this may be a different file but
you may have to configure the core
pattern to a file on your file system
and not to to a pipe somewhere here to a
service program okay so how did I
produce this crash it's actually very
simple by using unsafe you know you
shouldn't use unsafe because as the name
says it's unsafe but it's very handy for
producing crashes so actually what we do
here is I just define a method crash and
it uses unsafe to write a value X to
address 99 so address 99 is usually not
accessible and we call crash is 42 and
write it to others 99 it is crashes the
program so let's see how that's what
error file looks in this case so on top
of the hotspot error file we have a
summary
it contains the exact command line this
already can be very useful when you for
example get what's whatever file from
your client this can be useful to see
what what you run it contains quite
detailed information about the CPU the
hardware which was used both operating
system which was used and how long the
program did run in our case this was
just a second of course but we often get
crash files from clients which run for
weeks or even months so you see if a
problem appears after a few months
that's not easy to reproduce usually
usually so you better have all the
information you want in this error file
or in the core file if you have one
because you won't get a second chance
ok let's dig deeper into the hot spot
error file as next section is the Java
stack trace it contains all the Java
stack frames which were on the stack
when the error occurred and we see we
called our crash program and this called
unsafe then according to JDK misc and
thermal unsafe which is in JDK 9 simply
datian of unsafe and then called put in
but that's just the java frames when you
if you remember in the beginning we saw
that we actually crashed in a c function
which is in lip JVM so the next section
what's what arrow fire contains the so
called native or Mixtec trace which
contains all the actual frames which
have been on the stack and here you can
see we start with sleepy sweat starts
right then the Java main in the drama
launcher which in leap jli then we go
through Jane I call static and so on all
the stack up finally we arrive our Java
methods and the last Java matter tend to
put it unsafe put in course into native
code so unsafe put it it's the
implementation of this this is declared
negative in Java and this then calls
into the Lib JDM itself where we come to
the actual method where the crash
occurred yes so it's just an animation
of what I showed you it was not true I
will have a laser pointer so to come
back to our overview so we crashed in
the runtime while executing runtime code
in a Java thread so that was easy so
digging further into the hotspot error
file there is a section which contains
order which registers the value of the
registers when the VM crashed and as you
can see the register ax contained the
value 42 this was actually the way we
were writing to the address 99 if you
remember and address that register dxdx
contains the address but this is a
register to memory mapping it's not
actually just the pure register values
as you can see here while writing this
hotspot error file the VM tries to make
sense of these values and for example
the register RBX contained a strange hex
value which we in knew what it is but
the VM could find out that this is
actually a pointer to the put int method
so
for these other values the VM couldn't
find out or actually this one is
pointing into the stack but there is no
more information about it and finally we
see it at the top of the page we see
this strange arrow it says error
occurred during error reporting so while
the VM was writing the error file it was
trying to make sense of the values
contained in the register it's run into
another problem probably another
segmentation fault because as I told you
we are in an inconsistent state the VM
cannot be sure about all the values in
the register if there are objects or
where they are pointing to but it tries
to find it out and during this procedure
it may run into another problem but
there is a very sophisticated algorithms
in the hot spot which catch this
segmentation faults ignore them and
tries to go forward inverting the
hotspot FS to provide as much
information as possible so after this
error this section will be closed the
register mapping but the hotspot writing
will continue with the next section and
actually the next section is the pure
register values and here you saw it
couldn't make sense of register R 9 so
here we see register R 9 has this value
and this happened to point into the heap
but it didn't really point at the
beginning of an object so while the the
VM wanted to print out the type of the
object but because it just happened to
point into heap but not at the beginning
of an object it crashed while followed
the class pointer of the object so here
we get at least the naked values of the
registers yes
so going further we also get the values
which have been on top of the stack when
the error occurred and we also get the
values near the before and after the
instructions where the crash happened
so when the crash happened happens in a
C++ matter in Lib JVM we can actually we
could actually extract that
manually but if that happens in
generated code this may be quite useful
to have the actual instructions which
have been executed because wouldn't be
easy to extract them it is not if you
wouldn't have a core file yes yes non
mapping this various back to I just I
tell you because I know I mean we we are
just analyzing the hot spot error file
and we saw that it has this line so it's
saying that when this hurts whatever I
was written it couldn't make sense of
the register a nine and I just told you
why that happens because I know so when
you when you're debugging this crash and
you you you're debugging how the hats
whatever file will be written you will
see that it tries to print the value of
this object and then crashes a second
time and then it prints this this value
I think this West Java 9 actually we can
just look it up should be here on top of
the I don't see it here but it was Java
9 I just used a debug build of Java 9
for it but it would also happen in Java
8 because if you write to address 99
with unsafe you crash in every average
ever version okay so let's continue
we were the instructions and even if you
have only this hex term of the
instructions you could use gdb or object
dump or online or SEM disassembler
something to disassemble this
instruction and you see actually this
instruction wrote the content of
register ax which is was 42 to address
RDX which are the X was 99 okay so we
saw that the hotspot error file contains
a lot of useful and interesting
information
so sometimes we may want this
information without crashing the VM so
therefore we can use the J command
utility which comes with your JDK
distribution and we can just call J
command with the PID of your process of
your java process and command vm info
and if you generate a so called vm info
file it doesn't contain all the
information of our hot spot error file
when a crash happens because obviously
we're not at the crash but it still
contains a lot of useful information so
for example here you can see this this
was jdk 9 slow debug field it contains
the command line it contains the
hardware
it contains heap addresses and a lot of
other useful stuff so sometimes when a
customer has problems you can just ask
him to send you such a info file for him
to generate it so generating this info
file suit should be quite safe so for
example generating such an info file
doesn't do the register to region
mapping because as we saw that may be
dangerous so it only prints the the pure
value of of addresses because you don't
want to crash the VM just to get the
information all of it
learning virtual machine sorry ok so now
let's start with a is a real example
let's say somebody some of your clients
or colleagues shows you this crash file
or this crash and ask you what can you
say what happened so any idea I mean the
audience was happened here so having a
look we see that this time we didn't
crash in a native code or in the lip
when the VM request in interpreted code
so this lowercase J means it's a Java
method and it's an interpreted method an
uppercase J would mean it was a just in
time compiler method so we crashed in an
interpreted method which is called crash
because again it's from an example and
we get the PC segmentation fault
happened this time
we also get another information because
we crashed in the just-in-time compiler
so the hotspot error file so this is the
content of the hotspot error file a
summary I left out some of the parts
which we know already so this time the
hot so terrify also contains the the
template of the bytecode in which the
interpreter cache crashed so the hotspot
has a so-called template interpreter
which means that it generates assembly
for each Java bytecode and then it calls
them one after another and executes you
know byte codes and this time we crashed
in the error length byte code and the
hotspot error fire contains the
generated code for for this error length
byte code and we can see the address at
which we crashed and we see the
instruction at which request so this is
the instruction where we crashed we see
the register area X contains the strange
value batbabe so this is a so-called eye
catcher which is used throughout often
use throughout the hotspot 2 to zero out
memory or to flex some values which are
illegal so if you see such values
you can search over the code and see
where these values are written and this
may give you an idea why this crash
happened and here we are actually moving
the value of ax to this address and an
entry crash so let's take a look how I
have provoked this error how I how I
managed to bring the VM in a state where
it crashed in the interpreter so this is
a very simple program called crash int
it has a it contains an integer array
and you have a crash function which just
returns the length of this array and
again then we create a crash into object
we use unsafe to put some this this bad
paid value at the address of this object
with unsafe so again this is something
you shouldn't do it's just for the sake
of example and then we call crash so
this is the memory layout of our crash
into object in the heap so it contains
the object header which has a pointer to
the class or object in the mark word and
then the actual data itself so in this
case the data is just a reference to an
integer array and then somewhere another
place in the heap we have the integer
error itself again the integer array has
object header then it has a length field
and it's an integer area of length one
so it contains one integer so when we
write this value bad pipe into the I to
the at offset 12 of our current object
we will overwrite this reference to the
integer array and this will point
somewhere to nowhere so when we then
actually execute our crash in function
so this is the bytecode of our crash in
function which you can get by running
Java P on the class you see that it
actually does a load so this loads this
then gets a get field for for pushing
the integer area onto the stack and any
cost error wailings and error legs of
course wants to access the length field
of this object so this is what you
actually what we actually saw here this
is offset twelve of this object that
contains the length but when we were
accessing this we were crashing because
we've overwritten this so again this was
just an example and this example also
shows you something
very important when analyzing crashes
because actually we've crashed in the
interpreter in an interpreted method but
this was wasn't an error in interpreter
the interpreter what works just fine if
you have for example jane i code
actually i've actually simulated j'ni
code with unsafe here so if you have J&amp;amp;I
code for example and pollute your heap
or do some bad things in your heap
everything can happen so we've just
corrupted our object in the heap and
then we finally crashed in the
interpreter so this is something you
have to keep in mind the cost of your
object is not always related to the
place where you really crash and this
makes finding errors very tricky
sometimes okay so I will come now to a
real example so a problem which you
really got from our customer until now
we only had two examples to show you how
everything actually works so we got such
a message from a customer that he gets
out of memory errors out of memory meta
space this was all we received in error
message so there is one option you can
use so if the program at the customer
stops anyway because of an exception you
can try to use this xx crash on out of
memory error so in this case the VM will
not only exit with an with an exception
but it will at the same time produce a
complete hotspot error file and a core
file we ask the customer to do this and
he sent us that
generated hotspot error file and the
corresponding code file soon this
happened in Java 8
the problem is in Java 8 but I've
analyzed it with Java 9 metastasis
already in Java 8 so prom cane was
removed in Java 8 and replaced by meta
space so this is Java 8 upwards okay so
how does this look like okay this is not
the hot spot error fry from the customer
I cannot show you this but I've done a
reproducer which that's exactly the same
thing what happened in the customer side
and I will show you that at the end of
the talk okay so you can see that the
program was calling define class it has
a class loader classifier parser then
actually constant pool allocate it run
into the into the error so this doesn't
look weird I mean Java program should
load classes and allocate constant pools
and so on so another part of the hotspot
error file which I haven't which I
haven't shown you before it's the event
section so the hotspot error file also
has a section which records important
events which happen during execution and
you can see that before the crash
happened
the problem was loading a custom class
loader and at the end it executed a
collection a meta space collection
because it obviously ran out of space
and you see that the meta space
collection tried very hard to free
memory but it couldn't succeed so that's
actually the cause of the of the error
so with this information we cannot get
any further but there are other useful
tools for example serviceability agent
which you can use to inspect the core
so we also got the core file and we used
the hotspot debugger with Java hotspot
debugger of Java 9 the serviceability
tool to analyze this core file and the
hotspot debugger has a class browser
which allows you to look for all the
classes all the active loaded classes in
a core file when the VM crashed and when
you look for these classes for in a in a
package showing this this example quarks
Simonis we see that we actually have
this custom class loader which was
loaded before the crash and we have two
versions of the same class so that's
actually also not unusual because you
know in Java every class loader can has
its own version of a class so when you
have a custom class loader it's possible
it has is version of crash out of memory
and the same time the application class
table could have floated this class
before so two two versions of a class
it's actually not bad that shouldn't
fill up the meta space so we can dig
further in the hotspot error file and it
also contains the last exceptions which
was thrown by the virtual machine the
last ten exceptions before the VM
crashed and here we see an interesting
thing so before the VM crashed it showed
a linkage error exception and this
linkage exception was thrown by our
custom class loader and it says attempt
to placate class definition for name for
our class name so obviously there were a
lot of the appliques last definitions
happening and of course one class order
can only have one class one version of a
class so if it tries to reload the same
class it it gets this exception but this
exception were obviously handled by the
application so we didn't saw them but in
the end it resulted in an out of memory
in the meta space so still this
shouldn't happen because I mean we
handle this exception why do we get an
out of memory error here so the
stability agent is actually a very very
powerful tool and we cannot only use the
graphical tools which are which come
with it we can also use it
programmatically it has an API and it
allows us to inspect all the data
structures all the C++ data structures
which the hotspot maintains during its
run time so for example every class
object which you have in Java you know
in Java you can get you can call get
class on each object has a corresponding
class with Kay a C++ object in the
hotspot and now we can use the
serviceability agent to walk these these
these these C++ representations of the
Java classes in in the core file for
this we get a so-called class of the
data graph object which is all the class
class loaders in the hotspot then we
walk them and for every class loader we
query all the C++ class objects in which
were active at a time and we print them
out to to memory so when we run this
program again this is done with Java 9
so we have to add the JDK hotspot agent
module for Java 8 it's in the tools I
think tooth jar files so if you have a
JDK you don't have to do anything
whichever 9 you have to add the module
and also add a lot of exports because
unfortunately the API isn't publicly
exported anymore so if you run this on
our core file we will see that we had in
we have a lot of C++ classes for
actually the two class versions which we
have in Java and then we run this
through what count we see we have
actually 320 versions so this is
obviously not ok because you should only
have one C++ class representation for
every Java
in the heap so with all this information
we were able to reproduce the problem
and this is actually the reproduced er
which I also used for this presentation
so what we actually do is we get the
byte codes of our class we define a
known class loader in order to redefine
the defined class method the class order
which is protected and then in the loop
we rapidly define the same class so this
will succeed the first time and after
the first time we will obviously get
linkage errors which we catch and when
we do that in a loop we can reproduce
this problem and find the memory leak so
this was a day 1 problem of the meta
space change which was introduced in
Java 8 obviously never nobody did this
before catching linkage errors so our
customer for some reason did this and
then he run into this problem so I fixed
this like in February 2017 just in time
for Java 9 okay so let's come to the
next example
so I have a look at this hot spot error
file this time we crashed in the lip JVM
in massive code generate array copy if
you're not familiar with shorts what
this doesn't tell you anything but you
see it generated a core file a hotspot
error file and this time cert file has
been generated so called replay file so
this is interesting because it means
this happened to this crash happened
during compilation of JIT compilation
and we can see this in the house word
error file so we see the command line of
the program and we see that the current
threat where the crash happened was the
C 2 compiler threat we also see that the
crash happened to read the compilation
of a crash method and then we get the
stack trace and see that
happened in a method called generate era
coffee so obviously again we compile a
array copy system every copy method and
while we were compiling that one
compiler crashed for some reason so
where are we here now we crashed in the
c2 compiler in in C++ code not in
generated code but in C plus per call of
the c2 should come compile the sweat so
now we can use the replay compiles and
replay data file option of Java feed in
this replay file to reproduce the
problem but sad enough when we try to
reproduce the problem the crash doesn't
happen so any idea why it didn't happen
so if you look carefully at the hot spot
error file you may remember that it's a
command line use the option called
xx- to escape analysis so the program is
running without escape analysis when it
crashed so if you want to reproduce the
problem we obviously have to use the
exactly same command line options
because otherwise other code will be
generated other cost paths will be taken
doesn't mean we can reproduce the
problem so that's why the command line
parameters in hotspot error file are
useful for reproducing the problem so
when we use the exactly same options on
the command line now with our replay
file you see we can easily reproduce the
problem
so obviously this means we need the same
classes on the class path as the
customer so you can only do this if you
have the same version of the program to
the customer has and now that we can
reproduce the problem with this replay
file it is very easy to use other native
debugger like gdb for example place a
breakpoint into the offending method and
run the program and see what happens so
here again I cheated a little bit
actually I have just just patched the VM
such that it crashes in this special for
this special example but this is
actually how it also happens in a
relative there there is a problem in the
in the they often are not often but
sometimes there are problems in the
indicate compiler which only occur in
very strange situations you know
profiling is that just-in-time
compilation is done Tina McGee does
inlining that's profiling and in some
strange situations sometimes there
happens some inlining some optimization
which never happened before and the
compiler and enter in the compilation
crashes and then it's very useful to
have this replay file because this
replay file allows you to compile a
message in exactly the same way which
happens when the crash was recurring so
this time what what what have I added
here I actually say that when we compile
an array copy a generic copy method and
the type of the destination array is
crash in the class X or crash 5 in the
class X or crash 6 in the class X then
we will just just crash so looking at
the program which we used we have a
crack class crash 5 we have in across
this x and y we have the crash method we
just cause array copy it takes a source
object and copies that into a
destination array of type X so that's if
this happens here we can provoke the
crash and then we call this 20,000 times
to warm up the JIT compiler and compile
the message so we use this method to
provoke the problem
for some reason the slides are okay so
now ii take let's see what you have
learned until now we have a similar
crash again we crash at the same exactly
same location and we have a replay file
so this time we are smart enough to use
the same command line options which are
in the hotspot error file and we want to
reproduce the problem but this time we
get another error we actually cannot
reproduce the problem we get an error
while replaying the compilation there's
a strange sorry the strange error
message saying java.lang class not i
found lambda form goodness that handled
something like this so what does this
mean well during forum s it handles and
invoke dynamic that the VM generate
dynamically generates bytecode for
helper classes and these classes are
generated dynamically at runtime they
are not in in your class files in your
application class files so this time we
want it to reproduce our compilation but
not all the classes which were active at
the time when the problem happened are
available to the VM so we get this error
but as we saw before our example didn't
use lambdas so maybe this is not
important and often these methods are
not really required so we have the
hotspot offers an additional option
called replay ignite reply ignore
initialization errors and you can use
that one to ignore these errors so we
see the errors are then ignored but we
still cannot reproduce our our problem
all the initialization airs are ignored
but still the error doesn't happen so to
verify that our message actually gets
compiled we use the print compilation
option as you see that this time the
crash six crash method which where we
crashed
we notice from the hotspot error file
was indeed compiled compiled but
without an error happening so what can
be the problem here so again the hotspot
error file may help us here to gain some
more information for example here it
contains and if it shows us that before
the crash happened
we had a class redefinition event so
during runtime you know you can use
class instrumentation and class
redefinition to redefine classes for
example a lot of tools monitoring tools
for example do this sometimes profilers
they just redefine classes or debuggers
can also really find classes so here our
class where we crashed was really find
so we see the class was loaded and then
it was redefined so against
serviceability agent may be of use here
because it allows us to dump the classes
in a form which they were active when
the crash happened form a core file so
it uses the information in the qualifier
to reconstruct the class files and this
is actually not a version of the class
files you had statically on your disk
but the redefined version of the classes
which were active at the time when the
crash happened which maybe did which may
be different if free definition happened
and actually this is not not an not an
easy step because the meta space doesn't
contain your class file one to one
focused on the disk it contains it
contains the decomposed word data or it
has all the information of the constant
pool and the byte codes in the methods
and all in different places but the
serviceability agent can just gather
that together and create a very class
part of it of it so we call the Java
hotspot debugger command-line interface
this time yes
and this is all openjdk it's all OpenJDK
what I show here so I called the command
build replay jars I quit and I see that
hot sweaty Burger created to jar files
one with the application classes which
were loaded by the application class
loaders and one was the one called bucho
which which was which contains all the
classes loaded by the boot class loader
and now we can try the replay again but
this time not with the class is on the
on the disk on the class pass but with
the classes which we have it extracted
from the core file and when we do that
we see that now we can really reproduce
the error again which is fine because
now again we can go into the debugger
see what happened and hopefully find the
problem so how I did this this example
it's actually the same example like
before the only difference is that now
the element type of the destination
array of the array copies is not X but Y
and you remember we only crashed when
the destination when the element type
was X so when we use this program as it
is statically no no error will happen
but here during runtime we used class
redefinition I won't go into details how
does this be done I just use the
instrumentation agent to redefine this
class and replace Y by X so when you
just use this class it is on the disk
nothing will happen but when you run
this program this class a will be
redefined to have another destination
type not Y but X and then the crash
happens so that's why when you used the
class is extracted from the core file
they had the redefined version of the
class and we could reproduce the problem
this is actually a quite common problem
nowadays because many customers in big
installations that you
all kind of instrumentation tools to
monitor their tools and the actual code
which gets executed may be quite
different from the one you your ship to
them and it's it's often very hard then
to reproduce problems in your lab okay
so again this is where the crash
happened
somebody no yeah actually come to a
conclusion No so as I told you before
crash location crash reason are often
quite different so if some Jane I caught
some bad code changes your your Java
heap you're really out of luck because
you can for example question that you
see you could also crashing in the
interpreter as you see or in generated
code so crash location a crash reason is
unfortunately not always related so for
example if the just-in-time compiler
generates bad code doesn't mean that you
crash during code generation but during
the execution of a method so then it's
very hard this this method may then
corrupt the heap and again later you
crash a very different location so
finding the crash reason just was having
the crash location is very hard so with
this I actually come to the end of my
talk there is a lot of interesting stuff
which about crash analysis on the web
there is some articles in the Java
magazine and roppongi net sink last year
which I want to talk about building your
own Java debugging tools with
serviceability agent and instrumentation
and stuff like that the last thing I
wanted to point out that serviceability
agent was actually introduced 2001
already you know by a paper of Kenneth
Russell and last buck so this is a very
old technology
and unfortunately it's still not
officially supported and it breaks from
time to time because it really has to
always keep the Java implementation at
the hot spot implementation and sync but
nevertheless if you want to dig into the
implementation details of hot spot it's
it's it's a tool I can really advise you
to use so that's it here once again the
slides and I think we run out of time
but if there are quick questions I can
try to answer thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
