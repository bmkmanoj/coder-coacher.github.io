is advanced management console this
facility gives you the ability to manage
your Java clients whether they are Java
applets or Java web started clients
across your enterprise hi my name is Jim
Weaver and I'm a job a technology
ambassador for Oracle Corporation and
I'm going to be talking about the java
advanced management console it
essentially does two things one is it
automatically tracks Java applet and
Java Web Start app usage across your
enterprise whenever they are used by
different machines in your enterprise
Java usage tracks that and sends it to a
central server and then the advanced
management console gets that information
from the server and helps you develop
deployment rules which allow you to
manage those Java applets and web
started java applications there's a
concept called deployment rule sets
which allow you to manage what gets to
be run and what is blocked it also helps
you manage different versions of Java
for example you may have applets and
applications in your enterprise that
require different versions of Java some
newer and some older also you need the
ability to be able to manage from a
security standpoint what applications
get run or not and what applications you
require that the user answer the default
prompts as opposed to letting it run
without those dialog boxes so we can
control compatibility across the
enterprise with deployment rules as I
said some applications need certain
versions of Java also we can whitelist
or blacklist applications and reduce our
attack surface so I'd like to just go
ahead and take the Java advanced
management console for a spin and I'll
show you some of its features
first we'll go to the home page and
we'll notice that there are a lot of
options on this page those are shortcuts
to be able to do different tasks that
are very common and those take you to
these other views here and I'm going to
go ahead and show you those other views
one is the apps view and this shows the
apps that were caught by the Java usage
tracker so as I mentioned before when
applets and web start applications are
invoked it's reported to the usage
tracker and that's where we're getting
our information here we've got five
different applets and applications that
were reported
there's the URLs of them the titles the
vendors and if we want to see more
information about those we could click
inspect and we could find more
application details so you're here we
have a list of jars
we have channel P extensions in this
case this application doesn't have any
and also we have the JRE version and run
count so in this case we have 1.7 as the
JRE version that this applet ran and we
see that it has been run eight times by
one machine so we can find out not only
how many times an application was run
but also by how many machines so how
popular it is and how pervasive it is
and now we can go in to rules if we want
to be able to configure rules and
control how these are deployed or
whether they're deployed or whether
they're blocked and what kinds of
questions the user has to answer then we
just go to rules over on the Left we
have different rule sets so for example
we may have a science department and
we'll make a rule set called science
department we've already done that here
and then we have four different rules
that map to Apple
occasions or applets and then over here
we have the rules themselves so for
example the science department has a
physics scratchpad rule which I'll go
ahead and expand that and show you the
dialogue that has the information for
the theoretical physics scratchpad we're
showing here that the rule action is
default so that means that when this is
invoked the user is going to have to
answer the default dialogues to be able
to get it to run another one here we've
got astronaut nicknamed ER these are
just sample applications kind of
fictitious applications that I put
together to demonstrate what how these
work now this rule action is force run
so it's gonna it's going to run the
application but it's going to force it
to be run at an API level of 1.8 or
later so these are how some of the rules
what some of the rules look like now if
we would like to see what the impact of
the rules are on the rule set and what
the user should see then what we can do
is click on a rule set and then click
this button which is rule set
relationships and we can see that in the
science department we've got four rules
and those four rules map to four
different applications and here is a an
application that does some Java
detection and we're good to go on this
we're saying that where it's going to go
ahead and run that and then this one
we're saying because it's yellow and
we've got this down arrow that it's
going to run but the user is going to be
asked the default questions this
application is going to be blocked and
that this one is going to be run but
this icon means force run and it'll be
forced to run on one-point-eight in this
case
now if we wanted to create our own rule
set we could click this button right
here which is add a rule set and we're
going to say home computer so the the
home computers will get to run a
different set or maybe maybe an
intersected set of applications and
we'll set up the rules for that so here
it's saying that the home computer rule
set was created so what we'll do first
is we'll go ahead and drag a couple of
the rules in there that have already
been created we'll drag our physics
scratch pad and our astronaut nickname
er and then we'll go ahead and add one
called
comic-con and I'll go ahead and open
this one now this particular rule is a
named comic-con and it's going to run
the latest available JRE and so we'll go
ahead and drag that in here as well now
if I wanted to add another rule for
perhaps a different application then I
would simply go to apps and then say new
rule and then it would fill in the
information based upon the information
that we got from the Java usage tracker
and then we could modify the rules for
example instead of saying default we
could say run or we could say block and
specify other things I hope you enjoyed
this brief demo of the advanced
management console as well as the
explanations of what a deployment rule
set is and the java usage tracker is and
how those can help you in managing the
java applets and java applications in
your enterprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
