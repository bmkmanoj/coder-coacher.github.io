conference 2014 Nuremberg Germany we're
in a horrible booth and this is one of
two Oracle pods in the booth this one's
the Oracle Internet of Things platforms
and applaud and with us here to tell us
what we're showing in this area is Tim
Braves see the global solutions
architect in IOT and architecture group
at Oracle item hey James so you're going
to look at now is something for showing
in our data center follow me into the
other things demonstration now the data
center is where we have all of the
information that's coming from all the
reporters around as I'm aware of the
events that we receive now when you get
to this kind of data and nowadays it's
very valuable information you want to
keep it and retain it for long periods
of time but you also need to be able to
process it an Oracle has a number of
products that can help you do that so
what we're going to look at today it is
a couple of the front end products
without confusion lies your data but
behind these are things like Oracle
relational database we Oracle no SQL
database we're actually using to store
the data so let's have a look at a
couple of vision systems so the screen
will appear at the moment is a screen
that is the back to view and now bands
down to business activity monitoring key
feature of this screen is it is getting
the data in live event fees so as people
are playing the jam out of darts game or
we receive events and this display will
update if the advantages very fast real
time updating although it doesn't have
the full in-depth data analysis but some
of the other tools do so let's have a
look at the other business analysis
tools first of all we're going to look
at something that is based on the Oracle
NoSQL database so this is high I it is a
relational database system but can he
used with a dupe big data environment
this is pulling information out of the
Oracle no SQL database and it's
processing that information when you
have shoot audience of information you
need to store it but you need to store
it very efficiently very fast and that
is a project that the Oracle no SQL
database is particularly well-suited so
high this part of a hoodie distribution
that's part of the Oracle data plans
what we're looking at now is the
business intelligence enterprise edition
tools and it is put information out of
the Oracle relational database in this
case and as the jamaat mode dansgame
generates events for us those are being
stored in a relational database and
we're generating this user interface
from us as you can see we have a range
option to visualizing the data we can
have them is it in a table for time or
in a graph for you can even do a radio
rod this is an attempt to the time show
the kind of distribution of them we
haven't i canna dark for half the
conventional mechanisms but we can also
view the data based on its fine series
so for example here we can see the
breakdown of people registering to play
the darts game and was quite a peak of
data but around three o'clock in the
afternoon now but this is intelligence
don't make it very easy to generate this
kind of report and to do the data mine
of a bitch another example let's have a
look at the track boi de dos equis now
this is monetary information from a
geospatial environment English ticular
case it's a data set from a colleague
who was running a marathon in 50 land a
few weeks ago but we captured and above
are many tools of the internet can
concede and see this kind of data the
particular benefit of this tool is but
we cannot just see the track but we can
break it down for example how fast he
was running where his heart rate was and
we can produce an analysis based on that
information so a hill in marathon may
generate a particularly high heart rate
that might be an important thing to know
I happened to go for
the runners in a mouth lastly we are
also showing another type of business
intelligence tool and this is something
for bi mobile app designer bi mobile app
designer is a product that is design or
is intended to create user interfaces to
work on tablets uses html5 and what
we're showing at the moment is in fact
the entire set of data for the darts
game both here at embedded world and
also from adults game at work on World
Congress obviously we're seeing all of
the dance would have been thrown here
and we can see the breakdown and
statistics of information now three's a
demonstration we're showing this on
laptop but it works exactly the same on
a tablet so that you can see and
visualize a tablet user interface in the
same way as we can see this kind of
intimate semantic brief summary of the
products and technologies we're having
showing in the data center part of
miracle Internet of Things demonstration
here acting very well hope that's been
of interesting please contact oracle for
more information thank you Tim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
