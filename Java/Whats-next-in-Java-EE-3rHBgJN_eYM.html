at devoxx and I'm your employee from
Oracle technology Network and my guess
is David Alaba see the vid hi hi so
David you are so what's your title
anyway so you work at Oracle on java ee
but so you would yeah yeah so I mean
eventually it's working in a Java
organization all right at Oracle okay so
you know everything about java ee then
right what's coming next yeah let's say
that I know quite a few things sorry
okay so and you have a session actually
at the box as well that's right yeah
okay so so so what's the news what do we
know so far so basically my session is
about java next so job I next is a kind
of two-phase approach to deliver a java
ee the next version of java ee so that
that is basically to version of july
that is java ee 8 that we would like to
finalize so I mean the specification and
the reference from implementation we
would like to finalize that by the end
of next year and then the other step
would be divine nine that we would like
to finalize a right after that so that
doesn't mean that we are working in
parallel towards those two version of
Java EE okay so if you're thinking
already of the two versions yes we do
multi listen yeah that's right we don't
want to delay to evaluate anymore so
that's why we have this pile approach
basically so do you do you have like
more specific ap eyes and things that
you know that will be or that our
proposed for java ee eight so at the
stage everything is still a proposal but
for example for java yet there are
things that we would like to see that we
have already discussed and I mean they
are all the gcp expose you working on
those so for example there is on the
security space there are a lot of things
to do so right now there are some
discussions regarding the exact scope of
that GSR but for example one of the
things that we would like to do is open
having a onions on that way open ID
support within a java platform so that's
that's something that we know is
important so you can already do that
today in the July space but you need to
basically bring external for
works so we would like to avoid that and
basically standardizing that into the
platform so there are discussions going
around that oat isn't understand that
that we would like to see in the
platform and finally around the security
space secret management is something
which will be very important when it
comes to cloud-based deployment so
that's the kind of thing that we would
like to have in the specification in the
security specification so you mentioned
security so those are really brand new
or what so so security was part of the
initial Java yet proposal another API
that was part of the initial proposal
that will be part of java 8 that's the
JSONP so jason b is basically the
equivalent of jax be so jason b is to
json what Jax beach to xml so it's
basically an API that can be used to
Marshall and Marshall Java object to and
from JSON document so right now this API
is already in early draft so people can
already check the API and see how it
works and provide feedback so that's
another API that will be part of Java 8
and then for java 8 we are proposing to
add two new brand new API that is the
configuration API and i'll check api so
if we're looking at the configuration
api the basic idea of that api is
basically to provide a standard way for
externalizing the configuration from an
application so that means that at the
end of the day you basically will have
two artifact the application itself and
its configuration and when it comes to
reconfiguring the application you don't
have to touch the application you just
need to change the configuration itself
so it's really about externalizing the
configuration from an application it's
not an API that can be used by any
application to configure itself so
that's more portable then yeah the idea
is that given that Java next is
targeting a cloud and microservices type
of environment we need to make sure that
we provide the right portability level
so with that API it would be easier to
reconfigure an application or a java
application that is deployed in to a
java ee cloud environment so that's one
thing and then you're our API is the
that we would like to have for
java 8 is the LCAP i dar api is
basically api that allows an application
to expose metrics about itself so out oh
it v8 that is an API that would be
useful to basically get information
about how the different applications
that are running in the platform behaves
that's something that can be consumed by
the by different tools like an external
management tool but also the cloud
platform itself and that is something
that is important when it comes to for
example microservices you will have
multiple services so you need to have
the ability to easily money toward those
different services so that's one thing
that we would like to see in Java 8 as
well so um so what are some of the api's
that are like further along right
because I mean they all I kind of at the
different stage yeah so doesn't be I
mean we already have an early draft
security GSR there are already a lot of
discussion happening so those one are
quite already advanced regarding
configuration and I'll check at this
stage this is just a proposal so we
would like to propose that as a brand
new GSR so that's something that we
still need to discuss and do but having
said that it's not java 8 is not just
about those API we also have API
existing API that are evolving in Java 8
itself like bean validation so bean
validation will move to the tube
invalidation too and they are heading
quite some nice features like having the
ability to do validation on the
collection of elements for example
something that we don't have today CDI
to is evolving as well in Java 8 having
a support for a synchronous events for
example jax-rs is evolving in Java 8 so
we'll have so instructor eyes to so java
ee 7 we had new client api in jax-rs to
148 we would like to evolve that api so
that it is reactive because we know that
going forward having a reactive base
programming model is something that is
key for java next so those are the kind
of things that we are doing
for java y8 okay and so how do you see
like okay so we're thinking so Java e8
for next year and then Java 9 so what
will be kind of the difference or the
past from one to the next what's the the
high-level thinking behind us releases
so Java e9 is basically really about
doing the right thing to the platform to
make sure that it can be easily used in
a cloud-based environment and that it
java can also be used to develop
microservices based architecture so that
means that for example we have to do a
lot of things regarding the deployment
for java nine one of the idea we have
regarding deployment is maybe that is
maybe we should look at the lighter
model where basically we would just
deploy one artifact so we would have one
jar that includes the application and
the java container itself then we can go
a step further given that july nine will
be based on 89 it would be wise to use
jirachi 9 modularity to basically have a
just in a front i'm container so just
the capability that are needed by the
application bundle directly with the
application itself those are the kind of
things that we're looking at for divine
nine and then we also have open
questions regarding for example should
we look at standardizing no SQL in Java
9 those kind of things so I have to
admit that for j9 there is quite a lot
of work that we still need to do and
it's very exciting because I mean there
are different space that we need to
tackle and would that we would like to
see into the platform and so right now
so can people so what can people do so
the second part of this technology is
also available there is votes going on
so can you explain a little bit how
people can participate maybe give
feedback tests so so so basically right
now we have we already have quite some
Jace art that are addressing that are
going on for java 8 like Justin be for
example which it's already it's not yet
done but it's already know our draft
form so it the work is very advanced GSR
we have a very active working group
working on that so I mean those GSR are
very
well and 'old but for example for the
new API like the one that we would like
to propose like the configuration API as
soon as we well we start that that means
that we will have a new EG and if people
feel like they have a value to bring for
example in that space that's something
that is very welcome obviously so people
can join either specific exposed rupes
and if they don't have the time to do
that because that's a lot of work they
can anyway observe and provide feedback
but because as soon as we have an expert
working everything is out is visible
outside of the firewall so they are
clearly seeing what is being discussed
technically and they can obviously
provide feedback that's something which
is important and there is also the day
adopted a song program are you yes
that's something that we are also
looking at so for example we have been
discussed with the budget to do specific
atop the GSR for Jason D and as we are
making progress on the new upcoming GSR
of Lucy adopted GSR is a program that
would be very useful or basically we ask
God jago-ji user group to pick up
another pledges are and play with it
right samples try to break it before it
goes final so that if something is wrong
we still have the time to fix that great
when the often I've heard that actually
the expected they expect the spec lead
actually and really appreciates also the
feedback yeah they are very basically
it's about giving their work in the end
of real users right so that's something
which is important great so thank you
David thank you for talking to us and
for explaining a little bit of about
Java EE and those 20 releases so thank
you thanks you're welcome thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
