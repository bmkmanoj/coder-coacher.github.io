screen again for San Francisco Google's
backyard for the figured on challenge
fig it on was your preferred surgeon
hello thing probably a key stream they
like to fly random things in the
background alright so jumped it down so
you realized the signal got lost in all
the tour I hope you guys got to see
something or but I hope you guys got to
see something
we've started the video for Q&amp;amp;A for QA
Gosling
has questions via social stream as let's
say we'll hang out for 15 to 20 minutes
so that was Jim Weaver who mentioned the
extremist pack live all right so before
we go when you close that door just so
one of the questions you had asked me to
we never really got to was so what do I
do yeah you know and I and the actually
the onboard software on the new
generation fighter is a relatively
simple piece mostly what I spend my time
on is the cloud side so it's it's partly
this weird repository for streaming
telemetry that allows you to have like
multiple subscribers and describe it is
a filtering whatever system that lets
subscribers see what they want and with
authentication on every packet so that
you know if you've sold the weather data
to to Noah that Noah gets the stream of
the weather packets and nothing else and
the streams the data in as close to real
time as I can get so the almost all of
the delay is the Iridium satellite
network at this point time I met you
know it really it was that like network
plus I know it significantly less than a
second in delivery time with you know
pretty
you
then there's the end up being a pile of
web apps that sit on top of that that do
do things like you know display
statistics of the health of robots out
in the field and ones to do
visualization do some desktop apps i
think i've had that java one I get that
I showed that one app that uses shed
world what wheels tues visualize whirled
up yeah chips are so so presumably a lot
of what you're coding is his job at
these days yeah pretty much entirely
Java tragically more JavaScript than I
would like to be doing if it wasn't for
jquery I think I'd shoot myself how
about javafx um I've been I've actually
started braiding Java that fat tub of F
tilde FX apps ah a week or so ago oh and
I'm actually pretty jazzed about it it's
working pretty smoothly so api's are
reasonable yeah they've guys so far I've
been been quite reasonable I i really
like f xml ok all that all the CSS stuff
and the way that that you know all the
annotations are being used to connect FX
ml to the to the actual code but that's
felt pretty slick
I've got a couple of sort of daunting
experiments that I have to know that I
have to try one is one that I'm fairly
sure is doomed to failure which is
running world wind inside FX I'm
expecting there to be this you know
dueling OpenGL libraries problem that
will condemn things to miserableness I'm
he added brave enough to try that one
yet well the the first obstacle for that
and I actually was fiddling with this
over the past week is getting a swing
app to run inside of an FX f yeah we
don't we haven't released the know the
rapper swing swing view there's an open
for service project calls things effects
which has a swing view and presumably we
will eventually do a swing note yeah so
I was trying to figure out what internal
stuff we had I could leverage or see if
the things affect stuff worked yeah yeah
they be the other what I want to want to
try this um is that that that I i wrote
a a map viewer that would take tiles it
kind of kind of looks like like the
Google Maps API but it's a it's a it's a
swing component and I normally use these
a use tiles from like the OpenStreetMap
project and I've got this really slick
one that's just just raw awt and there
are a lot of the pain and agony is in
you know managing the imaging the image
cache yeah so you you know if you've
decided that you don't need an image
that you canceled the reading right now
because that's bandwidth you need yeah
because you're sighs you're scrolling
you know things that failed and went out
beside you need to be able to okay okay
ants does it did he run this off hand
but do the Java fix I'm in shape you
guys let you do that they probably don't
let you cut off and I could we're not
good if I
that I was looking looking through them
and so I was thinking of trying to to
re-implement the the Matt browser using
the effects node tree in it and it looks
like it's made its going to be
relatively straightforward the the kind
of tricks you need to play in cash
management to make it really fluid might
be outside of the use case that the
current image api's were designed for I
don't know yeah but I think it's not
it's not outside of the range of what
you want data both you could have been
like like even having a good street map
API as a standard component would be a
really cool thing yeah so on my on my
infinite to new list is you know porting
the one that I wrote it runs as a swing
component but it's mostly just uses
little lovely awt stuff ok what one of
the one of the guys actually saw i guess
the stream worked up to the part where
you were talking about the magnetic
clutch on the runner right so up to that
point we had we had video no no that was
an awful lot of the way through yeah and
he was wondering h kk hook was wondering
are the devices on the vessel running
java SE embedded so not the nose so no
the autumn what happen each other the
dominant on the new generation the via
the central machine is that the scenes
he is running job as he embedded you
know there's you know it's it's sort of
a combination of java SE embedded
there's random bits of c code for doing
like blue level device drivers and you
know all kinds of weirdness the new
devices are all are all arms they're all
running
linux we actually use this this weird
version of linux from times this oh no
so now the standards of TPM based as a
TV and a story yeah effectively but the
folks at time says to a bunch of you
know every every arm chip is a little
different in the way that you have to
speak to devices and the rest of that
and so time sis has a lot of flavors of
Linux that talk to different embedded
boards and so the none of the standard
Linux distributions run on any of the
embedded arm boards that work for us so
we ended up using this one from time sis
yeah yeah we needed a we needed a board
that was pretty environmentally robust
and and then the big deal for us has
been serial lines like I can't believe
I'm like back in the 70s with rs232 it
just it just it just feels so psycho to
be doing that stuff again yeah mobile
communications yeah and and and it's in
it's sad you know all the devices they
tend to behave like Hayes modems you
probably don't remember his modems and
they et command set Bagley I ago I am
practically old enough to have written
device drivers for it had to speak via
the days modem command set but that sort
of took over the world of protocols to
serial modems and I are back there is
very little I'll back 18
new life and it's like oh please Lord
just shoot me but it works in its
incredibly low power costs lower power
than bluetooth or whatever alright so
let's take one last question for folks
online double welcome i rap okay so Adam
Adam doubt this Davis Adam Davis asks
what other languages do you like besides
Java other was one like those eyes you
have always really like Scala they're
using Python you mentioned you have gi
phone yeah I got the good i tithe on
running on here I guess I like I wasn't
a like that was a practical well so
maybe I'm being a little there there you
know I basically like like like Python
just fine my issue with with with with
with python is the the just the
indentation thing the way the
indentation is what determines nesting
having had to write a COBOL compiler in
my past life there are aspects of Kobol
that are based on indentation a very
similar way to python it I can't write
Python without like having this I hate
COBOL reflex and in its and it's crazy
but you know it's it's it's there
actually I like I like what they did
with new lines and line breaks and Scala
yeah yeah all that made sense you know
the the thing about Java is it was
designed around being culturally
compatible
with C++ for good or for bad right I
mean it was it was it would you know
that was the whole goal was to have I'll
have it be that you know C++ programmers
could look at it go okay and as far as
I'm concerned Scala and two and our just
the same thing and what once you get get
to anything that targets the JPM yeah
you know life is life is good I've you
know I i did i did a reasonably large
project in soon scala but a about a year
ago and it was mostly a pretty good
experience it tends to do a lot of GC
churning with allocating a lot more
objects and I'm real comfortable with
but you know otherwise I just thought it
was you know pretty great cool okay so
thanks a lot for making that the time
this morning to show me around show us
around the liquid robotics yeah 3 no no
problem the the the comedy of technology
is you know what makes life fun right
yeah yeah so we've got multiple
companies of technologies going on here
we've been robots with multiple tip
redundant layers and video equipments
with fewer redundant layers yeah some
needs to be out I guess yeah yeah i like
i like systems where you can hit
anything with a baseball bat and the
whole system keeps on going yeah yeah
I've been losing a lot of sleep over
that particular one lightly but getting
awfully good at it they set of quarter
cases that cause my cluster to fail it's
getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and ever more exotic nice so the ground
the grass offers just as resilient as
what's running Ella well it's not going
to be as resilient need to be but it's
I'm more worried about
losing not losing control of like fleets
of robots the individual robots are
physically pretty robust you know and
there's sort of division of duties
between me and the other programmers
here mostly other programmers here work
on the robots but they're there they
mostly really fuss with like low-level
device details and mostly what I did was
the the sort of overarching control
architecture that the right now it's
it's a it's it's it's big deal is is is
is and then it's it's big deal is about
understanding what what components have
failed what things need to be restarted
and when and what what what order and
you know when when when eight when a
fails you have to restart a what other
things need to be restarted with kicked
or whatever and handling you know all
the the failure in recovery scenarios
cool and that bad piece is you know
happy and running and big mega Java code
but it's not nearly as hairy as being
able to handle like not only a complete
data center failure but an ISP failure
you know so if we completely lost at the
service provider we keep on trucking
yeah so multiple levels of redundancy
yeah okay so for folks watching the
stream thanks for tuning in for the
first night hacking interview apologize
for the technical difficulties but
hopefully we showed some interesting
things and if James is available and
interested we'll we'll try to do a
repeat later on let me get more cool
robot sense well maybe maybe see the new
the new ships which a good next one will
hike say have to be in Hawaii oh yeah
that would be a good excuse yeah
yeah yeah we could go and go and then
you'd have to do the the underwater
version of your rig here yeah yeah that
would be that would be the the enclosure
but they yeah course then you have to be
like a wire and a tether because Wi-Fi
doesn't work worth through this
works for 3g as well but yeah you're
right he won't wired underwater and no
communication protocols are going to
work oh yeah okay and then the next
stream i have up and running is i'm
going to be with ben evans it's 12 p.m.
pacific time on sunday or saturday
Saturday when I land in London and then
after that i'm beating russell windsor
stephen colbert and all a bunch of other
folks in in europe so come come join the
tour and my promise over the course the
tour the video equipment will get better
and better I'll know all the quirks well
seems like the video equipment is fine
it's the networking networking with in
need of some deals it crashed twice here
as well so that's true okay so next a
lot James all right thanks
