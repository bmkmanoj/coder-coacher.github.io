to be doing interviews all Wednesday
through Friday here in Malmo Sweden and
i'm joined by christine Weidman how are
you doing I'm very well thank you how
are you good good well no actually I'm
doing horrible because I'm jet-lagged
and I'm worn out from the Java one
conference last week and in general I'm
you know in a really horrible mood so
but thanks for asking I play some
pinball yes before we started chatting
so I'm in a very good moon right now
yeah yeah that's a good idea maybe if I
play some pinball and beat the ball you
should try it arounds like slap the ball
a few times that'll make me feel better
emotionally yes you're trying to see how
it works out for you so you're talking
about testing at the conference here at
ord of what sort of what sort of things
are you giving in your presentation or
did you give in your presentation well
so I am a software tester and that's
what I'm passionate about this testing
software and what I'm trying to push at
this conference is really the
collaborative aspect that's testers and
all the gatekeepers of quality quality
is a team effort the team else quality
and to build quality products testers
and developers and everyone else on the
team need to actually work together and
not throw things over the wall both
point fingers or blame each other so do
you have any advice for software
developers who are working in teams on
on how they should be working together
with the QA the Quality Assurance
testers well I'm not a big fan or
Quality Assurance either the term or the
concept okay is that is that like a
sense call the assistance I as a tester
can't assure quality because quality
means you have to fix the defects I
might find yeah and I can't influence
that I can only find ways in which the
software might fail and then I need help
from developers and decision-makers to
actually fix it so my advice for
developers would be text to just start
talking to the testers see how they can
help because testers are there to
provide a service
to everyone that's a stakeholder and
that includes developers so what can
your testers do for you so most of the
projects you work in are they using some
sort of software methodology or what's
usually your interface point with the
with the team's the pants on if you ask
them or if you ask me I would say they
all use a methodology is it a perfect
example out of a book no absolutely
notes but I also don't think it should
be you should find a methodology that's
going to support the goals of your
organization and then adapt it yeah and
to some extent that's what people do and
sometimes it's more maybe not in their
best interest how the deviating and
sometimes it works really well and i
would say iterative development is
definitely dominating but there are
still fairly traditional waterfall
projects out there too okay but that
doesn't really interact the way you
interface with the team so regardless
what they're doing waterfall there
they're doing some sort of agile
methodology you can be pretty much
applied the same testing principles on
how you kind of work and guide the teams
but I think it's really important in
terms of testing is early testing
whether you're agile or following the
waterfall methodology you can test and
you should test the requirements you
should test the design you should have a
lot of testing before you even start
implementing code yeah and I think
that's where a lot of organizations and
projects fall down again regardless of
methodology it's very easy to say
testing for last anyway whether it's the
last day of your sprint or last month of
your waterfall project okay so it's a
typical failure scenarios folks waiting
too long to start their testing and then
uncovering um issues uncovering issues
when it's too late to fix them and also
if you don't evolve testing early you
don't even know if your requirements for
example are testable you don't you can't
affect the delivery schedules you get
functionality delivered in the order
that you can actually
so it's important for testing to be part
of the software development from day one
on a project so do you ever do
exploratory testing with teams
absolutely so what would you when would
you do that in the in the software
lifecycle would you do it right from the
beginning or would you wait until there
was enough of a user interface that you
could actually I would do it all the
time exploratory testing means that you
don't have detailed steps to find in
advance it doesn't mean you don't have a
structure or a plan what you do or that
you don't document and I think there's a
lot of misconceptions around what
exploratory testing is and there's a
time and place for detailed scripts and
most of the time your test approach is
gonna be a hybrid of both there are some
things you might scraped out in detail
because you need that level of
information to run the tests but
exploratory testing allows you to find
more critical bugs faster and it's more
fun it's more creative yeah yeah
definitely um okay so what about
automated testing with teams um how much
how much should the QA person be
involved with creation of of automated
tests or scenarios which the you
automated tests are based upon so in
general I feel like we often talk about
manual versus automated testing manual
scripted vs exploratory testing yeah and
I don't like that very much I think
about testing as a holistic concept and
testing involves automation manual
testing exploratory testing and how much
you should automate depends on the
project and it depends on the team what
skill sets do you have are the tests are
going to be rerun there are very mundane
they're very boring for human to do yeah
and that's where automation fits but
there is also an investment in time and
effort so if you're not going to rerun
your tests may be soft worthwhile
automate
them often we talk about automation we
also think about automated scripts that
are really test that we execute but
automation can do so much more on a
project you can use automation to
generate test data you can write simple
small scripts that do fairly trivial
tasks so I just want to make sure that
when we talk about automation we're not
just talking about automating a test
script do you ever use I've heard folks
using software suites which will create
kind of randomized test data to to chaka
system are those effective in your
experience using those two to cover
different failure scenarios and software
by doing data-driven testing it depends
it can be very easy to find failures by
manipulating the input data no most
systems are not very robust developers
don't catch all the error cases but if
it's worthwhile to do that type of
testing or not depends on if it's really
a high risk if you look at just one part
of the system and you manipulate the
input data you might be able to generate
a lot of failures but it's an
integration that the data is coming from
a different system next to the state a
validation then if I go in and I
manipulate system B but the data would
come from system a I'm not really adding
any value by realistic you might be
testing scenarios which aren't possible
given the other systems involved in them
might be impossible or very very
unlikely and there might also be very
low risk even if the impact is high the
likelihood might be so low that I'm not
using my time wisely by running them the
problem is they're fun though and
they're kind of easy to run so it's easy
to end up sometimes wasting a little bit
of time there hahaha but having tools
that help you randomize or generate data
it's definitely valuable okay and when
we were chatting earlier you mentioned
that you do a lot of like testing of
integrations between different existing
software products so any any advice like
if you were
starting on a project which had a bunch
of large components you're integrating
any advice on the best place to get
started testing it or an approach well
obviously the integration pouring so it
sounds trivial but you really need to
understand the architecture of the
system and where the integration points
are and how data is flowing and what
systems and what users are consuming and
producing the data in the system what is
really the data flow and you have to ask
different people because you are going
to get different answers depending on if
you ask a business analyst a developer
for a system architect or a database
analyst and you need to get the input
from everyone and I like to always
create my own diagrams and flows because
easier to have that conversation if you
have something visual to show someone
and often if you take the the proper
architectural diagram it's too
complicated for for everyone to really
look and find and yeah so maybe you have
a simplified version which just
highlights the integration points that
you really want to focus on testing that
you can take to all the different roles
and get their feedback to understand
what do I need to test yeah and just
asking people what are they afraid of if
we launch this product tomorrow what
will keep you up tonight yeah and those
are usually questions people only think
about right when they're deploying
exactly but it's still there at the back
of your mind all throughout the project
but if you let it bubble up to the
surface it gives you more ideas for how
to structure your testing cool um so to
kind of close out is there any maybe a
few points of advice you can give
developers on the best way to get
started with working better with the
testers in their group so i really like
hair testing and there are different
ways of doing pair testing but pairing
app developers and testers it's a great
way to first of all get better
understanding of each other's different
roles
and that way the testers get a bit of an
understanding of how the code is
structured and the developer is getting
a better understanding of testing and
doing pair testing also allows you are
really short feedback loop as a tester I
can ask very pointed questions about
your code and you can walk me through
the code and i'll ask so what happens if
you do this or if the user enters this
data yeah and you can just fix any
problems to find on the fly so it opens
up for collaboration and communication
and it's fun and it again it's fast and
efficient yeah and it sounds like
something fairly easy to get started
with no matter what sort of software
methodology or using no matter what the
methodologies or the technology you can
always do pair testing and it can be
seen as a waste of time since you're
taking up to people's time to do one
task but attempts actually save you a
lot of time just because the feedback is
so much faster so that would be my
suggestion to start is to do pair
testing and to ask the develop the
testers as a developer how can you help
me yeah what's the service I can get
from you just we're not a pulse opposing
roles we're working together we have the
same goal or taste we should have so how
can we work better together to achieve
that goal and just to ask that very
frank questions what can I get from you
how can you add value to me cool that
makes sense so thank you very much
Christine for the short interview here
at the or dev conference so I have a
well a gift of sorts so you you get the
exclusive night hacking sticker goes
very nice on on laptops go on my laptop
so everyone it goes to my session
tomorrow we'll see it for sure thank you
so much and that's for the UM going
through the UM the pain of being
embarrassed on a live interview program
I'm actually really good at the
embarrassing myself in all different
context so that's that's yeah that's one
of the traits of speakers so you're
doing
you're doing excellent picked an
excellent conference to embarrass
yourself half so that I'm doing
excellent doesn't mean that it really
embarrassed myself just more what are
you trying to tell me well take it as a
compliment okay I'll go with that one
all right thanks very much thank you
let's make good luck with your session
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
