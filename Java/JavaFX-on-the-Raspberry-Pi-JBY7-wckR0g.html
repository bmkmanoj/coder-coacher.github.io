is to produce a quick screencast which
will show how we're actually running
JavaFX on the Raspberry Pi so the first
thing I do is if I just bring up my
external web camera here we can see is
we've got our Raspberry Pi configured up
and running and you'll see that we're
not using the HDMI output not got a
keyboard or a mouse connected so that
true we've just got power and network
connection so we're doing everything
remotely over a network connection okay
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
log in to the Raspberry Pi using SSH and
work yes and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to start the VNC server so
I can project the desktop from the
Raspberry Pi back to my Mac so if I
connect it now
I should see is the desktop from the
Raspberry Pi okay it's all good
so now I'm running the desktop I'm going
to do is a start up a terminal here I'm
going to go into my xcode directory that
i'm going to go to the distribution
directory of simple application that
i've created and then in order to run
this i'll just create the little scripts
that i type this in every time what we
can see here is we just set in the class
path so that we're picking up the
necessary runtime libraries these are on
specific libraries that we've created
internally and i recall not generally
available yet the early days so there's
a lot of work needs to be done on this
need to specify the the platform flow at
the glass window toolkit so because
we're using x x xi so we specified the
x11 platform that'll pick up the right
libraries for that and then we have the
the jar for the actual application
itself so if i run that what's going to
happen is it will take a few moments
just
up we can see down here that the the CPU
is running quite happily and get up in
Dover gradually appears there we go and
we have an application now this
application is designed to be like a
clock so it should update once a second
and it takes a few seconds for it to
settle down but it's it's not bad once
it gets going obviously as I said the
CPU utilization is quite heavy here and
gradually that will drop off once things
settle down and then the application
will run quite happily from there so we
see that that's beginning to settle down
there so that's really it that's just a
very quick screencast just to show you
JavaFX running on the Raspberry Pi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
