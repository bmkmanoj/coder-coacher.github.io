2011 and we're talking to members of the
java community you during user group

do different things with it I'm use it
on top of existing platform technologies
like a nap its platform or combine it
with existing other languages on the vm
so do a scholar FX api stuff so in the
cooperation with steven chen and do a
language mesh up with different
languages running in one vm at the same
time so yeah different technologies a
lot of fun pretty cool so tell me the
mood of the java community this year
well the community people i met so far
in the community its meeting unless
yesterday i think they're they're
they're they're very motivated and they
they are seeing a bright future things
are moving again javis moving again and
other things happening on the vm level
on the language level on the library
level so yeah so i think that's a good
thing and yeah let's take it forward

Wow okay I catch it in the accent so
Stephen tell me what you're doing here
this year I'm giving multiple sessions
the first couple are going to be on
watch all of them are going to be on
javafx but the first ones tomorrow an
html5 and Java so Kevin Nelson and I are
going to be talking about intermingling
the two technologies then a rude and I
are going to teach people how to get rid
of angle brackets excellent do you like
angle brackets puter no no most of the
time that he I can live it yeah so what
will teach you how to rid all your code
of angle brackets I make your life
better yet okay great and Peter what are
you doing here this week i'll be talking
only java effects I would have loved to
talk to talk about scholar but Java
effects it's enough so I have what a
session tomorrow and progressive Java
effects great yeah i hear java effects
on scholar are going to be working
together right so that's a good thing I
heard there's somebody has an open
source project about that ah interesting
like cookies and milk maybe I go
together like doing it java java effects
with scala api's and there might be an
announcement about that on Wow okay Wow
so keep in tuned we'll see what the
announcements are so tell me the mood
about with the java community this year
what are you since i think that people
have gone used to they've gotten used to
the new ownership the java community is
a lot more positive we have much the
java community leaders here today and
wearing some good discussions about the
moving java forward so i think it's a
big shift from last year okay good I'm
glad to hear that Peter what's your take
I think that the community is taken to
oracle very well and it they really are
there's a lot of interest since we have
a Java 7 release and lots of people are
going to be using Java again and I'm
really happy about that yeah well I am
too so thanks a lot guys I appreciate
you coming by and have a great travel
one thank you right now I'm talking to
Giuliana viana Giuliana tell me where
you're from I'm from Brazil okay so tell
me your role in using Java well I'm a
consultant and I work with java ee solar
and other technology but mainly with
java ee in brazil helping customers to
deliver enter
applications okay so tell me what you
like about Java EE what are some of the
features that are good for you to use
well java ee enables us to develop
applications faster and that's pretty
much what the customer needs they want
applications to be reliable and they
wanted them developer develop develop
professor and java 6 is the
specification that allows us to do that
in a standard way okay cool so you
remember the java community tell me a
little bit about the mood in the
community and how this show is looking
to you so far well the show is looking
pretty good the java community right now
is pretty excited with the release of
java 7 and the future release of java ee
7 so there's a lot of discussion going
on about how java ee 7 is going to look
and what the community wants to see in
java ee 7 and it's pretty good i mean
the development of java ee 7 is going to
be driven by the community and this is
something that you don't see in a lot of
other technologies right so the open
source nature of the technology allows a
lot of people to get in there and make
suggestions about what they want to see
exactly tell me the one thing you really
want to see in the next release well I
always wanted to see a better isolation
between applications different
applications running on the same java ee
container some of what i want to see is
actually not possible right now because
of the JVM the underlying JVM technology
but once we have Java 8 it's going to be
possible to have different applications
running on the same virtual machine on
the same EE container and still be
completely isolated from each other this
will be brilliant from from from an
administration point of view right that
sounds pretty exciting it sounds like
java's moving again right yes it's it's
really moving forward great well thank
you very much Giuliano thank you for you
coming by and have a great show and I've
got Jim Bethancourt with me today hi Jim
howdy how are you pretty good howdy so
where are you from I'm from euston Texas
excellent and tell me what your role is
in the java community i am the president
of the use and java users group
excellent so tell me the size of your
group and what's going on well we have
I think a thousand members on one of our
mailing list that's the businessman
elasaur a lot of the business
requisitions go out and at least 600 on
the the users mailing list and so we
have about 50 or so that have been
coming lately comedians it's been
growing slowly from 30 roughly about two
years ago to about 15 out lately so I'm
very excited to see the growth there
excellent so tell me you were in a
little bit of the user group sunday tell
me what you guys talked about we talked
about how to grow jug different ways
that people meet different schedules
that that jugs meet on different
different topics that people talk about
how to how to start a leader how to
start a jug what are the benefits of
going to a jug that about sums it up I
think yeah that's a lot to cover right
there in one afternoon so tell me some
of the technologies you're talking about
at your jug and what's going on with the
the Java piece of it oh let's see um
this year we had talked on the Google
web toolkit we had a talk last month we
had actually had to talk so we had one
on subversion and the version control
how to manage a good release management
and the second talk was just on a recap
of what one of the remembers is doing
with with with Java and how it relates
to offshore documentation used on oil
rigs actually which like out in the sea
out on the ocean so like oil oil war
platforms that and so he wrote a
browser-based documentation system that
is actually used as instruction manuals
for rig operators Wow and we do want the
rig operators to have a good
documentation right and it's actually
highly interactive so it's very
instructive yeah yeah so cool very very
impressive okay so how about you
personally how do you use Java what do
you do I am a developer at triple point
technology we make commodity management
and energy trade management software and
I have specifically I'm only delivery
services team for the credit risk
management product and so ifs and I
provide a lot of the icing on the cake
basically for the product which is which
is kind of fun and then I'm also
have two hats i am also a confluence
developer if you've heard of the glycine
confluence i write plugins for that as
well internally so a very exciting stuff
wow you sound like a busy guy so tell me
overall what how do you sense the mood
of the java community right now I
certainly see it growing again you know
with with the increase of membership
attendance I'm very excited to see that
continue to see business requisitions
come across the the business list which
is I'm very excited to see very pleased
to see and I can't get enough sponsors
there all by beating down my door and
actually we have about through May of
next year starting from january through
may already have meetings lined up so
i'm very very excited about that wow
that's excellent so if I'm a Java
developer in Houston I have a place to
go I can learn new technologies made
other Java developers right yes wwewhc
org again HW h ju g 0 RG excellent and
if you can't find that you can certainly
go to java.net and see a full listing of
jugs and jim i just want to say thanks a
lot for talking to us and have a great
show it's been a pleasure thank you I've
got fabiani nard on who's here with us
today hi where are you from I'm from
Brazil excellent so tell me what you're
doing here at javaone well this is my
things like java anything so I'm here to
see everybody again learn what is new in
Java fueled excitement about the depart
form so I'm very happy to be here again
excellent so you just spoke so tell me
what your presentation was about I was
presenting a case about the new version
of the largest local guide we have in
Brazil like for fighting restaurants
movies and everything if you go to the
Brazilian world cup is probably going to
use our too it's a new platform that to
just move it from a node dotnet version
to a whole java based platform that is
now serving lots of more user
connections requests and it's a lot
faster than it was before very stable so
we are very happy if they
the new version excellent so you use
glassfish to do that yeah it was did the
performance based on glassfish which was
great because we are serving now
thousands of simultaneous connections
it's zero downtime so far so we are very
happy of the diversion excellent so I
know you get your fingers in a lot of
pies so tell me some of the other things
you're working on I'm also working on
launching tools cloud us a tus clouds
company that started in Brazil providing
software development in the cloud like a
whole stack of continuous deployment
issue tracker get subversion everything
open source so we are launching our
environment here USA in the next move so
it's going to be exciting as well
excellent that sounds like the right
tool at the right time right excited
continuous deployment is something that
everybody needs right now and we have a
good solution good stack everything is
open source or no locking and I think
it's going to be it's going to make a
difference for several startups that are
starting now and don't have money to
invest in lots of tools so this is going
to be interesting excellent so tell me
what you sense is the mood of the java
community so far well i think it's a lot
better this year last year people are
kind of worried about it the whole
oracle take over and everything and I
think now that the time passes then
people feel that Java is evolving there
are new things coming up good things and
I think the mood these years a lot
better than used to be and I hope you
are going to have a great conference
with Java one excellent thank you thank
you very on e and it's good talking to
you have a great week thank you thank
you thanks a lot all right thank you
very much this is Tori wheel with the
Oracle technology Network
