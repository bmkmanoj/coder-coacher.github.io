technology Network we're here at devoxx
live speaking to members of the java
community I have Richard bear who is
chief architect for the Java client hey
Richard hey Tori thanks for coming by so
tell me you just did a keynote what did
you talk about there oh basically we
talked about a few things the first one
was Internet of Things which is a big
topic hot hot hot very much so and we've
also talked a lot about javafx and the
stuff that's going into Java 8 lambdas
and the program programming experience
here ok so tell me what you see in terms
of Java and its relation to the Internet
of it ok so you know I've been doing a
lot of research in the last few weeks on
the current state of the IOT marketplace
and you know Java is really well
positioned in that market for one it's
highly fragmented right now most people
who are writing code that runs on
embedded devices they're writing it in C
or C++ right and you know the chipsets
that they're running on are all kind of
unique and different the operating
system that's running on those is all
unique and different so there's a lot of
fragmentation in the marketplace and it
makes it difficult for people to deliver
their solutions on to those just like
the mobile phone space right yeah the
same issue right yeah it's it's you know
in my mind the IOT marketplace is
basically in the same position that the
mobile phone was at before Apple came
and introduced the iphone and completely
revolutionized the way that things were
done and frankly I think that we're at
that point where the right solution in
play would do the same thing for the
ifsc market space and I think Java is in
a good position to do that one of the
things like you know at this past oracle
openworld in Java one conference Oracle
made some announcements around
working with freescale and other
partners summon specific verticals like
health care and so forth and freescale
makes the chipsets that are used in a
bunch of these Internet of Things
applications they have they have a huge
portfolio of chipsets and we're working
really closely with freescale in order
to deliver software java software they
can run on their different chips so tell
me what's happening we I've heard some
talk about Java ME and Sen what are they
diverging coming together what's the
plan yeah they're definitely converging
you know in the past if you wanted to
write Java ME applications versus say a
desktop application was swinging it was
completely different the worlds were
completely different and to some degree
that there have to be differences
because when you are running in 192 k of
RAM you just can't class load everything
that you would do on desktop right so
there do have to be differences java
card is another one that sometimes we
don't mention but java card allows you
to actually run java on devices that are
extremely small we're talking you know
sort of the 42 16k of RAM sort of sort
of a device which is impossibly small in
fact for Java card to work they have to
subset the Java language there's no
floats there's no doubles you know
there's no threads there's no volatile
there's a bunch of things that they had
to cut out in order to make it work but
when you consider that your option is
that or some completely native thing
it's kind of nice to be able to continue
to use Java all the way so one of our
goals is to make sure that Java ME and
java SE there's a very smooth path for a
job developer and if you're a desktop
developer you should be able to step
into the embedded space or into the IOT
space without having to do a whole bunch
of relearning you should be able to
reuse the language features that you lot
or reuse the language features reuse the
libraries and of course you're going to
have some subset of the programming
language available to you as you go down
but you'll have good tooling for that as
well so tools are able to look at ask
Java Sea basically you know what in this
file will compile and run on Emmy and
what won't and so then the tools can
give you all this or feedback that you
need to
what you're doing so i think you know
that's one of the one of the things that
we have to do in order to make java work
well in that space is to have it be a
nice smooth migration path but that's
right take your existing skills and
leverage them in this new exciting space
so i know you're an expert at java
effects so how do you see is there room
for FX in the iot space yeah absolutely
i'm we showed at the keynote here at
devoxx and also at javaone javafx
running on a Raspberry Pi tablet thing
that we made it we call the Duke pad and
really it was an opportunity for us to
explore that concept of you know how
well does the java client scale down
onto these embedded devices because
we're talking about something that's 10
times slower than say a galaxy s4 way to
relatively slow cpu and yet we're able
to run reasonably well on it because it
has a good GPU and javafx was designed
to run on GPUs and so I think you know
because because Java is well positioned
to run the Internet of Things I think
java client is also well positioned to
be used as the UI for Internet of Things
great so switch gears a little bit I
heard in the keynote a lot of talk about
se8 and lambdas yeah so tell me a little
bit about lambdas is it gonna
revolutionize the Java world or what
absolutely ok tell me how you know
they're there was a time I was looking
at other programming languages because I
was like you know Java is good but what
about what about this Ruby what about
this Python what about these other
things that were coming up and there
were some things that were you know
attractive in those different
programming languages but when I came
right back to it I was like yeah but
honestly all I really want is just Java
and then start add some of these things
that are missing like lambdas and what
Brian gets has managed to do has been I
mean he's just done a masterful job at
fitting lambdas naturally into the java
programming language the last time that
we had a major change to the language
was with generics right as a bit of a
rocky transition right there were some
things in there that we're really really
good but using
generics really complicated the language
lambdas don't they keep the language
just as simple as it was before except
now you don't have to write as much code
excellent so when I look on some of the
the slides that they put up with using
anonymous inner classes right you look
at the anonymous inner classes in you
and knowing how to do lambdas today when
you look at the anonymous inner classes
it's just I can't believe we used to do
that and I think that's the experience
that a lot of people will have once they
use lambdas they'll say I can't believe
I used to write anonymous inner classes
for everything great and one of the
things he said was the more your code
looks like your problem statement the
more likely it's going to work right
other people can read it and it makes
more sense yep yep excellent it's just
it's just fun to use and I don't know it
you filled it inside hahaha that's nice
yeah like that right well thank you very
much for coming by i really appreciate
your time and I look forward to seeing
you more on the blogosphere Yeah right
alright thanks Richard notify this is
