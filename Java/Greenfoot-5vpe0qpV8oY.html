work at the University of Kent and I
want to tell you about greenford today
greenfoot is a programming environment
that we have developed for kids to learn
programming we use it a lot in schools
and often in computing clubs or it is
also used a lot by kids on their own it
is very well suited to self-directed
learning as well we have a lot of
resources so kids can actually also at
home use it the distinguishing thing
about win for that distinguishes from
many other programming environments is
that it is very graphical and very
engaging in very immediate so kids can
program in Java but it's a framework
that makes creation of animation and
graphics very very easy so kids can
write their own computer game within the
first hour of abusing it and we find
that is really important because we want
to get kids engaged in coding in
programming in computer science at a
stage where they are still in schools
that they still have the option to
choose computer science as a career in
case they are really interested and get
into that so we want to want them to see
it very early and if you want to get 14
or 15 year olds interesting program you
you cannot just go in there and say
today we are we're doing programming
half of them at least probably more are
not really letting interested if you
just you know introduce it formally to
them so what we do first is we show them
a computer game we get them to play and
then we say well you can make it
yourself now and so on the first day
they write their own lil computer game
and it is so the the programming
environment green foot is designed to
make it first of all possible but also
it's designed with educational
guidelines in mind that it actually
teaches the principles of programming
the principles of object orientation in
a very engaging very very interactive
way and so we give that a lot in schools
because that for after school clubs we
also have a lot of material online for
self-directed learning so go and look at
it if you have kids if you involved in
the school if you want to run a
programming club or just do it at home
with your own kids or if you are I kid
and you want to do it yourself look at
green foot there are lot of examples out
there you can first see what you can do
with it and then you can get going
yourself and help program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
