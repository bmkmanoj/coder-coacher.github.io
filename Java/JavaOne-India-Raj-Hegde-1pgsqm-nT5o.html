technology Network we're here at javaone
talking to members of the java community
I've got Raj hendra with me hey Raj hi
how are you doing fine good so to tell
me what your role is in the java
community i'm a founder and the lead for
the java is a group tonight yes how is
it how are things going it's really good
it's almost it's almost three years it's
going fine excellent how long do you
guys do you meet up once a month through
how we used to have every every month
once and it's slowly maturing it up and
John what's happened today's we don't
have exactly meeting up as such so every
month we we just say that we will have a
meeting here we'll have a little bit
because we started adopt a j's are now
so we have mainly focusing on radical
Jaser than that of having meetups and
doing it so we are directly jumping into
the coding SS wow cool so tell me about
some of the jss you guys adaptive via
mainly joined to je 7 because first we
suddenly our own came then why don't you
people can join so we joined with the je
seven so we thought of doing some proof
of concept with it so we started a
project called admin travelers which is
a small game but it says a multi-user
game it a minimum of three people
maximum of six people can play it so it
mainly focusing on the web socket as
well as Jason actually we thought of
adding some more j-stars but it didn't
it's not suiting directly to us so we
thought that let's stick with two so we
worked on that later we have started
working on the money in currency API so
I was so I already the money in my own
currency a pea started I was there
the Warner kin so we used to talk about
I'll just down these things and suddenly
we said that we will start another POC
on this so we gathered the people and we
started a small small POC called it's
called track stock it is mainly to show
about the stock related shares for a
company and a lot of things and we
started trying to accommodate as much as
the Jays are focused on same thing like
the core part of it and we will focus on
the forum the format of it and it means
format of the money and currency and we
plan to add some more things like a
victorious money in currency something
like some games like when did in dollars
yes exactly okay got it and also we are
planning for directly quoted on any
mobile as such so we are planning to
have Android as well but we again
focusing on blackberry as well if it as
follows we we we are still not short but
we need to put it on jme related
anything if it is possible we are
planning that one and also javafx okay
so you're working on the actual java ee
7 code right mm-hmm you're taking a look
at it and then you bump into something
did your feedback have any impact on
what happened to actually the part of j7
when we are working it it is already
matured so not much it have been even
sometimes when I see that that can be
done when I go into the mailing list it
is already done so it's it's it's all
melted we we are entering in the time of
its already maturing as part of the
money in currency as such yes when I was
just looking into the APA i found one or
two things so that a direct
I used to talk with Warner or directly I
will talk with the EG members suddenly
they said directly you go and post it in
the JIRA so directly we were posted in
the JIRA they said that yes this is
right so there will be a change into it
Wow and also I was part of the Java
social media assets social media it was
rejected in dough rise now it has been
separately ran outside as garrafa which
is I was also helping them into it so we
are trying to put trying to put a Goro
IPA for into our project so we are just
seeing it how it works but suddenly we
found it that a gorilla is not directly
working with that is one social stock
market we are using that gone into it
and suddenly there the APA of what is
not directly supporting it so suddenly
the we spoke with the people they said
that you just wait for and things are
changing too quickly they will plan to
change it and they are planning to give
it so it directly help to know all the
projects which we are trying to
contribute to it right right so this is
a great opportunity for a developer to
build the resume a little bit right I I
verified that this code was good i was a
part of a JSR being built we are also we
are also encouraging the people to
create a separate dr. J's are part of
Java user groups na so that we can
project people that these people have
worked on these areas of time so we are
just walking on we are not yet ready for
it so that will be a one separate site
for it so that every people can tomorrow
these people can go and show that see
this is what I have done in this one so
we are just to encourage the people more
than just there as a namesake construct
you're just being a namesake we can
project them now that would be like a
star right yes super steer
java super I like it that's very cool so
have you done sessions here yeah I have
two sessions mainly one is with the
mainly based on the ACP witches we are
talking about JCP next and another thing
and I have my own session one Java and
Java money and currency ah ok because
you've got a bit of expertise there yes
cool so if I want if i'm in chennai or
somewhere close to it and i want to get
involved where do I go wow do I find out
you can't daddy yeah you can directly go
to Jack Janet I n so that is the main
site there you will have all the links
