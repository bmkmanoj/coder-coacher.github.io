of all think thank you for attending
right there's a lot of options everyone
has here Java one during this time slot
and you're here with us so awesome so my
name is John Klingon and I'll be
moderating kind of this panel discussion
asking just a few kind of warm-up
questions to make sure everyone's on a
baseline a bit and then we'll be opening
up the questions for everyone out in the
audience
Hey so first of all again I mentioned
giant clean I'm with Red Hat and kind of
been with the micro profile effort from
day one then we have David Blevins raise
your hand as we go along with Tommy
tribe and David Dell Abbasi Oracle and
Kevin Sutter IBM alright and Mark little
red hat and Mike Croft payara all right
so these are the panelists and let's go
ahead and get started with a few kind of
again seed questions and this is just
raise your hand if you want to answer
this particular question yeah what is
micro profile not in like depth or
anything but why was the project created
kind of in the first place and actually
maybe even I'll take a step back raise
your hand if you've heard of micro
profile excellent good excellent yes
awesome
anyone want to kind of just do a quick
debrief in terms of you know the
foundation of the project and why we
started the project and and so on sir I
guess I got volunteered okay that is one
one thing I John and I were were project
leads for the Eclipse project that
doesn't mean that we have any more power
than anybody else but we you know we try
to organize some of the activity so
Michael profile has been around what
about 16 18 months started with just an
idea with some of the industry leaders
on this panel and others in the audience
trying to figure out okay how are we
going to fill in this gap with Java EE
and creating micro services in the cloud
I
we you know Mike Java II was not moving
fast enough it wasn't filling in those
gaps what can we do and that's where the
idea of micro profile came up we first
presented it
what 2016 and now you know 2017 at this
point we we've had our third release and
I don't know if that's another one of
your seed questions I won't go into a
lot of detail there but we are
generating some momentum it's been a
very good conference today ordered this
week and we're you know looking forward
to the interaction with the group here
anybody else want to add anything to the
history sorry I forgot to put on my
microphone profile hoodie just so Evan
can consent it maybe the marketing
people told me I had to do this okay
just kidding
all right so let's say we had an
announcement this JavaOne so does
somebody maybe want to talk about what
did we introduce this JavaOne in terms
of micah profile i have one particular
suspect that we can i take a little
speck I think because otherwise there's
too many but we introduced about five
different new additions to the micro
profile spec so it was it this is
actually kind of should have been maybe
a tool because of the amount of stuff
that was added so the previous one one
was was our baseline plus config and the
1.2 added about five new or four new
specifications my favorite amongst them
is the JSON web token specification or
the juvett they're called jots but
that's not actually possible to
pronunciate a W as an O but I guess
maybe that's a new language thing and
I'm not aware of but anyway so that
specification is great because one of
the things that we haven't done
particularly well kind of an as an
enterprise community in Java is security
typically we have defined security as
API calls inside the JVM and that
completely
NORs interoperability between servers in
a portable way and with JSON web tokens
you can actually get that portability
and so matters less what the API calls
are and matters a whole lot more
how can micro services and a distributed
architecture communicate in a stateless
way security across all those things and
so we have a pretty great specification
for consuming JSON web tokens inside a
micro service that's deployed in the
micro profile that allows you to have
claims injected via at claim inside the
the beans and you can even say you know
give me the current caller as a claim
you can get the whole JSON web token
injected in and inspect various things
you can use at rolls loud and have
permissions enforced and all this stuff
is completely brand-new and I think it's
pretty much gonna live for a very long
time I don't really see anything
dethroning JSON web tokens anytime soon
so this would be great so this is a
architecture level compatibility that's
been added that's a new thing because
the last time there was an architectural
compatibility for security it was called
Corvo with CSI v2 and I don't think we
want to be doing that anytime little
thing little anecdotal last year at this
time at JavaOne
we talked about okay what are the new
features we want to put in and this JWT
thing this was going to be okay we got
to do this and we got to do it quick
this will be real simple I don't know
who said that and you know it took a
collaborative effort I mean we got you
know I know Red Hat team was driving it
but we got input from a lot of different
teams and you know what we finally
produced is very good yeah I think the
interesting thing is the way that
developed so Scott's dark seeded
basically all the base all the you know
foundation and then myself and John
Ament came around and said you know you
can put dependency injection on that
it'll be
pretty cool and then took on like a
whole nother level and the spec went you
know a couple iterations after that we
had people getting involved off of
Twitter so Hendrik eber's you know he he
followed a tweet where I said hey what
do you think about having in dependency
injection for claims and JSON web token
and suddenly he's on the mailing list
and he submits a PR that day which is
pretty cool and it got merged of course
because that's that's the way it is and
now his code is released here at JavaOne
so that's an example of how quick things
move on on on that side of the fence so
it's pretty neat I won't go to as much
detail as David's just done sorry all
right
time wise one of the other things that
you know we've added to this release is
fault tolerance so starting to
standardize things like circuit breakers
etc that people have been using and in
other technologies okay I'll also
mention one other unique thing we talked
about with micah profile 1.1 that it was
kind of a minor release and and we had
config 1.0 and config by itself is a
very positive addition the thing i want
to point out with Mike profile 1.2 is
that we had an update to that spec
already so it was only a couple of
months later and one of our developers
John Hammett he noticed you know a
couple of things that we're missing from
config 1.0 and so he took ownership of
that spec and drove it in as config 1.1
so there again it shows that not any one
person or any one company owns any
particular aspect of Micra profile we
are sharing it among all of us and pick
the ball up and moved it up a couple
feet it was pretty great I was just
gonna mention that you know John Hammond
isn't you know one of the you know
employed by any of the big Java EE
vendors right he's kind of just one of
the folks that kind of out in the crowd
that decided that he was gonna go off
and build kind of his own implementation
right so it's it's really cool he was
here at JavaOne last year and I think he
kind of fired up yeah this year he
wasn't able to make it but he sent
another person from his team he's kind
of generous like that and you know I
think it's great that we have people
like John in the community and I think
it's like a a sign of success that we
can't miss that within the first year of
micro profile there weren't just us as
implementations but people inspired to
spend their spare time to build
something and I know that may sound
small to spend your spare time to build
something but Tommy was once a spare
time and effort for me so you know who
knows what he's got to build in in in a
couple years I think that that's awesome
that we're enabling that kind of thing
and that he's really in there driving
the community all right hey Mikey
can you think of any other new specs yes
I helped out with was metrics so one of
the things that I wanted to point out
with out was that it's fairly simple
spec from my background is not a
developer but a guy asked you know deal
with the operations side of things I
think Jay MX is fantastic it's not in a
amazingly easy to consume form a lot of
people so that metric spec will expose a
couple of different rest endpoints which
are all standard across every
implementation so you can predict
without knowing ahead of time how this
other vendor has has configured things
exactly what metrics you can get from
what end point which is pretty great but
yeah just to echo the comments we've had
before the the biggest thing that struck
me about it was that I saw that metrics
had already kind of started going and
took a look at it you know from my non
developer background and thought you
know what
I've got opinions and so I just kind of
dived in and said hello I'm gonna be
here now and I was pretty welcomed by
you know people from Red Hat and IBM and
it was a lot of fun
you know talking about my own experience
from working with different customers
who've had different requirements and
you know obviously you feel really
really listened to I found that the
community itself and the people working
on it have been really really accepting
of someone who's not quite so technical
as the rest it's been good I wouldn't
describe this not technical you might be
selling yourself short on that one yeah
that's my get out of jail free card no
that's that's my claim you can't take my
claim yeah do we get one last one yeah
health check so that that was a final
piece we had five new additions to Mike
profile 1.2 so health check is just a
very simple you know are you alive type
of check but it's you know okay I almost
said standardized it but but it is you
know Specht out so that anyone who is
implementing this it would be consistent
across all of their implementations I
guess I want to point out one little
aspect that might be missed
health check enables people who are not
micro profile implementations to
interoperate with us so we're route
we're reaching out and touching cloud
environments and saying here's how you
standardly get something from a micro
profile implementation the JWT is the
same we're not the one producing the JWT
it's gonna be API gateways and things
like that
key cloak and and various things and so
that's another example where we're
integrating with standard cloud you know
tech and it's it's always health I mean
you know we aren't the one aggregating
the health data so we're really directly
and deliberately integrating with
various aspects of cloud which is
something that can't be missed we're not
just creating in our space we're
connecting to outside our space right so
I'm gonna switch gears here a little bit
and now talk about Java EE and this is
opportunity perhaps for for David to
talk to us about what's new in Java you
know EE 8 and then we can kind of bring
it all together a little bit yeah so
first I just want to show you this this
is the Oracle several statements so as
you know we have released a Java eight
21st of September so a few days ago one
of the things that we did in Java yet is
basically the alignment which are ic8 so
wherever we can we have a
the API to leverage the new stuff that
we had in a CLI like some basic stuff
GPA now support date and time API GSN
also support date and time API now we
also did quite a few nice things
regarding for example compression stage
API I think so that concurrent thing
that gives you the ability to have a
sync task execution in Jack's arrest now
we have an reactive I think invoker that
allows you to basically compose multiple
services invocation in a very specific
fashion and all of that in an icing
fashion CDI - so CDI - as now the
support for a synchronous event and
guess what a synchronous events of CDI -
also support the completion stage api of
java SE 8 so basically whenever we can
we have updated the spec to make sure
that java c 8 can be leveraged now
something which we have done which is
also quite nice is we have basically
fixed the design support that was
started - introducing July 7 so you know
in Java 7 we had we have this JSONP 1.0
api which was which is quite nice but it
was not complete
now with that new Jason B API so we have
a complete end-to-end a binding story
for Jason so that's something which is
also very welcome
something else is select for servlet for
not a lot I mean from the outside not a
lot of new stuff but on 100 the hood
servlet 4 brings HTTP to support to the
platform so that's something that I
think is very nice and something that
will will hold use over time and I mean
so that's basically some of the things
that we have done I forgot to mention so
you've talked about GWT in Java 8 will
we have also added a new security API so
basically we are trying to finally solve
simplify how you can apply security
concern in a java application so that's
the first step but I think that's a
welcome step in the direction so then to
kind of bring these bring it all
together and this is an open-ended
question to anybody
how might micro profile accelerate the
adoption of Java EE 8 because that's you
know the kind of the title of the panels
or the sessions I'm very interested
and what people's thoughts are there
I'll jump in first so I think one of the
things that you know we were pushing
very heavily when we kicked off micro
profile was that you know the perception
that app servers in general are not
conducive to building micro services is
you know it's not really accurate we've
had very lightweight app servers from a
number of vendors over the years and you
know you don't actually need to strip
down your your monolithic application
server to get a runtime that actually is
you know quite small a lot of app server
vendors produce application servers that
are let's say e 7 compliant that were
pretty nimble it really boot fast very
small memory footprint I think with ee8
we should see exactly the same thing and
I would like to believe that micro
profile one three one four whatever will
you know start to address yet support
pull in some of the you know newer
features that David's just talked about
and drive ee8 adoption maybe not
necessarily explicit you know people
hopefully will start to deploy micro
profile I say 1.4 compatible
applications and just not necessarily
need to know they're running e 8 an app
server underneath the covers I think
that's that's a really good thing for
micro profile and a really good thing
for Java EE I guess I would add that you
know it probably would be a bit of time
before we see you know obviously with
with EE 4j another major revision we'll
be doing a lot of transitioning of stuff
and as that that happens we'll be still
doing releases of micro profile they all
work on top of an EE container and so
any gaps that need to be filled between
now and when we get e4j really moving
quickly
well micro profile is there to pick up
the slack and in the meantime and so
that you know that's a great asset to to
all of us
and so I think that that that can't be
missed that you know the pace that what
we've been going and micro profile has
actually been increasing if you look at
the time between the one oh and the one
point one speck it was I want to say
nine months or something along those
lines you know yeah but there was the
migration to eclipse oh yeah I mean we
did take some time yeah well we did the
migration to eclipse just as EE for J is
gonna have to do the migration for
Eclipse and of course we're all going to
help because that's that's what open
source means but our pace picked up
pretty quickly so so between one point
one and one point to where they were
released in the same quarter which is a
really great thing you know but part of
that was because we decided I'm doing
you know a time boxed release and you
know when one point one was coming out
we determined that okay
we had these other ones already in the
works but they just weren't ready to
release yet so I said okay no we're only
gonna go with config and we had some
questions about okay but it's only
config and it's like yeah but doesn't
matter that's the way that we're going
to do it so then we had another time box
release for Java one and that's where we
had the other you know all five of the
other features ready to go clearly some
motivated people to make Java one way as
what's called conference driven
development exactly this submit a talk
to do something that you want to create
yep that date will eventually come oh
gosh oh gosh let's make it and just a
quick mention if you look at open JDK
OpenJDK is also moving to that industry
hi you know maybe it was a good idea
yeah I know I think it's a good thing
yeah one of the neat things that we
should you know begin thinking about is
since everyone kind of has these tiny
box releases and acts is actually trying
to align what we do with you know
eventually the e4j and with micro
profile along with what's happening with
Java SE right and see if we can begin
kind of lining up the features up the
stack to take advantage of the things
that are happening
in the stack I think there would be a
really neat thing for us to be able to
do with time box releases I think it'll
make us more able to do that yeah I
would say to make that point even louder
eight is Java SE eight so that's a whole
major job of revision behind obviously
there was no real other choice because
you know it was difficult to develop ee8
on top of se nine because things were
kind of in flux but with basically
six-month releases of se there's no
reason that we would be even you know
more than six months behind that I can
see us being six months behind that but
wouldn't be you know like a whole year
behind that alright let's see I'm sorry
quick time check here to do to do okay
so here's a here's another question how
may ye forge a and micro profile both
big Eclipse projects aligned in the
future so I'm gonna tee David up for
this because we we had a we had a two
hour meeting not about this particular
topic but it did come up there was a few
people expressed how they reference they
expressed how they thought micro profile
and e4j should come together if at all
and I think we all agree that David kind
of put it more succinctly now I have to
remember my exact words well I guess I
would see that ideally in my perspective
and I guess some other people think the
same and we'll see once we talk about it
in a list but I I can would like to see
micro profile come under the e4j
umbrella kind of as the innovative edge
where we can incubate and experiment
with some good ideas and then you know
have that continue to be kind of the
innovative you know engine it's being
right now but inside the e4j umbrella
and if if I get my way I would love to
someday be able to say you know a micro
profile that would sort of be fun
a new name yeah exactly so that that
would be really cool I think that would
be like you know I would be dying to
tweet that the day that if it might
someday become real so so maybe I can
make a comment even though I'm not
making any forward statement so so if we
look today we basically have two well
two things so we have Java 8 which was
just released and we have micro profiles
so you already have multiple release and
we are just starting to work on that e4j
migration so we know that well you have
you have gone through that exercise so
we know that it's not a simple exercise
to move such a project because it's a
very large project to the kids
foundation so I think that shot will
well we really have to focus on on those
two I mean II Java e8 and micro profile
and hopefully over time yet there will
be some convergence between the two but
let's not anticipate that too much and
already talking now about that
conversion I think it's a bit too early
I would also add that you know
ultimately onesie 4j is out there this
is something that we would discuss with
both communities this is not something
that Red Hat
Oracle IBM or whoever is going to decide
this is something that the communities
have to decide if the communities decide
they want to keep the status quo two
completely separate projects then that's
how we're gonna do it yeah I'll state
that I'm speaking for myself and I'm
historically very excitable so yeah take
that but but the fact that both project
are and will be under the Kids
Foundation I mean will greatly simplify
those discussion and that potential
conventions just to clarify because you
know people in the audience may not know
currently micro profile is under a
different top-level project were under
the technology project in Eclipse and
for e4j we are establishing a new
top-level project called e4j so
currently they would be in separate
projects and that's why the discussion
excuse me the discussion would have to
happen eventually you know are we going
to move them under the same project or
are we going to keep them separate so
something down the road and that's where
we love to hear feedback on anything
right new specs you know process things
how do we develop you know release
cycles going forward anything that has
to do with you know moving the you know
enterprise Java EE forward or ie 4j
forward is like really good feedback I
really want to do that oh someone forgot
to mention we also have an EE forge a
commuter the mailing list right in the
Eclipse Foundation so go to the Eclipse
Foundation and join the EEE - EEE forge
a - community alias and you know just if
you want to catch up it's not that deep
in terms because it was just set up you
can get caught up really quickly and
then just contribute now are there any
questions from folks in the audience
raise your hands and I can bring around
bring around a mic if you have any easy
questions tough questions so does Mike
report this micro profile follow the
same pattern as Java is having a one
spec in multiple implementations all of
you guys including the same jar files on
your your app servers or what have you
so no we each have our own
implementations so in micro profile we
are defining a spec a specification an
API and a TCK the implementations we do
not define a reference implementation
there may be some sample implementations
created but there's no reference
implementation each of the vendors
create their own implementation of the
specifications but but there isn't
anything to prevent multiple vendors
collaborating on the same bit of code
that then gets deployed into there you
know compliant implementation so we just
didn't mandate it we kind of good
open-source practice let the communities
decide what they want to do yeah like
for example how mark is probably going
to share the same config a API
implementation that Tommy does just
because John met and is a very big
Apache guy and so are we so we're doing
implementation over there and then we'll
compile consume it in hammock will
consume it in Tommy and so there's
nothing preventing sharing but it's not
mandated now you got a complex question
now that you've bought it yourself yeah
okay so any other questions raise your
hand I think for from the perspective of
accelerating the adoption perspective
see currently all ye like the
installation or implementation that is
out there like the actual production
application that are out there how is
there any plan to basically provide some
type of like a conversion or some type
of way of enabling your existing
application to go on the on the micro
service architecture type scenery that
can use either microphone or or the e4j
I'll make it a simple answer and I'm
sure it's probably similar for everybody
we don't plan to have a separate ee
Tommy and a separate micro profile Tommy
we're putting everything together and so
you have access to the standard EE stuff
plus you can get additional micro
profile api's they're ready to use
should you want them so you don't really
have to install anything more in order
to do that and and and of course
everybody will probably do things
differently but you know that that's how
that's how we've decided to incorporate
both EE and micro profile in the same
box because they do complement each
other they're not conflicting in any way
so so micro profile technologies are you
know in addition to a lot of the EE
stuff now micro profile mandates only a
few things but there's nothing stopping
you from putting more things in the box
and so that's the way we've we've we've
attempted to do it
I don't know if you guys want to give
your perspectives on how you enable
people to use both so you know we have a
project called wild fly swarm soon be
product called wild fly swarm which is
our micro profile compliant
implementation is based on wild fly our
app server and you know at least at the
moment it's essentially you know you
take your full EE application server and
you know you can pare it back using
various tools that ship with with swarm
to get just the bare minimum we cut I
don't think we'd kinda Sturm but we we
call it right sizing the app server but
because it's compliant with micro
profile we or has compliant
configurations for micro profile we can
guarantee that you can still you know
port your application from you know one
from our implementation to you know the
Tommy tribe implementation or even to
the IBM implementation but I did want to
ask I wondered whether your question was
more about how if you starting with an
application so a full Java EE
application server do you start down the
journey to to right-size your deployment
to only have those things in it that you
need for the business logic I don't know
if that was it yeah I think where
question one was from the existing so
the existing application that already
has the e spec like you have you have
JSP you have a JB's MD B's and all those
things how do you map those into if into
a micro profile or ej like is there any
type of recommended way or some type of
conversion or analysis tool or something
that can be used to to create that
migration path so as so if I have an
application I wanted to go more on that
path how what's the path towards that
well first of all I'd I'd say don't
necessarily have to buy into micro
services now everything has to be a
micro service if you've got and I have a
Java EE application
that is running really well for you
today why would you want to change that
so just because lots of other people are
saying you should use microservices
doesn't actually mean that you need to
use micro-services if you do decide to
go down that route currently you know in
micro profile I don't think we have any
best practices or recommendations that's
certainly something that I think you
know certainly the message in the
meeting we were talking about earlier we
we probably start to need to start
thinking about there are things that I
could say but from a RedHat point of
view bright I think I want to keep this
kind of micro profile neutral so no I
think what and I guess I would just
stress again I think the mapping concept
is maybe either you don't have to change
anything you just you know for I know
you want to stay generic but it's a hard
to answer the question so like if you
are Tommy user you just keep upgrading
and you will eventually start getting
more and more in micro profile stuff you
don't the change or map or modify your
app just there's eventually going to be
more and more things for you to use so
there's no there's no rip and replace
you know it's just keep going down the
EE path and more micro profile things
will start to show up in the same binary
and you don't have to do anything if you
don't want to or you can start using
this stuff if you'd like just one thing
to add though is that we made the
decision quite early on because that
microphone was going to be from JDK 8 so
I hope you're not still on JDK 7 but if
you are you would need to move to JDK 8
yeah that would be very very good
call-out
and one thing I'll add is you know
different vendors are approaching this
problem in different ways right we all
kind of approach the idea of even
application servers Lee's just just even
take Michael profile out of it right
it's it's we all kind of have whether
it's not you know different module
implementations or you know a single
kind of deployable runtime you know we
all kind of take different approaches
and we just I think naturally extend
that into our micro profile
implementation so all right is this the
hard one don't disappoint how do you
solve world hunger with micro profile go
so I'm assuming that since Java EE 8 is
fairly new you guys coated your specs
against Java EE 7 now there are some
Java EE specs including micro profile so
it's a CDI JSONP and and jax-rs so if I
have a Java EE eight implementation and
I want to go something against micro
profile can I use Java EE 8 features yes
okay we did we put that in as a base to
say that like we identified CDI 1.2 as
the minimum okay so if you're moving up
and using CDI 2.0 then you can go ahead
and do that but all of our
implementations and relationship among
all the features may be you know there
there's some aspects of the new features
that we want to take advantage of so we
are looking at a new update to the
release and this is where we're thinking
about updating the the numbering scheme
so for micro file 2x then we would
update our base set of features to Java
EE 8 right and then at that time we're
also talking about bringing in JSON B to
complement the JSON P we waited a long
time for Java EE a so we really want to
use the new features a good answer yeah
I mean basically the spec or if you look
at the micro profile 1.2 spec it's not
long so it
very easy to read it says in the CGI
section specifically the implementation
is required yet minimum to do you know
1.2 but if it wants to do 2.0 that's
okay it you may sacrifice some
portability be a smart user and go have
fun in the upcoming micro profile list
it's like standardization of dupage our
tour or application service doing things
all differently still not at the moment
no no at the moment we all have our own
different approaches to you know how you
create your Ruby jar yeah well I mean
maybe we might get together and try and
stand out some aspects of that at some
point but I don't think it's a critical
thing at this stage yeah I would simply
say that when we started the conference
application you know the it's kind of a
reference architecture and for those who
aren't familiar with it
basically and we we got started and we
said let's do a sample app and then we
stopped herself dead in the tracks and
say wait how can you have a
microservices architecture with one app
so so we had four micro services and
they deploy on all the servers and they
all have uber jar in it everyone's uber
jar started out with different flags you
know on how to configure the ports but
to kind of have started to become a
little bit more mmm lined up I guess
and so the conference app does show you
how to do over jar and all the
implementations that are up here so it's
not standard but it's kind of de facto
Inge you know it's becoming a little
kind of de-facto ish possible to do with
everybody I'm on a related note there
was a suggestion by John Hammond he's
quite busy yeah so he suggested having
common configuration options so maybe
you could set micro profile HTTP deport
or HTTP port and it
the same for each that was mentioned in
our in our deluxe Belgium talk yeah last
November yeah so it's it's cropped began
I think recently on their mailing list
artists or I mention of it so that there
wasn't many people kind of giving John
much feedback on that so I thought maybe
it's not so wanted but if it's something
that's appeals t then you know get
involved on the mailing list and I'm
sure you're gonna be happy to do another
check Thanks yeah you are the phone to
microphone poor file basically as kind
of as well standard let's put that way
for doing micro services all right but
so you started at the bare minimum and
now you are starting to add more and
more stuff to that affair but at some
point it's the microphone file itself
might not be exactly Michael anymore
right so is there any plan to also then
make things like option the future is
there at some point where you say okay
no we we have to stop because it's not
really Michael I know so one
clarification is that the micro profile
the micro part was meant for micro
services so it it could grow but the
other thing even though we are defining
micro profile releases each of the
features that feed into that are
independent so if a given implementation
does not want to for whatever reason
they don't want to implement the full
micro profile 1.2 or 1.3 they could pick
the individual features that they want
to implement so you know if there is you
know size concerns or resource concerns
whatever it is in order to to provide
that capability
you could subdivide the phone like a
profile release and I mean we're not
requiring any particular implementation
that has to move up to the next release
so you know you can have a micro profile
compliant one-oh implementation and
stick it one out that's what you like or
one one you don't have to move to 1/2 or
1/3 or 1/4 it's not it's not like a
software release where you don't get
support for the previous version once
the new version comes out
and one thing I would like to see I've
talked about this on the mailing list a
few times but maybe it's a little bit
too complex at this stage I actually
think some kind of tree light model for
how releases branch off each other might
be more applicable than the linear
approach we're currently doing but you
gotta start somewhere so I think it's
it's not necessarily the fact that micro
profile as we add more and more things
will require more and more components to
be in the you know the stack as you
actually implement it so I actually I
actually have a question yet to testing
so here's my tiptoes okay so it kinda
came up a couple of times now about
standards right and in the industry kind
of you know perceives the JCP is a
standards organization so maybe this is
a question it's a question for everyone
but but maybe I'll kind of start out
with David is with EE for Jay and the
Eclipse Foundation do we kind of is that
do you think consider standard or or how
you know well yeah maybe I'll just leave
it that you should people consider this
to be a standard or whatever you know
other people can can pipe in as well
it's it's not simple to answer but one
of the reason why we have moved well why
we have decided to move java development
to an open source foundation namely the
Eclipse Foundation is that we want to
solve that release issue I mean Java is
too slow to get updated so that was an
issue so we hope to solve that when he
for Jay will be there so it really
depends what you mean by the standard
but at the end of the day we would like
to have something that is widely used so
that's why we need to have some some
common agreement on what is being used I
would reach to that agreement still have
still has to be decided to be discussed
to me
I say you know the eclipse foundation
patchy foundation and others I'm not
what you might call official standards
bodies like w3c Oasis IETF and I don't
think they should be I think this is one
of the problems that the JCP can have
got into and you know David's hinted at
it you don't you shouldn't try and do
innovation within a standards
organization a standards organization is
for standardizing things that have
innovated and have been deployed and
people want to have portability or
interoperability keep them separate so
you know if Eve or J does really really
well and the community including vendors
believe there's some reason to
standardize all of it or parts of it
then you know maybe we take it to a
waste as a right ear for spin up a
completely new standards body but I
honestly think that's a secondary thing
you know these days with open source
open standards tend to be good enough
for a lot of people an open standards
not something that goes through away so
they just it's something that's just
different yeah it's just just is so
widely yeah de-facto that's the yeah and
that's one of the reasons when we you
know when micro profile was founded it
was never really considered by the
founders to be a standard per se because
the idea was innovate and then submit
you know to the JCP right which we did
with config and now with it kind of
beginning to move into into Java Eve
moving into the Eclipse Foundation one
question is what happens to the config
jsr submission we're going to continue
down the path I just just to kind of
complete the thought configuration from
a micro profile standpoint I mean our
goal from day one was to feed that back
in to Java EE now with the introduction
of EE forge a kind of threw a wrench in
into those plans but we had already
started down that path of producing a
configuration jsr for Java EE we're not
going to discontinue that we've got the
spec leads all lined up the
expert group is being formed we're going
to continue down that path because he 4j
is still a work in progress so until
that is up and running and complete you
know we we want to continue the same
process and try to complete that jsr
yeah there's no reason to stop you know
obviously we can't achieve making things
faster if we immediately stop there's
any kind of change that defeats the
point all right I think we are we out of
time is it the 12:30 the yeah okay so I
just wanted to be wary of you know the
next session and everything assume there
is one right after this so thank you
very much for coming thank all the
attendees and the panelists if you'd
like we can continue conversations
outside in the hall all right thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
