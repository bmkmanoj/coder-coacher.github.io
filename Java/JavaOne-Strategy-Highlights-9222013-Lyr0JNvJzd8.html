2013 Java remains the number one
development platform in the world and
there's a lot going on in our industry
right now there are massive shifts
massive innovation and a huge amount of
change that's happening and that change
poses challenges for Java but more
importantly it poses huge opportunity
with Java 8 we're going to get code
portability we're going to get
commonality of api's and we have common
tooling from the smallest device all the
way up through SE embedded all the way
to service artists that you were
mentioning yes and this means that
developers will be able to use their
skill set across the entire spectrum as
opposed to as today where you're
restricted to being you know Java ME or
java c developer we are announcing today
that we are open sourcing project avatar
it should be available like right now if
you go to this URL avatar java.net so
brand-new very good there is real change
happening in our industry and if we
focus and if we take java break down the
walls between the implementations you on
board and start playing with devices let
that curiosity that drives you as
developers pick up a device and start to
develop to it even if it's a Raspberry
Pi connecting to a toaster at home that
we can take your skills which are
uniquely positioned to program on the
smallest device all the way up to a
cloud there's no other language and no
other community which can make the
internet of things happen and connect
the dots it is really big and it's
happening
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
