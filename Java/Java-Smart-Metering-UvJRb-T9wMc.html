a free scale and Oracle the joint Java
smart metering demonstration involves
the following freescale hardware a
zigbee MK 30 electric meter a 13 22 X
zigbee coordinator Anna data
concentrator p 1025 reference design
board it involves two following Oracle
software java SE embedded 174 power
architecture which is installed in the
data concentrator p 1025 in javafx 22
which is used for the client application
the Java Virtual Machine is responsible
for running the Java smart metering data
concentrator application the Java smart
metering application is responsible for
getting data from the meter processing
retrieved data and storing it on a
database the Java smart metering
application has nine loosely coupled
components these components can be
managed by the data concentrator web
admin tool the nine Java smart metering
applications components communicate by
exchanging asynchronous messages the
message flow is as follows first the
scheduler sends a read event every 12
seconds to the meter adapter the meter
adapter uses the ZigBee protocol to
retrieve Rob media consumption data the
raw data is sent to the meter aggregator
component that converts raw data and
JSON structured lightweight kosem the
cause of data is sent to the data
processing component the processing
component caused a JavaScript engine to
compute the instantaneous electric
consumption by loading dynamically a
JavaScript rule file the processing
component also calls the node
information component to retrieve memory
CPU usage and transaction performance
performed on the data concentrator
during each step of processing at the
end of data processing the data
processing component
cause the data storage component
responsible for storing all the data in
the database the database can be
Berkeley database or Java DB the Java
client receives data by using rest
requests and displays them in a graph
the video shows two javafx client
application connected to the restful
service the JavaFX client is connected
to the restful server on port 80 85 the
request is forwarded by the restful
server to the data storage component to
read me to data from the data
concentrators Java embedded database now
we can see on the JavaFX application the
freescale meter the meter displays
electric consumption in watts per hour
each time the data is displayed the left
red LED blinks the freescale zigbee
electric meter provides raw data every
five seconds by selecting the second tab
on the JavaFX client we show the
consumption as a graph the red graph is
the consumption on this date the blue
graph is the instantaneous consumption
computed by the data concentrated
JavaScript engine component the data
concentrator needs a minimum of two rows
of data to compute the instantaneous
consumption now we will increase the
electric consumption by using a 1000
watt light projector the JavaFX client
blue graph shows the instantaneous
electric light consumption raised to
1000 watts the client also shows the
estimated consumption price at point one
euros per hour on the meter display we
can see and compare the consumption
value on the javafx meter to the real
meter going back to the javafx graph we
now decrease the consumption by reducing
the light power the client now shows the
estimated consumption price at point O
five euros per hour from light off on
the projector we can see on the JavaFX
blue
ref that the instantaneous consumption
is equal to zero
the framework provides a data
concentrated web admin tool after log in
the browser shows the list of the nine
installed components database JavaScript
engine meter adapter meter aggregator
data processing scheduler information
node data storage and restful server
each component can be managed of
configured through the web admin tool
for example by selecting the electric
meter adapter we can see the serial port
used by the adapter the serial rate and
the zigbee cluster ID the adapter can be
stopped and started
by selecting the schedule component we
can see all of the events configured in
the cron list the read freescale meter
data event is performed as follows begin
date end date event period every 12
seconds the event is sent to the
electric meter adapter by selecting the
JavaScript engine component we can see
all of the JavaScript files deployed on
the data concentrator the meter
instantaneous rule j/s file contains the
computation rule used by the JavaScript
engine to calculate the instantaneous
electric consumption from the meter raw
data by selecting the restful server
component we can see the used put and
manage the restful server on stock and
stop the web admin tool cloud tab shows
the list of data concentrators in
operation in the demo only one data
concentrator is running this page
displays node information as the type of
platform the number of processor or
coors the operating system the operating
system version and cpu load as threads
per minute to summarize in this video we
have seen a Java smart metering
application
running on java SE embedded 1 dot 7
installed on a free scale p 1025 data
concentrator the application leverages
the power of java SE embedded features
restful api s from the java embedded
sweet the embedded grizzly HTTP server
pot of embedded glassfish in the java
embedded sweet and java database either
as berkeley database or java DB in the
job or embedded sweet the client
application leverages JavaFX to to thank
