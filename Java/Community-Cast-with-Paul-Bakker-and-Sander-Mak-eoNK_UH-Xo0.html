Kira here interviewing some of our
famous speakers attending or dev and
it's lunch time here so there are some
people hanging out in the crowd so
welcome my next guests we have Paul and
sander who are famous speakers going the
traveling the conference circuit this
sweet this year and the last couple of
weeks thanks for joining me why don't
you maybe just introduce yourselves for
those who don't know you sure I'll start
with some questions so I'm saamne muck
I'm from the medalist and I work for
limbus technologies as a software
architect actually co-worker of Paul at
Loomis technologies and we're pretty
deep into Java 9 and modularity and all
topics surrounding deaths and then doing
the stuff conference talks on that
recently so that's that's my direction
yes sir sauna set my name is Paul miles
from the Netherlands and yeah after nine
is definitely damn a topic for her this
year and probably the next year to come
as well right so I've seen you speak at
a few different conferences we were both
at a conference earlier this week and
and now we're it or a dev maybe you can
share with us a little bit about kind of
how it came to be that you develop this
talk and what your motivation was for
developing the talk sure so in done in
past years Sondra and I have been
speaking out a lot of cultures already
mostly a lot of Jaffa conferences and
our main topic was most of the time
about modularity so we did a lot of osgi
in the past which is modularity as well
so when the ball but when developments
around Jeff and nine modularity came to
life it made sense for us to look into
it so we decided to start speaking about
it and I'll just speak about it but also
write about it to the beginning of this
year we started writing for Riley a book
called Jeff and I modularity which is
about the module system in depo becoming
a job for nine right so I think it's
important to add that first modularity
isn't just about technology and changes
in the language of jam for example it's
also something that enables luminous as
a business to be more agile to have
fraud
that are evolvable flexible etc so that
it has both both sides a business side
and a technological side and that's
really what helps us in also driving
this this conference speaking writing
about it because we truly believe it's
important business enabler for luminous
and other companies as well to have a
modular software development sec whether
that's using osgi or using the new java
nine modules that doesn't really matter
it's the principles that counts mm-hmm I
think in my role you know I often have
pizza people approaching me so community
members I work with the job of community
lead the java community process
oftentimes developers will ask me you
know how they can become more involved
how can they become a conference speaker
how can they kind of raise their
visibility in the community so I think
it's really interesting what you've done
if I I've seen you grow over the last
few years where you're speaking at more
conferences and as you know we talked
about you know your employer supporting
you in doing this so you have any tips
that you share with a be with somebody
who's obviously in a different situation
doesn't work at your company but maybe
you know how you approached it yeah
definitely so I think one of the
greatest things of the Java world is
that there are so many Java user groups
in the rules or I'll run to the world
are just small groups of people who are
really interested in getting together
and learning together and those have
very many opportunities to actually
start speaking and start developing your
your way of presenting yourself and
getting your ideas out there and hacking
together and doing things together for
example in Netherlands we have the Dutch
Java user group which has a fairly big
conference every year in an atlas and we
see lots of talent developing there as
well just local talent local people who
start speaking and um yeah just have a
platform to grow and to start and that's
how we started as well so I just get out
there then be involved in the community
in your Java user groups and grow from
there that's that's at least that what
word for us so yeah
a very important to add to that is that
don't be afraid to speak about something
even if you're not like the all-knowing
expert because we are not the
all-knowing experts eater even if you
just talk about using some kind of
technology as a user and share your
experience about it about that that's
very valuable for a lot of other people
who didn't look into that technology yet
so don't be afraid to speak about
something that you're just using and I
want to share experiences which is a
really good way to actually get into
speaking I think those are two really
good tips so work with your local
community or user group that can be
great you know training opportunities
start with a small group of people that
you're comfortable with and then you
know don't be afraid and think that you
have to be an expert in the technology
before you start speaking about it and
maybe start a smaller venue and you know
gradually expand that into larger venues
I think I find that similar with jsr
expert groups right oftentimes
developers will tell me they've been a
member for a long time they've been
using this particular technology for a
long time but they don't think they're
qualified to nominate themselves to be
on an expert group so sometimes it's
challenging to bring more people in and
get the different perspectives in the
expert group because no one feels like
they're enough of an expert or the
expert I mean the word expert is sort of
intimidating in that sense and I think
it's really helpful to underline what
Paul says we're all learning here
together and we're all growing together
even when creating specs I mean it's not
just something to live up to the
all-knowing experts if there are people
who are all-knowing I don't know but
especially if you use the technology you
have valuable insights and valuable
feedback to feed in such a process so
really get active and make your voyage
hurt so yeah yeah actually I think we
introduced a new term in the JCP for jrs
this year we added a level of
participation which is an associate
member can be a contributor on a JSR so
that takes away the expert label
so it might be a good start yeah so we
have that to go with so any what were
some of the most common things that
people get out of your session the the
session that you're doing here at hora
de we're doing the JDK 9 modularity talk
so what's some of the best feedback that
you get some of the things that people
learn that they wouldn't have otherwise
known about what's coming with job and I
price so the biggest feature that we
focus on in our talk is the jigsaw the
module system that has been a long time
in the making in in Java actually and
what we see there is that we have two
parts to our talk first we talk about
what modularity actually is and why it's
important for software development to be
modular and now already talked a little
bit about this we we think it's
important to have flexible applications
to have evolvable applications and
modularity is tool to do that and then
we dive into the extra features of the
module system that are coming in Java 9
and what you see there is that you get
new ways to actually encapsulate and
hide code inside modules so there no
accidental dependencies anymore in your
code base between different parts that
shouldn't be there and the other big
theme of the Javan imma let module
system is that you are explicit about
dependencies between modules and this
explicit dependence information is used
both at compile time and at runtime and
it really helps you to structure your
application and get a more reliable
system and I think those are two things
that people are really looking forward
to because if you look at Java nowadays
when you build large systems you have a
very large class path and all kinds of
issues with that and people are really
keen to get rid of that and then to see
an improved situation there yeah and
java nine is probably the biggest ja'far
release to do will I forget I mean just
the first job for release it actually
breaks stuff potentially which is new
and I was really important so it's more
important than previous releases in Java
to actually start looking at it's very
early start testing your own
applications start looking
potential issues and after you did at
share feedback because the mailing list
is very important if you look at the
prototypes they've been out there they
have been directly influenced by what
people have been while saying on the
mailing list so yeah let you let you let
your voice be heard there as well this
is a super important yeah I think that's
going to be key so I think we're working
with the user groups encouraging them to
go to the adoption group so there's
actually openjdk has created an adoption
group as part of the project and there
you can find links to a wiki where you
can download the latest early access
build of the ri so it's updated like
every couple of weeks has the modularity
already integrated for several months
now and then test your applications and
then there's a link down on the bottom
which is the alias for the adoption
group so provide your feedback there and
then different people who are on the
alias can pick it up and feed into
issues or think if there's things there
that maybe could be picked up and fed
into OpenJDK project itself so really
made an effort to kind of make it easier
for more developers to actually provide
their feedback and have you know a tool
available some guidance on how to do it
so making that the builds available
often and then a little bit of guidance
in terms of what's happened with that
build and then what you should do once
you actually try out your applications
and how you give that feedback so i
think it's going to be really important
to the success of the release so i think
it's key what you're doing as well so
getting the word out there in the
community so it's great to see you here
at or deb we'll just close with maybe
share with me know your impression
supportive as a first-timer as a
returning speaker what are your favorite
things about ordem so I I come to a lot
of conferences and most of those
governments are like real Jaffa
conferences the Java technical related
content etc but you're definitely bit
different because first person mixed
conference so we have a lot of lots of
different disciplines here different
technologies but also things not
directly related to technology more and
how do you actually run projects how
uu x and that makes a very interesting
mixture of topics and also a very
interesting mix of people people that
you might not otherwise be well involved
with so much at typical Jaffa
conferences that's what I really like
about it the other thing that I really
like is that they have a whole bunch of
keynotes and all those key notes are
about how much maybe social topics
related to technology but not directly
about technology and that those are
really interesting and definitely worth
watching yeah yes I was my first time at
heard of here and so far I'm really
enjoying it I mean it's a great location
the vibe of the conference is great I
really love the first keynote really
eye-opening at least for me and some
aspects and what I also really liked is
that there's there's sort of overarching
team to the whole conference and
building up from okay what are some of
the problems and when you look at where
we're just current computing power line
right this was the topic of the first
SEC he knows building up to all the way
what can we do and how can we r es
developers acts on this so that's
something you don't see very often on
the conference such a theme throughout
the conference and that's nice and yeah
of course Paul I are very happy to be
presenting our work here as well and
that's very great to have this
opportunity right yeah well it's my
first time here and I guess I would echo
what you would see you've said so I'm
still you know experiencing the
conference I really like the venue I
really like the fact that I maybe don't
know all the people here so it's a
little bit of a different experience for
me in that way and then I did enjoyed
the morning keynote as well kind of more
social technical topic I enjoyed that so
I'm looking forward to the rest of the
conference thanks for taking the time to
share with us a little bit about what
you're doing here welcome and enjoy the
rest of the conference thank you thanks
