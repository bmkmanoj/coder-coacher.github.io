i'm joined by parsi co welcome bar thank
you so much thank you having me and you
run a you're in a pretty nice conference
here in Malmo so tell me a little bit
about how the or dev conference got
started and maybe some of the new
conference features this year that
you've added sure so we've been running
over there for 11 years now and it
started out with what the company that I
work for going to conferences around the
world yeah like javelin and others and
we figured why don't we bring the
speakers tomorrow instead of flying
around the world so we started or dev it
was a much smaller conference at that
time we had around up three or four
hundred people attending in the first
year and then we've been growing Navi
it's not too shabby i shall conference
but you're a lot a lot bigger now than
that yes so we attract around 1300
people over four days yeah just uh what
the venue can take so we're so loud
although i would say that you guys
probably do one of the best jobs I've
seen in a conference is about attracting
top speaking talent to come out here and
talk I mean you see some very big name
speakers and you have keynotes every
morning and evening yes so very
impressive lineup of speakers that you
you don't find it any other conference
thank you thank you we work really hard
on that one thing that we've one thing
that we've done that is bit different
from other conferences and that we will
do more of next year is that we if
you're not invited by us if we don't
know you well I no use I can just invite
you because I know you're a good speaker
and we always deliver but if you if you
submit a call for paper there is a
there's a field where you can submit a
video yeah and if you if we don't know
you and you don't submit a video we
spend around 30 seconds googling for
your name and videos and if look if we
can find you you're basically out
because we need to know that you will
perform on stage no matter how important
the topic is so and next year we're
going to make that mandatory for all all
of the speakers meeting to go for paper
unless we know you in
we invite you and they are basically to
get you know to get a to get the best
speakers well it sounds harsh but I
think you know we started doing
something similar for java one the past
few years and the the reason why we do
that is besides guaranteeing that you
have you know speakers which can deliver
on stage it also levels the playing
field a little bit so whether you're an
experienced speaker or whether you're a
new speaker just getting started by
demonstrating your speaking ability on
video it gives you the opportunity to
compete on equal level exactly and I
think that's fair so we don't need if
you have a good topic and you're
comfortable behind the in front of the
camera you're welcome to it up you don't
have to be one of the famous speakers
that traveling the world it's enough to
be a good speaker with a good topic and
then it is important more fair and we
have a lot of people attending over and
it's only fair to them that we pick the
best speakers based on the under quality
yeah yeah that makes sense so I know
that one of the things you also try to
do is each year you try to add new
conference elements or do a special
theme or do different things to improve
the conference so what was the what were
the main things you focused on for this
year so one of the things was the
Corporal paper just to improve the
quality but another thing is to
biohacking things so we've had 64 people
with that except with advantages exactly
so they've implanted a small chip in
their arm and I was one of the one of
the 64 and it's a simple NFC tag that
you can read and write with a mobile
phone and this is a long-term commitment
from our size because you wanna we want
to build on this so next year we might
have a special room that you can all
open with an NFC tag in your hand ah so
we're going to see what happens so that
was the that was the big thing this year
so your goal is to create a conference
where it is very so we're in it for like
five years now let's
we're going to see what happens so that
was the that was the big thing this year
so your goal is to create a conference
where it is very cyborg friendly exactly
exactly that's our mission but that's
one of the big things another thing that
we another thing that we try to do is we
come up with a new theme every year and
this year it's we are social and I like
the name of the mean Emily we had a
discussion about it she wanted it was
her Eddie we are social and my ID was
always social ? but she was like you
know I think your social and I like that
statement we are social yeah the whole
theme of the year is a letter it gives a
better arm impression italy artwork in
the way its teams is very excited host
this year ben he asked a question every
morning like what is your key takeaways
and stuff like that and yes and the host
this year ben he asked a question every
morning like what is your key takeaways
and stuff like that and and you can hear
that people are very social they speak
loudly in in the in the main room in the
main hall and only like the session i
gave yesterday there are lots of good
questions and audience interaction and
people coming up to me after the talk
and talking about it so I think it's
especially you know I think Northern
Europe gets a bad reputation for being
very having very tough audiences yeah
but this this conference has been very
friendly it's good and another aspect is
that we might not seem as social as
other people but if you if you take a
look at Twitter slack and Facebook we
are social on another level there's you
know there's hundreds of tweets going
out every day concerning order so people
are extremely social and after all it's
guys like us that built the platform for
Twitter and Facebook and everything so
uh absolutely we are social in our own
way yeah exactly
so that's the big thing this year the
the bio aking and the theme yeah yeah
and we also do one thing that working on
his security so we have a dedicated
security day either order with ya know I
dropped by on tuesday in it yeah he's
saying surprise that the the room was
entirely fact yeah it was a fall yeah
for audience you don't scare data I was
very nice and I think that in a couple
of years so maybe one year people will
get more attention of security because
it's something that we need so we're
definitely going to expand that room
it's going to be bigger because we
needed to care a security yeah maybe
maybe next year I'll do a security ddos
session securing your your your boat
Network then I can oakham I've been
getting a lot of practice from my
daughter's minecraft server my
constantly gets every night they take
down our network with the DDoS a toll
that is weird although it's it's good
practice I've been learning about syn
floods and all the different types of
attacks they launched and gradually been
strengthening our own firewall lots of
fun but i would just reserve a session
for you next year oh good we now thank
you yeah cool well this has been a
really nice conference here i'm i'm
excited but so far it's been great the
parties have been awesome in the
evenings the we have it's all been come
together very know we have one more
night to celebrate and then we have
sessions on friday as well and then
we're done and it's also i think this is
the most relaxed I've ever seen you at
your own conference so yes maybe you're
just your gear you're reaching your
prime like you've got it I hope so and I
