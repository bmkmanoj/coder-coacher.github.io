the Java zone conference my name is
steven chen i work for the Oracle
technology Network and I am interviewing
Burton and we're going to chat about
micro services for mortals exactly so
what why why for mortals what did the
one of the Immortals do with
microservices was a pretty good question
but well maybe if you've been out on the
internet and reading all the blogs and
tweets about this thing called micro
services you might wonder what did I
miss and am I the only one and not doing
this stuff yet at my customer and so
basically what i wanted to do is come up
with a reality check for people who are
really thinking about going this way but
are not really sure what they are up
against got it that makes sense yeah and
probably this is from some of your
experience actually doing
implementations of micro services and
actual real live customer stuff yeah
exactly so I've been around John from
for the past 20 years now and sort of
makes me really experienced in this
field right and I've been involved in
all sorts of system development in
architecture and design stuff so it's
basically a talk from experience and
well nowadays I I feel a bit a bit a
time you know I'm the old geezer in the
project saying well I think before you
do stuff right and and so I thought it
was time for a reality check talk
instead of all the you know sounds a bit
negative with all the false prophets and
who are promoting technology over actual
architectural style right and there's
lots more to it than just yeah there's
always a trend to if there's something
that's new or trendy or something which
is like very hot in the speaking circuit
you want to give it a try on your
project and see if it's if it's going to
be the panacea yeah and micro services
have been around long enough that I
think there's enough real cases and
things you can point to so what were to
like the top three takeaways I'm your
micro services for mortals pitch yeah i
think there's there's even more than
than three but I think and most
importantly I think it's very good that
people understand what microservices
style is actually before and I think
it's it is and to deliver business
agility through the use of technology so
it's not just a technology party here
it's not it it's not about running and
talkative it kind of goes into how your
you're defining and working with the
business and the requirements and it
gives you more agility in that sense
well exactly i think the the business
model is really prevalent over the
technology part right so if you see
where it came from and you see if you
look at the poster children like netflix
and amazon then they really used it to
come up with either a very different
business model than their competitors or
they needed to really overhaul their
existing business model so for example
if you take netflix they were like a DVD
selling shop selling you physical things
and now they have overhauled themselves
into one of the biggest online
entertainment sites yeah okay that makes
sense first take away it's a it's about
the business it was yeah its business
agility through technology what's number
two and number two is then I think it's
about there are a number of good things
that you get from doing a micro surface
style architecture which are really
promoting familiar design patterns so
for example single responsibility
pattern modularity for example and a
number of other things that enable you
to and adapt to change without breaking
either your application or stuff in your
landscape and although it's now part of
this microservices movement these are
also think that you can do in more
traditional architectural styles right
so applying modular to your or single I
think just recently I saw you give some
good talks and modularity at some
conferences yeah so I used to do my
loyalty to tutorials with it with
different technology stacks and there's
also promoting and people to think about
enabling your architecture for change
and I think that's one of the key
takeaways that you should be able to
change
as rapidly as your customer or your
business model expects from you and yeah
so so there are some some some
commonalities between what a micro
services architecture strives for and
what you strive for with having just a
regular a modular architecture
absolutely okay it's a good take away
and all right one more one more okay so
um one more is a very obvious one which
is always cool to say on stage which is
there's no such thing as a free lunch or
maybe except for Java zone yeah they're
doing great on food I've done my free
lunch today yes that's pretty good okay
but in in microservices style
architecture there is no such thing as a
free lunch so whether you're moving from
an existing monolithic style application
to micro services or what are you doing
greenfield or where you're coming from
SOA or wherever you're coming from
there's a big initial investment that
you should make and so there's some
technical stuff that you need to have in
place but there's also a really big
requirement of having your solid c ICD
practice in place at doing devops if
you're not doing that don't even bother
thinking about going to microservices
way because it it might takes months or
years alone just to get your DevOps up
and running okay yeah so there's a fair
amount of technical data and probably
some projects which are more suitable
for moving to a micro services
architecture based on where they are
from an infrastructure standpoint yeah
probably so that there is some natural
attraction so for example if you've
heavily invested into DevOps in the last
couple years yeah and you're doing like
continuous deployment exactly then then
there's like a natural attraction if
you're if you already made teams
responsible for keeping stuff in your
landscape up then doing it this
microservices way might be very
attractive and there's other things too
so for example if you are with your wall
against the back with your current
outdated business model right there is a
there's a really an urge to change so
there will also be big changes required
in your
in your architecture in your enterprise
architecture and so if you need to do
rapid change and you don't know exactly
where to go yet then there's also a very
appealing style because since you're
doing modular stuff you build everything
and ready to be thrown away right so it
should be disposable building blocks so
they they're easy to adapt you can just
take him out without breaking other
stuff so it's a peon okay so that's good
said it's kind of like the the basic
ideas to give people more down-to-earth
view on what microservices are so you're
not selling them you're not trying to
get people converted but there are some
things it's really good for ya at the
same time just wholesale adopts unit
because it's the new fantasy is not also
not the way to go now exactly and it's
also one of the points that I started to
get across like it's not like a
architecture isn't like a belt system
right so so you must have been doing so
at first and then afterwards you now you
have to do micro services in order to
get your black belt in architecture
right it's it's not like a level up
system it's it's more it's a different
style and X and style is exactly what it
is it's just a set of practices and
tools and techniques that now have a
name but you might be applying some of
these tools and some of these styles in
order architectural styles as well so
there's also no one righteous way to do
it right yeah cool okay so that's very
good what else is on the docket for you
so you here at javas oh no any other
conferences or travel plans oh yeah
absolutely so I think Java zone is the
conference season opener for me and
after japas own there will be others
John for one obviously so each other one
I'll be also be doing a micro services
talk and I also do a modularity tutorial
so if you're interested in how to get
that done then you gotta come to my BBQ
oh if you're organising again yeah I'd
love to saturday they okay cool it's one
of the highlights of Java one actually
cool and after javaone there is j fall
in the netherlands so since I stepped
down from the
and enl joke board last year after 10
years I'm now allowed to do
presentations at j fall again so after
10 years I will be returning as a
presenter at j fall so that's something
that I really look forward to in my own
backyard and after that there will be
other conferences as well I don't have
to schedule on top of my yeah that's
good against you got lots of stuff lined
up I see you got the new stylish Apple
watch too yeah I mean so many people
have to be the early adopters Tim might
get eventually affordable for others
right yeah that's good let's get you can
you can break it in first yes as you can
see i am i'm an auntie auntie anything
on my wrists your auntie smart or empty
watch I'm auntie auntie things which
interfere with my ability to coding okay
all right thanks a lot for the short i
got your welcome Bert and you can watch
the live interviews at night hacking
calm interact with us by tweeting to
hashtag night hacking and thank you very
much for watching the attribute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
