Oracle technology Network and I'm here
today with Linda Linda hi hi so leave
that you're you the co-founder of the
Duchess and I saw a programmer Java
programmer and you but we want to talk
to today about sketch noting so you've
been having this little passion of yours
to actually to draw as well as yes so
tell us about it how do star door it
started at an agile conference actually
when a friend of mine showed me his
notes and they just looked so awesome
there were all these pictures in between
and he could tell the entire story and
I've always liked drawing even and then
I never thought I could but if I tried
this technique because I'd already heard
about mind mapping and it seemed really
cool to include pictures in your notes
but mind mapping never really worked for
me because you start in the middle and
then you work towards a corner and the
idea is that you spread out all over the
place but I just worked into one corner
and got stuck there aha and then I found
out about sketch noting which has
several patterns you can use and so we
tried and at first there was mostly
words on the page and little sketch here
and they're not looking really pretty
and then well these days there I've been
doing this for about two years now and
they're slightly more sophisticated for
example these are the keynotes of this
morning yep and I tried it out and then
for example last year I had talked to
some colleagues and they were doing a
session for sharing knowledge and I was
like well I can talk about the
convention I've just been to was a two
day convention and taking all these
notes from the sessions and I could
actually for the first time ever talk
for a full hour on about what I'd seen
at a conference and I even had speed up
because I ran out of time so how did you
train your brain because of course we
are used to like especially at school
right you take notes and too but we lose
that ability when we start working and
not
really taking notes so so what were the
challenges or their little tricks that
you used to to make it easy for yourself
to really like build a story right
because you you read I mean you learn
about the story as you're listening to
them yes to the talk so how do you deal
with that um well at first it was mostly
words as I said and then you added more
pictures and and it's actually a bit of
a case of building up your visual
vocabulary there's certain words you use
so I've got a puzzle piece for jigsaw
and I drew some tunnels so do you come
up with those like before you start to
talk oh no no I come up with them during
the talk mostly because I only have one
picture that I drew up front that was it
started with white board in the kitchen
the session during one of the quickies
so I drew a kitchen and I drew that
beforehand because it takes too much
time but basically and what I hear a lot
of people say all your notes look so
cool I wish I could do that and I'm like
why don't you because we don't have to
be able to draw all you need is
kindergarten level and drawing because
everybody knows that if you draw two
lines with a little squiggly circle on
top that it's a tree and that if you
draw a square with a triangle on top
with little squares in in the other
square then it's a house and so and you
use also like colors and so there are
little tricks right so there's a simple
drawing and then what about the colors
how do you um well I try to limit myself
not to use too many colors in one
drawing because it gets really crowded
but that's for me that's hard so I've
limited myself by buying a set of
markers and simply only having ten
colors and black and gray and I don't
have we give it with me but you also
have like a pan with like multiple
colors so you can just change the yes
right the colors on it i prefer markers
because you can fill surfaces more
quickly
and you can use different font as well
right yes you can you can that you can
just try some funds and I've also heard
a lot of people say but I can't write as
neatly and the trick really is to just
write slowly take your time right les
that's hard that's the hard part writing
less okay so you have to make sure when
you're listening to the to the talk to
just concentrate on the key points yes
that's what you write down right yes and
and the graphics really help to make it
more memorable okay so and you did a
talk so what was your you talk of a Jeff
all right just that joyful I didn't
ignite talk about sketch noting and I
actually drew the entire presentation
I've made an a4 paper and I filled it
with all these sketches about sketch
noting and then I had to turn them in to
cut out the little pieces put them on
slides I actually had to draw the joyful
logo and my company logo because it
looked really silly if I just copied and
pasted the pictures from the internet
when everything else was drawn and so
would you recommend people to do because
I know I mean ice I tried it and it's a
little bit frustrated at first so keep
it keep at it try it and keep trying and
just practice basically just do it as
often as she can I've got several
notebooks full of conferences over the
last two years and at first if I look
back at my notes I can see that then my
notes are actually getting a lot better
now so it just takes practice and do you
go back to your notes more because they
are visual notes so yes because these
notes actually mean something to me
whereas my old notes which was just
words I read them and I'm like did I
write that I can't remember the thing
and now I can still take a talk from two
years ago and pretty much get the key
points out and be able to explain them
to others okay so that should be like a
good
yes for keeping at it okay well thank
you so much Linda for your welcome
coming and sharing with you every with
us like all this sketch noting Thanks oh
we forgot we forgot them then we forgot
the champagne oh oh oh well okay so
actually it's today is Belgium's women's
day it's national celebration so to us
to us there is a champagne and what was
the name of the vendor who did the
champagne you had the card no I don't
know if you guys well anyway it's over
there they're very nice they spot every
women in the conference and they invite
them to have a drink so you know so
instead of beer we have champagne so
Cheers because if I do it for rent sleep
you
messy
strangers in the night all right react
to the future react to the future
Russian one react to the future version
2 and react to the future version 8 be
Saguna
Oh way
no comments on the ticket for 24
tormented internet or chocolate what
Roger basket rydia up well I don't ask
assist you feel more flexible I shan't I
forgive quickly she's due for cozia
I they go like 40 feet kill the
streaming mush and will go faster
recording ok Sybil welcome to night
hiking I'm your employee from Oracle
technology Network and my guest today is
jose de palma jus say hi hello you long
so juicy your consultant you also
professor at maui 13 right so and you
here today to talk about reactive powder
yeah so what's going on yeah we invented
joy yes sir the title of that of the
interview well yes sir reactive
programming and reorganizing reactive
application applications around reactive
modules have been quite trendy this last
we could say here a little bit yeah loud
like that yeah has been quite trendy
these disasters we have quite a lot of
third-party api's in many languages we
have one that is well known probably the
best-known called Eric Java which comes
from netflix and the.net world and this
the third party aap I made it to the
Java world in two versions in fact the
version one which is compatible with
java 6 and version 2 which aims to be
compatible with Java 8 and by the way
which is of course compatible with Java
8 they are quite different in the day
exposed basically the same concepts and
the same kind of patterns but the
implementation of those API is quite
different from each other and then I
think is that we will have Java 9 in
about a year from now we will have Java
9 featured complete in less than a month
now because we are the 11th of November
and we should have it the tenth of
December so it just amounts let us say
and in this distribution we will have a
new class in Java you to control called
flow which aims to expose a reactive
framework for the java application so
basically in nine we can hope to have a
reactive framework that is here not not
to be a replacement of Eric Java or or
third-party api's but merely to provide
some kind of common framework that many
third-party pea i will be able to
implement kind of what we have in jdbc
well a set of interfaces is provided and
people can implement them to access
their different database server and here
we'll have the same kind of approach
where everything will be able to
implement this set of interface there is
also an implementing class by the way
net to to be able to make to create
interpipe interoperability between
different reactive modules in in
application so I think this is a great
way to move forward to the two to this
to embrace this kind of this kind of
concept because reactive programming
along with microservices enables now to
organize application in a much different
way that we did previously with
monolithic applications don't thing like
that those are still exist of course but
i'm probably going to be things of the
past in the next few years now and we
will have a this common framework which
will hopefully be very interesting and
very useful 50 applications so there is
also another topic that you discuss at
devoxx right and this is um I forgot the
name of the application with future
right so this is exactly that special
chair it has to do the future and in
fact it's quite related to yes right now
it's I'm just missing than the exact
name of the API which is embarrassing
this is where I'm not sure the exact
angle yeah complete a ball yeah sure lad
suitable creature this is the name of
the implementing class and the name of
the interface is completion stage so I'm
not sure okay if we should call it the
completion stage API or the computer
will future API right well all right we
leave that to the to the to the people
good at naming api's and not part of it
hey so you care a lot more about what it
does well I get a lot of more about what
it does yes I made a talk this morning
about about this API the fact is that
the
the concepts of this APR I I quite
simple to understand basically it's here
to provide a model for a task that can
be executed in a thread or in the
calling thread basically this task can
be a run-a-ball it can also be a
consumer or it can be a function so it
kept it can be threatening three things
and this guy does can be executed either
synchronously or asynchronously that is
in inner calling thread or in another
thread and I can even provide an
executor this kind of pull a thread to
take you this task in this in this
executor and the nice thing is that all
those tasks can can depend on each other
that is a task and depend on another
task so it can get a result from the
this upside task let us let us call it
like that transform this result to do
something with it do some side effect do
some iOS whatever queries some web
services or some rest services as itself
and then build a result and send this
result to another task that will do
something else so you can really create
graphs of tasks linked to each other to
create complex application or simple one
by the way complex application complex
flows of information of data processing
pipeline I think it's a very nice thing
to have because it is it is it is built
to handle multi-threading and a
synchronous etc very precisely it gives
very fine control over all visa and so
it's a very good complement of the
stream API which basically provides
parallelism which is not the same as a
synchronous and and which is there
really to process data to build data
processing pipeline but in memory I
think that the complete or future
framework really can canal oh wow 222222
deal with iOS that is to deal with data
that comes from from a network from a
database from whatever which the stream
API is probably not not as good as that
that in this in this field okay so two
together actually will well be a
delivering well we can do we can we can
take the best of both worlds it works
quite well it leads to it can lead to
very complex patterns because of course
the API in itself is complex over so you
can really write unreadable code with
that no problem but you can also write
very readable very simple very clean and
very elegant code especially if you if
you're using lambda expressions for that
so it's really really great great thing
to to use in our eight so would you use
that kind of pattern for more for
smaller devices for like a complex when
you say complex application what with
that the fact is that reactive
programming is probably very good at
getting data from different sensors in
the IOT world gather the data from those
sensors process it aggregated build
results with useful information
meaningful operation information for fun
operator from an operator point of view
and so yes it's a it it probably really
shines in the in this kind of feeling
now I know that area Java has a version
that runs in on droid also it's not Java
is not the only language in which it has
been coated so you can also interrupt
with the other devices program with
other languages so it's going to be even
more prevalent as we roll out the
modular actually yes is that fun i I
think so i really think that it provides
really very good solutions to problems
that really exist that are really there
and so I I don't see how it could not be
used to solve those problems really
great so and now we want to do a toast
oh great yes you put your champagne
right you you know it's for the it's for
the National Women's Day in Belgium
great thanks to Belgium for them
absolutely the only day and
and for our partner here and I think the
champagne has been provided here at
Davos yes yes yeah yeah yeah this is
great so you can see that Frenchman
sometime don't drink beer only we also
buy other things including champagne
exactly and I know you're actually a
problem proponent of women's rights
absolute differently if a day and I
really would be so happy to see as many
women as we have men in devoxx yes this
is not the case no we're not there yet
so we have to we all like to be worth
five percent right here this is really
too low you definitely want need we
definitely need to attract more women in
the in this kind of professional in this
kind of event okay cheers to all women
today one thank you you Rhonda thank you
ok I said you are chopping up that
