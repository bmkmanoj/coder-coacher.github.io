am one of the track leads at javaone
2014 specifically for the ee track I
here with me I i have here with me today
Adam beam very proud to have him here
and to have an interview on the sessions
that he has for this year specifically
on the Java EE track hopefully most of
you know who adam is if you don't i'm
sorry to say you should be better
informed he is one of the key java ee
advocates he's a extremely popular
blogger and author and also an
independent expert for a long time on
the job IE side of things so i guess
first and foremost Adam I'd like to ask
you what are the sessions that you have
on the echeck this year okay I'm first
thank you for accepting my sessions so
I'm really appreciated so I attempted
actually to speak on Java one I think
for seven years or something and finally
the recent years it becomes possible to
me so thank you so my sessions the first
one is about NASA one enterprise nice
one and what I would like to show is an
as soon as a part of Java 8 and it's a
JavaScript engine but it's perfectly
usable in with in Java in fact one of my
project uses several projects are using
nasan for instance i'm using NASA horn
for static page generation with
javascript i'm also using a national
project for transformation pipeline and
for testing and also as a dsl and i
would like just show and present some
ideas what is actually possible with
with NASA on and Java 8 and together
with Java you of course on an
application server and the other ship
the other session is about best
practices so the name is unorthodox best
practices with javi why the strange name
yeah because what I'm actually doing it
was most of my projects I try to
simplify the code and architectures
which is actually funny because
at the beginning of j2ee I try to
convince developers to use some patterns
to to hide the ugliness of j2ee and you
know to Heidi xml and the all the naming
remote exceptions and stuff like this
and now everything is gone and the
developers are still keep using the old
practices so what I was show in the
session is how clean java ee
particularly with java 8 actually is and
with java 8 and java 7 you can get em
even more rid of all the all the old
crowd i would say and so i will probably
hack a little bit and show some slides
but as usual usually I don't prepare for
a session a lot what I do is actually I
show some practices from my research
projects so it is too early to say what
happens on the sessions okay very good
that's the best way to to do it's only a
year you have every unique style in that
regard you're also part of the panel for
java later how do you feel about that
and how do you think job IE is cheap the
eight is shaping up so far and what are
you thoughts and some of that um i'm
curious what happened on the panel to
end and the shape i think this is a very
good shape but it was also in very good
shape java 6 in java 7 I was not very
critical about this and I was very happy
about what happened so it was so happy
to become even lazy as a JCP member so
just watch would happen but it just just
just the direction was perfect any Java
8 so what I saw already is there was
like some MVC proposals proposal for
configuration was really interesting and
what I would like to see a little bit
more so we had a chat the last java one
little bit more non functional aspects
like monitoring and deployment and yeah
i will increase what happens about this
and i will use java one to talk about
this stuff with the other members
excellent you also have a job ethics
session I understand what's what's
dollar all about well what I actually as
a Java developer what I created a small
dependency injection framework for java
fake
and strangely enough this framework
become very popular so it is also used
in production and and even some
consultants wrote articles about the
framework so what I afraid boxes to
classes so it's not a framework is just
classwork extent and I would just show
what you can do with a little bit
inversion of control in Java figs and
how to connect Java peaks with the java
ee back end with a little code that's
only possible so in and I will actually
answer one of the FAQ know how to use
web sockets and how to connect java ee
how to use the scene builder and in in
in reasonable way this is what i will do
with with the session excellent so i
guess i have to ask how do you feel java
ee adoption in the real world is going
specifically i guess in your cart
customer base and perhaps in may be in
europe so while in europe so I in Europe
I spend most of my time I would say
austria germany switzerland in projects
but i travel a bit of conferences so i
attended several conferences in Northern
Europe and in Eastern Europe or Poland
and so far and what I have to say is all
java ee sessions are completely full so
this is stretch seeing this for me it
happens more and more in recent years so
they become more and more popular
projectwise I'm it is i'm actually
overwhelmed i have to say so what
usually so what was the practice several
years ago there was a lots of adoption
adoption in enterprises what happens
right now more and more startups are
interested in java ee which is new to me
and at least three clients i know i
started as a start-up for with java ee
six now seven and even java 8 and i hope
i could interview them on my blog soon
so a really interesting project and they
decided for java ee because of
productivity so i would say the
enterprise of enterprise-e features are
less interesting to my customers which
really interesting is the productivity
was in my opinion
and you know what I can say whatever I
do is Java EE there's lots of projects
lots of demand and one of the most
common question is do I know any Java
developers so this is what what i can
only say so it's great so I'm yeah it's
perfect a salon so I guess other than
your sessions what else are you looking
forward to at javaone this year well the
java one is actually the only conference
where I'm really authentic as a speaker
it's a whole time and I try so this is
why I know I have absolutely no time for
parties and even though no time for a
four hallway conversations really so I
from the eight in the morning two birds
of feather are ending at 11pm or
something I attend the whole time
javaone and now I feel how the attendees
feel in my workshop to know after 12
hours but why I doing this because I
think the Java one is the only
conference where the we have a high
concentration of Oracle speakers
actually so I get the other speakers in
or other conferences but not all oracle
speakers and there were great sessions i
can remember last year about you know
the inner workings of collection stuff
like this you can only get this at
javaone so Java one for me is probably
like the WWDC for the Apple developers
and why and I would even expect even
more Oracle engineers talking on Java
one because this is the uniqueness of
Java one if I would like now to hear the
other consultants I could go to whatever
else 10,000 conferences you know so I'm
this is what i use java one to learn new
stuff too because you could forget a lot
of stuff so i just attend the same
sessions new sessions new stuff and yet
is what I'm looking for it's like
vacations and learning new stuff
vacations I mean I see probably half an
hour San Francisco you know and 200
hours java one so how it works excellent
so Adam thank you again for your time I
guess as a final world word is there
something you'd like to say to the
community before we sign off today and
hopefully see you at javaone yeah I'm
what I would say to Java one just try it
and try to
pre enrolled to as many sessions as only
possible and don't believe the common
wisdom you know say you learn nothing on
sessions you have to know have
conversations outside the conference
venue so you don't have to travel them
so just join these sessions try to
listen to speakers ask more questions
after the sessions and then talk with
other attendees and and just just enjoy
Java this is what i can tell you
excellent thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
