Brooke the community key what she's a
turn up are you talking to he's not
looking at me Hey look I at the sound
booth okay we're ready to start hello
volume again which guys with the stripe
so with ya both of them hi there hello
hi hello hey could you turn up the sound
sound could you turn up the sound it's
totally clear is he working there as
you're standing there could you turn on
the sound ok now the sounds on thank you
ok alright thanks to our crowd out there
for a system here with the sound alright
community cast so we're back your Tim
joins us again today thanks welcome back
your tune thank you for having me back
so this morning we talked a little bit
with the netbeans dream team um but
you're here this week also talking about
oracle jet you have rationed right
auricle jet right so maybe tell us a
little bit about yourself and about
oracle jet well I work I'm from
Amsterdam in the Netherlands and I've
worked for son before the takeover and
I'm part of Oracle and I've worked on
NetBeans for a long time but at the same
time increasingly i'm working on
Oracle's Java Script platform so about
three years ago we started standardizing
the JavaScript libraries and
technologies that organizations inside
Oracle are using because of course
everyone is interested in JavaScript
nowadays and it's becoming more more
popular the browser is becoming better
and better and more libraries coming out
more technologies coming out around
JavaScript an ecosystem is really
vibrant so the question was asking is
could you create enterprise applications
in JavaScript
from the Oracle point of view do you
have to use apex and ADF or from outside
Oracle do you have to use all the
different languages that are out there
and transpire down to JavaScript or
should you just write in native
JavaScript which is the language of the
browsers so it makes sense to ask
whether you could write native
JavaScript applications without some
intermediate step without some some
compilation of transporation down to
javascript and of course there are many
libraries out there this angular and
there's backbone and there's hundreds of
different technologies and I breeze out
there and we sought to standardize with
an Oracle let's not create a new
framework and it's not quite a new
library and so instead we created a
toolkit so Oracle jet the je T stands
for javascript extension toolkit and
it's not Oracle Jeff which javascript
extension framework and it's it's not an
Oracle Jeff you know it's not the orator
enterica jet so it's a it's a generic
collection of existing libraries like
jQuery jQuery UI knockout require you
know libraries that are widely used in
the JavaScript ecosystem that we've
bundled together and we've added some
graphs and charts on top so we've
created our own visualization component
library but including buttons and grids
and tables and all of these things on
top of jQuery UI and those are all
available for free on github anyone can
use them if you're using jQuery UI
already you can just include these
charts and so on in your application but
also aside from those charts and
components and the open source libraries
a third part of jet is an architecture
so we have this idea of how to structure
a JavaScript application in such a way
that those libraries fits into it well
but also that there's a modularity
system based on top of require and also
a convention of a configuration in the
sense of each module is a JavaScript
file with an HTML file and they have the
same name and there should be found
within certain folders within your
application structure so that if someone
else takes over your application that
immediately know where to find the code
so there's a there's a structure built
into it and sort of the Third Point so
the first point is it's these charts and
graphs and some on the second point is
the Athens
libraries the third point is an
architectural structure and also a bunch
of templates that's a fourth big part of
it and the fifth thing is solutions for
enterprise problems like
internationalization is built-in
accessibility of all the components is
built in so typical and security
concerns are handled and so typical
enterprise problems are solved out of
the box and you can just hook into those
existing solutions so that's someone
creating a finance applications business
you know enterprise applications
typically you want to dashboard to
visualize some underlying data that
there is everything is ready for you to
do that you can start working on your
domain specific code immediately and
I've been to your session where you go
over the product and it's really cool
the way that you do it in your session
so you're doing kind of a live right
molar cody we really able to highlight
some of them yeah main benefits just
went over so right i found your session
really beneficial i haven't been to the
one that you're doing here or dead right
well i mean and it's also it's part of
it is there's a cookbook with recipes
online you can go to our corporate jet
oregon all the components of the charts
everything is there you can see the code
you can copy the code from the page in
the browser into your application and
there's also a related Oracle product
which is not free and open source but a
related one is called Oracle application
builder cloud service a bcs oracle a BCS
and this isn't a browser-based tool for
creating applications for creating
oracle jet application without coding
and this application itself is created
in oracle jet so we use Aerojet to
create a browser-based tool to actually
generate our Aquajet applications which
and you can extend that to yourself and
the division behind it is that aside
from co developers who would use jets
writing JavaScript code there's also the
citizen developer who doesn't read code
and but has an interest in putting
applications together very quickly
without asking the software Department
of the IT department to create the
application but they already have data
in the cloud and they have these widgets
available I'm the quickly drag and drop
those things together that drag the data
from the Oracle cloud into it and they
quickly create an application and the
contactor to our presentation
no they can quickly put something
together and publish it and for the
citizen developer who wants to us this
kind of maybe maybe a programming
background because often people at some
point in their life on that program is
in war that be promoted to a middle
management position so there are kind of
still interested in development but
don't have the time to correct it took
fully coding application but might be
interested in in in correcting that
through your drag and drop mechanism so
that's that's also related to Oracle jet
very exciting stuff so you check out
that session if you don't attend it in
person I know they're recording all the
sessions it's definitely worth watching
so what would have been come the best
things about you know the people
attending your talk and some of the
talks that you've been to hear or a dev
this week well so at sea as I've known
to talks and and this is one generic
JavaScript talk that I do which is kind
of explaining and increasing levels of
of panic basically how bad the
JavaScript ecosystem is in a sense that
it is so volatile and so unstable and I
try and describe in increasing levels of
urgency that there's a problem here you
know that it's nice for correcting small
apps but for larger applications does
JavaScript and its ecosystem makes sense
and that's one talk i doing the other
one is about jet specifically and but
what's the kind of comments that i get
all the time from people is there saying
hey yeah this actually makes sense you
know this is a logical response to that
problem and what people like is the fact
that we haven't created a new framework
but that we've taken existing solutions
that we have all these enterprise ideas
built in and people really like the
cookbook this idea of just cutting and
pasting components and snippets of code
into your application so so that
combination I think people really are
really appreciate on here as well well I
definitely haven't heard your talk that
you just mentioned the ecosystem talk
right I should check that out for
herself I'm right familiar with the Java
ecosystem not so much the dry script
ecosystem but that's what's so
interesting about hora de right is that
the scene of different technologies yeah
conference exactly and and you know also
when I talk about the JavaScript
ecosystem at some point to say the
further you get into the JavaScript
world from a Java background the more
you appreciate the Java ecosystem
because everything like Java EE
everything is specified every single
part of it has been agreed upon between
different organizations everything is
documented their specifications that's
implementations there's working groups
on all these things and everything fits
together which is the complete opposite
of the JavaScript world and so it's kind
of looking back from the javascript roll
to the Java world you kind of Rhea
preciate all the work that's gone into
the JCP process and the jabs and and
everything and the work that you do and
Patrick and and everyone involved you
suddenly appreciate that so much more
because it really enables all the pieces
to fit together logically which is which
is what we're trying to solve via jet in
the JavaScript ecosystem yeah oh yeah
well very cool so I've learned something
here today tell right yes thank you I
hope you enjoy the rest of aura dev yes
sorry to see more of yes for the rest of
the conference of course x conference
yes probably next week right right thank
you right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
