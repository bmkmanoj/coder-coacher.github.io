University of Kent in the UK so I work
on the green foot and blue jay projects
so they're both beginners programming
environments and designed for people who
don't necessarily know any programming
all ready to take them and sort of learn
to program and for teachers to use them
to teach programming so one thing that
we've learned by developing this
software is there's not enough just to
develop the software you can't just
about the software throw it over the
fence and hope that we have ended up
you're going to few sort of dedicated
teachers or dedicated kids but by itself
the software is not sufficient so what
we do a savory trying to build community
will shine off the support we try and
provide material so that especially
teachers actually have something that
they can take and to use with the
software so we have a textbook for Blue
Jay we have a textbook for green foot we
have a community site for green foot
users tend to be the kids so they can
make games in green for us they can
upload them onto the website they can
share them whether we are the green for
users they can ask questions of each
other and get sort of peer supports that
they can those program or get help when
when they get stuck maybe if they just
doing it themselves in their bedroom
they've got some support there or if
they're doing in a classroom it's
something that they can do after school
will naturally add
get interesting we'll share with each
other we also have a site for teachers
so that teachers can actually share
materials so generally teachers wrong
things like lesson plans or skews of
work or so the structure they can fly to
their course or innovative ideas of
different assessments or or worksheets
so we have a site where they can again
interact with each other as a peer
support generate material share material
so they can actually support each other
teaching with with blue jay and green
fields so we hope to provide good
support so the kids are using it could
support silly the teachers are using it
actually sort of form communities all
the use of our software not just giving
the software and so leave them to it
actually fighting support once they're
using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
