for your WordPress blog so here we are
inside our WordPress dashboard and we
are ready to import the demo content I
have a file here this is an XML file and
this file contains the data that we need
inside our WordPress blog this contains
some posts some categories and some
subcategories so for this course we'll
be using the data inside this file and
this file will be imported inside
WordPress so let's just head over to the
dashboard once again and head over to
tools and select import
by default WordPress does not have the
import functionality we have to install
an additional plugin and in order to do
that just click on WordPress
this will show you the plugin that will
require and just hit install now so
WordPress will go ahead and install this
plug-in on our local WordPress
installation okay so here we are inside
the import plugin now it's working now
all we need to do is select the file
that contains the WordPress data so just
go ahead select the file that you have
I'll be providing this file along with
the video so don't worry about that
you can just browse to the file select
the XML file and click upload file and
import
since it contains a lot of data this
might take a while so just go ahead and
select the administrative user or the
user that you have created and make sure
you select download and import
attachments what this will do this will
download all the image files and videos
if there are and store them on your
local WordPress installation
although this will take a lot of time
I'm gonna keep it Ted
and hit submit so what press we'll go
ahead and download all the attachments
as well this will take some time so
we'll be back when it's done
looks like the input has completed so in
order to make sure that import is
completed we'll go to pose and we can
see that there are a number of posts
right here if we go to categories you'll
see that there are a number of
categories right here and if you go to
media you'll also see the imported media
content so you can see that we have a
number of images as well okay finally we
want to enable the API on this wordpress
blog so if you check out the wordpress
blog right now you'll see that a number
of posts will appear on the front page
so you can see that there are a number
of posts right here you can just scroll
down and read each of the polls but in
order to use this WordPress blog as a
source of information in our ionic
application we have to enable an API so
that our ionic application can fetch the
data from this WordPress blog
so in order to do that we'll have to go
to plugins click on add new go ahead and
search for JSON API and select the
plug-in one by Dan Pfeiffer okay just
hit install now there are other modern
plugins available but this one is the
simplest one so for this course we'll be
using this plugin just hit activate
plugin and the plugin will be activated
this plugin will allow you to get the
data from your WordPress blog in JSON
format so what you can do you can just
go to settings select JSON API and here
you will see the number of endpoints
that you can use in order to get data
from your WordPress blog as of now no
authentication is required but later in
the course I will introduce you to more
sophisticated plugin that will allow you
to implement authentication as well so
let's select get recent posts endpoint
and if you open this in a new tab you'll
see that there is an error so we kind of
get this error on a local server
and the workaround is that you can just
copy this text okay you can just copy
the text of the method that you want to
get data about and right here after the
URL of your blog just type in adjacent
parameter and give the value as the
method name so I'm typing in localhost /
udemy wordpress blog which is the URL of
a wordpress blog and then i am using a
URL parameter jason and the value of the
jason parameter is the method that we
want to get the data from and as i hit
enter you can see that it returned me a
lot of data it returned me a total of 36
posts and this data is json formatted
you might not see this data formatted in
your browser and this is because I have
installed a Jason formatting plug-in
this is an extension it's called Jason
view so just go ahead to Chrome Web
Store and add this extension to your
chrome so you can see JSON data well
formatted so we have to use the JSON
parameter on the local servers I don't
know why it happens but I have also set
up a similar server on my website news
portal dot lights and shades start in
and here if I type in API slash
get pose I get the JSON data perfect so
I do not understand this might be a bug
in the plugin it does not work directly
on localhost you need to add adjacent
parameter but on the remote web servers
it just works perfect so we'll be using
the blog add news portal dot lights and
share slot in for the rest of this
course but you know how you can set up
this blog on your local server as well
you can follow nearly the same procedure
to set up a wordpress blog on your web
server and then follow the course along
from the next video in the next video
we'll start with the process of creating
our ionic application so see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
