for your WordPress blog so it's time to
set up our WordPress blogs database
WordPress by default uses my sequel
database and that is what van server
provides so make sure that you have your
web server up and running and you can do
so by going to your tray in your tray
you will see this icon the green icon if
the green icon is red make sure that you
click on it and click on start all
services so this will start all the
services the advanced server provides
which includes apache 2 web server and
the my is equal to dub a server as well
now all you need to do is go to
localhost / PHP myadmin
the other way is you can also go to PHP
myadmin by clicking on this vamp server
tray icon hit PHP myadmin so both ways
you can get to PHP myadmin
PHP myadmin is a very smart tool that
web developers and database admins use
to create and manage databases so you
can see that I already have around 7-8
databases here and I'm going to create a
new one for the WordPress blog that we
are going to create so what I'm going to
do I'm going to go to databases tab
right here
and I'm just going to type in a name
here and the name of my database blog
will be udemy WordPress block and I'm
just going to hit create so you can see
that I have created a new database here
it does not have any tables as of now
and we do not need to create any tables
these tables will be created by
WordPress automatically during the
installation process so now that we have
created our database as well all we need
to do is start with the installation of
our WordPress blog so remember that we
have extracted the files of our
WordPress in a folder called udemy
WordPress blog so just would be a
browser type in localhost / udemy
WordPress blog this should get you
started with the WordPress installation
Visser
so you can see that I have the WordPress
installation wizard up and running just
select the language hit continue in the
next screen it is going to ask you for
the database name username password and
the host
so the name of my database is udemy
WordPress blog the user name of my
database is root I do not have a
password and the database host would be
localhost
because I'm running everything locally
and I am just gonna hit submit
if everything worked
fine this screen is what you will see
it's gonna tell you that the database
credentials that we entered were okay
and now it's gonna communicate with the
database hit run the install button and
now it will create the tables inside the
WordPress database that we pointed it to
so it's going to ask me for a few
details
and I'm gonna hit install WordPress
so our wordpress installation has
completed successfully now if we go back
to PHP myadmin and if we if we try to
access our database again udemy
WordPress blog you'll see that we have
11 tables created by WordPress here so
these other tables that WordPress uses
to store the data now we do not need
phpMyAdmin anymore all we need to do is
login to a wordpress admin panel so the
username ball's summer and the password
wars admin i'm going to type in and we
have logged in successfully to our local
wordpress instance so this is how we set
up wordpress locally in the next video
we'll import some demo content in this
wordpress blog and then we'll set up the
api so that we can access the data from
wordpress blog inside our ionic
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
