video on ionic so in this video we are
going to learn about deep links and how
we can use deep links in our ion ik
applications so here is a blog post
about deep links on blog dot ionic dot
IO by max Lynch and in this amazing blog
post he explains clearly what our deep
links so basically deep links are URLs
that make it possible to take your user
to a very specific point in your
application so for example you have an
e-commerce application and you want the
user to be navigated to a particular
page in their application with a very
particular product display but deep
links you can do that all your user will
have to do is click on a link and that
link will take the user to that very
specific point in your application and
that product will be displaying on that
particular page so this is our deep
links work and you might have seen this
with a number of popular applications
like Instagram Amazon and even whatsapp
so how deep links work is that we have
to define a custom URL scheme for our
application as you can see here we have
an example of Instagram so Instagram has
a custom URL if IAM defined which is
called instagram so all the urls is
starting with this protocol will be
handled by the Instagram application
similarly we can define a custom URL
scheme for our own ionic application and
then all the URLs with that custom URL
scheme will be handled by our
application so let's see this in action
so I have created this new ionic
application which is called ionic deep
link and what I am going to do is open
this application in Visual Studio code
so the application is now open in Visual
Studio code and the first thing that
we'll have to do is install the required
plugins and ionic native modules so
let's head over to the ionic native
website and
find the deep link section on the deep
links page you see that you need to
install an ionic cordova plugin and also
an ionic native module for deep links so
what I'm going to do is just copy this
and I'm going to come back to Visual
Studio code and open a terminal here and
I'm going to paste in this command now
this command is specifies four different
parameters that you need to specify
while installing this plugin
the first parameter is the URL scheme
and this is the URL scheme that should
be unique throughout all the
applications that the user has installed
on their device so it is a better option
that you keep your URL scheme such that
it is not duplicated by any other
application so for now what I am going
to do is call my URL scheme my cool app
so all my URLs will start with my cool
app then you specify a deep linking
scheme I am going to leave it HTTP the
third variable is deep link host this
takes in the domain name or the URL to
your website so I am just going to call
it Samar calm for now there is no such
website I'm just going to keep it like
this so I can later demonstrate how it
works and lastly the Android path prefix
I'm going to leave it default and now
what I'm going to do I am going to hit
enter so this will install the plug-in
and since I am working with the latest
ionic CLI I also need to install CLI
plug-in Cordova
so I'm just going to input yes here so
this will install the CLI plug-in
Cordova and then we'll install ionic
plug-in deep links while it completes
let's go back to ionic native website
and grab the second command which is
used to install the ionic native module
for deep links come back to Visual
Studio code and now paste in this
command so the ionic native module and
the ionic Cordova plugins both are
installed so the first thing that we'll
have to do is go to the SRC folder open
the app folder and go to app got module
to TS here I will have to import the
deep links plug-in after importing I'll
have to pass it in the providers array
so I'll just do that now let's go to the
page app component of TS because this is
the page which is loaded first in our
application and this is the place where
I want to handle all the deep links so
I'm just gonna import deep links here as
well and I'm going to pass it into my
constructor now we are ready to use deep
links but for now let's run this
application in an emulator and see how
the installation of Cordova deep links
plug-in modified how our application
behaves so what I am going to do is
initiate the run command here so I am
just going to type in ionic Cordova run
Android and this will add the Android
platform as well so while our
application is built and deployed on an
intro device what I am going to do is
open for PennDOT IO and I'm going to
create a new code fan and what I do is
write some HTML code to generate a link
so that our application can be tested
for that custom URL scheme that we have
just created and the URL to this anchor
tag will start with my cool app remember
we specified my cool app as the URL
scheme for our ionic application okay
and after that I will specify the name
of the domain that I specified while
installing that plug-in okay so this is
our URL which we are going to use to
test our ionic applications deep link
functionality I'm going to save this
code pin and this gives me a unique URL
that I can now access on my Android
device okay
so let's leave this open for now and
let's head over to our emulator
so the application has launched now
everything is as usual nothing special
has happened and now what we are going
to do is close this application and I
open the web browser on my Android
device and I'll open this code pen page
in my emulator so I'll just type in the
URL and I will hit enter okay so you can
see that this opens the same exact page
in my browser and if I click on this
link that I have created right here this
should launch my application because the
URL scheme specifies my cool app and
this phone right here knows that all the
URLs starting with my cool app are to be
handled by our ionic application so
let's try and click on this link and you
can see that our ionic application
launches up okay so this way we can
create custom URLs these URLs will
launch our application but how can we
send specific data to our application
with the help of these links and how can
we receive that data in our application
first to perform some navigation or
manipulation in our application so let's
check that out so let's go back to our
ionic application and inside my platform
dot ready function right here so I'm
just going to type in this dot D
playings got route and this route
function takes in some parameters that I
am going to explain in just a moment for
now what I am going to do is just pass
in a bland JSON object here okay and
this returns us an observable so I can
subscribe to that and the first function
inside this SUBSCRIBE function will be a
function that receives a parameter let
us call that match and what I'm going to
do is just alert whatever we get in
match
so I'll just jason stringify it and I'll
just pass in match I'll also create
another function that will be executed
if we run into an error and I will pass
in the parameter and call it no match
and I'll also alert no match using JSON
dot stringify
okay let's save that and run our
application again
so my application has run now and now I
will close the application and now if I
click on this link the application will
open and I should get an alert in my
application and I do and you can see all
the data that I get and here you can see
that I get the JSON object and inside
this object I have a property called
Dollar link which is again a nested JSON
object and it contains the URL which is
used to open our application you can see
that I get the complete URL I also get a
path property which is blank as of now I
get the scheme which is my cool app I
get the host which is somewhere calm and
a number of other parameters as well we
have got some information but how can we
pass in some custom parameters to this
let's see how to do that so what I'm
going to do is just pass in a parameter
called foo and the value of this
parameter is going to be bar I'm going
to save it open my emulator close the
app and I'm going to refresh this page
to load the changes that I have made
okay so now I have the parameters here
and now if I click on this link you can
see that I get the parameters as well in
the query string property inside my
Dollar link object foo equals bar okay
basically what is happening here is
every time the error callback is running
so when does the success callback run in
order to understand that we will have to
understand what are the parameters that
we need to pass it in the route function
the route function basically takes a
JSON object and inside this JSON object
you can specify different URLs that your
application should be able to handle so
as of now I am going to specify just one
URL which is going to be that root URL
and after this root URL you can specify
a value from a component to a JSON
object this can be anything that you
want for now I am just going to pass in
a plan JSON object here and what happens
here is that
the deep links module matches the URL
that is used to launch our application
with this particular URL so if the
application is launched with this
particular URL this particular object
that I have passed in along with this
URL will be passed in the success
callback ok
so in this case if we use the root URL
to launch our application the match
object will contain a blank JSON object
let's try and run this I am going to
save it and run the application again in
the emulator so our application has now
launched I'll close it I'll click on the
link and this time you can see okay so
the success callback should have been
executed but still the error callback
executed and this is because I have not
specified the second slash here
it's specifying the second flash here
make sure that the root URL matches with
the one that we have specified in our
out function I'm going to save it open
my browser on the emulator and reload
this URL and now I am going to click on
this link and this time the success
callback runs and you can see that I get
a route object which contains nothing
and this is because I have specified
nothing right here this object that you
specify right here will be received
inside the route object you can use it
to perform any action that you want in
the success callback another object that
I have got here is the args object which
contains the arguments which were
specified in our URL so I get a JSON
object with the key foo and its value
bar along with that I get the usual link
object which contains URL query string
scheme host and other information ok
let's try and specify one more URL here
so I'll just type in web and its value
let's just pass in a JSON object here
let's call it web and let's specify its
value to be true okay so now our
application is able to handle two kinds
of URL the ones with the route URL and
the ones that have slash web at
and okay so let's run this application
again so our application has now been
launched an emulator I will close it
I'll click on this link in the code pen
and you can see that the root URL has
been matched and this is because I get
nothing in the route object
let's close this and I'll update the URL
by specifying web endpoint okay
I'll save it refresh the page in my
browser in the emulator and when I click
on this link this time I should get an
object because the web and point should
be matched and you can see that the
route object contains web equals true
passed in as a JSON object and this is
what we have specified right here so
this object right here has been provided
to us in our application in the success
callback using the route object with
that I have other information like arcs
object which contains the arguments food
and its value bar and the link object
which contains all the other information
so based on these objects and these
values you can decide what you want to
do and where you want to navigate your
user in the application so this is how
deep links work you are free to try this
out and let me know if you face any
problems in implementing wavelength also
