for your WordPress blog so now that we
have index dot HTML our
Abdur J's and a controller dot J's in
place we can go ahead and start creating
our application we can write all our
application code in index dot HTML but
this is good when we have an application
that contains just one screen but our
application will be more than that what
we want to do is create an application
that have multiple screens and the user
can navigate between those screens using
the navigation controls that we provide
for example as soon as the application
launches user has a screen and that
screen shows all the latest posts
whenever user taps on any of the post
and the post opens in detail on another
screen so you see what we are trying to
do well we are trying to navigate from
one screen to another on a particular
event so we will have to create those
screens first and then we will use our
index dot HTML as a placeholder for
those screens we load a particular
screen inside our index dot HTML as and
when required and whenever we need to
load a different screen we'll swap the
screens in index dot HTML so how do we
do that
first let's just go head inside our www
folder and create a new folder and call
this as templates ok templates is a
folder that will contain the pieces of a
UI that will inject in index.html one
requirement okay so our latest posts
screen will be a piece similarly our
post detail screen will also be a piece
and we will swipe these pieces with each
other hasn't been required so let's just
go add an index.html and create a few
files so first I'm going to create a
file and I'm going to save it as menu
dot HTML so this file will contain a
menu that will help the user to navigate
from one page to another second I'll
create another page and I'll call this
as menu content dot HTML
okay this will contain the content of
our main screen third I will create
another screen and I'll save it as post
detail dot HTML the names are
self-explanatory the menu dot HTML will
contain our menu we are going to create
a side menu you can see how a side menu
looks so what we are trying to build is
something like this so we'll have a menu
on the left
and whenever we swipe to the right our
menu will show up and whenever we swipe
to the left our main content will show
up so we have our menu dot HTML for the
menu which is hidden on the left the
content on the screen which gets shifted
to the right whenever we open the menu
will be stored in menu content dot HTML
host detail dot HTML is another page
which will contain the content of a
particular post that we want to see in
detail ok so these are pretty much all
the pages that we are going to create
for now
now let's go to our app dot J's file all
we need to do is create respective
states so that we can navigate from one
page to another okay so what I'm going
to do I'm going to use the UI router
which is provided by angular UI and is
included with ionic so we do not need to
include UI router or angular UI in our
project we have ionic included right
here so we have access to the UI router
so what I'm going to do I'm just gonna
type in some code here I'm gonna type in
the config block of our module and this
config block will be a function and it
will take two parameters the first
parameter is state provider and the
second parameter is URL router provider
okay and this will be a function
so what we are trying to do we are
trying to create some states states will
be the encapsulation of a particular
screen so for example at steak menu dot
HTML so menu dot HTML will contain some
UI and will also contain some back-end
code so will encapsulate both the things
the UI and the backend code in a
particular State and we will navigate to
that state hasn't been required
similarly let's consider pose details
for HTML that file will contain the UI
code the HTML code for that screen and
also some back and JavaScript code will
be required so we'll encapsulate that
HTML code and the JavaScript code and
we'll bind it together and create a new
state and we'll navigate to that state
hasn't been required so let's just go
ahead and create States and then you
will know what we are trying to do so
let's see what state provider and we'll
use the dot state method to create a new
state okay and now we are supposed to
provide it the name of the state which
we'll call main and along with it we are
supposed to provide a number of
properties all these properties are
passed as a JSON object so I'm just
gonna use curly braces and within the
curly braces I'm gonna specify the URL
okay so this will be the URL that we can
see in the address bar but in a mobile
application this URL is not visible your
application navigate to this URL
whenever you want to activate this
particular state okay so the first
parameter is the URL and we have
assigned it to mean the second parameter
is a template URL okay this will be the
URL of the HTML file that we want to
load whenever the user navigates through
this particular state okay so the URL of
the template is
templates slash menu dot HTML okay
so we are actually referring this file
right here
last but not the least we need to
specify the controller so this will be
the JavaScript component that we are
binding together along with the UI and
the controller is menu controller okay
all you need to do is specify a name of
the controller likewise I'm going to
create two more States for our menu
content and post detail so I'm just
going to paste in the code right here
and you can see that the code is pretty
much the same except the fact that I
have put a dot here and I have named the
state as main dot content recent this is
because I have content recent as a state
nested within the main state similarly I
have pose detail a state nested within
the main state so content recent and
post little states are within the main
state the main state is the parent state
while these two states are the child
states okay other than that we have a
URL we have a temporary URL and we have
a controller you can see that for the
main state and the main dot content
recent state we have the same controller
you can use different controllers but
for the sake of simplicity we have
specified the same controller because
these two states will be visible on the
same screen this state will be the side
menu while this state will be the
content on the screen except that side
menu okay so finally we need to specify
a default case that will get executed if
the user navigates through any URL other
than the specified ones if the user
specified is a random URL then the user
will be taken to this case and this will
be URL router provider not otherwise and
here I'll specify the URL of a state
that the user will be taken to if they
try to navigate to any other state the
user should be taken to content recent
state
if none of the three states match okay
so this is our Stern now all we need to
do is create these two controllers menu
controller and post controller in our
controller rjs and also we need to
modify the code in our Indian store HTML
a bit so I'm just going to remove this
ion pane and because we want to use our
index dot HTML as a container which will
hold the templates we have to remove all
the code inside our body tag and I'm
just going to use iron nav view and iron
a view is the tag that will contain the
content of the templates hasn't been
required so I will just save it now
let's head back to controllers Rogers
and I'm just going to create controllers
so that no console errors occur and we
can test our application so we have a
controller here menu controller so we'll
just copy this code and we'll just paste
it again and we'll just change the name
of this controller from menu controller
to post controller okay so we have just
created the controllers but we are not
doing anything inside them now if we go
back to the application and inspect the
console you notice that we do not have
any errors also we do not have any
content this is because all the
templates are currently blank so in the
next video we'll start creating the UI
of our application and start with the
menu dot HTML file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
