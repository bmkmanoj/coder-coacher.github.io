WooCommerce now that we know how to
create and run ionic applications let's
dive in a little deeper and learn about
various ionic components each component
in ionic is created using HTML CSS in
JavaScript we can use HTML tags that
ionic provides to build a button a list
a header a footer and many other
components that come with ionic all we
have to do is learn about the various
classes and new tags that ionic
introduces us to and then we can just
get going with our ionic application so
from this video onwards until a few
videos we will have a look at each of
the ionic components so in this video we
are going to have a look at i/o Nick
header ionic content and ionic footer
let's have a look at how headers are
created in ionic so this is our first
tab that we created a few videos back so
what I'm going to do I am just going to
open this folder with visual studio code
also what I am going to do is run this
application in my browser so I am inside
my first half folder as you can see all
I have to do now is type in ionic serve
- - el this will run our ionic
application in the browser and you can
see that my ionic application is running
on the left in the browser ok
what I am going to do I am going to open
my Visual Studio code on the right so
here I have my Visual Studio code on the
right and on the Left I have my
application also note that I have my
ionic server running right here as soon
as I type in ionic serve - - shell a
live reload server starts running and
this makes sure that as soon as I make
changes in my HTML CSS in JavaScript
those changes are reflected in the
browser so this is kind of cool feature
that ionic provides let's go to our wwwp
and inside this we have an index for
HTML file let's open up that and in our
index Road HTML file we have a head
section and a body section let's have a
look at for this body section contains
the body section contains an iron pane
and inside the iron pane we have iron
header bar and an iron content
so what is iron pin well iron pain is
just like a container okay
it helps organize your content this way
we are just going to encapsulate all the
content inside our iron pin okay our
iron header bar is what we are seeing
right here this right here is our iron
header bar okay inside our iron header
bar we have an h1 tag with a class of
title and it says ionic blank starter so
if I change this I will make it first
app and as soon as I save it you'll
notice that on the left the application
is refreshed and now I can see the
change text on the header so this is a
cool feature that ionic provides the
live reload feature it automatically
reloads their application as soon as it
detects any changes in the application
so this is our iron header bar and I
have a class called bar - stable applied
to it but if I change this class from
bar stable to bar positive I'll save it
and as soon as the application refreshes
you will see the new color that our
header bar has on it it has a nice blue
color which is provided to it by the
class bar - positive there are a number
of other classes let's have a look at
some of them we also have bar royal and
this will give me a nice purple color
and there are other classes as well
let's just try energized and I'll save
it again I have a yellowish orange kind
of bar on the top so there are a number
of other classes you have a list of all
the classes and the colors that the
classes bring to the controls on your
screen right now so we have this special
tag iron header bar defined which makes
sure that the component that we see on
the screen is an iron add a bar we can
also use a dev instead and apply some
special ionic classes to get the same
effect I'll try that so I'll just put a
div here and I'll close the div tag
and now I will apply some classes I will
apply a class core bar and then I'll
apply another class called bar header
I'll save it
and you can see that I still get the
same header bar
okay similarly what I can do is just
copy this and below my iron content I'll
paste this and instead of bar header
class this time I will just apply bar
footer class and you can see that I now
have a footer in my application we can
change the color of the footer is fill
just like we were applying classes to
our header bar we can apply the same
classes to our iron footer as well so I
will just try bar - comm class and you
can see I have a comp blue color on the
footer
okay we have a text inside of here and
we can change the text as well
and as soon as you save and apply the
changes the changes are reflected in the
browser okay so this is how you create
iron header bar and iron footer bar but
what about this iron content iron
content is also container but the
special advantage that iron content
provides is that it automatically
applies a scroll bar if the size of the
content inside iron content
exceeds the size of your screen so
throughout our application we will be
using iron content a lot and we'll be
using and content to hold all the UI
components of our application as of now
we are not making any use of iron
content so what I'm going to do I'm just
going to put in my name here so that you
can see where iron content is in the
browser oh you cannot see that and
that's because my name is overlapped by
our iron header bar okay so what I can
do to correct this is that I can just
apply a class has header and I will save
it
and now you can see the content so
earlier what was happening the content
inside iron content some earth Agarwal
my name was there but it was overlapped
by our iron header bar so our iron
content spans from the top of the screen
to the bottom of the screen including
the area that iron header bar and footer
bar occupy so we have to make sure that
our content does not get overlapped and
to make sure that it does not happen we
have to apply a class called as header
just like we have created a header bar
we can also create a sub header bar so
I'll just copy this and I'll paste it in
here and instead of header class I'll
just apply a sub header class and I'll
save it and now you can see that I have
another header bar below my data bar and
it is a sub header so I'll just change
the text here I'll also change the
clouds that we have here and now we have
a red sub header bar and the text says
sub header and now the content insider
and content is overlapped again so all I
have to do is now apply a class called
iron sub header and this way our
uncontained will not be overlapped
anymore okay so make sure that if you
use in our header then you have to apply
a class called has header to your iron
content and if you are using a sub
header as well then you have to apply a
class called has sub header to your iron
content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
