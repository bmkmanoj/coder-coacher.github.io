for your WordPress blog so now let's get
started with setting up our wordpress
blog so in this video we are going to
download wordpress from wordpress.org
and then proceed with installation using
wamp server so I expect that you have
already downloaded an installed wamp
server it is a pretty straightforward
process you just have to follow the
on-screen prompts and keep hitting next
until finish appears and then hit finish
okay so open wordpress.org and click on
this blue button download wordpress four
point three point one this is the latest
version of the wordpress at the time of
this recording but when you watch this
video you may have to download a later
version so just click on the button and
this will go ahead and take me to the
download page now all i have to do is
click the download button again and this
is a small zip file it's about seven MBS
so I'm just going to save this inside my
ram server folder inside the www folder
okay and i'm going to call this folder
as udemy wordpress block okay so i'm
just going to save the zip file inside
this folder this will take a little
while while this download completes
ok so the download has completed so I'm
just going to go ahead into the folder
in which I downloaded the zip file and I
am just going to extract the zip file in
this folder itself inside the wordpress
folder I have all these files and the
three folders called WP hyphen includes
WP hyphen content and of loopy hyphen
admin so I am just going to select
everything and i'm just going to extract
it right here
now we do not need this file anymore so
you can just go ahead and delete this
file if you wish so the file structure
of a wordpress blog is ready now all we
need to do is create a database for this
wordpress blog then we'll proceed with
the installation of the wordpress blog
so in the next video we'll get started
with creating the database and
installation of our wordpress blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
