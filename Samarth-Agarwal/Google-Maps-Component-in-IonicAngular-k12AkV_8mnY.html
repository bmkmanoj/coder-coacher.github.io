framework video I am some earth and in
this video we are going to learn how to
integrate Google Maps in an ionic
application there are two ways to
integrate Google Maps into an ionic
application we are going to use the
JavaScript SDK to integrate Google Maps
into our app another way is to use
Google Maps Cordova plug-in to do that
so without wasting any more time let's
just get started so the first thing I'll
do is create a new ionic application and
I'll call this application as Google
Maps ionic once this application is
created I'll open the project in Visual
Studio code and before proceeding the
first thing I'll do is install types for
Google Maps so I'll just go ahead and
type in npm install ad types slash
Google Maps this will help us later in
the video once it's installed let's head
back to the browser and have a look at
the Google Maps JavaScript SDKs
documentation in the dogs scroll down a
little bit and here you will find two
buttons the first button will help you
get an API key which you will need if
you plan on to building this application
for production if you are just testing
this you do not necessarily need the API
key so get the API key it's fairly
simple just click on it select a project
and you get the key next click on start
developing and here in this code snippet
you will find this script tag that you
need to copy into your index dot HTML
file so just copy this tag from here
come back to your index dot HTML and
paste it right above your vendor dot J's
file make sure that you put in your API
key right here also make sure that you
remove callback equal init map from this
URL because we do not have a function
called init map so if you do not remove
that from the URL you will get an error
in the browser so make sure you do that
while doing that I can also remove async
and differ save your index dot HTML file
let's just create an
component for our Google Maps let's just
call this component Google map so I'll
just type in ionic generate or G
component google map press enter and
this will generate this new component
for us so now we have a components
folder and a component start module to
TS file that we can delete for now and
in my Google map I have a Google map
tortillas file and we'll also have to
import this component into our app dot
module tortillas file so let's just go
ahead and do that real quick so I'll
just import my Google map component
right here at the top and pass it into
my declarations array as well once done
let's save this file and close it coming
back to my home page I'll remove all
this code from here and instead I'll
just put in the selector for my Google
map component which is Google - map ok
this will display my Google map
component right here so you can see that
I get the hell over text which is coming
from the Google map component let's just
remove this code from here I'll also
remove this text property from here and
I'll also clear the HTML file we'll put
in our map here let's just go ahead and
create a div here that will be
responsible for displaying our map we'll
define a template variable called map
and give it an ID of map we will use
this template variable to get reference
to this dev while loading our map while
we are at it let's just add a style to
this day of using the map selector and
set its height to hundred percent this
will make sure that our map is displayed
on full page let's say squared an
initializer map so I'll just create a
function called iron viewdidload this is
a function that is called whenever an
ionic page is loaded so it's safe to
write our code inside here so I'll just
call a function called init map inside
this hook and inside my init map
function I'll write the code to
initialize a Google map
so I'll just create a variable first
called coordinates or Co Ord s and this
will be equal to new Google dot maps not
latitude longitude
okay this function takes in two numbers
one for latitude and another one for
longitude for now I'll just pass in some
random numbers here and this gives us
some coordinates that we can use to
initialize our map next we will be
creating map options to define some
properties for our map so we'll create
an object called map options and this
will be of the type google.com app
options and we'll set it equal to a JSON
object this JSON object will contain
properties like Center which is where
our Google map will be centered and
we'll just pass in the coordinates that
we created above along with that we can
also pass in zoom I'm just going to pass
in 214 here but you can choose any
number around that along with that I'll
also pass in a map type ID which defines
what type of map this will be so we can
select any one from Google dog Maps dot
map type ID and I'm just going to select
Road map so this will be our road map
next we need to create our actual map so
I'll just create an object called map on
the top and here I'll initialize it
using this dot map equals new Google dot
maps dot map and this function takes
reference to the div element that we
want to use to display our map so we
need to get a reference to the
development that we've created in a
Google map toward HTML file using that
template variable that we created
remember so we can use view child for
that so I'll just type in add new child
and then pass in the name of the
template variable which is map this will
give us a reference to the div element
which will store inside map element
we'll have to import view child and then
we can pass in this dot map element dot
native element to get the reference to
the actual div element
the second parameter to this function
will be map options that we have created
above so this will initialize our Google
map let's see if it works we are not
getting any errors but our map is also
not working so let's have a look at what
we have done wrong okay so I have used
ion viewdidload inside a component which
will not work
I am viewdidload works only inside pages
since this is a component we will have
to use ng on in it to make it work
ng on in it is also fired when the
component is ready and is completely
initialized so now we save and head back
to the browser you can see that the map
loads up great we made some progress
let's try changing zoom a little bit and
I'll also remove padding from my home
component and I'll also change the title
to Google Maps ionic save everything
come back to the application and you can
see that the zoom has been reduced a
little bit and I think that we should
change the location as well so that we
can see what actually our map looks like
so I just change the location to 25 and
80 okay
so we are now getting some land to look
at
great so our map is now working let's
have a look at how you can add a marker
to this map so to add a marker all you
have to do is create a new object called
marker and this will be of the type
Google Docs caught marker and we'll set
it equal to new Google Maps marker and
the constructor will take in a few
parameters the required parameter is map
which takes in the reference to the map
that you want to display this marker on
so I'll just pass in this dot map and
the second parameter is going to be the
position on which this marker will be
added so I'll just pass in coordinates
here as well so our map will be centered
on coordinates and our marker will also
be added to the center of the map so now
you can see that we get the map and we
also have a marker right there in the
center of the map so this is how you can
use Google Maps in your ionic
applications this is a very basic ionic
component that we have created for
adding Google Maps into your ionic
application if you like this video let
me know and I'll add more features to
this component we will make it more
flexible and more reusable for everyone
all the code for this video can be found
on github the link is right here let me
know if you like this video in the
comments and as always thanks for
