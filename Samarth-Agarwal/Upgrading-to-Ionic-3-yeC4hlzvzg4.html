the ionic school in this video I am
going to introduce you to ionic three
and I am going to tell you how you can
upgrade your ionic two applications to
ionic reacts now one thing that I would
like to mention very clearly here is
that ionic 3 apps are very similar to
ionic 2 apps ionic 3 and ionic 2 are
different versions of the same framework
while ionic 1 was a completely different
framework
therefore the up gradation from ionic 1
to 102 was a painful process while the
predation from ionic 2 to ionic 3 will
be an easy one so how can you upgrade an
ionic 2 app to an ionic 3 app and also
what are the differences between ionic 2
and ionic 3 first off there are not many
differences in ionic 2 and ionic 3 ionic
3 has just some major updates and
therefore the version has been changed
from ionic 2 to ionic three ionic has
opted for semantic version numbering
which means that all the major updates
will see an increased version number for
example if any minor update comes up
tomorrow then the version will be called
as three point zero point one or three
point one point zero while if ionic
decides to release a major update it
would be our next four so with that
doubt cleared I have this app highcharts
which I have created in my last video
and in this app we had used ionic two
now I am going to upgrade this app to
use ionic 3 to be very clear all the
apps that you create from now on will be
ionic 3 apps if you have any old app
like this one you can upgrade that app
using the process that I am about to
explain so let's open the package dot
JSON file right here
and here you can see all the
dependencies that are specified you can
see that the version of angular used in
this project is 2.4 and the latest
version of angular which has been
released recently and used in ionic 3 is
angular 4 angular has also opted for
semantic versioning which means that all
the major updates will see a newer
version
so now that we have decided to upgrade
this application to ionic 3 we will have
to go to I onyx documentation so let's
open the ionic page on github and here I
have opened the changelog dot MD file
this file specifies all the steps that
we need to take to update our
applications from ionic 2 to ionic 3 so
I'll just copy these dependencies and F
dependencies
I'll just come back to my packaged
adjacent files I will get rid of these
dependencies and dev dependencies based
in the text that I have copied from
github and I'll save it now I can delete
this node modules folder and once the
node modules folder has been deleted
I'll do an NPM install to download the
newer versions of all the modules as you
can see here we are using the ionic
version 3.0 point 0 okay now that the
folder has been deleted I will do an NPM
install hit enter this will create the
node modules folder again but this time
we will have newer versions of all the
modules we will have angular 4 and ionic
3 so while that installs one major
change that we'll have to do is go to
the app folder and open app got module 2
ts file and here I'll have to import the
browser module so I'll do that I'll pass
the browser module in my imports array
ok you have to do that and if you are
using HTTP module in your application
then you also have to import the HTTP
module okay and you have to pass in the
HTTP module as well in your import sorry
okay let's just wait for the npm install
to complete and then we will run our
application in the browser
okay so NPM install has finished now and
we have the latest versions of all the
node modules so now it's time to do an
ionic serve
hit enter okay so I am getting this
error because in this app I have used
the angular 2 high charts module which
is not installed so I will just do that
right away this is a small module so it
will install in just a few seconds and
it's done and now our application should
be working so I just make a small change
in the application so that it recompiles
come to the browser now
you can see that my application were
as it was working before also they have
completely changed the grid and
typography so if you are using grid
check out their documentation to see
what they have changed in the grid and
there are a few minor changes as well
that you can check out in the
documentation so this was pretty much it
this is not a hard process migrating
from ionic 2 to ionic 1 it is a simple
process all you have to do is just use
the latest versions of all these modules
you have to pass in browser module in
your imports and you have to pass in
HTTP module in your imports besides this
they have also introduced lazy loading
which I'll cover in another video as it
is a slightly complicated topic so see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
