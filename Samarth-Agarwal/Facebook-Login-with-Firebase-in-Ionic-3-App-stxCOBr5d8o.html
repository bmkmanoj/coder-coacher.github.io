channel on ionic before starting I would
like to thank you all because we have
just reached 500 subscribers I want to
thank you all for supporting my channel
and now let me tell you what we are
going to do in this video so in this
video we are going to implement facebook
login using firebase in our ion ik
application so before we start there are
two ways that we can implement facebook
login using firebase in are ionic
applications the first one is the web
browser way and the second one is the
native way in the web browser login what
happens when you try to log into your
application using Facebook and in my
browser opens in your application and
then the user enters their information
on the login page and then hit login
and once the login is successful the
control is brought back to your
application now this is not the best way
to do it but this is one of the two ways
that you can implement Facebook log in
another way is the native way in which
whenever the user tries to log in using
Facebook the native Facebook mobile
application is used for logging the user
in to your application so if a user is
currently logged in in the Facebook
application in that phone on which you
are trying to run your application the
same user will be logged in to your
application so in this video we are
going to try out the first way which is
the web browser-based login and most
probably in the next video I'll cover
the native login so here I am creating a
new ionic application which is called
firebase Facebook and before we get
started with this ionic application we
need to setup two things the first thing
that we need to setup is a Google
firebase project and the second thing
that we need to set up is an application
on Facebook so head over to console dot
firebase tour google.com and log in with
your Google account and then click on
add project when you click on that
project you will have to enter the name
of your project
and hit create project doesn't create a
new fire base project in your developers
console okay so our new project called
facebook login has been created in a
firebase console so here we need to do a
few things the first thing that we'll
have to do is head over to
authentication click on sign-in method
and here you will have to enable
Facebook an enabling Facebook it
requires you to enter an app ID and an
app secret which we'll get when you
create a new application on Facebook so
let's do that so head over to developers
dot facebook.com and to access this page
you'll have to login with your Facebook
account click on this green button which
will allow you to create a new Facebook
application once you have done that you
should see a page like this click on
settings and on this page you'll see
your app ID and your app secret your app
secret will be visible only to you
when you enter your password so copy
your app ID and your app secret from
here and come back to your ad firebase
console and enter the app ID right here
and your app secret right here so I'll
just do that
and now you can see that the Facebook
sign-in provider is enabled okay now
from here you'll have to copy this
authorize domain to come back to
Facebook and paste this right here in
our domain section so I'm just going to
paste it here okay and also type in the
same thing right here in the website URL
if you do not see this box with the
website title right here make sure that
you click on add platform and select
website from here you will also have to
select Android to add the Android
platform and here you will have to type
in the package name of your ionic
application which is generally IO dot IO
neck dot starter you can find yours in
the configure Dexamyl file in your ionic
project so I think that we have created
our project and now I'll just open this
project in Visual Studio code so our
project is now open in Visual Studio
code I'll head over to config for
example and you can see that the
identifier of this project is IO dot IO
n ik dot starter I'll just copy this
come back here and paste it right here
okay this is all the configuration that
you require on Facebook developers
website save all the changes and now you
can close this tab now we will get
started with working in our ionic
application so let's open visual studio
code and the first thing that I'll do is
install the firebase module so I'll just
type in npm install firebase - - save
this will install the firebase module in
our ionic application to initialize this
firebase module in our application we
will require some configuration which we
can get from the firebase console so
I'll just head over to the app folder
and open app got module dot ts file and
right here I'll just import the firebase
module so I'll just type in import
firebase from firebase because the
firebase module has installed
successfully I can import this module
and from this module I want to import
the firebase class ok now I will write
the code to initialize this firebase
class so that it gets connected to my
firebase project
so I'll just type in firebase dot
initialize app and inside this function
I will have to provide options which I
can get from the firebase console so
head over to overview and here you can
click on add firebase to your web app
and you can see that you get your config
right here so make sure that you copy
this JSON object from here come back to
your Visual Studio code and paste a JSON
object right inside your initialized app
function like this okay so this
initializer app function takes in a JSON
object with all this configuration about
that application save it now you can
close your app dot module dot ES file
now in order to proceed you'll have to
install a few plugins into your ionic
application so let's just do that real
quick so I'll just open this link which
is firebase google.com slash Docs slash
auth slash web slash Cordova and on this
page you'll find all the instructions
that you need to follow in order to
implement authentication with firebase
so here you can see we have the list of
five plugins that we need to install we
will only be installing the first four
because the fifth one is required by iOS
and we are not going to build this
application for iOS as of now so I'll
just install all these plugins one by
one
okay so now we are done with the
installation of all our plugins now I
will have to copy this configuration
from here and I will just go back to my
application and open conflict what XML
and right here after the author tab I
just pasted in this configuration I'll
have to replace two things the first one
is the dynamic link domain and the
second one is the odds domain I can get
both these things from the firebase
console so I'll just go back to my
firebase console and I will head over to
the authentication section click on
sign-in method and at the bottom you see
this URL which is your auth domain so
just copy this come back to your
application and replace auth domains
with your actual earth domain save your
application now we need to get the
dynamic link domain so head over to
firebase console again click on dynamic
links right here and it requires you to
add an application first so just click
on Android here you will have to add the
package name of your Android application
which is IO dot IO neck dot
starter and click on register app once
this is done you can close this and now
you can click on get started now if you
come back on this page you will find
this URL right here which is your
dynamic link domain so just copy this
open visual studio code and replace
dynamic link domain text with your
actual dynamic link domain save it and
now the configuration of your ionic
application has completed now we can get
started with the code so now let's head
over to our pages and on the home page I
am going to create a button which will
be responsible for logging the user in
so I'll just create a button okay now I
will create this function in my home dot
ES file ok now we need to write the code
to implement facebook login so let's
import firebase first the first thing
that I'll have to do is create a
Facebook authentication provider which I
can then use to sign-in
so there are a number of providers that
you can use out of the box with firebase
there is the Google auth provider the
Facebook or provider the email password
or provider but in this video we are
going to use the Facebook auth provider
only this way we have created a Facebook
earth provider and it is stored inside a
local variable called provider now on
this I can call the function sign invade
the redirect this takes in this provider
as a parameter so I'll just pass in that
ok and I can use the promise on this
function now what this function will do
it will open the inner browser in your
application and then open the facebook
login page where the user can enter
their credentials to login once they are
successfully logged in the control will
be brought back to your application and
you need to get the data when the
control gets back to your application to
get the data you will have to use
another function which is called get
redirect result which will get you the
result which is generated as a result of
users login and here inside this promise
you will get the result ok this result
object actually contains the information
about the user that is currently logged
in so as of now what I am going to do is
just alert everything that I get and I
will stringify
it using json dot stringify and I'll
just alert it on this function I can
also use the cash function which will be
called in case we run into an error and
I am just alerting the error as a string
as well so that is it now let's try and
run this in an emulator so I'll just
type in ionic cordova run Android hit
enter and this will run the application
in an emulator
okay so we are running into this error
and I have noticed that firebase modual
causes this error so in order to get
around this error you will have to type
in NPM install promise - polyfill
- - save exact so this will install the
promised polyfill node module which is I
think required for firebase to work so
this is a very small module and will
install in like five seconds and once
it's done we will again try to run our
application on the emulator and I think
it should succeed this time and should
deploy the application on an Android
emulator so it has succeeded and now
it's building the application for
Android and I should see my emulator
launching in just a few moments there we
go the emulator launches up and now
let's wait for the emulator to boot up
and then our application will be
launched in the emulator and there is
our application with the log in with
Facebook button I'm just going to click
on this button and you can see that an
inner browser has been lying and in just
a few moments I will see the facebook
login page now because I have tried this
before I am already logged in to
Facebook in the inner browser so I am
straightaway logged in and I am just
getting an option to allow this
application the ionic school application
on Facebook to receive my email address
so I am just going to click on continue
if you are running this for the very
first time you should see the facebook
login screen and then once you log in
you will be brought to this screen that
I am seeing right here I'll just click
continue and this will bring me back to
my application and will display the
login information in an alert and here
you can see that I have got a lot of
information as a result of facebook
login and this information particularly
includes the user object which contains
my UID the display name the photo URL
and my email address as well
apart from that I have also got a token
which I can use to make further requests
to the Facebook Graph API to grab more
data about this user from Facebook so
now that we have got this data we can
use this user object and we can also use
this access token that we have received
right here to get more information about
this view or to perform actions on
behalf of the user on Facebook so this
completes our facebook login and if you
head back to firebase console head over
to authentication in the users tab you
should see a new user created in your
project so this completes our facebook
login using the web browser method most
probably in the next video I will cover
the native method using the Facebook
application which I think is a better
way for developers as well and for users
as well so I would like to thank you all
once again for supporting my channel and
and I'm really happy about computing 500
subscribers and I'm looking to grow
further
so thank you again and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
