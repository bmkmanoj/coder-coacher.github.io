channel I am summers of the wall and in
this video I am going to teach you how
to implement facebook login in your
ionic applications using the native
method so in the last video we have
already implemented facebook login but
we did that using the web browser method
so if you haven't checked out that video
there is a link in the description or
you can click on the card on this video
before proceeding with this video make
sure that you have watched that video
and then you can come back and watch
this video in this video we are going to
remove the web browser log in from Iran
ik application and implement the native
method so what happens in the native
method is that instead of opening of web
browser in our ionic application the
native Facebook app which is installed
on the user's device is used to
authenticate our ionic application to
allow the user to be logged in so as
soon as you click on the login button
the native Facebook app opens up and if
a user is currently logged into the
native Facebook app the same user
requires to grant access to our ionic
application and once the grant access
the same user is logged in to our ionic
application so let's see how we can
implement that the first thing that
we'll need to do is install the Cordova
Facebook plugins and for that you can
head over to ionic framework calm slash
talk slash native slash Facebook here
you can find all the information that
you need to install this plugin so let's
scroll a little bit and here you can
find this command that you can use to
install the Cordova plug-in into your
ionic application so I have here the old
ionic application which we created in
the last video opened up and the first
thing that I'm going to do is just
comment out all this code that we have
written in the last video I'll save that
and now I'll open up a console and here
I'll just paste in this command that I
have just copied from the ionic native
website and
here I need to replace the app ID and
the app name so the name of my
application is the ionic school and for
the app ID I will head over to
developers for facebook.com and this is
the app ID of my application so just
copy that come back to my control right
here in Visual Studio code paste it and
just hit enter so this will install the
Cordova plugin that we require the next
step would be to install the ionic
native wrapper for this plugin so just
copy this next command from here come
back to the console so I'll just paste
that command right here and hit enter
and it's done so now we are ready to
integrate the Cordova plugin for
Facebook in para ionic application we
have installed that and now I'll just
head over to my hub dot module to TS
file and import that right away I'll
save it and now we are ready to use this
plug-in in our home dot d s file
I'll just import that right away in our
Humber th as well and I will just pass
it into my constructor as well okay so
now I can use this local Facebook
variable so let's just do that real
quick so I'll just start by using the
Facebook login method I'll just type in
this Facebook not login and this login
function takes in an array of string and
these arrays are basically the
permissions that our application
requires you can read more about
permissions on the clink for now I'm
just going to use the email permission
that I'll need and once I'm logged in I
will execute this promise function and
in this promise function
I'll get the response and this contains
the information of the user that has
currently logged in now this login
response contains an authentication
token that we can use to register the
logged in user as a firebase user as
well you do not need to do this
necessarily but if you want to keep
track of all your users on firebase then
you need to execute this step by now
using this line of code our user is
logged into Facebook and
now we will use this login information
from Facebook that we have got in blog
and response to authenticate the user
into our firebase app as well so this
will create a user on firebase so we can
use the firebase dot ODS function and on
that we can call the function sign in
with credential and this function takes
in a parameter which should be a valid
firebase credential so let's just call
this variable as credential we will
create this object in just a moment and
I'm just going to call the promise on
this let's say that we hit the parameter
called info inside of this and for now
I'm just going to alert that signified
info okay
so once the user is logged into Facebook
a user for the logged in user
will be created on firebase as well and
once the user has been logged in
successfully on firebase whatever we get
as the response from firebase will be
displayed to the user in an alert so we
are getting this error because the
credential variable or objects is not
defined as of now so let's just create
that and this credential as I told you
is a valid firebase credential so we
will use the firebase dot or dot is the
provider dot credential inside this we
need to pass in the access token that we
get inside this login response object
which we are getting as a result of
successful facebook login so I'll just
use login response dot or response dot
access token so this creates a
credential object which we can use with
the sign in with credential function I
think we are good to go now let's try
and run this on the emulator so I just
type in ionic cordova run android hit
enter so we have our application running
on an emulator and I am just going to
tap on this log in with Facebook button
and you can see that this time the web
browser does not open up but instead we
get a pop-up in our app and if you have
not granted access to the application
before then you will be required to
grant access since I have already
granted access to the ionic school app
I'm just gonna hit OK and you can see
that I get the same alert that we get in
the previous video which is the result
of successful firebase logins okay so
this contains all the information which
is returned to us from firebase which
contains the UID which is the unique ID
of every user on firebase
it also contains display information for
the URL and some other information it
also contains the access token which you
can further use to get more information
about the user from Facebook using the
graph API so now that we have all this
information we can assume that a user is
logged in to our application using
Facebook next head ok here and let's
head over to firebase console and see if
a user is showing up in the
authentication section so just click on
authentication and you can see that the
same user is showing up but this time
the signed in has been updated the June
14 which is today ok so this is how we
implement the native Facebook login on
the emulator but if not have the native
Facebook app that is why record that pop
up when you test on a real Android
device which has the Facebook app
installed you will get something like
this on your screen and you will have to
grant access to the ionic school
application so that the user can be
logged in to your ionic application so
desolate for this video let me know if
you liked this video and please leave a
comment if equip an issue using
different human
nation of facebook login into your ionic
application thank for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
