per your WordPress blog so now that we
know the basic structure of our
application it's time to modify that
structure according to our needs you can
see that we have an app dot JS file and
this abdur JS file contains the angular
module that we'll use in our application
angular module is all the JavaScript
code in context of angular and it is
initialized as soon as our application
is loaded so you can see that in index
dot HTML we have a reference to app dot
JS file so this means that whenever our
index.html file will be loaded a request
to AB dot J's will also be made and this
code will be executed well this code
pretty much does nothing except for
initializing our angular module called
starter and the dependency ionic which
is a library that we can see right here
is injected in our starter module so we
can use it
so that's it that's what our app DOJ's
filed us so far but what we'll do we'll
use our app door just to configure our
application and we'll implement the
actual logic of our application in a
separate file we create controllers in
angularjs to implement logic of each
screen okay so for example we have a
home screen and we have another screen
that shows posts from a particular
category say fashion
so both the screens will have different
logic so we'll have to implement two
different controllers for both the
screens now we have the option of
implementing that code as controllers in
ER Abdul J's file itself but it is a
good practice that we create our
controllers in separate file so we'll
create another file inside our J's
folder and we'll call this as
controllers dot J's okay and we'll save
the file so we are done with saving the
file the next thing we need to do is add
a reference to our controller's file
right here so we have added a reference
right here as well okay now if we try
and run our application you can see the
application just works as it was working
before so let's try and implement some
basic logic so that we get to know how
controllers work in angular you can see
that on the body tag we have an
attribute ng app and this is read equal
to starter this means that all of the
body tag is in context of our starter
module which is an angular module
okay so ng app actually defines the name
of the module that we'll use in our
Abdur J's file so this name right here
should be equal to this name right here
next we need to define a controller that
will control the logic for this
particular tag so I'll specify the name
of the controller as temp controller
because this is a temporary controller
will be deleting it so we have defined a
controller and we use the ng-controller
attribute to define the name of the
controller so I have created a
controller I have named it M controller
and the whole of the ion pane is in
context of this controller whatever the
logic we want to implement within this
ion pane will be implemented in them
controller obviously we can use nested
controllers but to keep our application
simple and easy to understand we are
just gonna use this one controller for
now so let's save it let's go back to a
controller or JS file and implement this
controller to show a simple alert dialog
so that we know that our controllers are
working so we'll just go to our
controller store JS file and write in
some code here so that we know that our
controllers are working so in order to
create a new controller we type in
angular dart module then we type in the
name of our module which is starter ok
this will remain throughout our
application the same so we'll use
angular dot module starter everywhere we
want to create a controller and then we
can use the dot controller method to
create a new controller it will take two
parameters the first parameter is the
name of a controller which is menu ctrl
and the second parameter is actually the
function ok
and right here I'm just gonna type in an
alert and it will say hello okay so this
way we'll just get to know that our
controllers are working we'll just make
sure that we have added our friends to
our controllers for J's file right here
and also that we have added a reference
to our controller right here okay now if
we go back to our application if you
check the browsers console you can see
all the errors right here
okay so it tells me that I'm controlling
not a function god undefined so which
means that M controller is not a
function okay so we have named our
controller as temp controller while we
have named a controller in our
controller dot JS file as menu
controller so we'll just change it save
it as temp controller and now if we
refresh our application we can see the
hell out okay so this means that the
controllers are working fine we have
successfully created a controller dot
J's file and included that in our
project we get to see two alerts because
both these clients are treated as
individual clients okay so whatever code
we'll type will be executed twice within
this browser window that is why we saw
two alerts so this is it this is how we
create controllers will use controllers
heavily throughout the application in
the next video we'll create some
template files and we'll also create
States and implement routing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
