apps for a wordpress blog I am Samantha
wall and I will be your instructor for
this course in this course we will
create a wordpress application for
Android and iOS devices if you are new
to ionic or if you are new to HTML and
CSS applications I suggest that you take
my beginner level course create Android
and iOS apps using HTML CSS and
JavaScript before taking this course in
this course we will create an amazing
mobile application that will allow the
users of your application to read your
blog on their Android and iOS devices so
basically we will be combining the two
most powerful platforms ionic and
WordPress and create an amazing
application that will work on both
Android and iOS
in this course we'll start by learning
the basics of restful api s and then we
will set up our wordpress blog and
enable the restful api on a wordpress
blog we'll also learn what json is and
then we'll also enable json 1 / + block
we'll then start developing our
application using ionic and angularjs
and since we will be creating a
multi-page application will require a
lot of states and controllers all this
will be done using angularjs we'll also
learn how we can navigate within States
keeping our application consistent at
all times we'll also learn about lot of
advanced ionic components finally we
will package our application ready to be
deployed on Android in order to proceed
with this course there are no particular
requirements but basic knowledge of HTML
CSS and JavaScript is a plus if you are
not familiar with ionic commands don't
worry we'll get introduced to this in
this course but if you have basic
knowledge of ionic commands you'll get
through faster if you have basic
knowledge of angularjs that would be a
plus but it's not required finally
you'll need to be familiar with mobile
devices or basically smartphones that
have Android or iOS and have
touchscreens so what are we waiting for
let's get started
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
