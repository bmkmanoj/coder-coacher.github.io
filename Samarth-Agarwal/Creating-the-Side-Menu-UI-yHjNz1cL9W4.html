per your WordPress blog so now it's time
to get started with the UI of our menu
so head over to menu dot HTML and in
menu dot HTML we'll start by adding some
HTML ionic code
so what we are trying to do well we are
trying to create something like this so
we have our menu on the left and inside
menu dot HTML we will try and replicate
this menu on the side okay so how do we
create this kind of menu in ionic well
it's fairly easy so if you scroll down
you will find the perfect documentation
that we are looking for okay so it tells
me how we can use this ionic code in our
application so you can see that we have
some HTML code right here so the root
tag is on side menus okay and it closes
right here and inside iron side menus I
have an iron side menu on the left and I
have an iron side menu on the right in
between these two left and right menus I
have the menu content okay so this is
basically the main content that will
appear on the screen while these two are
the menus on the sides so in menu dot
HTML we'll be creating a left menu okay
and in menu content dot HTML we'll be
creating the main content okay so let's
get started let's go over to menu dot
HTML and start typing so the first line
of code that I will use is iron side
menus okay and I'll just close it right
here sometimes you may forget to place
the closing tags so it's a good practice
to place the closing tag as soon as you
open any tag and inside iron side menus
we'll start by creating our iron side
menu on the Left okay so the tag is iron
side menu and we have to provide an
attribute of side which is left
following the good practices again we'll
just close the tag right here and inside
this iron side menu what I want I want a
header on the top so I just put an iron
header bar
okay and I will give it a class of bar
stable so this will give me a nice bar
on the top and I'll just close the tag
again so the tag has been closed and
within this tag I just put an h1 tag and
it will have a class of title so the
text will be widen color because I have
assigned it a class of title and it will
contain the text categories okay and
next I'll just close the h1 tag perfect
now after the header bar will be our
main content of the menu so what will be
our main content so let's put an iron
content first and let's close the iron
content as well and inside this iron
content let's just write something for
now so that we can just go ahead and
test out that application let's save the
code this far and head over to your
console or your command prompt or the
git bash shell if you are just like me
and head over to the correct directory
so I'll just head over to udemy and
inside udemy I have WordPress ionic and
I'll just do an ionic serve - the shell
and wait for my browser to pop up along
with the application the greatest thing
about ionic is the documentation so if
you are stuck somewhere just go ahead -
100 good IO or ionic framework comm and
you will pretty much find everything you
are looking for so here we are you can
see that I have added on the top and I
have a text of some of the gravel below
it but this is not in the menu so let us
go ahead and make the respective changes
that we are looking for
so before we start our iron side menu
tag we'll add a few more tags and that
will be iron side menu content
we'll just also close this tab and
inside this output and iron nav view so
we are putting an iron nephew here just
like we did in index dot HTML because we
want to load custom templates inside
this tab and let's head back to our
application and check it out
so you can see that now I can swipe left
and swipe right you can see that our
content is pretty much blank we do not
have any content right here if I swipe
to the right you can see that my menu
shows up okay
now let's head back to the application
and create then content
so what I want in the content well
content is the list of categories that
will be displaying in our side menu so
how do we create a list in ionic well
that is pretty simple we'll just have to
use the ion list tag okay and close on
lipstick as well and in ion list we'll
have an iron item and this iron item
will be repeated for each of the item in
the list so we'll use angular for that
and the menu clothes attribute tells us
that whenever somebody clicks on any
item in the menu the menu should close
okay and next we'll have an NG repeat
I'll just explain this in a while so
let's leave it here we'll have an H chef
we leave that for now as well and we'll
just close this let's close eye on item
as well and inside the eye on item we
are going to have a span okay and this
span will contain the name of the
category or you can just type in
category name will change that later on
but for now we'll just use the filler
content so this will be a span
and along with this pan will show the
number of posts in that particular
category on the right side so we'll just
type in span so we'll use another span
and the class will be badge so this is
an ionic class we just have to use it
and I want a red badge so I use badge a
certif okay I'll close the tag and I'll
just type in a random number here and
I'll close the span okay so this is
pretty much it let's save this and head
back to our application and see how it
is looking okay so nothing is updating
as of now so this is because we have
used a ninja repeat let's just remove
the ng repeat okay and now let's save
our application and head back and you
can see that now we have a category name
on the left and a badge with a random
number 12 on the right so this is how we
will create our menu we'll just repeat
the items just like this and create a
single column with a number of rows in
this menu we'll use an NG repeat to get
the content and create a new iron item
for each of the category so how are we
going to do it we'll see in the next
