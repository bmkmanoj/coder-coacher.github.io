vous commerce so far we have looked on a
number of ionic components and all those
components that we have seen so far are
the CSS components which means that they
were completely built using just HTML
and CSS now we are going to take a step
further and from this video onwards we
will have a look at some of the
JavaScript components that ionic offers
but before that we need to get familiar
with the ionic structure so you know
that we have this index.html file and
this is the file that we have been
working for now and we also have this
J's folder right here and inside this
J's folder I have an app dot JS file if
you open this file you'll see that there
is a small fragment of code already
inside of this file so what does this
code actually do let's have a look at
the first line of code at line number
six we have the code that C is angular
dot module starter and then within
square brackets we have passed in ionic
well this actually creates a new angular
module with the name starter and ionic
is a dependency which means that we are
creating a new angular application and
this angular application called starter
depends on another angular application
called ionic that's right whenever we
create an ionic application we have to
make use of angularjs to make it work
all the logic that we want to implement
in ionic applications is implemented
with the help of angular code let's
leave this dot run method for now we
will have a look at what this does in
the later lecture but for now let's go
back to our index for HTML file and on
the body tag I have an attribute called
ng-app and it has a value called starter
now this starter is the same value that
our Abdur JS file has as the name of the
module whatever will be the name of the
module the same will be reflected here
in the ng app directive this way our
index for HTML file will be bound to the
module that we have written in a raptor
GS file let's make this work so what I'm
going to do I'll just remove all this
code so I'll just remove this form tag
from here that we created in the last
video and I have removed that and right
here I just want to display a message
but before that we have to create a
controller a controller is a link
between our view which is our HTML file
and the data that is stored somewhere
now the data may be stored somewhere on
a remote database or inside our bure JS
file itself but we need a controller to
make these things work together so let's
create a controller first and in order
to create a controller you have to use
the directive ng controller and then
give this controller a name so let us
call this main controller the naming
convention is that you type in the name
and then the letters ctrl both in camel
case so this reflects that this is a
controller now all I need to do is
create this controller in my Abdur JS
file and then this ion pain tag can be
controlled from within that main
controller that will write in our
address file remember that since we have
defined ng-controller
on our ion pain tag all the content
inside ion pain and only the content
inside and pain is accessible and menu
palatable why I our controller
anything outside of that controller is
beyond the scope of the controller
so let's go to our bridges file and
create the controller and in order to
create the controller you have to use
the dot controller method
and it is a function which takes two
parameters the first parameter is the
name of the controller and second
parameter is a function which is the
controller itself so whatever we'll type
inside this controller will be executed
whenever our index.html file is loaded
or whenever our ion pane is loaded
so what I'm going to do I am just going
to display a message in my index.html
file if you want to pass on some
information from our controller to our
HTML file or to our view then we have to
use a service which is called scope so
we can use scope and we can type in
anything here let's type in message and
let us say hello word what this does
this creates a variable called message
which we can access in an indexed or
HTML file and we use the scope service
that angular provides and the main
function of scope service is that it
allows us to access methods and
properties that we create in our
controller in our view and since we want
to use this service in our controller we
have to inject it as a dependency and to
inject it we have to pass this as a
parameter in our controller function so
this is it this is all we have to do for
now and now we can go back to our index
load HTML file then I will have to type
in message
but make sure that you surround message
with a pair of curly braces this makes
sure that it is understood by angular
otherwise message would be just
interpreted as another HTML text
let's save it now you can see that the
hello word message is displayed in my
ion content okay we can use HTML tags
with it it just works perfect and now
the message will be displayed as h1
heading okay so the scope service allows
us to pass information from our model
which is hello word right now to our
view which is indexed or HTML right now
we also have a number of other services
that we will learn and use throughout
the course but for now scope is the one
that we want to start with let's create
an array and display that array in our
view okay so I'll just create a new
array called users you can name it
whatever you want and this will be a
JSON array and each of the JSON object
will have a name and I will type in a
few names here
you
okay so I have created an array with
four objects and each of the object is a
json object which just contains a name
key with the value of different names
okay so we have the name and we have the
value of the name and this happens for
each of the four objects we can have as
many objects as we want now since we
have created this users array on our
scope we can use this users array in our
view in our index road HTML file so let
us see how to do that first let us just
try to type in users like this and see
what happens see you get to see all the
data that we have created in our Abdur
JS file but this is not how we want it
in a real world application we just want
to display the values which are the
names in this case for this purpose we
have an NG repeat directive that angular
has built into it and it helps a lot
when you have arrays to handle
okay so how do we use ng-repeat let me
just show you so we will just create a
list okay so this is just an unordered
list and we will have list items inside
this unordered list now I just want to
display a list item for each of the
names so I will use an NG repeat
directive on our li tag and our ng
repeat directive will have a value now
if you come from a c-sharp background
you might be familiar with the for each
loop
what for each loop does it creates a
temporary instance of one of the indexes
of the array so the name of our array is
users and I just want to take one at a
time okay I can use user which is a
temporary instance of one of the users
this allows us to use the user object
inside the Li tag so now I can just type
in user here and the user object will be
accessible inside the Li tag okay since
we have four users for each iteration of
ng repeat we will have a different user
let's see how it works out okay so now
you can see that I have a list and each
item is displayed in a new line but
still we get to see the name key which
we do not want so let's just type in dot
name here this way we will just have the
name of the user object
and now you can see that I only get to
see the names so this is pretty cool
right I can also create more properties
let's just type in city
now I will go back to my index.html file
and I will put a dash and now I can also
display the city along with the name all
I have to do is use user dot CT within
double curly braces and that said now I
get to see the city of each of the users
along with their name we will be
creating a lot of controllers throughout
the course and this was our first
controller and ng-repeat has a number of
other options as well that we'll see
later in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
