per your WordPress blog so now that we
have created our ionic blank starter app
which is pretty much blank let's see if
what we have actually got so you have
seen already that we have a folder
called WordPress ionic which contains
some files and folders and it also
contains a public folder called www
which actually contains the HTML files
of our application so let's open this
folder in sublime text and see what we
have caught so here we are inside of
sublime text and I have opened the
WordPress ionic folder in sublime text
inside their www folder I have a CSS
folder which contains a blank CSS file I
have an image folder which only contains
an ionic dot PNG file I have a
JavaScript folder which contains an app
dot JS file a library folder which
contains the libraries as of now it
contains only ionic and I have an index
dot HTML file so index dot HTML file is
the most important file right here you
can consider index dot HTML as the home
screen of your mobile application so
whenever you launch your mobile
application the first screen that you
see is actually the index for HTML
you can see that inside a browser we
have the text ionic blank started right
here okay and right here I have the
ionic blank starter text so I am going
to change this and see what happens so
I'm going to change it to WordPress
ionic and I'm going to save it and now
if I go back to our browser you can see
that the text has changed so we can see
the changes that we made to the code in
real time in our browser this is made
possible with the library load feature
of ionic remember that we use the
command ionic serve - - shell while
executing our application and - - shell
is a flag which enables live reload
feature so you can track the changes in
real time in your browser as you make
them in the code now head back to our
application in sublime text and you can
see that we have an app dot JS file this
is the most important file that will
contain most of the logic of our
application will write JavaScript code
throughout this application in the next
video we'll create some more files and
folders and then we'll get started with
the coding process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
