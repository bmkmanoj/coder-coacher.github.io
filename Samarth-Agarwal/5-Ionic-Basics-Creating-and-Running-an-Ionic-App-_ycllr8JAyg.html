WooCommerce in this video we are going
to create our first ionic application so
I have created this folder inside my C
Drive called projects and we will create
our annika plication inside this
projects folder we will use this
projects folder throughout the course so
now that we have installed ionic in
Cordova we can use ionic commands in our
git bash or in our command prompt so
let's just do that
so here we have our git bash you can use
the command prompt and you can see that
I am inside the projects folder in my C
Drive since we have installed ionic in
Cordova we can now use ionic commands to
create ionic applications let's see how
to do that all you have to do is type in
ionic start and then the name of the
application that you want to create
since this is our first app let's just
name the app first app and then you can
optionally provide the name of a
template that you want to use we will
talk about templates later in this
lecture but for now let's just use the
blank template this will help us create
a pretty much blank application with the
name first app hit enter and as this
finishes you will notice that a new
folder called first app will be created
inside the projects folder this might
take a while depending upon the speed of
your internet connection
and once this is done we will run the
application in the browser we will also
see how we can run this application in
an android emulator okay
so a first half folder has been created
okay so the creation of an ionic
application has completed successfully
now let's try and run this app in a
browser all we have to do is change the
current IP to a project directory which
is first app and now we can type in
ionic serve
this will open the app in your browser
and you can see that the app is opened
in the browser okay this is a pretty
much blank application it just has a
header on the top that says ionic blank
starter but this does not actually feel
like a mobile application so how do we
run this inside a browser and make sure
that it feels like a mobile application
so what we can do we can press ctrl C to
stop the server and now we can type in
ionic serve but this time we will use a
flag called dash dash L this will enable
the lab mode the lab mode allows you to
view your application as it would look
like on an android n iOS device this is
a really cool way to test your
applications on the left you see an iOS
emulator and on the right you see an
android emulator these two emulators
have their own limitations that we'll
discuss later in the course but for
basic debugging and testing your
application this is fine and for the
most part of this course we'll be using
this way of debugging our applications
so now you know how to create basic
ionic applications but what about the
templates now if you go to ionic
documentation you see that ionic
supports three types of templates the
first one is the tabs which is the
default template that is used when no
template is specified while creating a
new application there is a side menu
template that we'll be using to create
our vocalist application and then there
is a blank template that we have just
used now let's create another
application with the side menu template
and see what's the difference so I'll
just get out of this directory and I
will type in ionic start since this is a
second app I will type in second app and
this time I'll use the side menu
template hit enter and this time ionic
will create another folder in my
projects folder and we'll create an app
based on side menu template
okay so a new folder has been created we
will have a look at the contents of the
folder in the next lecture it's done now
let's just change the current directory
to our application directory
and let's just real quick type in ionic
so - - L and this will launch our
application in the browser in the lab
mode
and we have a basic ionic application
already set up for us and this
application has a side menu that we can
open
by dragging this menu like this and it
has something already created for us
like the search page the Browse page
playlist we can click on any of the
playlists and the playlist page will
open so this is the basic structure that
is already created for us we need to
modify this structure according to our
own needs this is how we create
applications based on templates let's
see how we can deploy these applications
to emulators and mobile devices so I'll
just press control C and stop the server
now if you want to deploy this
application on an emulator you will have
to build this application for a
particular platform first so if you want
to build this application for Android
you'll have to download and setup
android sdk from developer.android.com
slash sdk go ahead and click the green
download button that will download the
whole Android studio and we'll set up
the Android SDK for you if you want to
develop applications for iOS go ahead to
developer.apple.com slash iOS and then
you can download the iOS SDK and set it
up on your map
once you are done with that all you have
to do is type in ionic platform ad since
I want to add the platform Android
because I want to build this application
for Android I just add Android and hit
enter this will add all the required
files that we need to create an
application for Android
since this is also a network operation
this requires Internet and the time
taken to complete this operation depends
upon the speed of your internet
connection
okay it's done now all you need to do is
type in ionic run and draw it if you
have an emulator up and running the
application will be run in your emulator
if you do not the emulator will be
launched and your application will be
installed on the emulator but if you
want to deploy this application on your
own mobile phone you have to connect the
mobile phone right now
via the USB cable and enable USB
debugging mode on your Android phone
type in ionic ran Android and hit enter
and your application will be launched on
your mobile phone or on your emulator
since I do not have an Android phone
connected right now it will be launched
on the emulator
wait for this to complete and once it
completes the application will be
launched on the emulator
as you can notice we also get a message
no target specified deploying to
emulator since it cannot find any
Android phones connected it is deploying
the application to the emulator
okay so the application has been built
successfully now it is deploying the
application on the emulator so I have my
emulator on the left and the console on
the right and it says that the
installation is successful and now it's
launching the application and you can
see on the left that the application is
being launched
and there we go so now we have the same
application running inside an emulator
that we had in the browser
so this is how you deploy your
applications on your emulator and on
your Android devices in the next video
we will examine the folder structure
that we get when we create a new ionic
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
