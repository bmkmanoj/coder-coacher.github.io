in ionic apps for vous commerce course
in this video we are going to take a
step further and learn about the
JavaScript features that ionic lists
have so far we have seen analysts as
just the CSS component but they are a
lot more than that in this video we will
learn how we can use our nicolas
built-in functionality to reorder items
in the list and to delete items in the
list we will also look at how to create
optional buttons for each item in the
list so let's get started first of all
I'll change the list from ul to iron
list so I'll just change this text to
iron list okay and I will change the
alloy tag to I an item I'll save it
and as soon as I save you can see that
my list has been transformed into a
beautiful list which is perfect to be
displayed on mobile devices
now what I can do is I can implement
additional functionality to my list so
first of all let's implement the
functionality to delete items from this
list using the built-in features of a
necklace so what I have to do is I have
to add an attribute to a unless tag
which is called show delete and I'll
have to set it to true okay so this
means that now I can use delete
functionality in my eye on item and the
next thing is that I'll have to add the
actual button tag which is I on delete
button to the eye on item tag ok so just
before I close my item tag I'll have to
add eye on delete button tag
this takes an ng-click directive which
is very similar to on click function in
JavaScript it just executes the code
passed to it whenever the button is
clicked okay so what we are doing here
is that we are deleting an item from the
user's array and the item that we are
deleting from the user's array is at
Dollar Index which means the current
index the second parameter is one which
means that I just want to delete one
item from the list from the current
index
you can already see that I have the
delete buttons displayed on the left in
my list items I can click on any of
these buttons and the items get deleted
although I can refresh and bring the
items back because the items are defined
statically in my controller
you may not always want to show these
delete buttons you may want to show them
only when the user requires them so
let's create a button in our header bar
and when the user will click on that
button these buttons in our list will be
shown otherwise these buttons will just
be hidden
so I'll just go to my header bar and
just before my title on the left I'll
add a button I'll add a class of button
doc so this will give me a black button
and I'll add an ng-click narrative what
I want to do is I want to modify the
value of her variable based on which I
will either show that Dilek buttons or
hide them so let's just create a
variable called allow delete
okay and I'll toggle the value of
allowed elite variable so I'll just said
the allowed elite do not allow delete
okay I'll set the text on the button as
delete and I'll close the button and now
instead of passing true as a default
value of her show delete directive what
I can do is I can pass in allow delete
which will contain either true or false
but there is no default value to allow
delete so we will go to our Abdul JS
file and define a default value to a
scope level variable which is allowed
delete and I'll set it to false which
means that by default these buttons will
not be shown if I click on the delete
button the buttons on the items are
shown if I click on the delete button
again the value of allow delete variable
is changed to false and the buttons are
hidden so this way I can show unhide the
buttons I can click on the delete
buttons and the list item is deleted
another cool feature that we can
implement in a similar way is ion
reorder button it is very similar to
implement all I have to do is paste in
another button here and it is called as
iron reorder button it has an additional
directive called own reorder which takes
the name of a function which is executed
every time the user tries to reorder the
items in the list the item itself the
from index and the to index are passed
in as parameters to this function you
will have to implement this function
inner controller but before that we will
have to allow reordering just like we
have to allow deletion so we will just
create a new directive here called show
reorder and again instead of using true
or false value I will use the name of a
variable which I'll create in a moment
call allow reorder okay so if the value
of allow reorder is set to true that
your ring will be allowed otherwise it
will not be allowed and the value will
be modified with the help of a button in
our header bar I'll just change the text
to reorder instead of allowed delete we
want to have a lower order that's it
now all I have to do is go to our
bridges file define a default value for
our allow reorder variable which is
false and I'll save it and now if I
click on this reorder button you can see
that I have the buttons that I can use
to reorder items in the list although if
I try reordering the items in the list
it is not going to work because we have
not yet implemented this function called
reorder item so let's just go ahead and
do that so I'll go to my upload J's file
and just before I close my controller
I'll create a function called reorder
item on my scope and this will be a
function which will take three
parameters the first one is the user
itself and I'll get the from index which
is the index that the user is dragging
the list item from and the to index
which is the index in the list that the
user is dragging the item to okay all
these indices are zero-based so if I am
dragging some earth Agrawal to the third
position in the list then the from index
value will be 0 and the two index value
will be 2
okay and what I can do I can use the
splice method from JavaScript to remove
and add items to the list what I want is
remove the item from the from index
value and add that item to the to index
value in our users array so I'll just
use a scope dot users dot splice okay
and I want to remove an item from the
from index and I want to remove just one
item so this line of code will remove
one item from the forum ending but we
have to add the item back to the list so
I'll use the scope dot users wrote a
splice again this time I will pass in
the to index and I'll pass in zero as
the second parameter which means that I
do not want to remove any elements from
the array instead I want to add an
element and the element is user itself
I'll save it and now if I try to reorder
items in the list I can do that so let's
try that I'll click on the reorder
button and the buttons show up and I'll
try to drag the first item to the second
position and you can see that the list
has been reordered completely and this
way you can use the delete and reorder
functionalities of iron lists which are
provided to you out of the box last but
not the least there is one more cool
feature that ionic list provides and it
is that you can have additional buttons
for each list item which get revealed
only when the user wants them all you
have to do is slide the list item to the
left and the button shows up so let's
see how to do that currently if I try to
swipe the item to the left nothing
happens but if I type in can swipe and
set its value to true now I can
implement I an option button to enable
swiping so I'm going to paste in some
code here and I have pasted in the code
of a button which is I an option button
it has a class of button info so it will
just show me a white button first of all
let me add a class called button
assertive which will show me a red
button and the ion option button takes
in an ng-click directive which is
executed every time this button is
clicked so I'll just use a function
called edit which I'll implement in my
Abdul J's file inside my controller and
I will pass in the current user to the
Edit function now I'll just go to my
Abra J's file real quick and implement
this function I do not want to do
anything serious so I will just
implement a function which will just
show us an alert and I will pass in the
user there all I want to do is alert
editing and then the name of the user
which is user dot name ok so if the user
clicks on the edit button they will see
an alert so what I will do I'll swipe
the list item to the left and I get to
see the edit button which is red in
color and has the text edit on it and if
I click on the button and if I click on
this button I get to see an alert that
says editing some earth agrawal okay so
we actually get the whole list item that
we are trying to menu Plato performs
some actions on as a parameter in this
edit function
okay so this is pretty much it about
this video this is how you can implement
these cool features like deletion
reordering and additional tasks using
built-in functionalities of iron list
that ionic provides we will use these
features a lot during development of our
vous commerce application in the next
module but before that we will learn
about some more JavaScript components
that ionic has</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
