WooCommerce in this video we are going
to learn another ionic component ionic
buttons so far we have learned how we
can create header bars and how we can
create some header bars we also saw how
we can create footer bars now it's time
to learn about buttons so how do we
create buttons let's have a look at it
so I just remove my name from here and
I'll save it and as soon as I save the
application you can see that my name is
gone from the preview as well now we are
going to use ionic buttons
all I have to do is use a button tag and
close the button tag this is a simple
HTML button okay but in order to make
this button an ionic button I have to
apply a class and the class name is
button okay if I want to display any
text on the button which we have to most
of the times then I'll just add the text
right here so I will just type in lick
me I'll save it and you can see that I
have a simple-looking whitish grey
button in my iron content just below my
iron sub editor okay just like we were
applying color classes to our iron
header bar we can apply all those color
classes to our buttons as well let's
have a look at how to do that so I'll
just apply another class called button
positive I'll save that okay and you can
see that now my button has a nice blue
color applied to it let's create some
more buttons so I'll just copy this code
from here and I'll just paste this code
and I'll try to change the color of the
button this time I'll change the color
to dark
and you can see that I get a dark color
button it's kind of a dark gray color
there are a number of other ways we can
modify these buttons let's have a look
at different sizes of the buttons so we
have this button what if I apply a class
called button small oh my button turned
very small I can apply a class called
button large and you can see that the
size of the button has increased so
these are the ways you can modify the
size of the button there is also very
important class that you can apply and
it is button block
this class will make your button occupy
full width in your screen these kind of
buttons are used a lot in modern
applications so maybe we will be using
this kind of button in our application
all these classes are something that you
need to remember you'll learn and
remember the name of all these classes
as we develop the application do not
worry about that so if you go to ionic
documentation you will end up on this
page and this page features all the anak
components that we can use so we have an
Aikido bar and some ADA bar and content
ionic footer and buttons here you can
see all the colors of the buttons that
we can use we have also seen how we can
create large in small buttons
we also have a class called button
outline so let's try that let us apply
the button outline class to this button
so I'll just apply that class here
button outline and I'll save it and you
can see that now the button only has an
outline okay the fill that the button
previously had the blue color is now
gone so this kind of looks a modern
button that you can use in your
applications
there is also button clear which kind of
removes the border of the button and
just displays the text and the text is
played is of blue color and this is
because we have a positive class applied
to it okay let me change the class to
assertive and now that click me text
will change to red
okay so this was all about buttons one
more thing about buttons is that you can
have icons in your button I'll just
remove this so I'll just bring my old
blue button back and now I will apply
and I can do it if you want to apply an
icon to your button all you have to do
is add the icon class and then the name
of the icon that you want to apply there
are a number of icons that are already
available with ionic so I'll just add
and I can call ion home and this will
add a cool home icon in my button the
icon is right there if I want to move
this icon to the left I'll add the class
I can left and the icon will be shifted
towards the left if I want to move this
icon towards the right I'll just add the
class I can right
see the icon has moved towards right
there are a number of other icons as
well let me just show you another one so
I just add a class called I on star this
will give me a star like icon on the
right okay we also have an icon called
gear a let's save it and see how it
looks like so we have this nice gear
let's try gear B as well okay so this is
a different gear
if you want to learn about all the icons
that are available with ionic just head
over to eye on accounts comm and here
you will see a list of all the icons
that ionic has so if you just want to go
ahead and use this icon all you have to
do is use the class iron - met kit and
this I can will show up in your
application let me show you how to use
these icons
so I just come back to my application
and instead of gear B I use icon ion
method I'll save it and now I see the
same icon that we wanted to use in our
application so these are all the icons
that you can use out of the box with
ionic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
