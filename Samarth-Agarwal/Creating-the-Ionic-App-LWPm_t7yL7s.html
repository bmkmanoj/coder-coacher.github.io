for your WordPress blog so now that we
are done with the installation of our
WordPress blog and we are done with the
process of configuration of our
WordPress blog now it's time to get
started with our ionic application so
first things first we need to download
and install node.js from node.js roadog
once you are done with installation
rhodius which is pretty straightforward
you need to install ionic and cordova
you can either use command prompt or you
can use a git bash like I am using right
here to install ionic in Cordova so you
can use NPM which is node package
manager to install ionic and code or
this command right here
NPM install ionic G will install ionic
globally using the node package manager
on your machine
what - she does it installs ionic
globally which means that you can access
ionic throughout your machine without
requiring to be in a particular folder
you can also install ionic in Cordova in
a single line of command which is NPM
install ionic Cordova - G this will
install ionic and Cordova globally once
you are done with this installation
process just go ahead create a new
folder somewhere I have created a
similar folder and it's called udemy so
I want to create an ionic application
inside this folder so I'll use the ionic
CLI which is ionic start start is the
command that we use to create a new
ionic application and next we need to
specify a name for this application so
I'm going to name it WordPress ionic and
finally I'll specify the name of the
template that we want to use we want to
use the blank template which means that
our application will be pretty much
blank there are other templates
available than blank which you can use
in your applications so just go ahead
and press ENTER and this will go ahead
and create a new folder inside the
folder udemy and we'll configure our
ionic application
once this is done we'll proceed by
running our application and test it out
you
so as you can see a new folder WordPress
ionic has been created inside the udemy
folder and this will be our project
folder you can see that the download has
completed and now it's initializing our
Cordova project this is basically a
configuration operation that happens
every time you create a new application
so we are done with the process of
creation of our ionic application we can
now browse this folder so as you can see
we have a number of folders here but the
one that we are concerned is this www
folder it contains all the HTML files
Java Script files CSS files and images
that we'll use in our application so you
can see that we have an index.html right
here this will be the home page of our
application so now let's head back to
git bash once again and try running this
application and in order to run this
application we need to change the
current directory to the one that
contains our project in our case it is
WordPress ionic once we are inside this
directory all I need to do is type in
ionic so ionic serve will execute our
project inside our browser since it
detects that I have two network
interface cards I will select the one
with the IP address
and it opens my browser and you'll see
that my application is running so this
is our application it is pretty much
blank as you can see on the top we have
a header called ionic blank starter and
it contains pretty much nothing another
way to test out your application is
ionic serve - - L this will also run
your project inside the browser but will
show you how your application will look
exactly on a mobile device it will show
you two versions of your application one
as it would look on an iOS device and
another one hazard would look on an
Android device as you can see the
application does not contain anything
much but it has a heard of and it has a
text from the header ionic blank starter
so that's it for this video in the next
video we'll go ahead and create some
necessary files for our project and then
we'll start with the process of coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
