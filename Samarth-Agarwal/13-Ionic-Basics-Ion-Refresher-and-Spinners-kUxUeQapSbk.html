WooCommerce many a times you might have
seen in many modern applications
including Facebook and Twitter that you
can refresh the content in your
application just by pulling down the
content and as soon as you let it go the
content is refreshed in Facebook if you
are on the top of your newsfeed and if
you pull down your newsfeed will be
refreshed and new newsfeed will appear
on the top ionic offers to implement
this functionality and it provides most
of the functionality that we need to
create this type of interface right out
of the box so we are going to create
hold on to refresh functionality in this
video so let's try that pull down to
refresh functionality works with iron
content so you need to have iron content
in your view
and the first child element of your iron
content should be iron refresher okay
iron refresher takes two most important
attributes the first one is the pulling
text which is the text that is shown to
the user when they are pulling down in
order to refresh the application and on
the free edge takes the name of a
function which is executed so it is
actually the task of this function to
refresh the data in the application
as of now we do not have any function
called do refresh but we will implement
this function in the moment but before
that let me just save this application
here and see how it looks like so I have
my application here and I will try to
pull down to refresh the application
and you can see that as I pull down I
see the text pull-to-refresh
and an arrow above it okay both these
components the text and the icon that we
see are customizable we can change them
now as I leave you can see that our
spinner shows up which tells the user
that something is happening in the
background
since we have not created any function
called do refresh this spinner will just
keep showing so let's just go to our
Abroad J's file and create this function
so I'll just create this function on my
scope
in to do in this function is
reinitialize the value of the users
array so I'll just copy the users array
and paste it in here
okay one more thing that we need to do
is that we need to tell high onic that
we are done with the refreshing process
since we just want to initialize our
users array after this we need to tell
iron it explicitly that we are done if
we do not tell ionic it will just keep
showing the spinner and to tell anionic
that you are done users have to type in
one line of code which is scope dot
broadcast this is the way of
broadcasting an event and this is the
event that we are broadcasting and ionic
will receive this event and will know
that the Refresh process is complete and
now it can hide the spinner let's see
how it works so what I am going to do I
am going to pull down to refresh
and you can see that the spinner goes
away after refreshing the item let me
just delete some of the items in the
list
and now if I pull down to refresh
you will see that the original list
comes back so this means that a refresh
method is working fine and the event is
also broadcasted successfully
a few customizations that you can do on
iron refresher are that you can change
the text that shows up when the user
pulls down you can also change the
spinner that shows up all you have to do
is define a directive called spinner and
the value of a spinner attribute can be
one of the many spinners that ionic
provides on your screen you can see that
there are a number of spinners built
into ionic that you can use right away
so let me just use the lines spinner
because it is very much similar to the
one used by Facebook let me just save
this
now if I pull down to refresh
you will notice that I get to see a
different spinner so this is pretty much
it about iron refresher we can use iron
refresher in order to refresh the
content in our application all the code
logic that you want to execute in order
to refresh the content of your
application has to be implemented inside
the do refresh method that you should
implement in your controller once you
are done you have to broadcast an event
called cold or refresh complete and this
will indicate that you are done with the
process of refreshing your application
and ionic should hide the spinner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
