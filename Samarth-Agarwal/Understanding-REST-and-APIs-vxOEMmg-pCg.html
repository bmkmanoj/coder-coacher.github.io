iOS apps for a wordpress blog in this
video we learn what is rest rest with an
acronym for representational state
transfer remember the basic way how
clients and servers work plan makes a
request to the server server receives a
request and then fetches the resource
and then forwards that resource to the
client client receives that response and
then shows it to the user this is the
basic paradigm that has been in place
since like forever this mode of
communication where client makes a
request and the server sends some data
or information in response to that
request is called representational state
transfer HTTP is a protocol that makes
use of representational state transfer
whenever we want one software to
interact with another piece of software
we need an API API stands for
application programming interfaces in
this course we will be building an ionic
app that will interact with the
WordPress blog using REST API so our
WordPress blog will be rest capable and
will feature a restful api that our
ionic app will use to communicate with
the blog let me show you an example of
an api
head over to open weather map dot-org
okay go to the API page and right here
you can click on this link
so you can see that whenever I send a
request to this particular URL I get a
response which is highly structured
let's have a look at the URL the first
part of the URL is the name of the
server ok after that we have the URL to
a resource then we have a version number
and then we have the name of another
resource after that we are passing in
some parameters and here the name of the
parameter is the city name which is
London UK ok along with that I am
passing in another parameter which is
basically used here for authentication
and it's app ID we are not concerned
about hop ID for now but if we change
this parameter let me type in Chicago
here
and I got the response for Chicago so
this is a response that I get for this
particular URL so I'm making calls to
this open weather map API and I'm
getting a highly structured response if
you have a look at the response it is
just a collection of key-value pairs
this type of structured data is called
as JavaScript object notation we will be
dealing with JavaScript object notation
throughout the course here we have a key
longitude and it's value minus eighty
seven point six five I have another key
latitude and its value is forty one
point eight five similarly I have other
collection of keys like I have a key
called main which has sub keys inside it
so the first sub key is temp which
stands for temperature and the value of
the temperature is 291 point seven eight
so I can use this data and convert it to
informations and present it nicely to my
user that is what we are going to learn
in this course we will fetch the data
from a wordpress blog and then we'll
display that data in a Roenick
application our users will use the ionic
application to interact with the sower
our server will respond to the client
using the restful api that will
implement on our wordpress server in the
next video we will start by setting up
our wordpress blog and then we will
enable the restful api on a wordpress
blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
