hello and welcome to another video in
the NX cool and in this video I am going
to teach you something which a lot of
people ask me on udemy and it is about
charts people want to know how we can
create charts in our ionic applications
so that is what we are going to do today
we are going to learn how we can create
charts in our ioniq applications so what
i'm going to do i'm going to create a
new ionic 2 application and then i'm
going to use the high charts library
which is a very comprehensive library
and contains a lot of tools to build
thousands of kinds of charts that you
can build for your applications all you
have to do is just use the correct
methods and options and you get your
charts the way you want them to be so
high charts has a module called high
charts which you can install yr npm and
you know that we can install NPM modules
in ionic 2 but using the native high
charts module is a little bit tricky so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
an angular 2 module which is called
angular 2 high charts which makes the
process a little bit easier so first of
all let's just create a new ionic 2
application ok so now my application has
been created so I'll just CD into my
project directory so the name of my
projects trajectory is high charge so
I'll just open that and I'm going to
open this folder in Visual Studio code
before doing anything else I'm just
going to open the console in Visual
Studio code and I'm just gonna close
this command prompt and I'm just going
to use this terminal now so I'm just
going to run this app now I have my app
running on the right side and I have
Visual Studio code open on the left side
and the first thing that I'm going to do
is install the angular 2 highcharts
modules so I'll just type in npm install
angular 2 pie charts hit enter and this
will just install this module and along
with angular 2 highcharts module it will
also install the hi charts module which
is a dependency on which angular 2 HRT's
module depends so basically angular 2
highcharts module is a wrapper around
the kohai charts module which helps us
to use high charts model in angular 2
and ionic 2 uses angular 2 that is why
we are going to use this module make
sense ok now that we have installed a
new module the first thing that we'll
have to do is introduce it to our app
dot module dot ES file so the first
thing that I will do is import this
module and I will tell you in a moment
what we want to import and I want to
import it from angular 2 pie charts ok
so I want to import the chart module
from angular 2 hi charts module
okay and along with that I want to
import everything as highcharts you can
type in however you want this is just
the local name so you can type in
however you want from hi charts
okay make sure the edge here is capital
because we are referencing an external
and game model here okay and now in the
imports I'll have to pass in chart
module dot for route and inside the for
root function I'll have to pass in the
local variable called hi charts that we
have created right here okay now just
save it and now we can close app dot
module dot TS file our high charge
module has been imported successfully
now and now let's just go to our main
page which is a haunted HTML and remove
everything from this page okay I'm going
to save it and see if the application
changes in the browser yes it does okay
and now here I'm going to create a new
chart element okay and this will have an
options property that we are going to
assign to a local variable that will
create in just a moment let's just call
it chart options okay and along with
chart options I am also going to specify
a type and the type will be chart let's
just leave it right here before
proceeding let's just bind our options
property to the chart options object
okay now we can come to our home two TS
file and here I am just going to create
this chart options object this will be
of the type any and in my constructor
what I'm going to do I'm going to assign
some values to this chart options okay
now if I save it okay
so I made a mistake here I have to close
this square bracket I'm going to save it
and this will bind this options property
to this chart options object that we
have created here in our TS file okay so
all the errors go away and our
application is blank again all I have to
do is assign some values to this chart
options object so let's just do that and
I'm just going to copy this thing okay
I'm going to explain you what this is in
just a moment so I'm just going to paste
it and I'm going to save it
let's see how our application changes in
the browser
okay so we get a nice looking chart this
is the chart looks pretty decent and
let's just have a look at what we have
done here we have created a chart
options object and this chart options
object is everything for our chart this
defines everything that designs or
creates or specifies how a chart is
going to look like so this chart options
object contains a lot of JSON objects
the first one is the chart object which
defines the type of the chart this is
the bar chart we can change the type of
the chart to line and I'll save it and
this will change the type of the chart
to line
okay so you can see that the type of the
chart has changed
I can also pass in spline here and this
will change the type of the chart to
spline so there are a number of chart
types that you can check out here in the
official documentation okay so if you go
to HR demos you see that they offer
quite a number of charts that you can
use right out of the box all you have to
do is create specific JSON objects for
chart options let's come back to our
application here let's just keep the bar
chart for now another object is the
title which defines the title of a chart
which we have here as fruit consumption
so basically we are specifying the text
for our title which is fruit consumption
you can also specify other attributes
like you can specify the style of how
your title is going to look like so
let's just try modifying this color I'm
going to save it and as soon as I save
the color of the title has been changed
to red similarly you can specify a
subtitle all you have to do is just
replicate the title property and change
it to subtitle and specify a text and
style if you want and the subtitle will
appear just below the title in a smaller
font the next important properties that
we have here are the x axis and the y
axis so on x axis I am going to have
three categories so basically we have
three categories apples bananas and
oranges so we are going to specify data
for these three categories okay so this
is the x axis due to styling of
highcharts we are seeing x axis on the y
axis so our x axis is represented
vertically here but basically this is
the x axis and apples bananas or oranges
are three values which are represented
on the x axis on the y axis we have the
title of fruits eaten and we have a
series object-- after that this is a
core data that our chart represents we
have a series of jecht which is
basically a JSON array and it contains
two series the first one is with the
name Jane and the second one is with the
name John the name is pretty clear we
have a name for each series
and this data is what our graph is
representing okay so data is an array if
it contains numerical values and it
contains as many numerical values as
many categories we have right so we have
three categories that is why we have
three numerical values represented in
our data array so one here represents
the number of fruits eaten by Jane and
the fruit is Apple okay zero here
represents the number of bananas eaten
by Jane
similarly seven here represents the
number of bananas eaten by John three
here represents the number of oranges
eaten by John similarly I can just copy
and paste it here and just change the
name
Vivat and we'll have new series in our
chart okay so you can see that a new
green series is there in a chart now I'm
just going to replace the zero values
with some value so I'm going to save it
again okay so now we have three bars for
each of our categories okay so this is
how we represent data in our charts for
each kind of chart the data might be a
little different but for most of the
basic charts all you have to do is
specify a name and data and that's it I
am specifying this data statically here
you can use dynamic objects dynamic
arrays and then pass them in here and
your charge will update in real time one
last thing that I want to do here is
make our chart look even better so as of
now the chart is overflowing our
viewport it is passing beyond the right
edge of our application so I'm just
going to specify a style here and I'm
going to specify a CSS style which is
going to be display and I'll set the
display to block that's it I'm going to
save it and now we'll have a nice
looking chart that fits into the
viewport of our application okay and
this is how we can create basic charts
using high charts in our ionic 2
applications there are a number of other
chart types and different methods that
you can use to improvise however charts
are going to look like if you want to
check out some new properties or some
new features and implement that you can
search them here and then you will get
to know how to use those properties if
you want to learn how to implement
different types of charts the high
charts documentation is pretty good so
you can search anything that you want to
do here and then you can you find the
documentation and you can use it right
away in your hand to application so
that's it for this video I'm going to
see in the next video with another
interesting topic thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
