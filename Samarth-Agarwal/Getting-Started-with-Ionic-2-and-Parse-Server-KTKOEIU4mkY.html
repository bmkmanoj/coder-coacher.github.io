self-hosted power server as a back-end
if you are watching this course you are
probably familiar with ionic and ionic 2
is the latest version of ionic which is
released just a few days ago if you are
new to ionic then you should know what
ionic is ionic is a cross-platform
mobile application development framework
which allows you to build applications
for Android iOS and Windows Phone using
the web technologies that you already
know so all you need is HTML CSS in
JavaScript skills to build mobile
applications for all the 3 leading
mobile platforms so all you do is write
your code using plain HTML CSS in
JavaScript and you will get three
different applications for Android iOS
and Windows Phone in this course we'll
build a mobile application from start to
end and use our server as the backend
for our application let's have a look at
the contents of this course so first of
all we are going to learn the basics of
ionic framework version 2 which is the
latest version of ionic this version of
ionic uses angular 2 with typescript and
we'll use parse server which will be
self hosted on our own server we will
also learn how we can build applications
for Android iOS and Windows using ionic
2 and we'll build a complete mobile
application from start to end using
ionic 2 finally we'll deploy this
application to Android and iOS devices
