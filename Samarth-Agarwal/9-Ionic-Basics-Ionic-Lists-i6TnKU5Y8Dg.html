commerce in this video we'll learn how
to create lists with ionic so what I'm
going to do inside this iron content
I'll create a new list there are two
ways of creating lists we can use a div
with a class of list
okay and inside of this Dave for each
item inside our list I will create
another div with a class of item so this
will be our item 1 and I'll close this
div I'll save it
and you can see that I now have a list
I'll just replicate this and this way I
can have number of objects in my list
I'll save it and now I have a beautiful
list in my iron content so this is one
way of creating lists another way is
that instead of using dev with a class
of list all you have to do is use the
tag iron list also instead of using
their day with a class of item all you
have to do now is use the tag iron item
okay and that's what you'll close so
just close eye on item and now what you
can do is replace all these tags that
you have just created with iron item
save it and you will get the same output
as you were getting before
using iron less tags and iron item tags
have several advantages over the
traditional dev and class combination
we will have a look at what those
advantages are in a little lecture but
for now let's try and modify this list
and change the style of the list so
ionic offers a number of styles that you
can create your list
with let me just show you how you can
have a thumbnail icon in your list so
all you have to do is add a class called
item thumbnail left and you will have a
thumbnail icon on the Left okay you have
not specified any icon as of now so
instead of getting the thumbnail icon we
are getting blank space for it so let's
just add an image tag here so I'll add
an image with the source of lorem pixel
dot-com slash 64 by 64 this will give me
a random 64 by 64 image that I can use
so I'll save it
and now you'll see that I have got an
image instead of the white space we can
also format the text that we have right
here to make it look a little bit nicer
so what I'll do I'll add an h2 tag
around the item and I'll also add a P
tag and a P tag will contain the
description of the item so I'll just add
a text called description goes here and
I'll save it
and you can see that I now have a pretty
nice-looking list item okay what I can
do is now replicate this one to see how
our list actually looks like so I'll
just paste this twice and now we will
end up having three list items with
thumbnails titles and descriptions
another thing that you can use to play
with is that you can change the class
from item thumbnail left to item
thumbnail right and save it in the
second list element you will have the
thumbnail on the right pretty cool right
another type of list that ionic supports
is the card list so it will allow you to
display a list as cards cards are the
latest UI component that Android has and
most of the applications out there are
using cards so I'm just going to remove
this list from here and instead I'm
going to paste in some code here and
here you can see that I already with a
class of list and card so I have applied
two classes here a list and a card class
the card class will ensure that all the
items in the list are rendered as cards
okay and inside this list I have three
items item number one item number two an
item number three each of these items
shows you the strength of ionic so in
the first item we are just using an
avatar image and the URL of the image is
something I need to change so I'll just
type in HTTP lorem pixel comm slash 32
by 32 okay it will have the title pretty
hate machine and the text will be Nine
Inch Nails you can just change this text
to whatever you want it's just something
that I have copied from the ionic
documentation also in the second list I
have the item image class again I'll
just change the URL okay and in the last
one instead of the div tag I have the
anchor tag with the class of item I can
left assertive so item I can left class
will ensure that I have an item and the
icon will be a music note icon and the
text will be start listening so let's
save this and have a look at how it
looks like
okay so the image is not pretty good
because it's a small image what I'm
seeing is that I have an avatar right
here I have the text by the avatar the
h2 title and the paragraph text below it
then I have the image and below the
image inside the same card
I have start listening text with the
music note I can this is a link which is
clickable so I can click on this and you
can see that nothing is actually
happening also notice that since the
size of the list has increased and it
has reached beyond the visible viewport
size now iron content has added a scroll
bar so I can scroll the content
you might not see this scrollbar in your
iOS simulator but in your Android
simulator you can see this so this is
how you create different types of lists
in ionic this is it about this video in
the next video we will learn how to
create beautiful forms and define
various HTML input elements in our forms
