another video on my youtube channel if
you're new here make sure that you
subscribe to my channel so last week I
was talking to a friend over phone and
we came across a discussion about
firestore and my friend actually did not
know much about file store so I just
dropped a post in the Facebook group and
a lot of people actually did not know
what firestore is so I decided to make
this video for all those people so fire
store is a new database that the
firebase team has been working on and it
is currently in beta so the old database
system that firebase has is going to be
deprecated maybe in future and the new
file store database is in currently the
firestore database is in beta but you
can use it in your applications in
development as well as in production so
what actually makes cloud file stored if
ur --nt from the real time database that
firebase has since forever so there are
a lot of improvements the first and the
biggest improvement for me personally
was that the data is now organized as
documents so if you have worked with
MongoDB or a similar no sequel database
you must have come across the term
documents the data in a no sequel
database is organized as documents okay
and a collection of similar kinds of
documents is called as collection which
makes it really simple to store and
structure JSON data when you are dealing
with applications that has structured
data so you can use those capabilities
as well for queries so if you need to
run a query on all your documents then
you can do that while it was little bit
complicated and you had to do a lot of
data modeling in advance considering how
you are going to run your queries in the
real time database which is not the case
with file store so in this video
basically what I am going to do is
create a new ionic application you can
create a new angular application or use
whatever framework you want to and then
we are going to integrate firebase file
store in that application and see how it
works and how the interface looks like
so if you go to the get started' section
on the official google documentation you
will see that there are a number of SDKs
that you can use and get started with
file store right out of the box since we
are working on a web application we will
be using the node module so we'll be
creating a new ionic application and
then integrating firebase file store in
that ionic application along with that
I'm going to introduce you to an online
IDE for your ionic angular and react
applications that you can use for
testing out code snippets or small
concepts that you want to integrate in
your application or basically for
testing so I've been using this website
called stab blades and this is an online
IDE it looks just like Visual Studio
code but if you are something like me
and you are going to test out the
feature or build something really small
just to test the functionality of it you
can use this website so you can actually
build angular react and ionic projects
on this website you don't have to
install a single thing on your machine
and the creation of the project is
really fast so it saves you a lot of
time and bandwidth so I'm going to click
on ionic to create a new ionic project
and as soon as I click on it I get a new
ionic project created for me the name of
the project is random but it doesn't
bother me as of now so I'm going to
bring in firebase first and then I'm
going to get started with the
integration process so the first thing
I'll have to do is bring in an external
module and on a local project if you are
going to use Visual Studio code you will
have to use the NPM command to install
the firebase module for stab blades I'm
just going to expand the dependencies
and right here I'm going to mention the
name of the package that I need in this
case I need firebase so just type in
firebase and press Enter this brings in
the firebase module and makes it
available to your application now while
it installs you can head over to app dot
module to TS file import firebase and
configure it just as we have done before
in a lot of my videos so I'm just going
to do it really fast to save you some
time
so that's it that's all the conflict
that you need to do it's just like you
are working on Visual Studio code so you
will not face many problems let's insert
out of AB dot module dot ES file and
head over to our home page where we will
be working for the rest of the project
so I'll just head over to home dirtiest
file and in here I'll import firebase
and firebase slash file store so these
are the two modules that you need to
bring in to make file store work so I'll
just come here and I'll paste in these
imports so I have imported two modules
firebase and firebase slash fire store
now I'll just go ahead and create a new
document in my collection and I'll just
go ahead and call that collection users
and I'll create a new user as soon as
this page loads so the first thing I'll
do is instantiate the firebase file
store and I can do that using firebase
dot file store function and get a
reference inside a variable I'll call
that variable DB and once I have that
variable I can just go ahead and type in
DB dot collection and this takes in the
name of a collection so I'll just call
this collection as users all the data
about all the users in my application
will be stored inside this collection I
can have as many collections as I want
and a query will always run within a
collection ok now I can execute all
these methods on this collection so what
I want to do right now is I want to add
a new document and the function that we
are going to use is the add function the
add function takes in a JSON object as a
parameter and this JSON object actually
contains the data for your document so
I'm just going to create a fake user
with a first name and a last name and
then I can execute a promise so let's
just go ahead and log the data that we
get inside the promise as a parameter to
the console and in case something goes
wrong we'll also handle that inside the
cache block so for now we will just
block the error to the console as well
let's save this now to make this work
you will have to enable file store in
your firebase console so just go ahead
to your firebase console click on
database and select fire
store from the top down menu if you are
doing this for the first time you will
get an option to choose firebase cloud
file store beta once you are done with
that make sure that in your rules
you do not have anything this will allow
unprotected readwrite access but since
we are just testing it out it's okay now
let's just go ahead and save our
application and see if something is
saved or logged to the console so I'll
just open up the console has been let's
refresh the application and make our
home page work so you can see that our
home page work and the code inside the
constructor actually ran and that is why
we are getting this console log from
line number 14 inside our home door TS
file and the only thing that you can
understand from this object is ID so
this is a unique ID which is generated
and automatically assigned to your
document inside the user's collection
let's set that to firebase console and
see if we actually have a user saved
with this information so let's head over
to the firestore database so you can see
that I already have three documents
inside my users collection and these are
the unique IDs that are automatically
created by a firebase for my documents
you can select any one of these and
you'll actually see the data inside the
document so I have got the first name
and the last name inside my document so
that's pretty cool right you can also
use manually generated IDs so you are
not stuck with these random complicated
IDs you can instead use another function
called set that will allow you to
specify an ID of your choice
so let's have a look at how it works all
you need to do is a specify a document
name let's call this my first user and
then you can execute the set function on
this document let's save this refresh
the application and if you switch back
to your file store database you should
see a new object right here in a few
moments so you can see that a new user
with the ID my faults user has been
created as a document inside our users
collection if you click on it you'll see
the similar data so you have the option
of using a random ID and you
also create your own IDs if you want you
can also store nested JSON data inside
this collection and you can use the
usual data types like numbers strings
dates to store specific types of data
you can also update data and in order to
update data all you have to do is just
specify the document just like I have
done here and you have to call the
update function instead of the set
function and I'll just change the name
here I'll save my file and I'll refresh
my application and if I switch back to
my file store you can see that the data
actually updated in real time so this is
the firebase console for firebase file
store and it actually allows you to have
a view of your applications data create
new collections to organize your data
and inside your collections you can
create new documents to store your data
you can also run queries on this data
but we'll check that out in another
video for now this is how firebase file
store works and this is what it actually
is so I hope you enjoyed this video I
hope you learn something new and if you
did make sure that you give me a huge
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel to
keep watching stuff like this thanks for
