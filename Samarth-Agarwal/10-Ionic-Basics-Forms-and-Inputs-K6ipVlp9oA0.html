vous commerce in this video I am going
to build a simple login form and that
way you learn how to create simple forms
using ionic so our typical form will
have a username field and a password
field and the user will enter those
fields and we'll click on the login
button ok so we will define two input
elements one of type text and another of
type password and also we will define a
button that will have the text login on
it so without wasting any more time
let's get started first of all I will
create a form tag I'll also close the
tag right away and the first thing I
will do inside my form is create a list
so I'll add a div with a class of list
I'll close the div and inside this div
the first element I will have is a label
this will have a class of item and item
input ok I'll close the label as well
inside this label I will have a span tag
with a class of input label and here I
will define the actual label so my label
will be user name I'll close the span
tag right away and below that I will
define the input element which will be
of type text and we can also define
placeholder text if you want and I will
close the input element ok let's save it
and see how it looks like
so you can see that I have a form field
and I have a user name label on the left
and on the right I can just type in
anything I want okay similarly we can
define for password so I'll just copy
this and paste it and instead of the
username label I'll have the label as
password okay and the type will be
password I'll save it
and now I can type in the password here
you can just remove the placeholder if
you want you can do it however you like
and lastly I'll add another item so I'll
add a label with a class of item again
and inside this label I will define a
button with a class of button button
block and button positive so this will
give me a full width blue button and the
button will have the text login on it
and I will close the button okay
let's save it and have a look at how it
looks
okay so it looks pretty cool we have the
login username field layer the login
password field and then we can just
click on this button to login there are
a number of other things that you can do
so let me just show you how you can
create other things so let's just try to
add a drop down somewhere if the user
has to select from a number of options
then we can just give them a drop down
list in HTML we call it the Select field
so how do we create that so I'll just
add another label and this will have a
class of item item input and item select
let's just close the label tag and
inside this label tag I'll define a span
with a class of input label let's just
type in select country let's just close
the span also and below that will give
the number of options so I'll just type
in select here and I'll close the Select
tag as well and inside this Select tag
we can provide options so the first
option will be India I will just close
the option as well
I'll provide another option the USA okay
let's save that and have a look at how
it looks
so you can see that I have select
country right here and on the right I
have the option of selecting country
India is selected as default because
this is the first option that we have
put in here select USA by default by
typing in selected save it
and now you can see that the default
country as selected is the USA okay we
can also have check boxes in our forms
all we have to do is type in ion check
box and I'll just close it and within
check box I just type in remember me and
I'll save it
and just by this one line of code I get
a check box right here that I can check
in or check off to indicate some input
which we can process later using
angularjs so this is pretty much it this
is how we create basic forms in ionic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
