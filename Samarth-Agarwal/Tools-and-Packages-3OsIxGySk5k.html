for your WordPress blog before we get
started with the development process of
our application we need to download and
install a few tools and packages on our
development machine so the first tool
that we need is no J's node.js is a
JavaScript runtime environment and it is
required to run ionic applications so go
ahead to node.js wrote OGG download the
package suitable for your operating
system and for your architecture
I have a Windows 10 64 bit installation
here so the green button shows me that I
can download windows 64-bit installation
of node.js the next tool that we need is
grid bash so go ahead to get - SCM comm
and click the download button it will
download git bash on your Windows
machine git bash is very similar to
command prompt but it also allows to
execute Linux commands so most
developers prefer git bash over the
traditional command prompt so we'll be
using git bash but if you want to use
command prompt that's okay
the next tool that we'll need is ionic
but we cannot install ionic just like
that will require node.js
and a command prompt or gate bash to
install ionic we'll see how we can do
that in a later lecture so this was for
the mobile application part but we also
need a wordpress blog that our
application will connect to if you have
a wordpress blog that's great
but if you are just starting out you can
set up a wordpress blog locally or on
your own hosting server if you have a
hosting server just download the
WordPress zip file from wordpress.org
and upload it to your hosting server if
you want to set up WordPress locally I'm
going to assist you with that just
download vamp server this is the server
that we need in order to run WordPress
locally
it contains pretty much everything that
will require it contains Apache - web
server and it also contains a MySQL
database server alongside will also get
an instance of PHP myadmin
that will allow us to manage our
databases so that was all for the
WordPress part now when you are done
with your application you will
definitely want to
deploy that application on your mobile
phones now if you want to run that
application on your Android devices you
can just go to developer.android.com
slash SDK and download the Android SDK
just download the SDK follow the guide
set up the development environment on
your machine but if you want to develop
for iOS you need to download the iOS SDK
for the sake of simplicity of this
course I'm just going to focus more on
development of the Android application
so we will be developing the application
for Android and then we will deploy it
on an Android device if you have an iOS
device just follow the same steps all
you need to do is an additional step of
downloading and conferring the iOS SDK
so that's it for this video in the next
video we'll download and install ionic
in Cordova in order to build our
applications and we'll set up our basic
ionic application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
