what programming language should I learn?
well Python is clearly better than Ruby
Objective C.
What is this? The ..
HTML is complete another trash
no no, don't listen to them. C is best place to start
Well honestly it really depends
What!?
loud voices
 
Okay.. If you are just starting to learn how to code
picking the right programming language isn't as important as picking up fundamental coding skills
Although, if you try to choose a programming language for something that you are going to build
then the best programming language is going to depend on a various factors
so let me talk about that first point
 
 
it doesn't matter too much what programming language you should start with.
your goal should be getting raise to write code
you're gonna learn a lot of basic skills like how to write code in syntax
how to run your program and how to debug it
these are the skills that are really important to develop early on in writing code
they are going to help you writing code on whatever you want
the best part is this chances are
and serves really important foundations.. for coding tricky
I learnt Java as my  first programming language
Because it was a programming language that my introduced computer science class used
I learned to use for loops, while loops, if then statements, i learned what variables and functions are
 
 
I also learned how to run my program and debug my code
We didn't study the -- of Java programming language
Where it came from and how it can be
We were all just getting started on learning how to code
so we started with the basics
I recommend starting with a programming language that is currently really popular
Today in 2018 I would say they're python ruby javascript and swift
 
because i am a partial of the iOS
A popular programming language is going to have a lot of documentation
for you if you are stuck on something
and that can be really helpful to unstack easily
another way to choose is
read a couple of --- from different ---
and look what's interesting or easy to understand for you
we all think different
so finding a computer programming language comes natural to how you think
is going to set you up for a success
okay so that second point
if you're choosing a programming language for building something
the best programming language is going to depend on various factors
each programming language wasinvented for a different need
you can hear of --- from Ruby
I quote -  &quot; I really a genuine object oriented, easy to use scripting language
 
I looked for one but couldn't find it. So i decided to make it
Apple created the programming language Swift four years ago
To create the best --- language
and to make writing and maintaining correct programs
easier for the developer
If you think about that
each programming language is going to shine and be best for use in different scenarios
you can think about factos like
what computer softwers are available to you
for instance you can all make ios apps if you have a mac
what do you come comfortable in writing
for example if you have a delivery deadline then choose something you are comfortable with
is going to help you sheet faster
how many people are going to be working on it
consider how easy this programming language should be for people in your team
to understand and contribute to it based on individual skills
once you understand these things then
consider options by doing some research
although there is really something helpful to be found out that is well tested and well used by the developer comunity
they usually have --- of using it
which can provide an overal better experience
okay so i hope this explains my answers
there isn't one objectively best programming language out there
 
when i was younger
strong opinions about programming language and frameworks
and i thought it was cool to have some really strong opinion about those things
but honestly it's not it's whatever
as a software engineer it's really important to solve your problem
based on what the best available options are
and to really understand what you are trying to achieve
and what the constraints are
once you understand that choosing your first programming language can come easy
alright everyone that is it for today
stick around --- announcements
if you like this video please give it some thumbs up
and don't forget to subscribe to my channel and to click on the notification bell
to get notified for my videos that are out every week
okay so my first announcement is that i started doing monthly live streams
starting this month and you can check it on my channel
they will be on the first weekend of every month
and don't forget to follow me on instagram or twitter
where i will be posting details about my
live streams and i will be weekly up to date
so i hope to see a lot of you out there
it's a fun time i usually talk about objects are my life
hope to see on my next one
my second announcement is that i have to shoutouts to give
so if you post on social media with the #heyMayuko
with something that you are working on or something that you are proud to
get accomplished than you may have my shoutout at the end of my video
the first one is from keziaspamz he says
i started learning java a week ago
and now i am creating an app to help people be productive when studying for my cs project
i fricking love coding i may feel stressed and start talking to myself when i get a feature to work
i am over the moon
that's awesome thank you so much keziaspams
for admitting this and good for you
this is like incredible so thank you so much for admitting that
the second shoutout goes to pixelpeach
and pixelpeach221 on twitter says
montsh ago i was unsatisfied with my job prospects
your channel inspired me to build up the coding skills i learned as a biologist
and make the switch to software engineering
I now have the best job ever and feel like i'm really make a difference with tech. thank you
thank you so much for sharing this that means
so much to me that is awesome
i am cheering for you.. thanks so much for sharing
so don't forget to tell me what you are working on or proud
with the hashtag #heyMayuko
and you might get the chance for shoutout on my next video
other than that i think we are done we are actually done
so we're good to go i will see you next time. bye
