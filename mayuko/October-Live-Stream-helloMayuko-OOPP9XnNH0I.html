tell me that like you can hear me if you
can okay cool
all right Thank You leo so hi everyone
so good to see you all um sorry about
the delay the YouTube livestream
experience is not great so I just had a
little bit of technical difficulty again
unfortunately I know last month two
months ago now I was trying to do it and
it didn't work so well so cool alright
so I would love to know where you all
are tuning in from let me know your name
and where you're based and yeah Wow 436
people already that's incredible thank
you so much um I don't have a whole like
agenda or anything necessarily for what
I want to talk about but you know I'll
just kind of generally take any
questions and we can just hang out I
know there's been a lot of new
subscribers Wow okay I just hit 50k so
again this is a 50k stream woohoo so
yeah I'd like to just get to know you
all and we can all just hang out and
have a fun time so let me catch up this
chat is streaming so quickly alright
from Bali Italy Sweden Tunisia Canada
Portugal Texas in the abreu India
Germany Canada Boston Cleveland wow this
is such an international group
my goodness wow wow wow wow
type hey he's from Iowa SoCal yeah SoCal
good rep sweet incredible yeah this is
live right now oh my gosh all right all
right I have to like scroll down well
thank you so much all for joining uh
sweet so yeah i oh gosh okay alright so
how about I start taking questions and
we can resolve out together I might be
munching on something I have I woke up
with an hour ago and I'm still kind of
eating breakfast and I've just got my
tea here per usual today it's just black
tea or milk tea I guess milk bhakti see
oh there's a slower mood for chat let's
see how can I do that Oh show I don't
think there was a slower mode ooh this
is cool all right
unfortunately I wish I could turn it
this way but it says orientation is
locked or up rotate device back so okay
seat oh I stopped Netflix and I got a
notification for your channel thank you
so much that means a lot
is anyone watching stranger things I
started watching it last night because I
got released season two and it's so good
I have to stop myself from like binging
it completely so alright
Wow Wow you finished Ranger things too
already dang that is incredible oh my
gosh you all are in Ted's that's awesome
I mean it's a very very very addicting
show so you know make sense cool um
sweet I am slightly like overwhelmed and
floored by how engaged you I you all are
for my videos so I just need to pick a
question and start off alright do I
watch Rick your morning by chance I
don't I am NOT on that bad wagon um do I
need coffee to survive I drink I'm
trying to do like one cup of coffee a
day it is hard to sometimes especially
what I'm like really need a crank or
really tired to go for two but anything
over to it get really jittery so I don't
where I where do i do my questions just
pop them in down here I'm going to try
my best to answer them the the chat is
literally going it like this speed so
I'm trying to make sure that I can
answer everyone's okay I've gotten a lot
of questions about Kotlin so far for
Android development
um I am an iOS engineer and I'm aware
that Kotlin is a thing I don't know any
Android engineers who are writing in
Kotlin quite yet I'm very interested to
see like the the difference between like
Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS
Swift is the new programming language
for iOS that came out like three or four
years ago now by Apple open source super
cool it's like kind of the future of iOS
development and so there's been a lot of
like stuff in the iOS community about
Swift so if you are coding in Kotlin let
me know and let me know as you think
about it in this trap Swift just similar
to Cullen yeah the syntax is like
definitely like both Swift and Kotlin
has simplified the syntax for Java and
it took to see a lot more and is really
modernized it so I'm pretty excited
about
so yeah um cool people have been I've
seen a couple that are like how do I get
started on iOS programming I'm actually
going to make a video about this very
soon with my friend Hector who's also an
iOS engineer and we're going to talk a
little bit more about iOS development
but to get you started for anyone who's
really interested
I really really highly recommend just
kind of going to the Apple developer
website and getting started on some of
the basic tutorials that they have
I also recommend starting in Swift then
objective-c right now because all the
tutorials you're gonna find are gonna be
in Swift that's kind of like the
language that Apple is speaking nowadays
and from now on like Swift is just gonna
get bigger and bigger and so I think
yeah so if like but in Swift some
websites that I really really like are
raid Wonderlic com
ra y w en de r li CH com I'll actually
post a link of my Twitter later on so
that y'all can see and yeah I'll post a
link on my Twitter so that yeah they
have a bunch of iOS tutorials like
literally every type of iOS tutorial you
could imagine and so yeah I it to like
learn new iOS stuff all the time and
it's incredible cool all right what's my
Twitter my Twitter is hello my you go so
I have brand alignment across all the
different things so yeah alright um what
am i currently working on that something
you could talk about yes so I am working
on an app called patreon lens it's kind
of people have compared as snapchat or
Instagram stories but we're kind of
making a patreon S version of it so I've
been working on that as well as working
on some exciting things with the other
patreon table right now so see
where did I learn all this stuff uh you
know just try it just everywhere from
college from friends from work see what
or who is your inspiration my
inspiration uh you know there's a lot of
different people that inspire me and I
guess like a lot of some of those people
who inspire me include like Simone yecch
Hannah Hart and yeah there's there's
wonderful role models out there that I
look up to but I think the thing that
motivates me the most is to like always
think be thinking about like kind of my
purpose in life I know it sounds cheesy
but I'm very good at making excuses for
myself and so I tried to figure out what
is it that I really want to do that's
authentic to me and stick to it it's a
really hard question to answer I feel
like I've only started to form and an
answer to it this last year and so yeah
it's it's difficult but that's what gets
me up in the morning to figure out what
what can I do to help people to get a
job as a software engineer and Dean you
know everything about the programming
language no no no no oh there's a lot of
I get a lot of like what's the best
program and they wish to learn to get a
software engineering job know that you
don't have to like know a program
language to get a job especially if
you're coming out of college or even
like if you're mid-career if you are
applying for another role it's more it's
not so much the programming languages as
it is like the architectures and
frameworks that you should be familiar
with
so like general like my friend Jarvis is
talking about like back-end coding like
back in engineering you can write it in
Ruby you can write it in Python can
write it in Java the programming
language is not as important as the
actual patterns involved and so don't
stress too much on what programming
languages should learn first but to get
started
on a programming language I would
definitely do a lot of research into
like water companies hiring for right
now if that's kind of like your end goal
of like getting hired at a company and
also you know what is the language that
appeals to you what languages are well
supported online so when you do a Google
search for like python tutorial or java
tutorial see what comes up if there's a
lot of results that means there's a lot
of support for it on the community so
you can debug your issues very easily
and so yeah that's that's kind of my
question or that's kind of my answer um
let's see Wow there are so many
questions okay all right let's see
what's my favorite part about my job I
have a whole video on this which I hope
you've watched called
60 reasons I love being a software
engineer and that was kind of outline
exactly what those are particularly in
my job right now the role that I'm in I
work at patreon a membership platform
that helps creators get paid and I'm
very passionate about it because I
really love you too obviously a starting
youtube channel but I've been really
interested in like youtubers and have
watched youtube since like the beginning
of it in high school and so being able
to help those folks get you know what
get the money get paid for what they
make is something that really excites me
so yeah
is it too late to start learning
programming when bachelor program
already started no it's not if you have
already if you're already you in your
four years of college you were declared
another major um you know you're
thinking about maybe switching to
computer science but you can't or you
know you don't know if you can I think
you can definitely take an intro to
computer science class at your
University and see how that goes
intro to computer science or software
engineering or whatever the equivalent
is at your university is really well set
up to be able to really introduce the
computer science fundamentals really
well and get you started and coding as
soon as possible so try that out and see
what you think and then also like you
know talk to the professor in that class
and ask what are some reach what are
some good resources how do I further
this more without needing to declare an
entire major around it I had a friend in
college who was an econ major and then
he got a job doing website development
and then you realized you really like
computer science and so he did not quite
switch over his major to computer
science but he took up a minor but
really what he did was just take like a
bunch of computer science classes and
now he's a software engineer so yeah by
the way thank you all so much would like
the love this is incredible I I I can't
believe how many eyes are watching this
right now and I am floored by all of
your support so thank you so much do I
play video games I don't really I am a
terrible video gamer I'm very excited
about video games but I don't stay on
for a very long time so most recently I
think we bought the Nintendo switch and
so I played legends of Zelda for a good
amount of time and then I fell off
because I was like I have to be in the
right mental mode and the right mental
state to be able to play Zelda and so
yeah I have a plan a long time because I
made it to special' would have that for
me to just pick
to play but love all the Pokemon games
have a 3ds and so playing Pokemon
playing any of the games there is fun
I'm not really a computer gamer though I
don't play like League of Legends or
Starcraft or any of those unfortunately
I'm so happy when I find your channel
when there aren't and mini software
female software engineers thank you so
much umm let's see how do you manage
your timer stay organized oh this is the
thing that I'm constantly trying to
improve one system that I picked up
recently to help you with this is bullet
journaling but kind of a step take a
step back before that I think generally
speaking I'm really bad at keeping
things up here and so I try my best to
just like write it down so I've tried
using like notes the Notes app on my
computer use Trello used Evernote
you know I used a lot of different
productivity things to make sure that
whatever I'm thinking or whatever I'm
like trying to do is record it somewhere
and I took up bullet journaling because
of the freeform nosov it and because you
don't have to subscribe to a system and
it's a system that you make and
especially with like work stuff and
YouTube stuff and personalized stuff and
also wedding planning there's just a lot
of different things that are kind of
like swirling around that I need to do
so I took a bullet journaling after
being inspired by fellow youtuber
charlie marietv and also Matt Ragland
who have both shown the insides of their
bullet journal and talked about how it
works for them so I picked it up and
it's really great generally speaking
it's like you get to show you get to
plan for like what you what you have
done what you're doing in the future and
what you're currently focused on so a
great way to stay organized um let's see
hey Jarvis yes big fan of writing
everything down yep um alright yeah
everyone's very excited to see Jarvis in
the stream hmm let's see
- did you - do you think writing both
iOS and Android apps from react native
will make swift and Colin useless what
do you think of react native Hot Topic
yeah react so for it yeah for those of
you who don't know reacts native is a
framework written by Facebook that
allows you to write like one set of code
I guess for lack of a better term and to
be able to like compile it and release
it as two different as like an Android
app and an iOS app so you don't have to
have like an Android developer an iOS
developer per se you can just have like
an engineer writing JavaScript which is
the language that react native uses to
create two apps so it's very efficient
for those who need two apps like an
Android and iOS app but maybe have
limited you know people to write them
but yeah reacting is really interesting
I have not written a whole lot of react
native I've done some like intro and
like quick tutorial things I don't think
that it's going to dwarf iOS or Android
development like pure native development
at all because Walt react native is
becoming a very like popular and very
stable framework at the end of the day
like Facebook is not creating iPhones or
making Xcode or you know writing the
compiler or anything like that and so
yeah I guess I can talk more from the
iOS side but because of that react
native is a great way for people to get
apps out there quickly and to like make
best use of you know limited people
writing their apps but I think they're
really powerful stuff and yeah the
really powerful stuff comes from writing
native apps as well as just like the
fact that Apple can change something in
Facebook has to kind of like react to
the change in order to support it in
their framework is
makes it so that you can't really well
it'll catch up eventually but you know
you have to wait a little bit for like
new stuff to come out sometimes okay Wow
all right I'm gonna take a sip of tea
because I'm thirsty from talking so much
oh my goodness this child is going so
quickly all right
um let's see did you do
yeah the chat really is flying isn't it
no okay Oh how old am i I'm 25 I just
turned 25 like a couple weeks ago so
that answers I hope like five questions
do I use vim or Emacs I I guess I use
more vim but I don't really use either
because I use Xcode but when I do need
some sort of like text editor I use atom
C to do tabs or spaces I use tabs but
you know it's whatever you want to use
um
did you know Cho hey Andy how's it going
good to see you in here do I speak
Japanese I do speak Japanese um does it
matter where you get your degree from um
I would say no in the grand scheme of
things
um I think where you get your degree
from might help you know if you're just
to get a Bachelor of Science in computer
science
it might help for like when you're first
graduating and getting a job I know some
companies are selective about the
universities that they recruit from and
also because they get so many
applications like from students you know
one deciding factor could be where you
received your education but I've been
I'm like starting to enter kind of like
the mid-career stage of my career and
I'm noticing more and more they're like
I don't really care where you got your
degree from like that doesn't really
necessarily speak to how good of a
developer you are you know there's a lot
of different things that make a good
developer that sounds like a video idea
which I should do but yeah just to kind
of like speak off the cuff about what I
think those things are
you know having good solid foundational
like expertise and also sometimes
mastery of what your of like the tech
stock that you're in so if you're an iOS
engineer you should know kind of like
the Apple frameworks objective-c Swift
how to use Xcode really really well
I think another good I think another
mark that like differentiates a good
engineer from others is being able to
speak about what you're building really
well is too and so like being able to
teach other people what you're working
on and how things work is an incredible
mark of maturity for software engineers
I think and also like I think the third
one is being kind of like a good person
to work with being a good teammate being
yeah being kind of just like a good
person being collaborative being open to
feedback those things make working with
other people really easy and I think
that's an incredibly important part
about being a software engineer cool
thanks Aaron for quechua and helping out
with the live stream I really appreciate
it
it's really good to see people that I
know in this live stream so thank you
all for joining all right
do I know any electrical engineers I
know a couple of my fiance actually
study electrical engineering but he's a
software engineer now so cool um do I
use github yes I do
yay let's see
well by the way how is how are all of
your days nights mornings wherever you
are going
it's 10:57 a.m. on a Sunday here and
today it's actually kind of cloudy it's
been really hot recently so I pulled out
my sweater and I feel like it's finally
fall right before Halloween
so feels good okay oh I can make people
moderators how do I do that
Oh oh cool wonderful okay I'm going to
add some people those moderators Wow
thank you for the tip wonderful okay
let's go down to the bottom
cool 757 p.m. on Sunday 16 o'clock 7
p.m. oh so it's like nighttime where a
lot of you are all are cool cool cool 3
a.m. at Tokyo wow thank you so much for
joining in from Tokyo how do you got
those I lost last 700 people talking
it's like a TED talk on here I know I
feel a little under prepared ah
I did a livestream I want to say it was
like in August or September on Instagram
wife I was going to go live on YouTube
and YouTube live chat stuff was buggy
and I couldn't go live and so there's
about like I think 50 people in the chat
at once so going from 50 people to 650
at once is incredible and now I
empathize with all the people who I wash
live streams with because this this is
very quick cool sweet 12 a.m. Monday in
India
well thank you all right
thank you so much for the love Oh
any advice for starting a new graduate
sree job in a week still unsure what
Sree is I believe SR e stands for site
reliability engineer and well from what
I know you help with like DevOps and
keeping the site running so making sure
that performance for the site is like
good making sure that things don't go
down instilling processees too so that
you know the site doesn't break if any
of you are SRT engineers then I would
love some help and let us know what you
do
are there any electrical engine using
your office no there aren't do I work
with them no unfortunately not I know
there are some companies you know who
like work with hardware so I imagine
like you know companies like Apple that
make iPhones and TV Apple TVs and watch
os's there's electrical engineers that
work there but my company doesn't do any
hardware or build any hardware things so
no electrical engineers unfortunately
all right where to go for uni I went to
University of California San Diego in
sunny in California cool
do I have to graduate from computer
science to be a developer can I for
example learn from website called
treehouse and have a job uh yeah you
don't have to have a degree to become a
software engineer boot camps are never
another popular way for people to become
and get software engineering jobs
without needing to without needing to
get a computer science degree and so
yeah I think you know it's stuff I think
you can definitely build the skills to
become a software engineer just by
looking at online stuff if you're very
like google savvy and everything but
yeah maybe a more difficult part of it
is like convincing others that you can
do the job well and I think that comes
from networking and you know working
with other people who might be able to
give you some jobs or give you
connections and stuff and kind of like
about tree that like yeah this person
can code really well so yeah I would say
that like boot camps and colleges like
studying computer science university
gives a lot of good structure for
studying computer science and learning
how to become a software engineer and so
yeah um how old was I when I started
programming I was eighteen I want to say
yeah I was 18 so I'm not yeah I'm not a
like I coded since I was 10 or 14 so
yeah
yes Thank You Aaron I do like to
surround my headphones a lot to
concentrate I listen to a lot of music
too just like we have an open office and
so we don't have walls and so whenever I
need to like get in the mood I'll
usually have like a cup of coffee and
headphones just like groove that's how I
stay focused but also another bit of
focus or another like piece of advice
for focusing is making sure that I'm
only focusing on one thing at a time in
order to focus on one thing at a time
kind of going back to what I said
earlier about about like taking all the
things in my head and storing them
somewhere else has been really helpful
so that I have kind of like a structured
like list in front of me that's tangible
so that I can actually focus on one
thing at a time and get them done if I
have like ten things to do and I'm
thinking about them all at once none of
them gets done and I get overwhelmed by
that pretty easily and so yeah that's
that's one way that helps cool Wow okay
sorry
I like accidentally opened up the thing
did you do
Wow okay I need to like actually
straight up scroll see Lisa Campbell you
got anything while asking how many days
how many hours a day do we have to code
to be a good software engineer that's up
to you some people can code two hours a
day and be a good software engineer some
people code 14 hours a day to be a good
software engineer I think it's important
to figure out what kind of software
engineer you want to be and you know set
a goal and then plan out for yourself
how what do I need to do to get there me
I typically code like anywhere from
anyone from honestly zero hours a day of
coding depending on what my day looks
like to like six hours a day in coding
so yeah cool all right I've seen this
question multiple times resources
offline or off get some tips on how to
learn code resources in which language
should I use first depending on what
kind of software engineering you want to
do if you're interested in mobile
backend front-end the language will
change there also I realized at the same
time you might not know what kind of
technology you want to work on
iving myself being soft like an iOS
engineer I recommend starting on Swift
and yeah Apple has basically written
Swift because well so one of the reasons
why they invented Swift was to make it a
lot more approachable and easier for
people to learn code if you have an iPad
actually there's the cool app called
Swift playgrounds that kind of teaches
you how to code in Swift and that app is
like solely there to teach people how to
code and so if you have an iPad download
that app
otherwise you know look up tutorials for
Python look up tutorials for JavaScript
I think those are kind of like the hot
ones right now and yeah I recommend that
cool any tips for being an intern yes if
you're gonna be an intern if you are
trying to get land an intern and you're
going to start an internship my biggest
piece of advice is to don't be afraid to
ask questions being an intern means that
you're there to learn and people don't
necessarily expect you to get things
like to start cranking on day one or
even day 10 and so like you're kind of
there to absorb information and then
take that information and hopefully make
something out of it and so the more
information you can absorb the better if
you can't fix a bug and you've spent
like three hours on it don't be afraid
to ask a software engineer there and
help you out it's much better for you to
like you know ask questions early and
often than to like wait two days and be
like hey I've been stuck on this bug for
two days and so yeah don't be afraid to
do that and and have fun to enjoy just a
lot of fun make friends with you know
other interns make friends with other
software engineers get to know the
company really well so yeah alright
let's add some more moderators see okay
um
when did I move to the US all right lots
of questions about like where I grew up
and stuff so I was born in the United
States and I've been living here most of
my life so I've only lived in Japan for
like two years and I was when I was
really little and so yeah I'm I'm
American and I've spent more time in the
US than Japan but my parents are both
Japanese so I speak Japanese because
they taught me Japanese and yeah cool
sweet did you do yes plus one please
don't ask me questions
I'm also not gonna answer some questions
related to some personal stuff because
that's my personal life but I'm happy to
answer other questions as well oh okay
so can't caman came in asks I want to
study for a software engineer but should
I apply for computer systems and
technologies or software and Internet
technologies major I get a lot of
questions about like what major should I
be sure to be computer science major
should I be software engineering major
should I be internet technologies major
that and I know there's a lot of
different permutations of tech majors
and my best advice for you especially if
you have already committed to going to a
university or if you are at a university
is to go talk to the department head for
like computer science software stuff
each University has a very different
curriculum for what they teach as part
of their like different majors that they
offer and I highly recommend going to
talk to them to see if they align with
what you want to do you know you can ask
them questions like Oh what companies do
these people with these majors go to
after they graduate what do they do
after they graduate like what are some
of the things that I'll learn where does
the coursework
those are the kinds of questions that I
would ask I can't give you the answer
unfortunately I can maybe give you the
answer for if you go to UCSD um but you
know each University is very different
and they have different goals and they
have a different set of professors
different faculty heads etc so that's my
biggest piece of advice for y'all
ya UCSD is there anyone here who goes or
what TCS t it's exciting hey Hector
how's it goin yeah everyone you should
check out Hector he does a livestream
like three or four times a week correct
me if I'm wrong of to teach everyone how
to do iOS development and I've like
picked in a couple times it's on Twitch
and it's super fun I will also retweet
his tweet for his live stream later but
if you all are interested in that
he's a crying he's great Oh like five
times a week sorry he's great at
teaching iOS development and he's
incredible so definitely check him out
what degree did I graduate with I
graduated with a computer science degree
do I like hackathons I've actually never
done a hackathon before well sort of
I've done like different like hack day
type of things at companies um but I'm
not sure my definition of hackathon is
kind of like you code a lot for like two
days and then you present a thing so
yeah I guess I have done a hackathon
they're fun they help me to like really
concentrate and get scrappy on making
something which feels good you know
especially when like a projects at work
can take like weeks and months and stuff
like doing a hackathon and think
starting with an idea and building it
within the you know - one or two days
it's really fun I'm also the camaraderie
that comes with it on building it with
your friends is really fun as well but
I'm not someone who like actually goes
out and seeks them like hackathons I
really like like taking my time being
thoughtful about what I'm making and
it's
so yeah I don't know maybe it's
something I'll get into later but yeah
yeah it's really difficult to ask
questions I'm really sorry for everyone
who's like who I haven't asked the
questions too
but uh or who I haven't answered
questions of but this just tells me that
I need to do more of these would you all
be interested in like a monthly like
livestream hangout maybe
and also let me know if you prefer like
YouTube livestream or Instagram
livestream or anything like that yeah oh
cool see okay people are saying yes
awesome
that's that's cool yeah I named this the
October livestream because it's like the
last couple of days of October I didn't
really know what else to call it
cool what's my word per minute typing
speed I think it's like 90-something
last time I checked pretty fast I credit
that all to like instant messaging from
when I was a teenager so rest in peace
a.m. but that's where I learn how to
type um cool what do I think about VIPRE
architecture uh yeah um I think it's I
think it makes sense for specific code
bases but I think it's a little
heavy-handed it's if you have if you
need the VIPRE architectures and use it
if it's going to simplify the code that
you're using or the code that you're
working with but I more often use like
model-view-controller type of stuff
which is like pretty straightforward I'm
gonna look up the definition for the
VIPRE architecture so that I can like
describe it correctly for those of you
who don't know what it is
I know it's come in and right now it's
talked about in iOS but I'm not sure if
it's yeah okay so it's a it's an iOS
thing let's see who objective-c de IO
one of my favorite blogs
see if I can figure out it says vipera
is an application of clean architecture
to iOS apps the word Viper is a
backronym for view interactor presenter
entity and routing it divides an apple
structure into the distinct layers or
responsibilities makes it easier to
isolate dependencies and to test
interactions of the boundaries between
layers yep
and generally I would I would say that
like most architectures are there til I
divide your apps logical structure into
distinct layers but Viper does a lot
vibrant of changes or divides up the
layers even more okay do you think
college is most difficult than your
daily job I think it was I hmm this
might change in the future but I think
I'm definitely more of like I want to
like build stuff in industry and like
work and stuff and give my skills to
that more so than like really study a
bunch of computer science things so I
definitely like working a lot more
because I get to see that you know what
I make gets used by real people and
improves their lives at the same time
people in academia for computer science
are incredible and they're you know
making new discoveries and inventing new
things every day so that's cool but yeah
college was really hard for me and I
didn't do it very well to be honest so
cool thanks Aaron for moderating by the
way it's been very it's very very
helpful and thank you so much ok I'm a
junior developer I need advice on tasks
time estimation hey this is something
that you know I think everyone is like
working at I'm still working at it
estimation I think the first thing to
know about estimation is that estimation
is an art and not a science understand
that it's like real people who are you
know building things and so things can
come up you know different people have
different speeds of like building stuff
but generally speaking I think having a
common language for estimation between
your teammates is really important
also the other thing about like
estimation should be more about
complexity than it is about the time you
would need to build something is also
really important and I think being able
to track how well your estimations have
been and using that knowledge to
estimate future tasks is is also a good
way to do that cool do you recommend
moving jobs every 1 to 2 or 1/2 years to
boost salary in early years not really I
know there's a whole thing about like
you know you should move you know
computer science and software engineers
like change jobs every one to two years
which you know I would say is like
somewhat common but it's not so much to
like boost salary although maybe that's
some people's motives as it is that you
know they want more opportunities and
they want to learn something new because
of the nature of software development it
moves SuperDuper quickly and so one to
two years it's like you get a lot done
and ones to use you also learn you know
a lot but you know if you if salary
something that you're looking to boost
like why not interview at a bunch of
places and then like you know negotiate
there and see what's the best you can
get I yeah I'm more of like I'll move
jobs when I don't feel like I can learn
a lot or I'm not as excited about like
the company what the company's doing
anymore and right now I'm really happy
with it I feel like I'm gonna stay my
company forever so I thought I was also
gonna be someone who moves every one to
two years but you know it's really like
what do you want in life and make
decisions about your life based on that
so cool
um you said of one of your videos that
you did bachelors and CSD say you're a
software engineer they aren't considered
the same in my country interesting I
didn't know that
yeah actually from reading all of your
comments I didn't know that software
engineering was like major Mattson
universities and I'm curious to see if
that's like you know different major
between different countries or if
there's like universities in America
that have that like have a BS and
software engineering really curious like
at my at my school we didn't have a
software engineering degree everyone
went through computer science you know
we had like a bachelor's of Art in
computer science as well as well as like
human-computer interaction as a major
but yeah I really want to learn more
about that so hey drama what's going on
I'm shooting a collab with DOMA later
today so I care for that um with a
stream revealing a channel later I
believe so yeah I'll keep it up there
I'll maybe make a playlist for all the
live streams that I'll be doing so see
ah where did all my chats go okay um
woohoo so fast so so fast what's the
highest solo of math you've taken um
shoot differential equations or vector
calculus probably vector calculus I
don't remember any of it I honestly I
remember doing matrix calculations yeah
this is embarrassing
okay I have an idea for an app I'd know
how to code should I spend my time
learning how to code or should I get
someone to make for me depends on what
you want to do I know a lot of my
questions a lot I know a lot of my
answers are like depends on what you
want depends on what you want to do but
really like you know if you have the
time to you know learn how to code what
you want to do then
I highly recommend doing so I think one
of the best ways to learn how to code is
to build something well actually I think
it is the best way to cook because you
know I think I think of code is like a
tool and you know just looking at the
tool and just studying the tool like say
you have a hammer which is a tool and
you want to let you're like I want to
learn how to use a hammer and like
what's the best way to learn how to
hammer and you could just like use the
hammer and just like you know learn how
to hold it learn you know just like make
the motion of like hammering something
but you're gonna learn your the best way
to learn how to use a hammer is to use a
hammer and building something so that's
kind of how I think about code apologies
for the bad analogy but yeah I think you
will learn a lot on you know about code
for like what you need to what you need
to know to learn an app or what you need
to learn to build an app and so if
that's something you're interested in
then do it I also think like building
with another person is really fun kind
of for the same reasons that you might
like work out with another person you
have to motivate each other get to be
each other support system you can you
know help each other learn stuff and so
yeah I think that's really fun but yeah
if you have some friends who can get you
who can help you get started that's also
another it's also another way of doing
so cool what would I be if I didn't go
to computer science oh I don't know
that's a good question maybe I I think
maybe a teacher yeah
cool by the way
Halloween's in like three days what are
y'all gonna be or do you celebrate
Halloween I'm still trying to get my
costume together and it's a little
stressful
I think Halloween is kind of like prom
where you like stress forever about what
you're gonna wear and then you wear it
for a night and then it's fun but it's
also just like a lot of stress so yeah
let me know what you think okay
Halloween isn't big in Jamaica okay when
to be a broke college student for
Halloween is that like how how what what
does that look like how hard was a
learning curve for coating for you I
think pretty so one one thing that I
remember from college was that when I
was taking the intro to computer science
class like the very first class I took
for computer science and I I didn't I
think I wasn't like paying attention in
lecture or something but I went to the
labs to do a programming assignment and
I would like called over one of the
tutors and I was like hey how do I do
this and they're like okay well do you
know how to use for loops and I was like
no what what's a for loop and they're
like you don't know what a for loop is I
was like no I don't so yeah I kind of
started there I think coding was kind of
hard for me but once I figured out the
tools for how to write programs and it
gets easier and easier I also think like
I've said before that logical reasoning
is really important and helps you to
reason about what code you're gonna
write and so coding is kind of like a
natural language for me now and before
so yeah thank you for your answer I'll
see what I can do that you learned in
code with a friend who's also into apps
hopefully that will be beneficial yeah
that would be really fun I like like
making something with another person
that's
I think the most fun what languages you
are using mostly I'm using objective-c
mostly right now what have have you been
to any conferences this year if so what
was your favorite yes I went to a couple
of conferences this year I went to WOD C
which is a Worldwide Developers
Conference and that's hosted by Apple
and that's like the official Apple
Developers Conference there they reveal
I think that's the one where they reveal
the new iOS version I want to say like
iOS TV OS watch OS and so therefore they
reveal all these new frameworks that are
coming out and so there's a bunch of
talks by Apple engineers about like the
stuff that they're making and the stuff
that's gonna be released as well as labs
so if you're stuck on something you know
while you're coding your iOS app you can
go and directly talk to the engineers
there that was really fun I went to the
Grace Hopper conference a couple weeks
ago that vlog is on my channel if you
haven't seen it already but Grace Hopper
conference is the world's largest
conference for Women in Technology and
there's a wind of talks there's a career
fair there's nighttime social events and
this year there were 18,000 people so
that was really cool I really liked both
conferences the world the WTCC
conference is really fun because there's
just so many iOS developers and being in
a room with all of them is like
incredible and also learning directly
from the Apple engineers for like all
the new stuff that's coming out is
really cool too and yeah that that was
fun I learned a lot there Grace Hopper
conference is really fun I like going
because it really energizes me every
time I go it's it just like the amount
of people that are there I'm always like
amazed by and so yeah the talks are
really great the people all like every
single attendee at Grace Hopper is super
kind and it's one of the most like
positive most constructive conference
conferences just purely because of the
people that go there and I really like
going so hopefully I'll be able to go
next year as well
um can you suggest a good game
developing academy oh I can't I don't
know any actually so if you know of any
let me know down there in the comments
would you like to start your own
software business yeah maybe one day not
right now though but that would be cool
to do did it do let's see Wow okay by
the way a lot of like any repeat
questions and stuff I'm not answering
again but I believe the video will be
live on my youtube channel I think yeah
it will be and so you can go back and
watch and look for your answer maybe I
can do a thing of like tagging the times
with the questions so you can see
through them easier I like it when other
youtubers do that so I might do that
alright let's see so I'm gonna be on for
another ten minutes and then I'm gonna
head out so just a quick time check
big fan what's your work schedule like I
know some places that allow you to work
a pretty open schedule as long as your
dearie ours yeah um I get a lot of
comments on my life day in the life
video they're like oh you only work this
many hours but yeah generally it's like
10:00 to 6:00 ish you know depending on
the train schedule like I'll get in at
10:30
sometimes even 5:30 or sometimes I'll
get in at 10:00 leave at 6:30 it really
depends but more recently I've been
trying to like wake up earlier and so
now it's been more like 9:30 to like
5:00 or 5:30 and yeah some like some
companies allow for a very like flex
schedule it depends on what hours work
best for you some people are night owls
some people are morning people
and so yeah companies all that like some
companies allow you to do that but
generally you know because software
engineering is very collaborative I feel
like having kind of like a common time
for people to be able to gather and work
on stuff together is important and
whether that be online or in person
doesn't matter
but yeah okey-dokey what will my next
video will be about um let's see so I
think I'm so I shot a collab with Jo ma
like a couple weeks ago about everything
about internships so everything about
how to get them why to do them what you
should do in them just any advice and
tips and also just stories from our own
experiences so I think that one's gonna
be next I'm also gonna be doing another
one about like interviewing sometime mid
next mid-november
I also want to do a video about boot
camps I'm just kind of just like intro
you to what they are and what are some
of the ones that I know of what they do
they teach you what to expect and I
might do kind of like some fun ones too
honestly I've been doing I feel like my
videos have kind of focused more on like
what are things about software
engineering but I want to put more of
like myself in my life a little more out
there so maybe like a what's in my
backpack video or like I don't know
something like that if you have any
suggestions let me know I want to do
some more like fun content things so
let's see yeah be on it interviewing
yeah to do
hmm draw my life video oh that could be
interesting yeah I'm not a very good
chart but that doesn't stop people cool
thoughts on data science data science is
incredible they say that the the
currency this day and age and technology
is data and so yeah very important I
don't know that much about like I don't
really have any skills in doing data
science things I took one artificial and
or actually no machine learning class in
college and that's about the extent that
I know but you know data-driven
decisions data-driven you know features
and stuff are a big thing nowadays so
yeah thought so those are my thoughts on
data science it's cool how do you
resolve the stressful situations
work-related great question um I think
one thing that I am trying to actually
do in stressful situations at work is to
really think logically about the
situation and really think objectively
but at the same time still keep a pulse
on like how I'm feeling about everything
I think it's impossible for me to be
robotic I'm a person I have feelings and
but at the same time like trying to
resolve things democratically especially
if it's like amongst co-workers and
stuff I think communication is the best
policy and so if there's you know
something some awkward thing that's
happening between you and another person
I really think like talking to that
person and being honest about it is the
most important thing but I'm I'm very
like open to talking about my feelings
at work and so I'll say them and I'm not
afraid to and I think just honesty is a
good policy if you're feeling stressed
in terms of like there's too much work
to do then you know I like take breaks I
like go on walks the other day I was
like I was like stressed after working
or after coding for a while so I just
like clean out my desk to not think
about coding for a little bit and so I
think it's important to take breaks and
let yourself the time to
you know just chill so can't be working
all the time alright do I use read it
sometimes I used to years I did a lot
more in college alright five more
minutes people five more minutes and
then hopefully I will schedule another
one next month maybe yeah what's the
long as you stayed up for a project I
stayed up 40 hours one's for my
compilers class and college and that was
like I stayed awake for 48 hours I
probably coded more for like 17 to 20
hours that was grueling that was the
longest I've ever stayed up and I never
want to do that again
and so I'm actively like trying to live
a lifestyle trying to communicate the
fact that like that's something that I
will never do for I mean anything
probably unless you know maybe the time
comes to do so so we'll see you watch my
in life video on a regular basis oh
thanks it's kind of interesting because
my day in the life video is a very first
video that I put out
but it's my most popular wine and I'm
slightly kind of like I'm not
embarrassed by it but I'm a little bit
like uh I feel like I would want to do
this video again sometime maybe in like
a year maybe my day and the life has
changed it's already changed because I
started doing more YouTube stuff and
that's kind of been like my side project
and so yeah maybe I'll make one like in
a year maybe I'll do like a one year
anniversary day-in-the-life or something
we'll see
let's see average hours of sleep I sleep
I definitely need like eight hours do I
accept fan mail not yet I don't
unfortunately should I get master after
I finished co-op college or find a job
instead depends on what you want to do I
went for a job because I was like done
with school I didn't want to like study
anymore and I wanted to like use my
skills to apply them to you know like
building something for people but you
know I know a lot of people who go
get their masters because they really
want to deepen their knowledge in a
specific area of computer science or
software engineering like big data or
like you know game engines or like
human-computer interaction so it depends
on what you're interested in and just go
with your gut let's see
do you plan working abroad one day I
maybe I yeah maybe it could be cool I
also want to just like like go more
abroad I haven't gone abroad in a while
and so I feel like that's a start
visiting first and then deciding whether
I want to work there we'll see um do you
ever interact with UX designers how's
the experience yes I do I interact with
UX designers UI designers researchers on
a daily basis and it's really fun I
really really like working with
designers because I think just kind of
tying back to my passion of like working
on something that like people use I'm
want to make like I love pairing with
designers on brainstorming what are the
ways that can make you know an
interaction really cool and easy to use
and what users need and so yeah I like
it a lot it's fun I've worked with
awesome designers and I love them all
and it's great cool uh are you going to
do a coding challenge maybe what's a
coding challenge what what are you
thinking of when you think of a coding
challenge like me to encourage challenge
or I assign a coding challenge for
everyone maybe AME and reddit that's a
good idea then I can actually mean the
answer a lot of these considering how
many people are in here we'll see yeah
would you be interested in an AMA on
reddit I don't know we'll see
um could you possibly do a video about
interviews and what you need to know for
interviews yeah yeah that um that's yeah
that's a video I'm working on right now
so look out for that if there's any like
quick questions that I can answer about
interviews I'd be happy to do so what do
you think about computer science it's
cool just experience really matter when
you apply for a job
it can unfortunately I think it's funny
that people are like it's like an
entry-level job but you have to have two
years of experience which yeah this job
like listings are stupid um but yeah I
think there's certain there's different
way stocks also create experiences for
yourself like doing side projects
working on an app with a friend like you
know even just school projects and stuff
so yeah what's the last song I've
listened to
ooh I listened to choices Vaughn's album
yesterday and I think the song called
for him I love that song it's my jam
right now do you do am i doing any
freelancer work no not right now
actually two kind of going along with
that your free time hobby right now it's
YouTube you do is you know takes a quite
a bit of time to do especially
considering that I have a full-time job
as well so alright um let's see last
question I'm gonna find one last
question to answer let's see yeah I I
guess I I definitely want to say like
thank you all so much for joining in I'm
there's still there's always been
there's been like at least 500 people in
this livestream at a time that is
incredible
and you know thank you all so much for
the love especially on all the videos
like like I want to pump out a lot more
videos to be able to answer all of your
questions and hopefully help you along
with your journey in computer science so
alright alright I still didn't find a
last question there's fine last question
uh-huh
how and why that's a good question
I'm doing well I'm yeah I'm doing really
well um it's yeah it's good my life is
good yesterday i sat back and almost
like I've been really busy for a long
time but all the things that I've been
busy with have been things that I've
been really wanting to do and all things
that I'm very passionate about so I felt
very lucky and grateful that I can do
the things that I do so see alright
thank you again everyone for joining and
I'm going to make sure that this is live
on my youtube channel afterwards but I
hope you all have a great day no matter
where you are and thank you especially
to those who have tuned in late at night
but I will hopefully announce another
live stream and also come out with new
videos soon and don't forget to follow
me on Twitter
hello may you go and also on Instagram
hello may you go Twitter for like my
random musings Instagram I post a lot of
stories on there about my day which I
will do more of and so yeah thank you
again so much and hope you all have a
great day alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
