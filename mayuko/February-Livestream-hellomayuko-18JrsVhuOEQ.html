thank you for coming to my live stream
can you all see me I have the live chat
to the right let's make sure this thing
is working hi yay
I'm guessing y'all can see me yes yay
whoa this is trippy okay hold on one sec
I have to do a thing which is there we
go
okay so there's a little bit of lag
between my camera and the stream and I
have the stream on behind my cameras so
I heard myself a little bit okay awesome
good morning everybody or good evening
or good afternoon or good whatever
middle of the night it is and thank you
so much for coming to my live stream
yeah awesome this is incredible yay
thank you all for joining so I have a
little bit of an agenda today and let me
first start off with that so first I'm
gonna go over a couple announcements
some exciting things that I have I'm
just gonna talk about some of new things
that that are in store and then I'm
gonna go over some like life for you to
updates just talking about my life how
was January whatsoever you're gonna look
like what's been going on um and then I
will do open Q&amp;amp;A I'm really gonna do
this for 15 minutes so let's see I don't
know how Q&amp;amp;A will work but I guess at
the time I will just ask four questions
and hopefully I will get to as many as I
can and then at the very end I will
announce that thing that I've been
teasing on social media which I think
y'all are really gonna like so sweet
thank you yeah let's get a survey for
where are you all from I'm seeing Greece
India Sri Lanka mantri
y'all and ya nopal Philippines Colombia
that's awesome yeah I know I Franklin I
last time I did a lie she was a little
bit overwhelming because it was just Q&amp;amp;A
so this time I I made an agenda for
myself
and I feel really good about it I've
honestly been a little bit nervous about
this but yeah I feel prepared and I'm
really a role and great so let's get
started so the first thing on my
announcements list is we're doing
monthly live streams yay so I did that
live stream back in October and y'all
really liked it one of the top comments
is like hey please leave can we do this
more because it feels like or hanging
out and so yeah we're doing them now so
it's gonna happen once a month at the
very beginning of the month the first
weekend either Saturday or Sunday I'm
not sure what time works quite yes maybe
I'll do like a Twitter poll actually
after this to see what time works best
for everybody and it might switch off
depending on the month just so that you
know some people can make it to sell
them and other people can make it to
others so yeah great I'm just seeing
where everyone's from this is a really
international group that is freaking
awesome it's incredible how many people
I'm reaching all over the world so thank
you so much
so yeah monthly live streams second one
is yeah stay until the end for something
very awesome the thing that I said I
wanted to announce at this live stream
which will be at the very very end after
Q&amp;amp;A so stick around for that and then oh
the last thing that I wanted to announce
is kind of an idea that I've had which
is I want to do like shout outs on my
videos I would love to like give shout
outs to people yeah at the end of each
video so I'll explain this on social
media later but just so that you're all
the first to know um if you want to tag
me on insta or Twitter posts
something that you're really proud about
something that you've accomplished that
you're you know you're like yeah I did
this knows you're really awesome so yeah
make those posts on Instagram or Twitter
those are the places I'm gonna be
looking for with a hashtag hey my you go
like hey like hgy well you go I mean
actually let me see that so tag me with
your posts with hey there you go which i
think is a fun riff off of hello my you
go so yeah I would love to like
highlight some really awesome people in
this community we have a lot of people
here now and I think it'd be really cool
so yeah definitely
give me some cool posts and you might be
featured in my next video
awesome so that's it for the
announcements part we are seven minutes
in and we are rolling in I'm just gonna
check the chat I have myself here and
then I have the chat right here so if
you see me like looking over here that's
where I'm at um but yeah awesome yeah
lots of people from all over the world
Scotland Indonesia Germany Malaysia
British Columbia Netherlands Greenland
Costa Rica Wow
oh my gosh this is this is really really
cool okay
sleeps uh yeah let's go into life slash
YouTube updates um let's talk about
January so I have my bullet journal
right here which one day I will probably
do like a bullet journal review or like
how I do my bullet journal but I have my
January planned out or I did have it
plan out right here
and so I wanted to just kind of go over
like what my resolutions or goals were
because I thought that would be like fun
sort of just to talk about goal tracking
and where I'm at and like what I'm
thinking about
um so if you haven't watched my other
video about like what my resolutions for
2018 are and that Gary ready with me for
2018 video I talked about like what my
2018 resolutions are and so I boiled
that down into like what our monthly
ones
but just to kind of reiterate what my
2018 resolutions were it was about
consistency perseverance and grit so
just like now that I found things that
I'm passionate about sticking to it and
making sure that I can like keep going
with it
see follow through because I want to not
because I need to finally found my
passions again I feel like I'm going
towards like the living to work and not
working to live lifestyle so there's
that be better connected to family
become a better writer which is one
skill that I really want to be better
with don't be afraid to be friends with
people I admire or want to be friends
with I talked about this in my video I
do that because I like idolize people
like people that I know and I'm too
scared to talk to them which I really
shouldn't be so um there's that have
more meaningful and real interactions
and live healthier but all of that is
kind of really encompassed and just like
do better this year
it's always my mom just do better so
that is what my 2018 was something like
looks like the DOMA fam is here hello
Joe MA and all of your viewers thanks
for coming and watching Jarvis is here
and yeah this is Wow
there's so many people here this is
incredible and yes this live stream will
be available for later viewing on my
channel so I'll put timestamps and
substitutes they don't have to watch the
full 30 minutes or 45 or one hour
however long this is going to be um so
you can skip to parts that you wanted to
learn about so awesome great yeah
awesome okay so so my January so what if
my goals was to release two videos and I
did that
which I'm really proud about and so I
made my what how should I choose my
major video and how do you study for
technical interviews video I had a goal
to call my grandparents twice this month
I only called them once you can get
better at that my goal is to write three
scripts I'm in like I'm working on three
scripts right now so say like that's a
that's good and then go on to Coffee Day
with friends this is specifically for
like getting to know the people that I
admire and coffee dates are just like an
easy way to Jay back because there are
people that work who I like really
really like admire and they're just so
cool and amazing
that's yeah I was like Oh coffee dates
but I did I did one coffee date and I
did one like one-on-one meeting type of
thing with two of the people that I
really really admire at work there's
plenty more still so I there's lots of
room for opportunity but I did that and
that was really cool one wellness school
that I had was trying meditating or
doing headspace for ten days in a row I
did not do that I didn't even start
headspace so that's gonna roll over to
the next month but other than that my
January was really good um like I talked
about just like being at home or and
just being kind of like being with
myself a lot more giving myself time to
not only like do YouTube of course and
do all the stuff that I wanted to do but
also just to kind of relax and give
myself the time to like introspect how
my life is and what I'm thinking about
so yeah January's are really really good
month so far it was a long month don't
get me wrong it always was but yeah
January is a great month I got to go to
San Diego once and so I only did one
trip outside the outside not the country
but just I just had one trip where I had
to leave the house and yeah it was great
we celebrate Scott's birthday
earlier this month which was awesome too
so January was a good month so on to
February it's a little bit of a shorter
month I actually haven't filled out my
February 1 yet but kind of similar goals
but let's state let me catch up on the
chat real quick cool cool
lots lots of good questions that I'm
hoping to answer later awesome great ok
so there was my January goal tracking
and reflections let's talk about YouTube
a little bit so my YouTube channel like
yesterday reached 80,000 subscribers
which is unreal it's so great I'm really
excited I've been seeing the number
steadily look steadily go up and 80,000
is really cool like I I can't blue there
so many of you washing so thank you so
much for supporting and for sharing and
for liking and just for watching from
the very beginning I'm still very new at
this thing so yeah thank you all so much
for like washing my next goal is to
reach 100,000 and I'm thinking of maybe
doing like a giveaway of some sorts at
100k so hopefully we will reach that
goal together sooner rather than later
cool so one of my other things that I've
been doing this last month is like
thinking about what I want to do with my
youtube channel yeah
oh thank you everyone for jinks roots
giving me congrats 1 million by 2020
that would be incredible yeah yeah thank
you so much umm cool
YouTube goals so I've been taking this
last month to really figure out like
there's a lot of unknowns with doing the
YouTube stuff I don't know honestly I
don't know what I'm doing like that that
is like I'm just gonna give it to you
straight
I don't really know what I'm doing and I
had so many questions about like how
should I post on Instagram how should I
post on Twitter how often should I eat
listen what kind of video should I be
posting and I just had so many swirling
questions that I ended up talking to my
friend who has been on YouTube for a
long long long time and he knows his
stuff really well so we had a good like
one hour session where we talked about
like he basically asked me questions
like later like why do you want to do
YouTube like why do your viewers like
you
um you know why do they watch our videos
what are you good at like these really
kind of like fundamental questions we're
actually the basis for creating
what in kind of like the tech world and
big companies you call like the mission
statement and that's kind of like your
guiding like North Star for how we make
decisions and how we do stuff but the
mission it alone isn't like detailed
enough to guide me in like what I should
be doing so that actually clicks down
into like the mission and the vision and
the strategy and each layer is a little
more detailed than the next so I've been
spending some time doing that and I
honestly just like put everything that
was in my head onto paper and I just
kind of like sorted my mind a little bit
on YouTube and everything is so so clear
I wish I could share this with you but I
think that I think what I'm gonna do
actually is share this doc at the very
end of the year because I think that
would be really interesting to see like
hey this these were the goals that I set
in January and see in January 2019
whether I reached or not but I just
wanted to read a little bit from you um
so yeah my mission basically is to make
people feel that Tech is approachable on
that they can accomplish their dreams by
connecting with people around the world
to hear about their story and hopes and
dreams remove the intimidating or scary
stigma around tech by showing that Tech
is not like magic and help people to
find and pursue what they're passionate
about in text so they feel empowered to
take action so I hope this fires you up
as much of the fires me up but at the
same time you are kind of like the
direct like you get to see the outcome
of what that mission is so yeah hope
that that is exciting on my vision which
kind of talks more a little bit about
like number goals which I'm I'll just
talk about right now is my subscriber
count I would love to reach 300 thousand
by the end of the year January 1st 2019
will love to be 300 thousand it's a
little bit of a stretch goal a little
bit like a lot of the Sharks goal but I
think we can do it and that would be the
dream videos I want to make 36 videos so
three videos a month along with one live
stream every month so basically you'll
see something from
me once a week which is kind of like a
weekly schedule I think if you will so
cool and yeah some other things about
like how I'm thinking about social stuff
but I also wanted to talk about like
what my video makeup is gonna be I've
been kind of a little bit all over the
place because I don't exactly know what
type of video I should be making so I
kind of like clicked into that and
figure out what that was
so right now and this could totally
change is 50% of my videos going to be
tech content so tech content is meant to
be insightful or helpful informative
inspirational videos where I talk to you
about stuff that I know just in my head
that maybe you know you would normally
find out from other people in tech um
15% of my videos are gonna be vlogs I
did an Instagram survey the other day
asking you all like why do you watch my
videos what do you like about them and a
lot of you said you liked seeing the
lifestyle side of me being me I guess
and what what the lifestyle is like to
be a software engineer and so you all
really like reacted very positively to
my day in the life video and I haven't
made a vlog since then so that's what I
wanted to do so 15% vlogs vlogs are a
little scary for me and don't really
know how to make them so it'll be a
learning process but that's there 25% of
my videos are going to be like more
personal based so like you know personal
development I guess think the things
that I'm thinking about I think I have a
lot of room to grow still and there's
just I have a lot of thoughts all the
time so just like dumping them and
talking about them and sharing with you
kind of like what's going on in my head
and just like some personal things I
think would be really cool to do so
awesome yeah sounds like people are
interested in my vlog slash life video
so that is really good to hear
and then so 25% will be personal and
then 10% I want to do collabs clouds are
really fun and getting to know other
youtubers is super fun all the while
making a video so I'm gonna be dropping
in some collabs here and there
so we'll definitely be doing that so let
me know what you think do you feel like
that's like the right amount of you know
content this will probably change over
time but the first half of my ear I'm
gonna focus on making a lot of tech
content you'll have like very
oops I brought my headphones you'll have
like very specific questions that I
answer frequently on like Instagram or
Twitter that I'm honestly just like I
should just make a video about this you
know this is a question that's on
everyone's minds um so to tease a little
bit about what video is gonna be making
in February mu my camera went out of
focus - no it did that okay um cool just
reading clad with Jake Paul yeah right
glad with drama yes I will be collabing
with Jenna this year sometime this year
so cool okay um boy they talked about oh
yeah videos ahead so to tease the videos
that I'm really working on this year or
sorry this month February I'm making two
tech videos in one vlog video so the
tech videos I'm gonna answer the
question what programming language
should I learn / what's the best
programming language and to kind of like
some summarize that TLDR too long didn't
read that basically like choose a
programming language that you feel
comfortable with no one programming
language is objectively better than the
other in all cases use different
programming languages and different
scenarios you know certain like
different programming you know different
strengths and weaknesses kind of like
people so that's kind of like the
overall message of it if you don't want
to wait around for that but that's a
video I'm working on another video is
what's a coding bootcamp coding boot
camps are very popular way to get into
software engineering without name to go
through a four-year college program
they're really accelerated they're
really fast and a lot of people have
been going through them Scott actually
went to a book coding boot camp - so big
thing in the Bay Area nowadays and I
wanted to talk a little bit about that
cool now I'm getting all these
programming questions like what's Java
or Python or Python or going yeah you
know honestly I know how the answers
gonna do a little bit more research for
that video but those are the two
programming language and coding bootcamp
and then are we making a vlog don't know
what that vlog is gonna look like
probably just gonna like get a bunch of
footage from one week of my life and see
how that goes but you can guarantee I
can guarantee that there will be a chill
hop involved because apparently that's
like my signature thing now where my
videos are very chill so hope they'll
like that cool I'm gonna just step on
some tea cuz I'm really thirsty is I've
been talking for 22 minutes straight so
I'm just gonna watch the chat a little
bit awesome by the way this mug I've had
it for years I'm very confused by it
because well um but okay so it's my like
UCSD Jacob school of engineering mug
that I got I'm filling out some survey
when I was graduating which is great
like makes a lot of sense I don't
understand what this hundred percent is
like there's no nothing else on the mug
it's just like 100 percent I don't know
if it's like hey you're 100% caffeinated
I don't know it's a mystery but it's
like one of the biggest ones that I have
so I'm havin my usual milk tea for the
morning so cool awesome hmm let's build
that app yeah I'd love to curl to collab
with Bryan sometimes we've been talking
a little bit but I would love to do that
sweet 100% bug yet I mean what like I
would be surprised if it wasn't 100
percent mug so you know okay sweet um
cool
I know okay so the other only other
thing I had for life you two updates was
like my month ahead but trying to think
about what February's like there's a
three-day weekend and we're having some
friends come over but other than that
we're doing it for a big release at work
next week which has been really cool and
we're gonna like finally be able to see
a thing that we've been working on for a
long time go into the wild so a lot of
things happening at work
err and ya gonna keep chugging on
YouTube I have a side project that I'm
working on right now that I'm also gonna
keep chugging on and yeah I think that's
I think that's what my February is gonna
look like Chinese New Year is oh shoot
the 14th of the 15th I think so we're
celebrating with Scotts family which I'm
excited about speaking with Shea's a
Super Bowl I don't know if you're all
watching um for those of you not in the
United States Super Bowl it's like it's
like the championship football like an
American football game that like you go
on TV and everyone watches it and the
ratings are always super high or
whatever but today it's I think the
Patriots and the Eagles I am NOT partial
to either team I'm just gonna watch
football
specifically the the commercials during
the football games are fun to watch so
it's gonna watch that eat some wings
good ol American Wings and have a good
ol American time today umm but yeah let
me know if you are gonna watch it I
guess I heard Justin Timberlake is like
performing at the halftime show and he
just came out with the CD CD gosh no one
said that in a long time he came out
with an album recently and I haven't
listened to it yet so yeah we'll see
cool Patriots all the way huh cool ok
guess no Eagles fans awesome
ok so now we are entering into the open
Q&amp;amp;A I actually made it through all of my
announcements and life slash YouTube
updates pretty quickly so you can
actually probably do maybe like 20
minutes of Q&amp;amp;A let's do that so I'm just
gonna like sit and watch the chat feeds
but yeah ask me a question any question
I'll pick a couple to reply to if you
haven't noticed I put like a like a rate
limiting thing on so you can't like type
in two messages in more than 30 seconds
I think just make to make sure it's not
so spammy so if you want to actually if
you want to ask me a question can you
just make sure to type in my eco because
I get these orange highlights
in the chat whenever you say my you go
and it's easier for me to just like look
at so for all the questions that you are
gonna ask me can you just at my you go
or just like type in my name where you
go and it'll be highlighted in orange so
I can just see it better
cool I found one question that I really
like so I'm gonna answer a are a song
how long did it take you to become an
iOS developer so I when I graduated
college my first job as a like a early
career engineer like I didn't really
know what I wanted to do but the
recruiting team put me on a mobile like
engineering team and yeah so I started
there I honestly learned iOS on the job
and I've been doing it for four years
now this is this is my fourth year
working on iOS but the first like a
couple months I worked on one very
specific thing called UI webview like it
was just one very specific part of the
the codebase that had the project in and
it wasn't like high risk or anything at
all but it was like a way to get my feet
wet learned X could a little bit of
learn objective-c a little better so
yeah that's kind of how I got into it
but I think generally like when you're
learning something new when you're
laying a new program language and like
teams know this when you're joining a
like a team at a tech company they're
going to assign you something like small
and like compartmentalized and like just
like well-defined so that you don't get
lost in all the details
alright cool seeing a lot of questions
come through let me scroll through some
of these um let's see did you do
is that a swift shirt it's not well it
kind of is it looks like it right I call
this my slick shirts from j.crew I wear
it to like iOS conferences and stuff and
I was like yeah why not wear my stuffed
shirt today GPA importance in job or
internships ooh good question I think
GPA so I remember when I was like
applying to colleges in high school like
they talked about like a third of you
know college acceptance is based on your
GPA a third of it is based on like
your SATs and another third of it is
based on like what is it what was the
third one Oh like extracurriculars and
like other stuff that you did outside of
school I kind of like to think about it
that way too for jobs like GP is not
everything just because you have a 4.0
or 3.9 GPA doesn't mean you're
guaranteed a job but I mean GPA more or
less does sort of indicate some sort of
like you know like general aptitude in
computer science so yeah if you see
someone 3.9 GPA like you can kind of
infer that they're going to understand
computer science concepts better or like
they they understand yeah they did well
in their classes versus someone look
like a 2.0 GPA so I would say that your
GPA can only help you with that said in
my school at UC San Diego I was friends
with a lot of other engineers like
mechanical engineer structural engineers
electrical engineers and we're all like
it was all kind of just like known that
as long as you had above a 3.0 GPA
you're pretty much good like no one
really expects you to have like a 3.9 or
8 in engineering especially when like
you know the class average for a test is
like 50 something or a 60 something
which of course is like graded on a
curve and everything but still yeah
grades are important but like they're
not everything what I think is is
important is like that you're gaining
the skills in order to achieve your
goals
so yeah like if it means that doing
really well your data structures class
is going to help you you know do better
in your interviews and like that's great
at the same time don't fail stuff
because that's bad and then you have to
retake it and that's that's not great
cool let's see all right I'm a little
behind let me go through it
okay let's see this one what's the
difference change CSS in computer
engineering I'm gonna answer this one
because I kind of avoided it in my last
video CS is computer science SEO
software engineering and Computer
Engineering so computer science is like
the study of computer science and so
learning concepts like like algorithms
data structures you know sometimes you
learn things about how a compiler works
how to make an operating system how to
make a processor yeah that's what that's
the thing that I did in my one of my
classes actually software engineering is
like the application of that and so
using like concepts like you know data
structures now greater than think yeah
using those concepts to actually build
something on that like other people use
and computer engineering I think so at
my school like we had three different
majors it was computer science Computer
Engineering and electrical engineering
and I'm not sure the computer
engineering is like a career path per se
I've used it I've heard it more often
used as like a major but yeah Computer
Engineering like in my mind is like
somewhere between computer science and
electrical engineering so it's kind of
like bordering between software and
hardware so you might learn a little bit
more like assembly and other things
y'all can help me out if you have some
electrical engineering background
because I'm very very like on the
software side very high up in this tack
so yeah so hopefully that I answered
your question a little bit hmm woah woah
my chat just like went bonkers for a
little bit if I wasn't doing software
engineering what would I do
that's a good question what would I be
doing you know honestly I think I would
be teaching maybe yeah I think I would
probably be in some sort of like
teaching area my parents are both
teachers and so it's like a it's like a
world that I'm like somewhat familiar
with but the concept of just like
learning it's learning stuff and then
teaching it to students and like
helping them understand whatever you're
teaching and also just like a little bit
more of the world I think teachers have
a big impact on students I still
remember the very very good teachers
that I had which like made me fall in
love with like calculus or like English
Lit or whatever so I think that is
probably what I would be doing um cool
see you go through another one because
you do a collab video with an Android
app developer to share your experience
and do some comparison yeah I'd love to
I'll see who's up for I know a couple of
enjoyed engineers that I could probably
paying for that what do I think about
Bitcoin blockchain technology I don't
really have an opinion to be honest it's
a cool thing that people are talking
about but I don't um I don't know much
about it I'm not honestly not interested
yeah what's the area of technology you'd
like to explore and why I would love to
explore VR a little bit and also gaming
in general I'm very intrigued by like
game engineering it's like in my mind
it's like a more intense software
engineering because if you think about
all the stuff that you have to code like
you basically have to code an entire
world in an entire universe and it's not
just like the material things like how
does hair sway just like or like how
does hair look or like what you know how
do you render an eye that's like looking
you know up and down back and forth in
different lighting conditions it's just
like all the physics involved - for like
how that works like when you jump what
does that look like like what does the
legs look like you know what about that
rock like how is that supposed to render
how do you even render the whole world's
like is there an engineer working on
each part really interested in that and
like the processes around like how do
you design a game and then turn that
into like as a designer like what has
that work like what tools do you use and
like how do you get specs and
requirements from product managers and
designers and then turn it into a game
like it baffles me there's so much like
magic that goes on there
that that's an area I'd like to explore
and specifically I think VR would be
really cool because it's fully immersive
and it has such a potential to be a good
thing but also potential to be a bad
thing
but like yeah I think the technology
around VR is fascinating so yeah all
right
do-do-do-do-do I didn't use a MacBook
what would I use um iMac yeah I'm an
apple person like through and through I
actually had like one of the original
Apple 2 computers like the ones that
were like big and had like a floppy disk
drive here my supply kid picks on it and
my dad got it for me when I was like in
I want to say third grade and my dad
really has been like novel person this
whole time so that's kind of kind of
what I've been doing
well okay big question why do coding
tutorials know the I'm not trying to do
coding tutorials on my channel I think
there's a lot of resources out there and
I don't really want to add to the noise
of it I also like I'm not really excited
by the idea of making coding tutorials
yeah like what like one specific video
that I do have in mind that I'm making
that is more tutorial II is how to use
Xcode because me personally when I was
getting into iOS development the biggest
hurdle for me was like learning how to
use Xcode because it is kind of a
mystery how it works at the very
beginning because you don't know what
all the symbols mean and the buttons
mean so yeah that's one like tutorial
video I'd like to do but it's really in
service of like getting you off the
ground and like like reviewing you know
the world around you I guess but yeah
I'm not gonna be doing coding tutorials
I'm gonna be more talking about like how
to get into tech kind of more career
personal development type stuff so yeah
you will stand for me but there are a
lot of other great YouTube channels that
do do coding tutorials the two that I
think about our let's build that app I
wish a lot of you already know he does a
ton
of coding tutorials a lot of swift
tutorials actually because I think he's
an iOS developer and he has like series
of them and then the other one is CS
dojo by YK he also has a lot of coding
tutorials on his channel too
both they're really great so if that's
what you're looking for I highly
recommend you check those out see um
any advice for women who would like to
join the tech industry I would say do it
like please like I would love more women
in the tech industry I think right now
at least the last thought that I heard
is like one in five people are or one in
five software engineers are women would
love to be 5050 because that reflects
kind of like the rest of the world but
yeah I would say like you know you might
encounter some nasty things and you
might encounter some prejudice and
whatever but as long as you know like
you you know what you're doing it for
and you're following your passion I say
go for it don't let anything stop you
cool hmm
let me just go through some other
questions ah
what languages do I know what
programming languages right now that's a
fun question I regularly program Anna
justice Objective C and Swift more
fluent in Objective C I know like Java
JavaScript C yeah those those are
probably the ones that I spent more time
in I have played around with like Python
on Scala oh camel and these are all like
programming languages that I learned in
school so yeah actually I don't know
that many programming languages the
honestly it doesn't really matter how
many programming languages you know so
don't feel like it's like oh there's
like these Pokemon or like these cards
that I have to click to be a better
software engineer knowing where
programming languages is not like that's
not what makes you good software
engineer if you understand like what
programming what each programming
language is good for and their strengths
and weaknesses and when to use them that
does make you a better software engineer
so I should actually make that a video
makes a great software engineer cool I'm
gonna do a couple more questions can you
give any networking tips sure I'd love
to
so I would say like jump out of your
comfort zone and go talk to people I
guess I think the scariest part about
networking is jumping out of your
comfort zone and like meeting people who
you don't really know I'm really having
the only day in common between you two
is like programming for instance so it
is scary like when I first moved to the
Bay Area I really wanted to like get to
know other iOS engineer so I went to a
lot of meetups through meetup comm which
is a great site there's a lot of like
groups and stuff out there there's a lot
of groups inside within the San
Francisco area specifically for every
type of technology you can imagine and I
would imagine that's also the case for
like metropolitan areas like New York
City poly Seattle - but yeah I went to
like meetups and I just kind of like
hung out and just like talked to my
neighbor and asked them like hey like um
I would just be like hey like my name's
maker like what's your name oh like
where do you work what do you do Oh like
I've never heard of that company what
does that company do and like it just
kind of like starts being a conversation
but yeah like going to meetups and going
to like talks and stuff are a great way
to meet other software engineers if
you're in college going to student orgs
like if you have like us yes
organization or like a yeah coding thing
or a hackathon thing just like it's new
neighbors you don't have to necessarily
find like the perfect person Network
with just like to network with everybody
um
Twitter is also a great place to network
with other people the iOS community on
Twitter is pretty cool and so it's more
it's not like like two-way networking
it's more like I get to know who are
kind of like the big people in the iOS
community or like you know they're
really well-known and respected people
but it's a good thing nonetheless
conferences are also a great way to
network with other people but yeah I
would say just like don't worry about it
just be your genuine self like be
curious and get to know your name
you know having business cards is also
like useful but not like required just
so you can keep in touch afterwards if I
don't have a business card to be like
hey you have a Twitter demo link didn't
kind of just like connect with you so
yeah that's it that's actually another
video that I'm thinking of making I
don't know what I'm gonna say in that
one yet but probably something along
those lines
all right do I believe a college degree
is required to become a software
engineer no I don't you don't have to
have a college degree in anything to be
a software engineer like that's not like
a certification or anything that
companies are looking for companies
you're looking for skills and whether
you meet those skills so yeah you don't
have to do that my actually I'm so hmm
actually doing what I wear this no I
also had this in the different
livestream actually I have an idea that
I think would be really cool to answer
this question all right one more
question
ah let's see actually two more questions
because I like these books
Andrea asks any advice to someone who is
struggling with the development of
logical thinking because I'm having a
really hard time with it and makes me
think I'm not good for this oh don't
think you're not good for this oh you're
gonna be fine um yeah I guess a lot of
the thinking one of the one of the most
important things or helpful things that
I did in college when I was like taking
computer science classes and whatnot was
like to to work with other people and
like have a study group that that was
really helpful because then like I
realize like oh my the way that I think
through problems is fog or like oh I
could do this better because you know
this other person I thought about this
idea and that's really that's really
smart so that's one way I I guess like I
get that question a lot but I don't
quite understand what it means if any of
you can elaborate a little better maybe
I could answer your question more
helpfully the other question that I saw
was Vincent said
is there any age limit to change career
towards the tech industry I'm 39 PhD in
politics who decide to learn code today
in sister wait for my next incarnation
Thanks
you only got one life Vincent Yolo yeah
like you're 39 too which is not that old
I think it's never too old to change
careers and never too old to do what you
want to do and chase your dreams if
you're 39 I'm guessing like you're you
know yourself really well I think that's
an asset for like doing anything in life
like knowing yourself really well
knowing what you have and what you don't
have and so if anything like you're more
set up now than you were before to
become a software engineer um there I
don't think there's a whole lot of age
bias in the tech industry there is a
little bit a lot of tech startups and
the higher for younger but if you like I
think if you are you know regardless of
what age you're as long as you're as
long as you have the skills that a
company's looking for and you're very
flexible and abductive and not dogmatic
and like you accept change and you deal
with change really well then you're
gonna be fine um I I went to school at
UCSD so like there's a lot of like
military navy bases in San Diego and I
had I frequently had like classmates who
were like ex-marine or ex-navy who yeah
we're like you know a lot older than I
was but they're going through like doing
computer science I think a lot of them
had a GI Bill so they had like the
government support to get another degree
but yeah a lot of them were like in
their 30s 40s 50s however old and they
were getting their CS degree so yeah
like never too late to do something that
you want to do 39 s not that old you're
gonna be fine awesome um cool let's see
okay I think that's about it yeah I
think I did a good 20 25 minutes for Q&amp;amp;A
so thank you everyone for for submitting
your questions I really wish there was a
way to like export these questions
for future which I'm not sure you can do
I wish you teens live-streaming
tools are a little better if like number
one I wish I could export the live chat
number two I wish there was a better way
to interact with you all that wasn't
super chat super chat something that I
might turn on later but not like like so
super chat feature on YouTube where you
can pay to have your questions featured
so that I can see them better but it
just feels a little bit like a little
bit money grabby and I'm happy to do
that it would be like hey like we're
gonna turn super chat on today and the
profits will go to some charity or
something or some like program because I
feel like that's a little weird so yeah
I wish I wish there was a better way to
like get Q&amp;amp;A questions and have you all
like upload them instead of just seeing
like this max mass wall and I wish I
could also pull you guys you all sorry
but yeah YouTube's live streaming
capabilities are pretty limited I might
possibly play around with some other
live-streaming tools like crowdcast
and you now maybe just to see how those
are like and those will be like in
addition to my monthly live students
which I'm still gonna have my youtube
channel cuz the very end of the day I
still want these videos to sit on my
channel so that people can watch them
afterwards especially Lulu can't make
the stream but yeah maybe I'll just do
some like other one-off ones just to
test out the tools a little bit awesome
okay so we are coming towards the end of
our livestream and I have been having a
lot of fun I hope you have as well I
have two more things that I wanted to
talk about first I'm gonna have a glass
water so I'm very thirsty mmm Rodrigo
says you can make communion with Twitter
questions that's true maybe I'll do like
a hey send me and your questions and
then I'll answer them um like like
during the livestream but at the same
time that I still like being able to see
things come you know in live otherwise I
would just like make a Q&amp;amp;A video about
it so yeah we'll see everyone knows
about the
when you go or like my you go tag thing
now so I feel a lot more orange in my
side but thanks um okay cool
so lastly things thing that I wanted to
announce is drumroll I'm the only one
there um I don't know why I did that
um I made a slack team for everyone who
watches my videos to interact with me
and with everyone else I think we've had
I think we have a really great community
here now I've seen a lot of like good
back and forth in the comments and I
wish there was a better like forum for
us to do that in so I made a slack team
I've been piloting it with a couple of
friends and like close to viewers for
the last week and I'm really excited
about it and I'm opening it up to
everyone today so that is my
announcement for those of you who don't
know what slack is it's like a
communication tool that a lot of like
tech companies use to interact with
between like companies or sorry without
within teams um so you can direct
message there's like channels that you
can go into to talk about specific
things but I will post my signup link on
my Twitter which leads me into my next
point which is don't to not forget to
follow me on Instagram and Twitter I
post a lot of like like on Instagram I
post a lot of insta stories about my day
and sometimes I announce stuff like live
streams or whatever is happening so yeah
I don't forget to follow me on insta
Twitter I also do announcements too so I
would love if you would follow me so I
will post the slack team what is it
link invite link on my Twitter right
after this livestream so look out for
that and yeah I'm hoping it'll be a
helpful community for everyone to help
each other answer questions about career
or college or software engineering or
anything at all
so I would love that we can all help
each other and get to know each other a
little better
Jorma has a discord and it's been going
well really well so it's inspired me to
make my own slack
yeah I think cluck is a great tool to
get to know anyway since a lot of
companies are using it so to give it as
like hey like you already know how to
use slack so one more skill that you'll
have to be better prepared to become a
software engineer cool so uh yeah I
think that's everything
thank you all so much for tuning in
especially if it was like late into the
night or early into the morning I had a
lot of fun and I'm looking forward to
the March livestream which will be the
first let's see Saturday of March I
think as long as I don't have anything
that day
let's see March 10th I think yeah I
think it'll be March 10th or 11th right
no wait that's wrong one - oh sorry
it'll be either the third or the fourth
which is the first weekend March 3rd or
4th will be the next livestream I hope
you all will be able to tune in but yeah
thank you so much for joining and I will
see you all next time so have a great
rest of your day or night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
