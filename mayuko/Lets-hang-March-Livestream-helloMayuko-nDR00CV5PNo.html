if every went by so quickly in
comparison to January which felt like
forever really
and so yeah I have an agenda like last
time so just to give oh like a kind of
broad idea what we're gonna talk about
actually before I do that I'm gonna put
an out icebreaker because I thought that
could be fun
so the icebreaker is let me know in the
comments who are some of your other
favorite youtubers some of my favorite
youtubers are one crew productions kina
grannis Simone yet among a ton of others
so let me know who you really like on
YouTube
so yeah the well I'm waiting for those
replies to come through in the chat
because it sounds it looks like there's
like a 30-second delay usually and I
will go over the agenda so first we're
gonna go over some announcements and
stuff some things that I've announced
over the last month um that I will go
over again and then ii will go over just
some like for YouTube updates I'm saying
we're gonna go over it sounds like I'm
like hosting like a meeting with at work
but this is a fun thing but I just
wanted to structure this little morning
that no live streams can be pretty
freeform
so yeah for those of you who just joined
I'm just going over at the agenda right
now right now it's an ounce mints and
then
and then a Q&amp;amp;A at the end I want to
leave at least 15-20 minutes for Q&amp;amp;A so
I will let you know in on that all
happens but that'll be at the very end
the Icebreaker that I set up was who are
your other favorite youtubers and I'm
gonna go to the chat a little bit I see
a lot of Joma so hello DOMA fam good

they're called yeah yeah that's like uh
it's like fart and oh I forgot the other
guy's name but like Bart and Gio and
everybody yeah they're awesome cool cool
okay so I'll keep an eye on the chat but
I'm going to just kind of concentrate on
talking about stuff because I know the
chat can be a little bit overwhelming
sometimes and I honestly I could get
into a state where I just like stare at
the shot and didn't say anything so I
want this to be useful and it's not just
me like giving a bunch of filler so
let's get started all right so some
announcements um Monday live streams all
are announced this again we're doing
what the live streams as y'all can tell
February is our first one and this is
our second one in March so they'll be
happening at the very beginning of the
month specifically the first weekend of
the month
and I know that I have a lot of viewers
from all over the world and some of
y'all are in Europe and some of y'all
are in Asia and some of y'all are in
North South America and my time zone but
to culminate for everybody I wanted to
make sure that everyone has a chance to
go to some live streams so odd months
are going to be Saturday night this is a
big time
so like March right now is an odd month
so we're gonna do Saturday night and
then even months we're going to be doing
Sunday morning so if every what you did
like Sunday 10:00 a.m. this is just so
that everyone can make it of course if
you can't make it that's totally fine
these elections are always going to be
up on my channel for you to view
afterwards and last time I put like
timestamps on the video or in the video
description so that I can just like
scribe to the Parsee long because I know
these videos can be kind of long so yeah
that's one the second one is my slack
team which I also announced in the last
one so a lot of these add-ons insert new
but just to reiterate in case you
haven't heard I have a slack team hello
when you go slack comm or something like
that
I'll have there's a link to join the
slack team in the description box for
this YouTube livestream but I was
watching and we chilled we talked and
I'm hoping to make a really helpful
community for everyone that's safe and
fun and everyone can help out each other
I know like there's been a lot of good
discussion so far and we've celebrated
some people like getting jobs and
internships this feels super cool and
I've gotten to know some of you like
really well through that life or through
that a swag team and see how come and
join the fun it's the bit dolly / hello
my go slack link down there so yeah come
on in
we have a lot of different topics that
we can talk about and I love if you do
have experience on in some of this stuff
and you've been working in temporary you
know whatever or you're studying or you
know any anything that you have to offer
I love if you shared your experiences we
can all help each other out because I
think that's the best part of having a
community so all right checking in to
the to the channel
thingy chat thingy that's what it's
called so notice what's a slack team so
slack is a messaging platform it's kind
of replacing forums and a lot of tech
companies are using it now as a way for
employees to talk to each other
basically so yeah you can join in and
then there's like these things called
channels or like rooms
I guess that are specifically your on a
topic and you can talk to people in that
so yeah um let's see let's see I am
looking at other things in the chat cool
I see someone from San Diego hello
I heard it's kind of raining down there
which is like wow because San Diego
never rains I see a couple of UFO people
from Brazil Colombia
really cool alright awesome awesome
awesome little hello from Indonesia
Honduras see okay cool um
oh yeah non scenes and things coming in
for this with a slack idea awesome
Google's really nice my competitor yeah
I wonder how that's gonna go
we'll see and yeah oh uh someone asked
why don't you consider using discord
over slack discord is another like chat
platform that a lot of gamers years and
I consider using discord but as a way
for like since a lot of tech startups
and tech companies you're using slack
nowadays I feel like why not use slack
and if you haven't you slack before then
getting familiar with it might be useful
smelling you can put like knows how do
you select your resume I mean you can if
you want to you but just to kind of
emulate what other companies are using
and I'm really comfortable slack I'm in
like a bunch of different slack teams
and it's really fun to use so awesome
okay moving on okay one last
announcement is about the hashtag halo
you go so I'm doing shadows at the end
of my videos especially the ones where
I'm like kind of talking at you kind of
like this and if you tagged me in a
photo on Instagram or you know
Twitter with the hashtag hey will you go
then I think you might get featured and
I might give you a shout-out in my video
specifically I'd love to hear things
about something you're proud about
accomplishing or like a project you're
working on I love reading about those
things and since last time there's been
a lot more tweets about them so I would
love to see what y'all are working on
and what y'all are we can really hard on
so yeah don't forget to tag me in that
cool which is actually very relevant
because I'm shooting a video right after
this and I've chosen my shout out person
already for this video but there are
also a lot of videos in the pipeline
that are gonna come through so
okey-dokey okay my camera is does not
know where I am okay sweet Lala just
looking at the chat real now right now
real now cool okay yeah and thanks for
the questions so far I am doing Union at
the very end I just wanted to like get
through some of this stuff real quick
real fast and yeah so I will try to
remember the questions that you've typed
in there but there's a chance that I
won't remember so if you wanna add that
into the end that would be awesome cool
moving on we're doing wife's last
YouTube updates as you do my own effects
because I'm not like an actual show okay
the first thing is I am nearly at a
hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube
which is freaking wild and I have been
monitoring the sub count every day and I
am so excited to almost reach a hundred
thousand which is I don't want like I
don't know how to even imagine that
number of people watching my videos but
they do and I'm really thankful for it
so thank you to everyone who has watched
and commented and liked and shared my
videos with your friends it really means
a lot and yeah it's so cool it's such a
great milestone my goal for the year is
three hundred thousand so here's to
hoping that I can reach that as well so
I would say we are well on our way
towards that so thank you thank you
thank you so much the other thing is I'm
also almost a 10k followers on Instagram
which is really cool too I think at 10k
Instagram followers you get like the
swipe look for a link functionality on
insta story so yeah pretty excited to
play with like I don't know if there's
any other features that become available
to me on Instagram for having that many
followers but I'm excited to play with
them so yeah one question that I wanted
to ask was like should I do something
for 100k subscribers like I think I
posted a quick video about it I don't
know what I'm gonna say in it but I yeah
I want to like celebrate with a video a
little bit but like would you all be
interested in a giveaway I know a lot of
you all are like worldwide and I'm not
sure how International shipping works
out so I probably only shipped to the US
unfortunately for like actual tangible
goods but yeah I was considering doing a
giveaway for I don't know maybe cracking
the coding interview air pods like John
planted I don't know if y'all have any
ideas I would love to hear them
so do mukbang yeah okay I actually do
really like watching them but I probably
wouldn't do that but yeah I guess what
would you like to for me to give away
like what would what what do you want to
win I don't know I'm still thinking
about that so yeah any ideas are very
much appreciated
um I'm like fireworks or something yeah
I don't know that that's actually uh
legal maybe I don't know someone asks do
I know gage LSP and I do he was my
professor for software engineering and
UCSD so yeah I do know him he's a great
professor um cracking the coding
interview yeah okay feel that a Porsche
can't afford that coffee yeah oh
speaking of coffee I'm playing around
with the idea of some sort of Bay Area
Meetup maybe I don't know we'll see I'm
talking about on my slack team so we'll
see how it goes okay everyone's
everyone's like give away a MacBook Pro
and
but they're so expensive I'm sorry maybe
I like 1 million I can do something like
that
sorry ok cool ok what else
ok so last month let's go over what
happened last month so I launched my
slack I started doing monthly live
streams which I just talked about in my
announcements I mean two videos I made
the what programming language should you
learn like what's the best one which is
a question I get so often and I'm really
really proud of how the video came out I
played around with like the acting in
the beginning and that looks super fun
to do and also got it was embarrassing
and scary but I hope you'll like that
it's doing really well and I had a lot
of fun making it the second video I made
was my weekend flog the day of the life
weekend edition excuse me and that was
also really fun to make I realized I
hadn't made a vlog vlog since the day in
the life of the software engineer video
and that was like in like July I want to
say that was like my very first video so
yeah it was really fun to do that for a
day and it's inspired me to buy my new
login camera which is a lot more
important belen handheld it's downstairs
I don't have it with me right now
because that other like this one just
one that's sitting on the bed right now
ooh right there if that one's really
hard to hold and it's heavy and my arm
gets tired so yeah I bought a vlogging
camera and so I will be making more
vlogs I don't know if I want to do like
weekly logs that I think that's a little
tough for me right now given just my
schedule but I will be releasing another
vlog in March so yeah I guess oh before
before I move on to what I'm thinking of
doing this month last month other things
that I did was I got to meet Charlie who
is running the YouTube channel Charlie
marietv and it was really cool she's in
San Francisco for a little bit and
Jarvis and I got to meet her she talks
about design stuff on her Channel
and just kind of some lifestyle type
things and it was really really cool to
meet her because right before VidCon
when I was talking to drivers about the
possibility of creating a YouTube
channel
he sent me Charlie's YouTube channel and
he was like hey this could be kind of
like this looks like sort of what you
were thinking about doing for software
engineering but for design like yeah
like check it out and I wash it and I
was like this is exactly what I wanted
to do for software engineering so she's
been an awesome like role model for me
in doing YouTube and she's been
releasing a video every single week
about a variety of different topics so
probably going to be her and we got to
chat and have lunch and dinner and we
want to drive his improv show together
which was also really fun so yeah it's
really cool like the Internet is such a
cool place because like she lives in
London and I live here and I'm pretty
sure we wouldn't have met otherwise
maybe and like one of my favorite parts
about doing YouTube is being able to
meet people who are yeah I wouldn't meet
like regularly I guess so I feel like my
world has expanded but also grown
smaller if that makes sense from doing
YouTube stuff and say I hanging out with
her I was just like damn like what a
world we live in so cool
okay let's see let's see
um just looking at the chat right now I
look a little been asking me if I'm from
Asia or like where I'm from and stuff
I'm willing to answer this ones in this
last shape but I grew up in the United
States and I am like I'm Japanese I was
born in Japan I was born in America
speak Japanese but yeah y'all asked that
a lot so there's my answer
okay um the other thing that I did last
month was I was on Jomo's startup series
yes Jonah's startup series
if you don't know Jolin has this like
YouTube series which is kind of like a
mockumentary like TV show type thing
about starting a startup and it's so
funny I love
so much he's a really great writer and
director turns out Lee especially I
realized that like especially from
working with him and being in the
startup series but yeah I think a site
appearance as Joma and Arya's therapist
it was really hard to act in front of
other people and honestly watching you
I'm like this is so cringy and a super
deadpan because I was supposed to be
kind of like just like a therapist who
gets paid alone money whoo yeah that was
just kind of the character and I didn't
play it pretty well but it was really
fun to be in it so it's a startup
episode for go check it out in droves
Channel
yeah it was so fun so good stuff okay uh
sweet okay um yeah okay so that's what
happened last month this month um the
three videos that I'm thinking of making
is the first one is what is a coding
bootcamp which I know I promised I would
make this last month but from scheduling
stuff I moved it around and so it's
gonna be released next month so just
going to talk about coding boot camps
what I know about them so hopefully
that'll be helpful cuz I know y'all have
asked a lot about that I'm going to
doing a vlog like a like a weekly vlog
almost I'm going to San Diego in the
middle of March and so I want to vlog a
little bit of that as well is just like
my workday because everyone's been
asking a lot about showing more
lifestyle type stuff which I realized I
haven't done very much of on my channel
but I know that's why y'all like
watching it so yeah I'm gonna be doing
that really excited to test out my new
camera which I bought but how it really
used it so you can look forward to that
uh the other one that I want to do is
kind of like a fun skit type sort of
video like Jarvis's videos are very much
like this that have like multiple
talking heads kind of like wheezy leader
and Nathan said style and I think those
are fun like they really get my creative
juices flowing and with my newfound
acting skills which I don't have
I wanted to make something like that so
I think it's it I think maybe I'll make
a video around like the stupid questions
I slash other people have asked about
coding and programming I asked people on
Twitter like what are some questions
that they have asked before when they
were first starting out I know I've
asked a lot of stupid questions about
programming so yeah excited to make that
video so I think that's what the topic
is going to be that third video is a
little TBD but yeah the time thing in so
excited to do that
other than that some other ideas that I
have for next month is I guess this is
more for April but the next live stream
I think I might turn on super chat and
super China is a feature on YouTube
where you can pay money to get your
questions featured in the live chat but
with the money raised from super shot I
wanted to like donate it to a good cause
probably one of the causes for like
helping you know people from
underrepresented backgrounds get into
coding so there's a lot of great
organizations out there that are doing
good work around that so yeah I thought
that would be kind of fun so we'll see
how it goes I think I'm gonna do it
so yeah it's dudette alright ah cool
other than that yeah yes this is kind of
like me on my soapbox now for life slash
YouTube updates but um let's see
weekend's have been very busy I'm always
either doing YouTube stuff or
side-project stuff or just trying to
relax from the last week from like the
work week basically it's really teaching
me a lot about like discipline and grit
and just like just keeping up and
staying consistent with what I set out
to do and so like that
I made a document last month in January
January yeah though that kind of just
listed out like why I'm doing YouTube
like why this is important so I've been
referring to that document a lot for
sources of inspiration really doing a
lot of soul-searching on what I want to
do and how I want to spend my time so
yeah it's been tough but I'm not I'm
trying to
not fall off the boat which I said in my
last video which I don't think is an
actual expression but I'm trying to
stick with it and stay consistent so
keep me accountable hold me accountable
I hope I could do this I think I can so
can you we got this the other thing I
realized from this is just like having
time to sit and process things and
giving myself the headspace so just like
catch up with my brain is really
important when I'm really busy
think I'm constantly just like inputting
things and outputting things from my
brain so like in putting things like
just like I'm just like I have to learn
a lot of stuff just like keep learning
just listen to a bunch of stuff read a
bunch of stuff watch a lot of stuff just
like you have so much to learn so just
keep doing that so like in putting a lot
of things and then also outputting a lot
of things so outputting code out putting
videos out putting social media posts
like talking to people as an output and
when I'm inputting and outputting a lot
of times sometimes I forget about like
listening to myself a little bit and
listening to like what I really want to
do and listening to my gut and I
realized that I hadn't given him space
from myself to do that and I realized
this that day that I was shooting the
vlog the weekend vlog and I talked show
it on camera but then I cut it out is a
little unstructured and stuff but yeah I
think it's really important to give
yourself the time to think and so yeah
you try to do that better maybe just
like schedule myself some more
unstructured time so that I have the
time to just chill basically like I
sometimes it feels like I'm stumbling
over my feet because like things are
happening so fast and changes going so
quickly and I know that there's a lot
expected of me but in order to grow I
need to like be able to grow sustainably
which means sometimes I just got to slow
down on purpose so that's a lesson that
I learned last month and it's I think
the lesson that's really important so
glad to have learned that
all right I am going to look at the chat
right now um cool cool cool let's see
let's see
I'm so sorry that's like awkward time of
me reading the chai is so boring but I
honestly can't talk and read it yeah I
can't talk to me at the same time so
yeah did you do
cool cool cool okay see someone else
what's my myers-briggs personality type
is that right and BTW eyes out what
myers-briggs stands for i think last
time i was like i ND or i infj i want to
say it changes a lot and I haven't done
that in a while so I'll see maybe I'll
take it again okay uh seats um what else
yeah I think that's about it I haven't
gotten sick this flu season which is
great because a lot of other people
around me are getting sick and I haven't
gotten sick I got my flu shot and so I'm
doing well and I hope that I don't get
sick because that would be very bad but
my tips for not getting sick are to take
a lot of vitamin C to always wash your
hands and don't touch your eyes or your
nose or your mouth with your bare hands
which is silly but you know that's how
you don't get sick um okie dokie did you
I'm gonna do some real life moderating
right here okay cool I think that's it
now it's Q&amp;amp;A time 628 I think I did a
pretty good job alright so give me
whatever questions you got I'm happy to
answer whatever questions you have
I guess not gonna answer all of them and
I lost mine I'm gonna choose to not
answer all of them but yeah I'm excited
to see what you've got a lot of people
are talking about myers-briggs
personality tests INTJ yeah I guess
there's a lot of INTJ
yeah someone told ya someone said I
think you think that I'm
ENFP maybe I think I think I remember
being infj because Scott is ENFJ and
infj is the same personality type as
Beyonce and ENFJ I think is the same
personality type as Barack Obama so you
know power couple right here alright um
mm okay
Wow lots of questions coming in you know
I'm gonna just start at somewhere around
the top uh what brain is my dog I'm
getting a new dog today Oh Marshall Oh
from Korea hello Kim oh my gosh it's
like saying I don't I actually don't
know what breed my dog is we got him
from Australian Shepherd rescue and
originally they said they think he's
Australian Shepherd and Australian
Cattle Dog mix but we don't know that
for sure so I think he's I'm trying some
type of like Swiss Mountain Dogs maybe
or just a mix of everything but it's fun
having a unique dog he is he's the best
dog someone asked what my favorite show
is on Netflix currently well I have a
couple favorite shows but a show that I
recently watched that was really good
was ugly delicious which is made by
David Chang who's on who's the chef for
Momofuku loves famous restaurant I think
in New York he's such a good show he
talks a lot about like each show each
episode is about a different food and
like he talks about kind of like
cultural connotations about it like why
that food is good like what do people
think of the food he's korean-american
so a lot of time he ties it back to like
like Eastern versus Western views on
food it's really fascinating there was a
whole episode on like fried chicken
fried rice there's another episode about
stuff thing so you compare like
dumplings to ravioli it's a really good
I really enjoyed it um did you do let's
see do I play any sports I know actually
currently but in high school I used to
play tennis and I also used to do Aikido
I still like doing both but I'm really
not consistent with it and I still
remember how to do both
um but yeah uh let's see uh Dennis asked
do I do
Android developers as inferiors no we're
all friends let's not see each other as
a few years were yeah we're all working
as a team so I don't think there's any
point in like like pitching a war
against anybody really I think it's a
waste of energy and emotions someone
asked if I would be open to doing a mock
interview uh
I think that would be something that
would be really fun to do maybe as like
a video it would be great but um yeah
I'm gonna say that's not like it's not
something I see very excited I don't
think it aligns with my goals for doing
YouTube very much so
yeah um the other one thing that I think
could be cool about my slack channel is
to have people like do mock interviews
with each other so we're trying to look
like a couple a couple of us are
actually trying to like set up some mock
interview resume review type of things
like a bunch of these kind of like
collaborative workshops I guess we're
trying to set up some of these so yeah
like you could honestly pop into the
slack team and say like hey does anybody
have experience doing interviews
so can we do can I do a mock interview
with you if you're if you're
interviewing for a job I'm gonna take a
sip my tea because I'm very thirsty
today I'm drinking green tea I usually
don't drink caffeine until this late but
I've got a long night ahead of me where
I have to shoot my video and edit
another one so yeah okay
okay lots of questions I'm okay okay
okay did you - I see hmm
couple of people have asked me about
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency not really
into that not all
I'm a very like ooh that's weird
sorry I'm just trying to like get the
lighting better in here I think that's a
little better
yeah yeah yeah not really into
cryptocurrency I don't have any Bitcoin
or anything or dogecoin err and cerium
or anything at all um hmm ooh
Oh one thing that I noted one thing that
YouTube told me about um one I was
logging on to this was that the live
chat I think is gonna stay on the video
now so if you watch life stream videos
on YouTube that have since ended you can
still see the chat which yeah it's great
I feel like that should have been a
thing from the beginning but yeah cool
let's see let's see some people are
asking about what they read books and if
so what books I like to read currently
and currently meaning like the last year
I've really enjoyed reading memoirs I
like reading those types of things
because you can't make that stuff up and
really it's really interesting to hear
about people's lives it all kind of
started when I read the glass castle
which is an incredible memoir of a
really like interesting life from like I
think I think it takes place in like the
50s in America or a lot of the stories
from that and I thought it was really
fascinating so I was like I would never
meet anyone with this life I also would
never live that life so reading about it
is cool and a lot of like famous figures
have also published memoirs and reading
those always are great
so yeah other than that sometimes I try
reading some interesting fiction novels
on the most recent novel that I read was
the mothers by Bennett which is really
interesting it's about a teen mom
basically and it follows the life of her
and the people around her until
basically she's like a lot older it's
really good
it actually takes place in San Diego
right near where I grew up so it's kind
of trippy to read
like these places that I know in a book
and I was like oh that is an actual
restaurant that I've been to that has
this reputation there so yeah all right
Oh Tina asked how do I manage stress and
do I spend most of my free time coding
that's a great question the second
question I'll answer first do I spend
most of my free time coding I don't I
like right now I've spent more free time
and coding than I had before
for my side project but other than that
I don't really like that was actually a
complex that I had especially right
after I graduated when I wasn't a
student anymore it felt like everyone
around me had like a side project that
they're working on and I was like am i
incompetent because I don't I'm not
coding after work but I mean coding is
you know your problem solving for you
know several hours during the day
sometimes you just gotta relax so I
choose to do that and do other things in
life that are fulfilling to well the way
that I manage stress ah that's a good
question honestly some sometimes I'm
just like I'm so stressed I'm just going
to nap right now because I don't want to
do anything about it which happens
frequently other than that I think the
most like helpful way that I found for
managing stress is just to be really
organized
I guess you're asked when I'm not well
prepared for stuff so if I'm meeting
with someone or talking to someone about
something and I have no idea what we're
gonna talk about and I have not done my
research
then I'm so stressed about that cuz I'm
just like oh my god I don't know what
I'm doing and that feeling is like the
thing that gives me stress I think but
that like oh my god I don't know what
I'm doing I don't belong here but if I
give enough time to myself to do the
research and to figure it all out then
it's a lot easier so yeah pre-prep is
important so that means like
organization I have everything in a
calendar making sure that things have
like times and stuff so I honestly like
as a con to that I'm not very flexible I
can't it's hard for me to just be like
hey later the day do you want to do this
I already have like everything that I
have pointed out and everything for
today and tomorrow
but like I it's honestly one of the best
ways for me to manage stress my bullet
journal also is a great way to do that
because it helps me stay organized and
like whenever I keep too much stuff in
my brain then I also really get stressed
because I forget things so writing them
down out of my brain just like unloads a
lot of the information that's in there
so yeah that's that's how I manage
stress so hopefully that's helpful
otherwise I take bad cuddle with my dog
i watch TV i watch friends a lot so uh
yeah alright yeah 30 faheen said 35
minutes flew by and it really did okay
um let's see there is a lot of things a
lot of questions okay
Oh someone asked loose leaf tea or tea
bags
I like wheeze leaf tea more but it takes
more time to prepare so tea bags are
also great I'm gonna scroll up because I
think I forgot I like didn't read all
the questions and I feel bad um let's
see Oh some people have asked me like
how do I like the bay area what was like
your transition living here I really do
like working in the Bay Area and living
here but it's also you know I grew up in
San Diego which is very different from
the bay area still in California so it's
not super different but San Diego is
known to be very chill very relaxed the
area it's everything's very fast-paced
everything is very like deliberate
there's a lot of talent here and Tech is
like the biggest industry I think I'm
pretty sure it is and so yeah it's it's
really intense sometimes which is good a
bad thing it's good because it pushes
need to be you know the best version of
myself and work hard there's also a lot
of great people to me and like I'm
costly inspired by
just like everyone around me it's bad
because sometimes I just want to get
away from tech stuff and get away from
just like my job and other things it
also doesn't help that I made a YouTube
channel about tech stuff but yeah
sometimes it can be really intense and I
have gone through bouts or just like how
do I deal with this like it can be
really hard to emotionally settle I
guess I'm and I don't really know how I
get over it but I do and I'm here for
her - yes years three years almost now
so yeah but one big thing that I always
like feel when I go between the Bay Area
and everywhere else is up here is just
like hell expensive housing expensive
food is expensive everything's very
expensive so I wish it was cheaper and
you know yeah but that's what vacations
are for so alright um do rating some
more questions I will talking about tea
I like tea okay I think I think I'm a
little more caught up let's see see
let's see someone asked how how much do
I sleep when do I go to bed and wake up
I need eight hours of sleep every night
or else I can't function the next day I
know some people are okay with with like
sleeping 4 to 6 hours and those people
are like high functioning people and
they get a lot done but I I don't think
I'll ever be that person because I can
easily sleep 10 hours a day so I usually
try to get to bed around 10:00 or 11:00
and I wake up around 6:30 7:00 every
night um let's see
you do Oh mm-hmm
oh gosh man my my chat is kind of slow
oh do I have T recommendations allow so
many people he loved T I really like PG
tipps which is just a typical black tee
but I actually bought like a I think
it's like a 280 back it's just like big
box like this this big and I'm like oh
shoot this is hard like this wide it's
like umm for work because he didn't have
that much black tee and now I'm gonna
have black tea everyday and it turns out
it's a hip oh there's a lot of tea
drinkers at my office too but I drink a
cup of like like milk tea every morning
or you know usually two actually so
that's my recommendation
do I like matcha tea I also really like
matcha tea yeah do I put my X code in
dark mode I don't know that it's dark
mode so much as it is just like a theme
that has a dark background I think the
theme is called oceanic I want to say
but I really like it because it's very
pleasant and I think it still plays with
the rest of Mexico colors really well um
ah this is a great question from Joseph
Louie if you were to go to a meet-up
slash networking event but are only a
beginner in the subject how would you
communicate with other professionals
that's a good question because when I
first started working and started going
to meetups I was so intimidated I was
just like I don't know any of this stuff
and everyone else around me was talking
about like whatever the meetup was about
and I felt very very in how to quit so
the way that I dealt with it which maybe
isn't the best way it's just in there
and not and pretend to contribute to the
conversation oh and after a while you
get more comfortable with it but I think
I think there's something about just
like like as a software engineer like
it's it's really important to have kind
of like a learning mindset and to always
be learning and I think it's a sign of
maturity when like other software
engineers can recognize that and sell it
that so like when you go to a meet-up or
something and like someone's talking
about something you don't know I think
it's so totally okay to be like hey like
I don't know what that is what is it
like I am NOT a fan of when people
respond to that by saying like oh you
don't know what that is like everyone
knows what that is because everyone
learns differently and everyone knows a
set of different things but yeah I would
say just go for it and then see how it
is like you know hopefully you'll find a
group of people who are really you know
open and are I can teach you a lot of
stuff um so yeah hopefully that's
helpful um let's see guest Jarvis thank
you for answering a lot of people ask me
how old am I I'm 25
oh my god 25 30 26 this year y'all I
feel I feel the like quarter life crisis
real hard this year okay just looking at
some other questions see what's next in
your career after software engineering
from Dennis that's a good question
I don't know I think I think I didn't be
a software engineer for a long time I
really liked doing software engineering
I might consider going into like
software engineering management so
managing other software engineers is an
option but I do like working at Tech
some people have also asked me if I am
considering doing like YouTube full-time
but I don't think so
any time spirit and I like keeping it as
a like a side hobby thing right now so
yeah yeah I don't know
I also purposely don't want to like set
a like a plan that is more than like a
year just because feelings change
emotions change and I act based on like
my gut and so like a lot of times off
myself like am I happy right now if I'm
not why aren't I happy
what needs to change and make life
decisions based on that or like hey my
set up for success if I'm not why don't
why why am I not so yeah
it's trying to constantly improve my
life that way you know
oh so you get asked what's your what was
your favorite year of college
ooh I think my first year was my
favorite year of college it was really
fun I lived in the dorms for the first
year and got to make a lot of friends
started learning computer science
classes weren't that hard yet and like
it was the first time that you meet
people that are ever high school so yeah
it was really fun time to a lot of
repeat questions yeah by the way some of
these reaping questions like after the
live stream probably tomorrow actually
I'll put timestamps on the questions and
just topics in the video description so
you can go back and watch my live stream
and see that cool Jason asks is it
possible to get an entry-level iOS
developer position just knowing Swift
and not objective-c yeah I would say so
I say like maybe do your research and
find companies that are writing mostly
Swift anyways and like those companies
are more likely probably to to hire you
see young indie said why did you go to
college so close to home um I don't know
I I guess it wasn't necessarily like I
went to college because it was close to
home it was like I went to college
because it was the best one that I got
into so yeah it's a very like pragmatic
question or answer I guess ah let's see
Oh how are my 2018 goals going to use
your winning goals
my goals are going pretty well anything
I have my bullet journal in front of me
right here I'm just gonna revisit them
but yeah I think every month I'm
concentrating on different expensive
goals
I'm not doing every single one every
time and this next month is a lot about
consistency perseverance and grit which
is one of my overall 2018 goals so yeah
other than that like the having more
meaningful and real interactions live
healthier don't be afraid to be friends
with people I admire like that's all
going really well like writing these
down in a bullet journal just on paper
that I can reference is really nice and
I like doing this I think I might
actually just do this every year so cool
someone asked these whatever the sh xn
will you ever do software engineering in
the UK that would be cool yeah I feel
like Iowa's development is pretty big in
the UK there's a couple of conferences
that happen in the UK in Europe and I'll
be really cool to do but honestly I
haven't even visited the UK or Europe in
a long time but yeah that would be
really cool to do as like a bucket list
item one day I've always like really
been admiring just like the UK and
London and stuff so yeah cool see um
just figuring out which questions I want
to answer I think I am going to finish
this in a bit though so - two more
questions I'm going to answer two more
questions and I'm going to log off okay
hmm let's see
whoo yo its Lance ass is it dangerous to
become a computer scientists and
security agencies I'm actually not sure
de mean like becoming like a becoming
like the security software engineer it
might be I actually don't really know so
okay night coordination I see UCS RIT I
mean I don't know either you gotta give
me some more context dude what music do
you listen to like code I listen to a
shit ton of chill hop I listen to a lot
of Sheila hub listen to you like the
radio chill hop on YouTube and sometimes
they just like put the chill hop
playlist on Spotify on repeat so okay
okay one more question one more question
um let's see cat or dog and iOS are
Android first question cat or dog I'd
say both and then iOS or Android also
both okay cool well I'm going to end it
so thank you all so much for joining me
on this March livestream I hope you all
had fun don't forget to follow me on
Instagram and Twitter
the other day I just went live casually
on Instagram so yeah sometimes I do that
