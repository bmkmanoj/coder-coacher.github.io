discovered a security flaw in some of
the most ubiquitous devices in
businesses today the wireless keyboard
and the wireless mouse the bus jack this
vulnerability affects most non Bluetooth
keyboards and mouse dongles on both PC
and Apple computers when engineers
designed wireless keyboards they were
worried about the ability of an attacker
to sniffing keystrokes of a target
machine so they encrypted the traffic
between the keyboard and the wireless
USB dongle however they overlooked the
fact that if the dongle is sent running
fifty keystrokes that look like they
come from a wireless keyboard the dongle
will still accept them the mouse Jack
exploit results in the ability for an
attacker to remotely enter a victim's
machine by pairing with the mouse or
keyboard humble it is as if the attacker
was sitting in front of the Machine and
executing commands from the victims own
mousing keyboard the attacker has full
access to the victim system as hackers
become increasingly sophisticated in
their targeting Mouse Jack could be used
to steal data or files from a remote
machine here we illustrate how sensitive
documents could be exfiltrated from the
victims computer the insider can access
files from 30 feet away and
deport delete files and programs and
we'll pass steals research team has
found that mouse Jack has an effective
range of at least 100 meters while the
attack scenarios are limitless mass
steals research illustrates how an
attacker could create a network
vulnerability by opening a command
window on the target machine here we
show an adversary inserting a series of
commands on a computer belonging to a
network administrator from the other
side of the building in this case we see
an attacker using the administrators
Network privileges to install a rootkit
it takes just 30 seconds to result in a
complete network compromise at that
point the attacker can log in to your
network as Mouse Jack attacker thinking
complete access to all the resources on
the network these are only a few
examples of the harm that was jackin
cost of vulnerable computers and their
networks so what can you do to stop
Mouse Jack attacks first unplug any
wireless mouse or keyboard dongles until
you have been able to confirm they are
safe then go to Mouse Jack calm to view
