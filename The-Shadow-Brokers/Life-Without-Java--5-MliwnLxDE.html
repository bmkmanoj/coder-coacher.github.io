with the increasing controversies
surrounding its security Java is under
fire again it's supposed to write ones
run everywhere but it's more like right
once ruin everything you see compiled to
bytecode to run equally for Allah not
like communism or Nazism it's a virus
it's a virus it is a virus Java expert
mrs. Christine has warned of disastrous
consequences if Java is discontinued but
today the president has finally decided
he will push the undo Java button
removing Java I cannot let you go
through with this people demand security
are we talking about a risk of meniscal
proportions God's sake sir you'll see
Stephen Hawking pole-vaulting before you
see security breach with Java
I will not be deceived by the Prince of
Darkness
Oh close call
why the hell do we even have this other
button here due to server issues
Datagram is unable to share its users
inspiring food photos causing boring
meals and starvation I don't even know
what he's eating
where's the fucking photo other Internet
services are also going offline due to
the power issue on a brighter note TV
networks are safe
it's been 14 days since Java was
terminated society has completely
collapsed people javanese on
we need a Java update Co 403
investigating reports of open source
activity standby
I have estimated that we should have a
new update in 22 years
