were hit by a smaller breach it made the
ball stop and think that funded they
were so they brought in the experts it's
never just an IT issue they carried out
cyber security training from boardroom
to basement identifying what was
critical to the business threat and
intelligence monitoring they planned a
cyber incident response and brought in
their own ethical hackers to test the
systems and make honey pots to trap the
attackers they reviewed the whole
business from New York to Tokyo and
devised the game plan for any breach
make some noise source we're in its
denial of service attack just want to
treat the situation have they got into
any accounts
