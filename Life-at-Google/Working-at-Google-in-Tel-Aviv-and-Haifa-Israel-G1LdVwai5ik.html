is actually impossible just think back
to how it must have sounded when a
couple of people said they were going to
organize all the information in the
whole world or that one day we'd be able
to see every place on earth without
actually going there sometimes
impossible things are just problems we
haven't solved yet so how does the
impossible become possible well it often
starts with people like these they're
engineers researchers designers
scientists and inventors people
experimenting rethinking and creating
new technology to challenge the
impossible at the Google R&amp;amp;D center in
Israel they're inventing new ways to
help everyone ask questions wherever
they are on the web in the world and in
almost every language even predicting
their next question they're making it
quicker for everyone to find answers
discover more answers get them in real
time and working to make it all run
faster way faster they're helping
everyone access their accounts when they
need them and helping people access
information when they need it most
they're creating tools so everyone can
share their sites with the world and
using the cloud to give more people
access to those sites in more places
they're making it possible for everyone
to read a piece of history to see more
of the world from anywhere in the world
to get to places faster and see what the
world is searching for they're thinking
of what might be possible in the future
for search the cloud and how machine
learning and AI could create new tools
millions might need someday ones that
might even help others to solve a few
problems of their own the challenges
aren't going to be easy and some of them
may even sound impossible but then again
so did a lot of other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
