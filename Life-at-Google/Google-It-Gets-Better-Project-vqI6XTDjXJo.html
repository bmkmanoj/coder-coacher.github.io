strategic partnerships development team
at Google hi I'm Eric I'm a system
administrator at Google I'm Scottie I
work at Google I'm from the Chicago
suburbs my name is Randy Reyes I grew up
here in the San Francisco Bay Area and I
currently work at Google I remember when
I was younger I had four brothers which
it's not easy to be gay when you have
four brothers because there's like so
much masculinity in the house I remember
sitting in my bedroom when I was younger
laying on my bed and just feeling this
dread in my chest like knowing someday I
have to tell my family or I have to tell
somebody and that alone was enough to
terrify me I grew up at the dinner table
hearing conversations about how gay
people should die of AIDS how gay people
were less than you know straight people
and it really caused me to not very feel
very safe at home and at the same time I
didn't feel very safe at school either
then I went to a public middle school
and high school and it was full of jocks
and I didn't know any gay people I was
the token computer nerd so I got picked
on all the time for that much less being
gay there were days where I was
pretending to be sick just because I was
too afraid to go it was cool I'm a
transsexual woman I grew up in rural
Canada in really conservative
surroundings rather conservative family
I went to a pretty conservative school
and when I was growing up it was all
about conforming fitting in and doing
what was expected of me I was never even
able to think about issues like my
gender identity or sexual orientation
until I was until I grew up in my high
school it was fit in I went to my senior
prom of course with a girl or two girls
actually is a messed up story and I
remember after dropping them off I drove
away drove to the side of the road in my
car
and I started crying just thinking about
how screwed up everything is trying to
figure out what the hell I'm going to do
with my life I didn't know what to do or
who to reach out to and I was scared of
getting hurt and I was so depressed that
I was even thinking about hurting myself
you're sitting in your house it's a
small town you can't you feel this
magnetism like you're never gonna get
out you're never gonna go anywhere and
it really draws you in and you feel like
there's no hope that there's no one who
will ever understand you I'm a software
engineer now at Google I'm and I just
want to tell you straight forward that
things get so much better for me it got
better when I got to college when I got
to college I met many many new people
and some of them I found out were gay
and they were quite happy and there were
a lot of them were quite successful even
when my family couldn't be there to
support me because they didn't know that
I was gay or I hadn't told them or even
after I came out and things were still
kind of a little difficult with them I
knew that I could really rely on my
friends and that's where they became my
family for me things really started to
change in the last two years of high
school when we could you know choose us
choose the subjects that we wanted to
study and choose how we wanted to spend
our free time so I could really start
exploring the city exploring different
sides of myself when I went away to
college I was able to define who I was
there was no there was no backstory I
really felt like I could come alive and
be expressive and as you you sort of
grow older as you leave high school you
are not going to be under the control of
those bullies anymore you're going to be
in control of your own life it got
better when I came out when I was able
to tell my friends and family that I'm
still me but I'm not quite who you
thought um when I was able to say I'm
transgender so the thing about things
getting better is it doesn't just happen
once like it's not one day you wake up
and you go oh my god things are better
things keep getting better over and over
and in really small ways things got
better the first time I said to myself
okay I admit it I'm gay
like that was a huge step things got
better the first time I told a friend
and just somebody else other
minou things got better when I stood
before my brother and it was like the
hardest thing in the world to say to
admit it and I couldn't even get through
the sentence and I started crying and he
gave me a hug and he just like almost
laughed at me it was actually really an
awkward situation but he almost laughed
at me and just said yeah it's okay
and he gave me a hug and if I could tell
myself at the age of 14 what I wanted to
heard from an older person is that it
does get better and that you deserve
that you deserve an awesome education
you will be loved by somebody somebody
will love you back I'd say don't don't
worry so much about the labels or the
definition or the exactly or figuring
out precisely what you are who you are
who you may be back in middle school in
high school I thought it was maybe just
me and you know a couple of other people
I knew but I didn't realize that there
were all these great resources out there
and you're lots of youth centers or LGBT
centers and and I wish I sort of knew
that and maybe I would have reached out
to those groups and realized that here
there are other ways of dealing with
family issues especially within Asian
communities well when I was a young
teenager if someone had told me that in
10 years I would be living in California
or that I would have a boyfriend both of
those things would seem equally strange
and impossible so the truth of the
matter is is even if you think you know
everything that's going to happen in
your life and that you're able to
predict all these terrible sad
depressing things that are gonna happen
you really never know when or how
quickly things can get better for you
there's nowhere to go but up this is
temporary and like all the stuff that
you are experiencing a school or the
stuff you're going through tons of
people go through that but it's
definitely not worth it to not persevere
through it it'd be really bad for you to
want to end your life at that point
because it's so early on and there's so
much more to life so if you're thinking
as a teenager that may be hurting
yourself is going to be a good way of
getting out of the pain
don't do it just think of yourself being
a little older maybe not 40 maybe 25 but
think of yourself coming back and
telling you that it's going to be okay
because it is whether in your personal
life and your friendships at work things
are getting better really quickly stay
here to see it just don't do it I don't
know what else to say it's just it's
gonna get so much better if you hang on
it's gonna get a lot better
it really gets better yeah it does get
better if you don't hang on for just a
year more or a couple months more
whatever it may be you might not get to
meet your best friend you might not get
to meet the person that you spend the
rest of your life with so just hang on
and you will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
