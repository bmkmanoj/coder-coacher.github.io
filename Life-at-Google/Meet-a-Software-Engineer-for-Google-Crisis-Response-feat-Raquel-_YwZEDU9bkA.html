beyond what's already been done I think
how you could change how that whole
ecosystem of information works software
engineering is kind of at the core of
the company so you get a perspective as
kind of a center of the universe where
you look at all these different
technologies and you to integrate them
into it you know amazing product I work
on the Google crisis response team and
we do our best to make information
available as quickly as possible for
people after a natural disaster let's
say that something like the earthquake
in Haiti happens there's a particular
unfulfilled role with managing data that
you can't expect the people who are
actually on the ground helping people
who are saving lives who aren't
providing medical support who are
rebuilding cities you can't expect them
to worry about something like a
spreadsheet we're a group of engineers
product managers and partnership people
who work pretty closely together to try
to solve this problem from end to end
that could mean working closely with
agencies who own data and building
open-source tools to validate their data
and make it more useful on the web to
building systems within Google that
ingest data process it and ultimately
provide information to people that is
interprete balandin up to date after a
crisis happens people go to Google they
use Google they try to find information
out and that's a moment in time that's
really critical for us to provide really
timely feedback so we have a great
responsibility to make sure that we give
users accurate data it's exactly the
kind of thing that Google is good at and
should be working on the fact that
Google hire is extremely good software
engineers it's not just that the
products we make are good it's that what
I'm learning is I feel like I'm learning
from the best we look for people that
are visionary people that actually see
the big picture that aren't just
incremental but really think about our
products we like people with enthusiasm
and care about their job and are excited
to come in every day here it's sort of
in the air that you should be pursuing
things that you think are rewarding even
if it's risky it's your own risk
that's what entrepreneurialism is all
about I really didn't think it was
possible to do this kind of work
