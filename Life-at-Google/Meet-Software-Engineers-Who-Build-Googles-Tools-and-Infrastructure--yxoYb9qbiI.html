Tim Leahy and I'm a software engineer
and tools and infrastructure also called
City for short Sarah is a software
engineer first and foremost we develop
code the differences between a city and
a traditional software engineer is that
our customers are severally other
engineers and when we lost a product we
lost it to other Googlers software
projects that grow big enough need a
full-time person to do the integration
between the people producing the
software and the infrastructure that
runs it we're the ones doing the the
plumbing of the organization to keep
things moving forward we also often say
that we're part of an engineering
productivity team because that's what we
do we help all engineers being
productive right high quality codes and
great products that are just great
keeping software up-to-date with recent
updates and releases coordinating with
the project management teams to make
sure that things are on track and on
schedule removing a lot of unnecessary
roadblocks to Ewing software to Holliman
I think one of the best things about
working at Google is really the people
there's a lot of different backgrounds
and I like that my preference is to have
a team with a lot of backgrounds and not
a diversity in perspective as well
there's a lot of mobility within Google
if you feel like you have done
everything you can possibly do in the
group you are working in there are tons
of opportunities elsewhere in the
company probably the location where you
are or other locations around the world
it's a big part of being at Google is
growing yourself all the time
you meet other people you meet people
from different parts of Google and
you'll learn more about what they're
doing and again it's all about sharing
knowledge expanding your skill sets the
projects that I've worked on are now in
people's hands on people's faces and I
can only count a handful of experience
that I've had in my entire career where
it was as rewarding as what I've worked
on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
