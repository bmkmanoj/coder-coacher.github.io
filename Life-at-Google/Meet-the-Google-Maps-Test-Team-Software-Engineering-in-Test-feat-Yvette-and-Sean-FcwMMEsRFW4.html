testing and the entire team you know
will depend on you and will talk to you
about whatever tests work they want to
do I'm a test engineer in Google Maps
meaning I actually test tile rendering
so we basically take all of the Geo data
and convert it into the map you all know
and love the impact that a test engineer
can habit Google is huge because there
are so few of us we can pick what's the
highest priority thing where we will
think we will like uncover the most bugs
and use the technology we're really
passionate about we don't want to
disappoint our users and the thing that
testing brings us is that real world
look at what our products look like from
a user perspective and that's really
important so test is the front lawns
between what we try to build and what
our users actually see so the map tiles
we make are used by millions tens of
millions hundreds of millions of people
and making sure that those look good
it's essentially my responsibility where
the people sort of at the end of the
pipeline who can ensure that what they
said was usable at the beginning is
actually what's happening for them in
the end
so SATs are also involved in the
development of the product they help
plan the roadmap they help plan the
features they get a say in everything in
SE T focuses more on depth of a single
area whereas a T has a broader focus
I write way more code and use way cooler
tools and I ever could have imagined I
code every day for hopefully most of the
day most days I would say I program you
know being tired you don't have manual
testing in the sense that you have
testers going down a script you instead
design automation you help make designs
that are going to lend themselves easily
to being tested you helped the team
rapidly do their work we make big
decisions on wind shift and how to ship
and turning our products around as fast
as possible based on the input we get
from tests when the map breaks usually
it breaks back accurately so you'll find
some
stanchion that maybe caused a whole
bunch of parks to disappear change color
we could get somebody lost in the middle
of a desert if we could have a road that
leads to nowhere that it's actually in a
driving direction their success is if I
can find a bug before our users do
that's a great thing and so it's a
different mindset a different way of
looking at problems you know a mistake
that we find at that level is one that
you know potentially millions of users
are going to see in real life I love
Google Maps I've used Google Maps for
years I've worked on it now for a year
and a half and now I feel partly
responsible for the quality of it users
are seeing map tiles that I helped build
and QA tests and making sure that that
experience is great for the user is part
of the reason that I love going to work
every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
