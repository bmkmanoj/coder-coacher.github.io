wonderful you've got some questions to
answer here right here we do yeah
welcome to Chicago
welcome my name is Brian Fitzpatrick and
I go by Fitz my name is ben
collins-sussman and I go by ben
collins-sussman
we're here in the Google Chicago office
where many things get done so what are
we gonna do we're gonna answer a few
questions here yeah I've got I've got
them all listed out here my Gpad
technology very very high-tech it's got
a great tactile interface so the first
question we have is from the boss
the Balthasar in Luxembourg actually it
looks like it's a bunch of question the
first question is do you feel working at
Google is like a hobby since you started
working at Google do you feel happier
did you notice you've started learning
more do you feel you broaden or
specialize your knowledge fascinate
that's an awful it's more than one
question so which one should we do first
that's sort of it do you feel working at
Google is like a hobby I do feel it's
much like a hobby in fact I would say
one of the great things that working
here is that we have people who are very
passionate about computer science and
one of the things I actually look for
when interviewing people is is this
would this person be doing computer
science for fun if they were a
billionaire didn't have to work at all
when they'd still be playing around on
computers and that's true pretty much of
every engineer here and I I know I
certainly fit to that category right
yeah so it's like coming to work is
actually something I look forward to
because I get to play in the world's
biggest computer playground right what
sit sit I mean I guess like a hobby to
the extent if I love my job I mean I
really really love working here I love
coming to work here primarily because of
the people I get to work with yeah you
get to work with some of the smartest
people in computer science and you know
that sort of leads into the other
question he had do you notice you
started learning more I don't know that
I've suddenly started learn anymore but
I'm definitely always learning because
we're working with so many people who
you know you always pick up something
from somebody yes and it's also one of
these things where the environment is so
dynamic it's always changing there's
always new technologies coming out it's
one of those things where you almost
have to run the hold still right even if
you have created a product and launched
it you're still always improving if
there's always new things coming out
that cause you
to adapt and learn a new change right
and there's and there's there's other
companies they're coming out with
products that are in competition with
yours and you know you get excited about
that because you have an opportunity to
make your product better and you always
want to you know you focus on the users
and and basically write good software
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
