was told I'd get to work on the Google
Search app for iOS and what I was really
amazed about was the fact that I'd be
really that the only designer on this
project they said to me you know our
experience on the tablet it's not good
enough we're not really doing enough
there what can you do to make it better
and I was amazed that they would ask me
something like that and not like we have
this idea go build it it's more like you
have a really talented team go off and
show us something great we think about
the user first and when you think about
the user you have to look at all the
little intricate details about how they
interact with your product and user
experience and user research is a
fantastic way to understand how our
users use our products and their skills
or how to build what is a complex system
into a simple user experience so we
spent a lot of time iterating on
different designs because we really
needed to start building it and changing
it over time and testing it to know that
it was good when you hit a link a lot of
times you want to go back very quickly
back and forth to explore these results
so I came up with this tab do I wear
once you click a result a tab slides out
and you can kind of scan through it so
maybe that's not what I want and
instantly swipe it away or tap it away
and look at other results when you watch
a video of a person in Korea or in Japan
or anywhere and they're holding it and
they're just kind of talking about a
look and it does this and they're
tapping it and they're interacting with
it they're swiping things that I had
thought about and sketched on a
whiteboard the fact this sketch reached
across the globe is incredibly
eye-opening and it really drives you
every day to keep doing what you're
doing
Amit Singhal the guy who really invented
a lot of the the way that search works
today
the fact that he would be willing and
excited to learn about design really
made me excited to come to work to know
that that the people responsible for a
lot of the biggest decisions we make
care about these things it's never too
late to learn often in the case of an
executive what you need to do is you
have to understand enough of the craft
and enough of the background enough of
the technology
and why they're doing what they're doing
to really be able to understand in which
directions to push a product and how to
push your product you have to understand
beauty to be able to work with teams to
produce it with the search applications
that we've worked on for Windows 8 and
for iPhone and Android we've done a lot
of the UX work there so in thinking
about where Google can be really helpful
there where's the right time for us to
come in and surprise you and delight you
if you have good ideas you can come work
here and build those things
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
