competition we mainly do it for fun just
because we lost programming contestants
get really difficult programming
problems that most people might not be
able to solve in a week but you somehow
need to solve it in a couple hours and
you can compete from anywhere as long as
you have a laptop computer and internet
connection we have people from every
continent virtually that are competing
and it's a really amazing online global
community I love code Jam because it's
very engaging if everybody that gets
involved is really loved it very
passionate about it it provides access
to people around the world to engage
with our engineers at Google and also
each other I think my favorite thing
about code Jam events is meeting all the
other people it's nice to see a lot of
the people who have been doing this for
as long as I have and a lot of new faces
as well
they're often funny and have a clever
story or balancer like something I
advantageous conveying what the task is
I just love the sort of like playful
thoughtful nature of the problem
statements they've presented these kind
of fun situations a lot of programming
day to day is filled with stuff that
kind of gets in the way of the fun part
of the problem
so we'll strike all that away and we
just focus on the core of the problem
so my favorite see the last C++ C++ is
familiarity you don't know what you're
doing you can really do something wrong
but if you do know what you're doing you
do a lot of power now let's say you're
going to feel of other languages being
better at some specific that mostly is
Python that's not always the best choice
for coding in a competition the time
that you lose on that sometimes you save
because it's easier to debug in Python
they use many languages in coach and I
would guess 100 class maybe one that
uses Shakespearean language there's one
that's purely based on white space
there's one that's based on lolcat speak
we've even had a contestant use the
language that they wrote completely on
their own practice is the most important
thing it's most important than knowing
algorithms or knowing math I think my
advice is just try previous problems
from biggest ears and you will find some
of them that are just way too hard and
that's fine just do as many easier
problems like the first couple in the
fall rounds and be like a problems in
the round ones just do as many of those
as you can
oh my god yeah there were a few years
well maybe a couple of years where we
were actually changing problems during
the final right before we're going to
have the finals got everything set up
perfectly and then a Beautif used blue
or something and that all the power went
out all the computers were down
we almost served one of our contestants
a problem that he had already kind of
written himself which would have been
bad we really try not to do that anymore
koji M is important to me because it's
basically a Google product that our
engineers work on they put so much
passion into it think Oh gem is good for
the community because it gives people an
opportunity to test their skills meet a
lot of great people and learn a lot
everybody in the community I've met has
been really like polite and friendly and
eager to help other people learn so a
great group it's a really honor for me
to work with our Co GM engineers and
also to sprinkle jam some more people
around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
