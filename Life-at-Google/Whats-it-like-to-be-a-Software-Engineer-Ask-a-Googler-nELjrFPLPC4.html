software engineer and manager on the
Google Chrome team I think I myself kind
of like a fairy godmother I go around
the chrome team spreading the joy of two
things the first is usable security and
the second is data-driven and product
development over the last five years my
job has changed a lot when I first
started my job was focused on fixing a
very specific problem how do I make
warnings better then over time it
expanded to how do I make all secure to
UI and chrome better and now I'm
starting to stand out to other teams
like metrics autofill and payments where
their broader problems affecting the
whole chrome team and I am using the
skills I learned earlier and applying
them to a broader scope I now spend a
lot of time reviewing other people's
code writing design Docs to help other
people figure out what they should be
influencing and meeting with
stakeholders to understand what we
should be implementing and why I love
working on chrome because people use it
there's something like 2 billion people
who are using Chrome and I really like
that it means that the work that I'm
doing is actually making the daily lives
of people easier and in many ways safer
and I really value that I have to love
that you know I can show my friends it's
like oh my god you know I built that or
oh I helped them figure out how to
launch that I really appreciate that so
having that real-world impact on
people's lives
because hey I really like chrome I think
it's a great product I love that it's
open source I love that I'm able to talk
about what I work on I love that I see
people using the thing I build and be
honestly because of my manager I've had
the same manager for several years now
and there's a saying people don't leave
bad teams they leave bad managers and I
think they're versa is also true which
is that people stay because of good
managers I feel like my aim of the trust
my manager and she's found growth
opportunities for me as I wanted to go
looking for growth opportunities and as
a result I've been happy staying at
Google one thing I like about Google's
culture is the culture around code
reviews so at Google any time you're
trying to let code at least one other
person often two or three also review
your code and get feedback before you're
allowed to Land's it and as part of that
process people are encouraged to a ask
questions of their reviewers and be
eight the reviewers are encouraged to
get candid but hopefully constructive
and friendly feedback I've learned a lot
in this process a good code reviewer
really makes your your job easier they
teach you things that help you write
better code than what you started with I
think it's a really important part of
the culture
what I've found in my experience is that
if you have a good idea if you're able
to back it up with a strong argument
with data you're able to show results
people are interested in your idea no
matter how junior you are or even if
you're in a different part of the
company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
