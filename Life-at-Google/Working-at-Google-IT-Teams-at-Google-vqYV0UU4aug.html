us we're doing a hangout on air on the
life at Google page I'm been freed I'm
Google's CIL I'm happy to be hanging out
here with some of my colleagues from
corporate engineering Google's IT
department our organization's mission is
to empower Googlers with world-leading
technology um my colleagues and I here
are really excited to be here because
you know we've been trying to get the
word out about what we do although
everyone knows that Google hires
engineers work on Google's amazing
products what we do is a little less
well known and people don't always
realize that we're looking for great IT
people who want to work on the
technology that powers the company so
today I'm here with Tara narada and
Jason we're going to talk a little bit
about what what it's like about what we
do in corporate engineering at Google so
why don't we start with Tara who's here
uh am i right hi Tara so what introduce
yourself tell us about your team and
what you do sure my name is Tara Mathieu
I'm based in the New York office and I
manage the team that implements systems
to help manage our multi-billion dollar
investment portfolio for Google cool all
right
Narada hi I'm nearad Haku and I'm out
here in Mountain View here with Jason
and I helped run the IT program for the
real estate in workplaces services team
it's actually a big group of you know
various types of folks from the real
estate that builds and sort of manages
buildings and out here and workplace
services which is all the parts of
Google and then physical security which
is going to access control safety
security that kind of stuff so do IT for
all these groups cool Jason hi I'm Jason
and the software developers and I'm also
a bass and I'm based in Mountain View
and I integrated various internal and
external HR systems cool so uh since
this is after all the life at life at
Google page I thought we could start off
by maybe you're telling us all telling
the audience a little bit what your work
life is like what's a typical day or
week don't we go in backwards order and
start with Jason this time
uh-huh sure so yeah actually you know a
typical kind of workday for me is like
coming in at 11 o'clock in the morning
I'm firing up my server and just coding
so I you know I get to geek out and
write code all day it's awesome so I'm I
actually enjoy coming to work every day
because I know I just I'm just going to
be writing lots of Python Java
JavaScript and working with that team of
really great software engineers and
developers and and yeah so it's it's
awesome I am we my team has a really
strong focus on unit testing and
actually core bench that's the whole you
know has a really big focus on testing
and code quality so it's not uncommon to
have teams with like very large code
bases that have 90 plus percent code
coverage and my previous team had
something like 3,000 test assertions run
at less than a minute so we we really
take pride in our in our code coverage
and testing cloth and quality of testing
well I think it's you know not every IT
shop has that kind of code review
practices that we have - was that
something that was new to you when you
came to Google yeah totally and when I
came to Google I was like really
impressed by um well when I first joined
Google I worked on Google Checkout and
we you know I worked with some really
amazing software engineers on checkout
and and and then when I came to court
bench I was I saw the same kind of
culture the same expertise and you know
some of the software engineers here here
are just really really really talented
and yeah we you know we really take
pride in code quality we review every
single line of code by multiple people
sometimes we have different reviewers
for different languages so if you have a
change list that for different languages
you know if this change list has you
know some Java code some Python or Java
Script you'll have three at least three
different people reading that you know
and commenting and you know the UM make
changes and it's very yeah we have
awesome internal tools that help you
kind of manage that entire process
cool so mr. neuron you've got this
incredibly big and diverse customer
group right with tons of Technology
power on what they do and you know not
everyone really understands it but kind
of from the outside you might not know
from hearing the description of the
teams that you support but it's what
they do is some of the stuff that most
defines the Google experience right so
what's worth like for you what's it like
for you to be kind of part of the group
that's the adornment algae that defines
right really what it's like to be here
working in the company so unlike Jason
my my day didn't start a lot and started
at 8:00 a.m. you know you go until
midnight you know regular workday but
and a lot of it starts with you know I'm
a developer actually and this is the
thing about Google it there isn't you
know a boxed in to what you do I'm
running a program now and I'm working
closely with customers stakeholders and
so on doing a lot of stuff you know
leadership kind of stuff so but I tie my
my development background back in
because we design and build stuff from
the ground up for these different teams
and so you know a typical typical
workday for me might be meeting with
various groups just to give you a little
more background I mean like what is IT
for for a group like roos well and then
why do they need IT so you've got a
group like the real estate team for
example these are the guys who buy the
land that we built buildings I've got
presences like 60 plus countries you
know I've got hundreds of buildings
right we're always constructing
constructing renovating I mean things
move here much like the pace of Google's
code itself you know the building's
themselves evolve very dramatically
we've got to look you know a lot of
people characterize the campus as a sort
of a cross between a theme park and a
college campus you know there's there's
that richness going on it's not just
buildings right there's a lot going on
here you might have a half by might have
slides you know it all starts equippable
yeah I mean climbing wall don't forget
the climbing wall yes the climbing walls
exactly you know it you know you name it
we've got it
and so um to complement that there's a
rich set of IT that they need to help
manage the leases or to manage the
construction projects to execute
transactions to buy and sell land
you know to portfolio plan right figure
out where are we going to be five to
seven years from now in terms of the
real estate need we have you know the
land we so there's there's a lot of
interesting questions to ask and you
know our team is tasked with building
tools reporting you know all sorts of
applications to help answer those
questions that they have and um you know
a lot of the times the balance between
for us is trying to design tools whether
we buy what's out there that's really
good out there or we completely build
from the ground up and starts when the
requirements gathering with a customer
and then all the way through design and
deployment and support you know keeping
the tool alive as well it's very
important much I think one big huge win
of sort of being in core bench and I
think everyone can allude to this here
is the fact that you are right there
with your customer and they're all right
here with us and I meet with them and
there's that gratification of being able
to go build something and get immediate
feedback you know both getting that
right right then and there so there's
that's a great part of you know I mean
one of the things I take pride in that I
like to tell people about about what we
do that's interesting and differentiates
it from other parts of Google is you
know we get to sit down and have lunch
with our users every day they're all
around us in the cafeteria right and
it's like that's kind of if that's one
of the things that excites you about
engineering and technology the fact you
can actually see the people it's having
an effect on and see the effect it has
immediately you know there's no better
place to I might been in this know that
no better place you could work a better
job and they really take the partnership
very seriously which made me so happy
when it came to Google so as an example
you know I work with the Treasury team
so the Treasury team manages a huge
multi billion dollar investment
portfolio and just the multitude of
tools an ephah is incredible it's a
combination of purchasing third-party
vendor products and also building some
things in-house to address some
reporting needs that maybe the vendors
can't do so our treasury team even takes
us out to conferences and I'm not
kidding you we're usually the only IT
people in the room but you know it
really gives us a good sense for what
our customers trying to do you know
rather than it being you know a
dictatorial here's what we
you know it's more hey we have some
ideas what do you guys think what should
we build we get to be involved to very
early on in the process and I think that
that that's kind of what leads to really
doing really great technology if someone
asked me you know kind of how can you
differentiate ITA Google from IT at
other places I think the possibility of
those kinds of partnerships is one way I
mean I know you're not someone to boast
but your team is one you know the
coveted Alexander Hamilton award for
treasury technology systems an
unprecedented number of times right and
I think that that's as much as it's a
revolution to the talents of the team I
also think it's reflecting the
opportunity to create by the partnership
and by having you know really creative
engaged customers you get to spend a lot
of time exactly you know they're they're
always available to either help explain
things that we don't know get us in
touch with maybe other folks in the
Treasury space so maybe it's meeting
with another company to find out what
their IT systems are like we often learn
a lot just from hearing what other
companies are doing and we use that to
decide how to develop our strategies as
well well hey so Tara getting back to
that original question kind of what life
you know what what the day the work with
the work week and someone are like
you're here with me in our New York
office right is just Narada Jason are
there and headquarters so what's uh
what's what's your work like and what's
it like working out of New York as well
on addition so the nice thing is you
know when I come in the office in the
morning at 9 o'clock
you know Mountain View isn't there yet
so I can have a nice relaxing cup of
coffee that I've made myself using our
own expressive mountains that is the
skill I picked up since coming to Google
I can now make my own lot did you use
the espresso machine office hours uh I
did why I actually could use the office
hours as well learn how to put just just
the right for me I can't say I've
totally mastered it but it's good enough
I'm still working up my phone are so and
the more said the morning is is time for
me to really plan out what is our team
doing how are we doing in our projects
how reviewing requirements documents
that our team has done or test plans
that our team has done and try and come
up with longer term and shorter term
strategies for for the work our team is
doing once Mountain View comes in which
is usually around noon our
then I'm pretty much you know at my
laptop doing hangouts all day long which
thank God for hangouts because otherwise
I'd be making a lot more trips to
Mountain View but thanks to the hangouts
you know the quality is really great and
you know it's like you're really there
so I'll have meetings with usually key
stakeholders from Treasury with my own
team you know maybe a and once in a
while you know maybe a vendor will come
in give a demo of some cool tool that we
want to use how neat so it's a lot of
fun yeah that the pervasive use of
videoconferencing really does make work
here I think different in in ways that
are sometimes subtle and hard to
describe to people on the outside but I
don't know like you know like you I've
got uh I've got a few small children at
home I know you just yeah you're you
just seven and a half right and and you
know for me their possibility of doing
video conferencing and working with my
global team anywhere from my laptop has
really allowed me to to find a kind of
balance between work life and home life
that I would not have expected otherwise
and elsewhere it's the use of the video
conferencing technology and hangouts has
been great for that it's one of these
things that really makes Google unusual
absolutely um so I think you guys kind
of kind of touched about this but I
thought it'd be interesting for the
people watching this to try to get a
sense of what makes what makes the loop
every company to one degree or another
has IT right but what makes that what
makes it being at Google and your jobs
different from what it might be
elsewhere
I mean from a treasury standpoint it's
interesting we have met with a lot of
other treasury teams and other companies
here what they're doing and I think
innovation is the big thing which you
just don't see very often
you know um in in the Treasury space you
know they're working to provide services
leveraging our relationships with our
vendors to rulers you know using
Treasury to benefit Googlers that's
something I just really haven't heard in
other places you know to offer those
kind of benefits and you know really
always trying to push the envelope like
how can we do more how can we create a
greater return while still keeping
nervous levels really low you know and
and what are new exciting things we can
do is always the top of our treasurer's
list which makes it really fun yeah
they're a great group to work with
enjoy no Jason neurotic I mean you have
thoughts about this kind of what white
why is Google a different you know
what's different about doing this kind
of stuff at Google what wouldn't this is
you about it
sure yeah like well I like having
massage room like we've heard about
11:00 a.m. starts and massage room
sometimes when I'm developing I you know
I can't think clearly maybe I didn't
sleep well the night before or something
so I'll just go get a massage and and
they're discounted massages so you pay
like twenty dollars and you might give
them like a tip or something but uh and
but it always works I'm gonna go back to
my desk and I can be productive for the
rest of the day so that's pretty cool
and the asad rooms are pretty much they
have massage rooms in every building and
and you know excellent masseuses at them
and also having they have a lawn mower
we see that's not a problem we have here
a yeah on campus once yes right yeah
another thing I really like about
working here is just access to all kinds
of really like awesome people I mean I
was reading a book called effective Java
which is probably the most Josh blog
josh bloch Jeff Locke just hit my
question about about the book yeah just
email Josh block or walk by his desk and
just talk to her a little bit you know
the Python creator review by russell
works here i've seen him around saw him
at a holiday party last year I wanted to
talk to him that I didn't couldn't
really gather the Kerch they're actually
like I didn't know what to say yeah and
he was there just having a martini or
something and then uh you know then
creator Bryan Lamar
lunr works here Ken Thompson that the
UNIX yeah UNIX in the 60s or 70s or
whatever it works here you know these
people are they're just they're so
accessible you can send them an email
and chat with them ya know and you touch
RocketBallz points and I think it's
worth kind of amplifying for the
audience the first is that you know I
mean it should go without saying that no
matter what we do in IT
we view it as engineering whether you're
you know doing business analysis or
integrating software service or software
or writing new code we need all those
engineering and Google was created by
two engineers right so so much of the
design of the company and the culture
was around allowing engineers to be able
to work at their best and so people look
at the perks and the benefits and all
that and so like some of the stuff that
you mentioned earlier Jason and the
thing to actually understand is it's all
part of a plan to make it be a great
place for engineers to work right a
place where engineers can get everything
that they need where we minimize their
distractions we give them tools to allow
them to be better at what they're doing
then it could be otherwise and I found
that to be one of the huge
differentiator is I you know I worked in
another industry for a long time prior
to this and I loved it but I think
there's a real difference about doing IT
in a company with such a strong
engineering culture that I think is a
differentiator and I know in my role
I've become better at what I do as a
result of having the eyes of so many
engineers and so much great engineering
going on around around me in addition to
the fact that the company was
constructed and maximize the
productivity of engineers the first
principle I think that's that this is
something most unusual so Your Honor we
didn't get get your take I've kind of a
little different right yeah you know I
mean so it's interesting there's a lot
of different things but I think one
thing is is is the user base we needed
to that earlier but you know teeing off
of what we were talking about massage
program so in our in our team we support
the IT behind the massage program that's
right that's your app isn't it that's
not we Oh dad and so you know question
is well it's a great example like well
why'd you need IT for a massage and it
turns out Googlers are a very demanding
bunch of people because it's not enough
that there's a web tool to schedule your
massages and this is before appointments
are supported and Google Calendar we
already had to we had to do something
that the calendar didn't do you know so
we really took it to the next level
right a calendar and capabilities to
schedule massages against deployment
stops and then you know then customers
said they wanted a mobile app because
they want to be on the go so you know if
you tried the mobile app it you know so
we built out a mobile app and and and
then internally there's a lot of
reporting
and all around one area you know and so
it's interesting because the user base
and by user base there's two kinds I
mean there's both the folks in very
specific business teams or operations
teams running the scene for some part of
the work you know that we do at Google
and then there's the general Googler who
is you know also kind of consumer of a
lot of these tools that we built both
are very demanding people because you
know if you can imagine the kind of the
level of perfection that is you know
people try to achieve out there with
with external products you use daily
those same people obviously have a very
high bar and so meeting those
expectations is a pretty enriching
challenge I mean it's not easy but it's
a lot of fun and it sort of forces you
to take things to the sort of the next
level and and likewise you know in terms
of the scale of projects that's another
thing that I think that makes like
school unique I mean there's probably
you know everything I do in the
corporate real estate or corporate arena
seems it seems like Google is like 10x
everything out there you know and it's
just not sufficient to say that you know
we'll do it like any other company and
so the amount of resources we're willing
to pour into solving problems both
exciting and and also raises the stakes
that much more you know this like a
specific instance is is that like you
know I that I think of a lot is at other
places where we had real estate
absolutely now there you know other
times workplaces apps there might be
expectation is that you maybe you think
you're ten people who use it or twenty
people use it but you should design as
if it's going to be thousands of users
you never know that it becomes an
enterprise solution someday so that's
another aspect of you know I think it
makes things different here no I
definitely agree I agree I was going
through kind of as you went through kind
of some of this is you going through
you're interesting about all the things
that the team that you work with does
that are interesting right I mean they
run is it the largest private bus fleet
in California for example something like
that right I mean it's just all the kind
of interesting ways in which Google has
explored new territory and the
challenges that that creates for
technology
never work right absolutely because you
know it's a good point you mentioned
that the bus network is gets us from
campus from here so you can just hop on
a bus and get to anywhere in the Bay
Area if you're familiar with a barrier
geography about an hour and a half mile
radius from here to San Francisco to San
Jose and a pleasant and so on and
there's this there's and so the
interesting there's they're scheduling
challenges like how do you schedule bus
bunch of buses if a bus goes down how do
you quickly send out a replacement all
the buses have to have Wi-Fi I mean how
do you actually connect you know you the
expectation is that you're continue can
continue working if you want on the bus
right and and then there is like
security because you know how do you
help monitor manage the safety the
security some of the buses probably have
like you know yeah they'll have cameras
pretty soon to monitor traffic around it
so there's also an exciting stuff that
we can be doing and are doing and that I
don't think either company really
everything's about I think I mean that's
kind of a great tagline and I think
we'll probably will probably go from
that tagline to answering some questions
that have appeared on the moderator and
in the comments now but that comment
about challenges and doing work that no
other company is facing is I think a
great way of summarizing what makes what
we do so interesting and different so um
the plan now is to go through questions
that were posted to the moderator page
or in the comments section of the of our
of our Plus page of the life of Google
page so the first question that I see is
from source Frenchy and Montreat
Montrealer trace a male all you had the
chance to magically fix something in IT
with no budget limit what would you do I
guess this is probably a question for
all of us all you face as much as me um
if you have chimed in if you get if you
ever thought about it mmm
so within Treasury one of the issues we
always have is there's just so much data
available term even if you look at one
specific security you might be buying
and selling there ten different places
that can provide a price for one right
so one of the issues we always have is
oh we have so many different sources of
data from so many different vendors we
have to make sure it all stays in sync
with each other
and then send it off to other places
maybe you know other vendor systems who
want to integrate with maybe our own
in-house reporting tool so if I could
magically fix something out have one
huge data warehouse to pull in whatever
data you want using whatever type of
methodology you want and and have a way
to automatically reconcile what where
it's getting the data from as I have
spread in the financial world that's
such a huge challenge
exactly really and even I reckon so
there are some reconciliation tools out
there but the problem is it they're so
basic you know all they can do is match
line for line and then you've you're
pretty much doing the same thing over
and over again oh well I know about that
break because of this why can't we have
some machine learning that can say oh
you know you are always fixing this
stuff you could do anything I know some
machine learning people here at Google
okay we should talk so near are Jason
thoughts about if you could wave a magic
wand and fix something with infinite
funds what would it be saying yeah so
the font is an interesting question
because there's a there's the question
of like if I had infinite brainpower
what would I try to fix and then you
stop you're like wait wait I'm at Google
I can do that
right there there's actually you know
quite a bit of resource pool here in
terms of brilliance and I think a lot of
interesting complex problems get solved
on that basis I think the idea are like
sort of the funding aspect when you talk
about money well what would be by the
ability to formally support certain
efforts we've thought of this as
interesting or potentially unring that
we can you know sort of fun bringing
brains on from internally you know
basically sponsored yeah I think there's
an unlimited list of projects I would
love to do because of that if I could
just sit here here's like you know
gazillion dollars or take some of that
Treasury money maybe and you know and I
will know about entire team to go work
on crosses and from yes I mean there's
this probably a long long list
I think we're forced to be buying what
we have to do and we have to prioritize
and tackle and I mean I think that's a
reasonable expectation for any
organization but but but you know so I
it's it's I guess the question is yeah
what would what would money buy us it's
it's it's
sounds like it's not having to
prioritize as one PR dog that might be
exciting yeah everything yeah not having
to decide just do it alright but Jake
Jason any any thoughts sure I would
actually try to open-source more things
that I'm working on like you know here
at Google we have we have a culture of
like trying to share what we're doing
internally with people outside of the
company so you know Google closure is an
example of that where we had some
engineers build am you know javascript
compiler templating library and our
template templating system and library
there was an awesome tool we use it
internally and and someone just said why
don't we just open source this so it's
been a few months of doing that it's a
great it's an awesome tool it's
available outside of the company and
it'd be nice to be able to do something
like that with them some of the HR and
Treasury things that I have that my team
has been working on I mean we're we're
kind of solving the same problems a lot
of other people with various companies
are trying to solve so it'd be great to
have some some projects has stood on App
Engine that other teams could use and
want a great lead-in
what are we leading for me since that's
what I'm trying to it's one of my big
directions for our organization thank
you for that I think you can point for
the assist on that and so yeah I mean
one of the ways I want us to
differentiate Google is also to be able
to share it with the rest of the world
right we've been early adopters of
things like Google App Engine for
example which make it incredibly easy to
find a place to host your application
have it scale up to enterprise needs or
scale down the needs of one or two teams
at you know without having to worry
about the system's planning and running
and systems administration capacity
planning stuff and I would love to see
other organizations be able to take
advantage of both the thought that we
put into building these business
applications and the ability to run it
at kind of zero
you know marginal cost not that you
don't have to pay for App Engine but
there's no marginal cost in the sense of
having to grow your staff and buy new
hardware and so on you can really be so
much more experiment what we've
discovered what I've discovered as a CIO
about App Engine so much more
experimental about what you do because
you don't have to worry about making a
huge commitment to equipment or data
centers or administrative assistance
administration staffed and try out a new
app so we're trying to do more Jason you
may
get your wish we're trying to do more of
open sourcing that we build so thank you
for helping me have your dream realized
I think you know as I was thinking about
answering uh this question you know my
you know my take on it is you know at
any given time there's lots of projects
that I'm enthusiastic about that I'd
like to see funded that maybe kind of
don't cross a prioritization line so I'm
not going to take neurons answers my
non-being not having to prioritize and
decide everything but and be able to
give a yes to everything although that
would be great
but the thing that I actually think if I
could fix that I would that is just such
a big problem is that uh you know we
spend so one of the things we do at
Google is we let people choose the kind
of computer that they want to use the
theory being that you know your work
everyone will work - no matter what you
do it's your tech savvy and we expect
you to choose that you expect you to
choose the tool set that you can be most
productive with right but the truth of
the matter is is that some of these
tools they're just things about doing
someone's stuff that are expensive if
you want to free the operating system on
a personal computer it often means the
person has to take their computer in and
it has to be unavailable for several
hours people don't want to do that but
there's good reasons you know every CIO
will tell you all the good reasons why
you might want to do that for security
reasons keep things up to date and stuff
like that and if I could wave a magic
wand would be able to do things like
make upgrades free and instantaneous
with no loss of data we can't do that
today my hope is that something like
that Chrome OS in the enterprise will
allow us to get there you know it'll be
a different kind of personal computing
experience for the one that people are
used to today but but but source
frenchie that would be the magic wand I
would wave so we only have time you guys
have given great really thoughtful
answers we're only gonna have time for
one or two more questions and there were
I apologize because there were six
questions on the list but why don't we
go to the next one which is from Domingo
Rogers in Cary North Carolina and his
question is when it comes to training
are you a proponent of project driven
versus personal development and what's
your vision of training for the IT team
compared to how IT training is currently
conducted one I kind of give my answer
on this and see what you all have have
thoughts about kind of training and how
it might work as well you know Domingo
my short answer is that uh this is kind
of complicated but first of all I think
that if you're if you're a professional
of any sort particularly an IT
professional the hallmark of being a
professional is a dedication to
self-improvement right that's technology
as an arena that moves incredibly
quickly and if you're not part of your
invest if you have if you are in
technology part of that reason has to be
because you like change and you deal
with it and you want to be part of it I
think that part of that means personal
commitment to training and and the other
sorts of things that are necessary to
keep yourself current so I think I don't
know how to classify that as project or
personal development but I think that it
starts with that commitment that you're
gonna have to continuing self-improve if
you want to stay in this business I also
do think and I've seen there's great
project based training at Google and
also there's all kinds of opportunities
for personal development and kind of
there's great training programs but
everything from things like managing
your personal energy level which is
actually a great way it's a great class
I recommend it um I know classes um you
know there's leadership training all
kinds of stuff that's kind of related
more to your development through your
career as well as to your specific kind
of functional skills so then I'm soon to
jump in with like 30 seconds on top of
what you said you know folks at Google
have access to a very kind of rich set
of courses that we offer here we have
only university if you will right so
people take training through that and to
your point also about about self
training or self project-based training
you know a lot of people know about 20%
time right and it's still you know it's
alive and well
I have people don't realize that that's
it's a very important aspect Avenue to
to sort of grow yourself and for example
in our team we've got someone who's
working on on a project that leverages
Google TV Android a whole bunch of
things and this is a 20% of her so it's
sort of outside of his main course work
but it's actually going to back to
feedback a project we have in core bench
so as a kind of doing both an
interesting project that's a side
project he's learning new technologies
that he didn't know before and and
that's all you know in the context of a
project which hopefully will have some
sort of Barisan fruit is simply so
there's a lot of kind of interesting
opportunity so you were actually doing a
graduate degree that's right so yeah
Google's been very supportive of that as
well so I started taking a remote master
degree in software engineering
management which has been great you know
so I can let you can get the more
institutionalized learning you know like
through through universities and get
that reimbursed or no kind of along the
line to look near to saying it's really
fun you can just play around the
technologies which I found at other
places was very difficult you you know
at other places sometimes you have to
request a specific server Pacific
technology so that you can write you
know in here it's like everything's
available if I want to go drum up some
Python code because I want to learn
Python I can find a place to do it
without going through all those hoops
it's really it's a nice combination of
both that you know there's so many
resources available videos classes etc
online you know at Google and then in
addition you can get yeah constitutions
yeah I mean the commitment is really
deep I have two teams that work together
ones in New York and ones at Zurich and
we really thought that awesome training
those teams together in the next step so
we arranged for them to meet in Istanbul
actually and have a week of training and
development done customized for them by
the educational development people like
Google and it was fantastic and kind of
achieved all these results that we
really wanted I think that uh it was you
know really really well worth it I think
that kind of talks about some of the
opportunities for training in the way it
works here at Google as well that was
really impressive so we're out of time
we're over time there's so much more we
could talk about I hope that you've
gotten to people watching I've gotten
something useful out of this and that we
can see you again maybe talk more about
corporate engineering some other time on
the life of Google page so thanks thanks
for watching thanks everyone thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
