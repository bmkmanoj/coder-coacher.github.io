on the air for this time for the life at
Google site we're really excited I've
just launched I'm a lead recruiter with
Google here on the East Coast
hanging out with two of my friends from
Boulder I'm Mike and John and before we
get going too far I just wanted to you
know represent the the boulder the
boulder office
all right fine represent and you just
did it's gonna be my new thing I want a
t-shirt for every office not that I'm
greedy
but if you guys want to go real quick
just introduce yourself Mike we'll start
with you because you're more smug and it
was a smug boy now I'm confused
all right we'll start talking about why
you guys love Google sounds good sounds
good well hello everyone I'm Mike
procopio I'm a software engineer here
working on Google Docs here in the
boulder office let's see I'm from the
East Coast originally and have gradually
found my way out to the west coast and
landed here in the mountainous town of
Boulder Colorado where I loved it and
thriving here at Google and excited to
chat about our experiences here awesome
John I hadn't prepared his detailed
biography as dr. microscopy has but yeah
I work on on stuff inside Google Docs
we're actually working on a super-secret
project that well no you better not get
it and talk any kind of details because
we don't want to get these things turned
off you're right yes so super secret
awesome project live in Denver working
Boulder uh it's fun awesome cool and how
long have you guys known Google see how
I'm just complete I'm four years now
four years yeah four years Wow how many
how much vacation are they giving you
get like eight weeks or maybe fifteen
weeks of vacations
I don't know cuz I don't take it and and
I'm just coming up on two years in March
years all right cool I just I'm six just
four whoo the old man in the room all
right all manner
awesome and so you know our chat is
really pretty pretty laid-back today
so we really want to just sort of get to
the nuts and bolts of what you guys love
about Google and so you know we've got a
lot of questions people submitted but I
figured we would just start off with a
little bit more freeform like you know
tell me you're it's actually a question
so I guess it's not that freeform I'm
totally cheating I'm you know totally
stealing it from CN doctor in New Jersey
but you know like what is your you know
like if you had one sort of Google
moment like this aha moment you know
what would it be hmm
what's your Google moment I I actually
had a funny one just pop up pop up
literally yesterday and if you if you
had asked me this yesterday or two days
ago I would have had a different answer
yeah the short story is I when we when
we come on board here at Google we have
a kind of a noogler project right a
noogler is a new Googler and this is
kind of a rite of passage right you're
trying to thrive in this environment and
there's a lot to read and a lot to ramp
up on the pace is past and so so I had
this kind of three or four month noogler
project and it went pretty well you know
a few hiccups but it did launch and it's
out there today in Google Docs it's the
one of the features there so just
yesterday what's that that the bold
button
yeah well it's it's really a menu item
it's the ellipsis the three dots and a
menu item was quite a good feature
yeah the this particular one anyway I'm
working on something new and it can't
kind of came full circle because some of
the new functionality that were that
we've been working on just kind of got
working kind of an end-to-end way showed
up and was able to be manipulated
through that that earlier feature that I
wrote literally two years ago too so
just yesterday I kind of had that aha
moment where it all kind of came
together and tied in the work I've been
doing for the past couple years so
technically that was that kind of was a
whack on the side of the head in a very
good way cool huh
let's see well we have a lot of good
social moments around here and a time
that I really appreciated is we had we
had an excellent intern last summer I'm
pretty sure he's listening actually so
hey Jon :
and uh and you know at the end of his
tenure
done some excellent work and Mike and I
wrote a little song to to give him a
farewell and when we performed it the
entire almost the entire office turned
out we had a really big audience
cheering on this intern who uh you know
moved on from best internship in the
world to his boring life as a college
student so Betty's regretting that right
now but you know he'll uh he'll start
soon and it'll write will be great but
anyway the point is people people turn
out in force for for those fun moments
around here so that's what I like no
that's great I am God I think back like
my first week at Google you guys will
appreciate this and I got an email from
a really famous Googler that I'll just
leave rameneh us and it was a referral
for it's like hey Jeff I hear you the
new recruiter in Boston and I know this
guy he's really great you should call
him please use my name and I remember
like looking at the email think of
myself this is got to be the coolest
recruiting job ever I'm gonna like hey
you wanted you want to come work with
so-and-so sure you do great awesome
hardcore recruiting there not so much
but I was like this is totally Google
this is awesome well the funny moment if
I may call out as one moment today in a
earlier phase of the super-secret
project that we're working on we opened
it up to internal people to test and we
got a an email with a sort of long
litany of improvements that that
somebody wanted and it turned out to be
from someone that I won't name but who
wrote a textbook that every single
person of my age had in college like you
had a to that absolutely yes yes this
person is pretty much famous for a week
we all knew them very well in in college
yeah and he's adorable in real life
despite his crotchety email skills cool
so oh my god super funny when you
interviewed me though what'd you say
that that was a defining turning point
in your career at Google clearly just
move on to the next okay
all right we'll talk more about yeah I
know we could talk about my moment of
meeting you guys but okay so while we
take some questions we have a whole
bunch of questions this one I think you
guys will just say working with each
other but it's um what's your favorite
thing about working in the boulder
office like what's the what makes
boulder so great besides you know all
the cool people oh well the boulder the
city I mean not because Boulder is a
Google office like any other so you know
all of the all of the smaller offices do
work that is you know as important and
as kind of autonomous as any project you
get in another office know that Boulder
is a beautiful town you know the you
there's a very like there are there are
places where you can have a very urban
vibe but then you can be hiking from
miles and miles right after a ten minute
drive and I don't know yeah I mean I
would definitely add a be John John's
kind of giving you some bolder flavor
but also the boulder office has folks
coming from all over Colorado so but
that's one of the neat things right is
that more and more location can be
defining right folks who want to be
where they want to be maybe they have
family maybe they have a hobby or a
passion or they're drawn to the creative
energy of a place and I mean that was
the case for for me right I mean a
boulder was one of the places that I
want to be and Google was where I wanted
to be and so of course here the it was
just a perfect marriage but what what
ends up happening is is that these
offices become like a reflection of the
the greater place because the people who
work here are also here because of that
place so here in the boulder office we
it's a really cool vibe right I mean
there's there's plenty of folks who are
really into kind of this and you know
fit kind of outdoorsy kinds of things
going on I mean there's a rock climbing
wall and and you know some folks are
into that there's a running club but a
biking club and contests it's during the
summer skiing and the these sorts of
things so that kind of the people here
in this office or a reflection of this
kind of place that we live in and that's
that gives it a really cool vibe that is
really cool very cool I need to get out
there it's on my list
yeah you should come on I know I told I
should we'll go
skiing mountain biking skating all risky
apres ski all day alright we have a
question is that what that was yes I was
just smiling so we have a we have a
question that just came in from Jason
who's at Brown University
what up East Coast it's actually a great
question it it's you know when you get
into the office on a Monday what's what
is it that you look you know forward to
most like for the week
so like the code review on Tuesday is it
lunch on Thursday what do you guys look
forward to most certainly well the
depends on what's for lunch
you know there's filet mignon or
something like that well that's
obviously the highlight a highlight of
the week no well for me when I get in on
Monday I usually feel like there's
almost always a really interesting task
that I am desperate to get to so when I
get in on Monday I'm often like I just
can't get through all these emails and
ignore all these people and then I can
finally get to the really awesome coding
tasks that I want to work on and I think
most Googlers feel that way that there's
like there's there's often things that
you have to do like fix bugs and you
know respond to stuff but you're really
waiting for that awesome project that
you want to be working on mm-hmm
yeah that that week you typically have
that that one thing that you you want to
do or you know maybe it's a feature or
something like that it's going to going
to have impact but you know on the other
hand when when Monday shows up you know
you want to do that but there's also
this kind of notion that your week is
not planned right beyond this idea that
this is the kind of engineering work we
want to do this week and there's all
these other things one of the exciting
things about Google is that it's very
fast-paced and on any given Monday I
don't know what the week is going to
look like right I mean maybe there's
there's meetings and I knew we were
going to be doing this hangout and that
was awesome and I knew there are a
couple technical things but everything
else is fill in the blanks and but you
better believe those kinds of interrupts
and emergencies and unexpected technical
challenges will will present themselves
and so that's part of
in town on Monday is you have an idea
but you don't really know how the whole
week is to unfold you just have to be be
on your toes quite literally ready to
adapt to the change right got it yep
cool so you guys are gonna laugh we are
actually what halfway down our hangout
if you can believe it
let's go super fast it's amazing I'm
always in shock um so just to sort of
reiterate to people that are joining
late this is Jeff Moore hanging out live
with John and Mike and Boulder talking
about why why they and I guess why all
of us left Google and we just keep
getting more more questions so we're
gonna fire up another one we've got
another one which is from from New
Jersey it's actually kind of a cool
question to actually answers for you
guys I'd be good on this we're going to
preface it a lot yeah I am going to
totally why did you choose Google and
you know why do you think Google chose
you besides your awesomeness hmm well
I'm it I really did interview Mike so I
know hey Mike you should leave the room
for a minute okay yeah Mike was hired
under the strict nobody who looks better
than me policy so we were able to get
just under the bar I don't know I know
that the reason the reason why I rated
Mike so high when I interviewed him was
that I asked a question where Mike
actually we always ask coding questions
and I try to always ask a question that
actually is something that came up in
work so that you know it's fair it like
really represents the kind of thing
you'll have to do and even though in the
short you know interview time that we
had Mike didn't actually code up a
solution he came up with a really
enthusiastic and well-thought-out
analysis of the problem that like he
made some observations no one had ever
made about the problem before and he was
so excited about like thinking it
through that that that really tipped the
balance from he also did write excellent
code in an earlier section of the
question but we had established that he
wasn't just pretending
yeah the the energy that I felt in that
interview was one of the one of the main
things that why I chose Google right I
mean I I had this this hypothesis that
Google was the place for me but it was
after I interviewed and in particularly
this interview with John that I realized
that this is what a collaborationist
like it didn't feel like an interview we
actually had some some joint insights on
this on this otherwise tricky problem
that was very satisfying and and so this
this kind of leads me to the final thing
that I'll leave with the question here
is that we need we need to belong this
is getting a little philosophical but
you know we need to find a place where
we belong where we fit in you know
especially in the context of our job and
if you know if you're a computer person
and you do software and you think about
things like users and building things
and having a constructive impact Google
is Mecca right I mean there's there are
rough days there's there's very
difficult challenges sometimes things
break sometimes people are impacted but
but for me this is this is home and I
can't imagine being anywhere else and
it's mostly because of the people and
the technical problems in the
collaboration that we have on a daily
basis you know for example between
between John and one and if you I mean I
I chose Google because I'd heard a rumor
that it was a place where the very best
people were and I was excited about that
idea and in my former job I worked with
people that were absolutely brilliant
and then there are a couple people are
not so brilliant and here there is
nobody like that I I never meet someone
who does not have chops you got chops
Jeff well everybody brings their chops
in different ways exactly your glasses
picking skills are second to none
socially I model my nap ears actually
you know that no laser beams my calling
I know I know where I'm at in life I'm
teasing anyway all right we have more
questions you guys still doing all right
over there yeah let's keep them coming
yeah I'm not like I'm not gonna preface
this one at all I'm just gonna fire it
at you that was a breakfast yeah it's
true so this is from Sweden actually
we're getting international if you can
believe it this is from prototype H in
Sweden how important a coffee breaks at
Google
how important are coffee breaks which I
think we can extrapolate to mean how
important is coffee and I think it we
would say that if you say I don't know
let's do but it's it's critical and it's
a part of my morning routine and my
afternoon routine and well basically one
of my friends actually said this to me
verbatim he gets so excited about his
morning cup of coffee the night before
sometimes he can't fall asleep thinking
about the morning coffee
and and I thought that that's that's I
don't know if that's that's a great
problem to have I think that's true you
should realize that that problem is not
typical and probably indicates some sort
of clinical condition for but if the
question if the question means yeah
that's that's pretty crazy yeah but if
the question is about coffee breaks
there may be a built in assumption that
there are structured breaks at all and
if that's the case there are not any mic
occasionally takes a coffee break before
work that lasts till like 11:00 a.m. I
mean this money here starts at like 3:30
or 4:00 sometimes well no yeah exactly
yeah I come in I come in and start my
coffee break at 3:30 yeah so different I
mean there's absolutely no structured
schedule for anything so you know as
long as you don't have an appointment
with somebody you kind of never have to
be there right right but with that
autonomy comes responsibility right so
it's both empowering but also you need
to need a push right you have it's very
clear if you're if you're doing the
things that you need to do but in return
from that you have a lot of a lot of
freedom to drink coffee or go rock
climbing in the indoor rock gym or you
know go for a soda or something like
that with somebody yeah well nobody
abuses it because I think the
personality of almost everyone we work
with are like people would feel so
internally a shame which they weren't
like yeah if they were doing their best
that they don't use their policy yeah
present company excluded
right yeah see I you know when I think
about coffee breaks I I like pretty much
I look up a coffee going all day so it's
not even like coffees a break coffee is
just the oxygen at this time
oxygen all right more questions
actually like this one is there any
standard read for nooglers
or is it project-based reading get
caught up on what the team is doing
that's from Barry Stewart I know very
less but that's repair anything for
nooglers oh well there pick up if you're
already hired or if you're trying to get
hired that day one already powder
oh well then yeah there there is an
extensive kind of internal self-paced
collection of classes you do to learn
about the technology so there's like
about there's two weeks of orientation
and then a lot of self-study to get up
to speed and most people kind of
intersperse the self-study with their
their smaller nuclear project yeah yeah
and there is a celebrated period right
where did your noogler you know roughly
it's the first six months so you kind of
have this focused orientation period and
then maybe a kind of a reading period
after that and then gradually you're
kind of you start to get project working
and it kind of mixes in but in that
first kind of six months you're you're
still absorbing and there is a lot to
absorb there's a lot to you know lots of
acronyms and lots of systems to learn
but but gradually things turn pretty
project focused fairly quickly right
because you want to kind of jump in and
dive in and make a contribution and then
it's through that project work that a
lot of the the reading is kind of mixed
in oh and we actually do a single
depending on what language you program
in you might get affected Java by Josh
block or I don't know what the one is if
you are a C++ guy yeah people a deal or
something like that sure I said
dismissively yeah well I mean come on
see I get grown-ups to do that garbage
collection
I don't trust John with C++ bottom line
I'll that's true yeah just this guy with
pointers well you know I gotta say I
I read the search by John Battelle I
think is how you pronounce his last name
who wrote like one of those first google
books and then I also read there
I also read competing on the edge by
Shona Brown who's one of our VPS it was
like sort of based on her Harvard PhD
thesis on my flight out I read that I
don't know well that's a different
conversation and those were actually
really helpful because they sort of gave
me a good vibe for what Google would be
like before I joined and they're
actually tended to be pretty accurate
descriptions but it's like so there's
non-technical folks looking yeah those
are pretty good cultural roots
especially the show know one that was
actually really helpful so yeah
cool all right so we've got five minutes
left and our hangout you guys can't
believe how fast these things go
no it's kind of surprising so we do have
more questions this is from I can't
pronounce it t3 Jam and Tucson this is
actually a great question why would you
guys choose the boulder office over any
other office
I mean why why Boulder besides all the
cool stuff in Boulder like just well I
mean if you want to well there's a
couple of reasons for me I really like
the projects I'm on the and you know
crank it doesn't matter where you work
because you need to be based in an
office that has a project the project
that you're working on but for us that
are in that we're we're in a environment
that's spread across a couple of offices
we work with teams in other offices all
the time we have basically carte blanche
to go to Sydney or New York whenever we
feel like it and so that's a great
advantage and and the smaller offices if
you like the town you're in you can
almost certainly enjoy a higher standard
of living
because housing is cheaper so if you
want a straight-up practical
consideration like I get to live in a
house in Denver that the equivalent
house in Mountain View would be like 10
million dollars and I didn't pay
anything close to that
yeah so you know the the smaller offices
right it's definitely they have a
different vibe Google not all Google
offices have the same by right each one
kind of absorbs the culture of the meat
and then the kind of passions of the
people that that that are at that office
so
for me it was partially Boulder but the
vibe here at this office is really neat
and then the project worked right
sometimes you just just get lucky you
know I like working on applications
right that actually have a kind of more
towards the kind of user interface parts
of things and Google has a here in
Boulder has a number of projects like
that including for example Google Docs
and the documents list it's a good fit
with regard to projects - yeah I think
those things are all important right I
mean I I'm sort of a big proponent of
you work with this much is what you do
and sort of where you do it and so if
you've got a great team around you
doesn't matter if it's in Mountain View
or Cambridge or Boulder it's people make
life a lot better and if you're if
you're a person who's thinking of
working at Google and you don't you're
not sure if you'd enjoy being in a
particular office you should ask
somebody that you're talking to inside
Google if you can have lunch because
they do that a lot around here and it's
fun for all of us yeah absolutely
absolutely heard it from the man's mouth
himself come fly out to Google Boulder
we'll treat you to lunch
yeah right what John yes yeah Michael's
been are you writing code and actually
dude welcome America all right so we are
almost out of time if you guys can't
believe it we're gonna do one last
question and then I'm gonna ask you guys
one last question okay
which I haven't thought up it so I'm
going to be thinking while you're
answering this question this is from
Todd and Cazenovia New York because ever
been to Cazenovia I have been to
casanova New York just want to drop that
for Todd beautiful upstate here
yeah everywhere you go my kazanova that
state I'm gonna I'm gonna cut his
question short because I think the last
part is the part you guys will like is
does Google encourage risk-taking in all
aspects of the company we all hope for
that that having you guys on here with
me it just means all different question
we're working we're working on something
that I feel like is so incredibly risky
from like a technical success point of
view that I can't imagine it being
greenlit in any other environment and
the thing is it's gonna work that's that
that's what awesome it's awesome about
it so far we we took big risks it looks
like this particular project is
go right we're going to pull it off the
Google in general will favor kind of
riskier things right we try and not be
too risk-averse because that will tend
to stagnate right and so we want to not
analyze sorts of the the downside that
occasionally happens when you take risks
and I think I heard heard this Pope I
think is Randy Randy Pausch II said you
know the the the risk of failure is the
the price of success right so that's
kind of built in to to our culture and
to ensure that we don't stagnate we
definitely kind of look at something
that feels a little risky and sometimes
it's just the right thing and sometimes
things are risky for engineering reasons
sometimes things are risky for product
reasons right are we shipping the right
thing is this what are going to make
people happy will this have an impact in
the case of our project it's just risky
all around like that but I mean one
thing about that is that you can't just
say I'm gonna do something incredibly
risky and then have you know a vice
president say well you know here's a
hundred people go ahead what what
typically happens is you've got a crazy
idea you talk your peers into helping
you prototype it and then when you've
got enough momentum it kind of gets
official approval so like there's a
built-in peer review process just
because it's kind of up to you to put
your teams together in many environments
here I think John that's a really great
point because it's it's everywhere -
right it's engineering it's in
recruiting it's sort of all across the
organization where we sort of like put
together these virtual rogue teams to
sort of experiment and stuff and hey
this is going to work yeah and my work
let's pitch this thing up the ladder and
then see how it goes you know or not and
I think that's a really great point
actually it's one of the my favorite
things about Google is actually a bad
exact piece Holly that's a great great
question a good good thing to kind of
chew on Andy's from Cazenovia New York
which is pretty awesome right okay so
last question from me okay describe
Google why you love Google Mike in one
word one word
this is one word if you don't count the
space and if you consider the space to
be the ASCII character for a letter so
it's technically one word people make it
three words people technical challenge
okay that's what that's one word if you
don't have there - and start school join
you can do the same thing as many dashes
as you need you just say my name that
that's kind of right oh my god you made
by making it one word it's taking so
long
um okay these imagine the hyphens
appropriately sure tub at retreat yeah I
don't know if I want the story here I
think we're just gonna say cool
coworkers
yeah yeah all right okay I was a party
in honor Jeff that's great I'll bring
the opening the ropes hot tub party in
his honor but he's not invited okay good
I could hang out it's cool I'll just
dial and do it
we'll have to be there it's gonna be
great my coffee dispenser next to the
hot tub that's my dream yeah let's do it
every week um I me up we can do it again
for sure so we're at the end
unfortunately like mute
no I'll kidding aside guys I really
appreciate you coming on it's um you
know a lot of fun to hear from folks
from around the company why I love
Google and you know really appreciate
you taking the time to hang out with us
today
and for everyone listening just to sort
of wrap up this is Jeff Moore doing a
hangout on the air for the at Google
students at the Google students site
excuse me oh my god it's not Google
students it's life at Google total is
gonna kill me
it's life at Google and we are all done
with John and Mike and hopefully we'll
get you guys back on and we can talk
about some more fun stuff hopefully your
project will go live eventually we can
talk about that yeah yeah that'd be
great
