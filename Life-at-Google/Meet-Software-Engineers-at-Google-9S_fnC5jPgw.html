engineering director at Google
my name is vlog have legee city my role
as a technical lead and a manager in the
software engineering my name is Jacques
Nick Nandi I am a distinguished engineer
over the years I have fooled enough
people to think I'm somewhat
distinguishable
my name is Homer Garduno I work in
software engineering cloud machine
learning in my current role we write
software to make machine learning
accessible to people everywhere being a
software engineer a good part of it is
writing software another good part of it
is finding out the right solution for a
problem and of course writing code it's
a computer engineers dream to build
systems that work for billions of users
I feel energetic every day coming to
work because this exciting stuff going
on all the time there's a series of
tools that Google has built that
streamline this whole process of
software development writing code for
getting your code reviewed by your
fellow software engineers and then once
you finish writing code you have to
deploy your code into production our
main challenges are in creating great
user experiences not just software that
works but experiences that work for
users it's an honor and a privilege to
work with a team that is really high
functioning you get to work with people
who make work fun so people are always
joking people are playing fun pranks on
each other one of the things that I did
quite some time ago was put a whole
bunch of flamingos on the dinosaur
sculpture so I'm always particularly
proud whenever I see the pictures show
up on the Internet of the dinosaur
sculpture covered in pink flamingos
we're always innovating in new areas
we're always kind of asking ourselves
the question of what's the most
important thing what's the most
interesting thing that you could do next
how do we make a story that's even
better than the one that we have today
you get to build these things that are
exciting you can see the end results of
what you build right away it's just
magic and there's no limit to the size
of problems that we can tackle the limit
is really just our imagination and our
ability to execute on it that's a
software engineer for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
