accomplish something is what actually
drives projects forward people are more
important than technology
I'm more so slate and I'm the SVP for
technical infrastructure I worked at
Google since 1999 in a way I've been
doing the same thing for the last you
know 19 years namely infrastructure you
know that was my first thing but what
surprised me is actually how much that
question has changed and I don't feel I
have the same job even for two years in
a row because it very much changes over
time because you get to apply your
technical skills to two new problems and
and problems that are surprising cloud
for example is really materially
different from what we used to do and
that keeps it interesting and sometimes
frustrating of course but rewarding more
often than frustrating
infrastructure it's not just about the
technology it's actually about creating
an outcome that matters for customers or
for end-users or for someone internal on
pretty much any area of infrastructure
our network is something like a quarter
to 30% of Internet traffic that's
delivered to user comes from Google so
clearly with our network we have to do
things that weren't done before because
there isn't an existing one that that
works for that problem to some extent
the craziest idea it was really the
original index all the world's
information and make it universally
accessible and useful then it is kind of
crazy and still is except that today the
expectations of the user are much higher
literally when we launched people were
super happy that you could type in
Stanford or IBM or coca-cola and
actually get Stanford or IBM at
coca-cola because that was actually new
at the time the product leads a user to
expect more and more and it's very
challenging to keep up with that but
often when you fail you still solved a
very important problem halfway so it's
much harder to fail completely if you
are ambitious versus when you're not
ambitious you're trying to do something
in trample and any fail do you really
fail like you did nothing and that is
much worse it's an interesting job but
in at the same time we're really trying
hard to make it a fun job
to make it a job where you actually like
to hang out because people are your
friends and not just your co-workers in
that keeps lots of people here including
myself transfers are very easy inside of
Google Google isn't really one company
you can go from a very business facing
thing like advertising to something like
Gmail that's very user focused and that
way you can kind of change your career
without changing the company you can go
to a different team or to a different
challenge in a very very low overhead
way and that's why we're actually
spending a lot of time trying to really
make people feel empowered and and free
to take risks and and you know respect
risks but not Fiona if you're passionate
about infrastructure this really is an
awesome place because we have some of
the best interest
everywhere and we really work and we
have to work on the problems that are
leading edge I mean ten years in the
past basically almost nothing that you
care about today existed and so ten
years from now I think the things that
we're going to be most excited about are
things that we're not really thinking
about and yes you know I hope we have a
big hand that at inventing that so to
speak but I have no idea what it will be
I have absolutely no idea that's why you
should apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
