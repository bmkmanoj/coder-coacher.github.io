over a billion users and dozens of
products that serve over a million users
and front-end traffic that serves
millions of queries per second Google
scale is likely no surprise but have you
ever wondered what it takes to construct
Google's computing infrastructure at
that scale it starts with forecasts of
how much compute storage and network
capacity is needed by product teams
across Google the forecast drive plans
for how much supporting infrastructure
to deploy that plan initially tells us
when defined power build data centers
design and deploy networks and establish
edge Network presence throughout the
world later on a product team decides
exactly when they need additional
compute network and storage resources
that triggers an order for Hardware
here's how that works
our suppliers ship the parts needed to
contract manufacturers who assemble them
and store them in a regional warehouse
for future use much of our hardware is
custom built to our own design such as
tensor processing units we decide when
to acquire inventory to make sure we
achieve cost optimal availability and
ensure that hundreds of components from
dozens of suppliers around the world
come together when they are needed
trucks planes trains and pack mules take
these parts to a local spoke warehouse
close to our data center once they get
there local staff perform the install
connect the power and cooling and then
the new gear is tested automatically
before it's turned over to our product
teams in the unified fulfillment
optimization team or UFO we are
automating this entire process we're
aiming to minimize Google's costs and
since we spent 30 billion dollars on
capital over the last three years that's
a big deal and help ensure that Google
can continue to scale we help deliver
hundreds of thousands of computers a
year and network capacity that lets us
contribute 25 to 40% of the global
Internet user traffic all in support of
serving billions of queries a day from
our users we are software and hardware
engineers operations and machine
learning researchers analysts and
product and program managers come join
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
