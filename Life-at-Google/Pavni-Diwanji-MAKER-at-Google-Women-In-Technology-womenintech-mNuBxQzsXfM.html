creating something and once these
creative juices are flowing then I can
drink them everywhere I go I grew up in
a city in western India called and the
bath my mom worked as a bank manager at
the time you don't think about these
things right it's only afterwards that
you're like grown-up and you're looking
around and you're like boy that was
unusual to have actually a working
mother my dad worked for IBM I think I
was in like seventh grade and he was
trying to get me excited about
programming for the first time in the
language called basic my dad's like well
you need you should learn so you can
enter this competition I'm like oh that
sounds good
really I have never looked back once I
got my hands dirty I was like this is
amazing
I remember this day very clearly like I
show up to the University and I'm
looking around and in my whole class I'm
the only woman then I'm like ah I guess
I'm gonna have to get used to this
because it's a four-year degree if girls
are showing inclination towards science
is we have to support them and we have
to encourage them you have two daughters
and I think my older one is right now
into computer games so I'm taking that
as a win my dad mortgaged his office
$10,000 and I knew that could last me
one quarter so my mission when I came to
Stanford it was to find a way to fund my
education I made a big list of all the
professor's went to them and I said
here's what I can do can you take a
chance on me some of them shouted at me
one of them like really kicked me out of
the office I cried for a bit and then
the next day morning I went to the next
person on the list so I think my don't
give up gene really helped me
I graduated in 92 the company I wanted
to work for was Sun Microsystems because
it was where a lot of hot engineers
where
at the time C++ was the big language of
choice but it was fairly complex and a
lot of programmers didn't really like it
this little team of eight people deep in
Sun were designing a new programming
language called oak and oak became Java
and then Java launched and it became a
huge overnight success it was
tremendously exciting I mean we would
come to work every day and there was a
huge fan base and we had no idea you
know when we put it out we had no idea
how much of a success this was going to
become and then James Gosling had this
idea that this programming language can
be really really useful even on the
server side and no one was looking at
that area at all and so I said I'll step
up an arc
I'll look at it and then and then
servlets were born I think you can
hardly go to a website today that
doesn't deploy the technology
I think spam is awful it clutters up
everyone's life what makes it very hard
is also what intrigues me about the
problem it's almost like you're playing
chess with someone there's a human being
on the other side and there's us on this
side trying to figure out how to take
him out I'm thinking about the problem
every day like this got to be a better
answer there's got to be a better answer
and that's what led to the creation of
my second company male friend here
the idea is can we take Gmail and bring
it to schools and universities and
companies and I found this incredibly
exciting I picked it up as my 20%
project 20% projects at Google are like
for 20% of your time you are allowed to
do whatever you want right
Gmail was created this this way Google
Maps was created this way fast forward
four years and what we achieved was
Google Apps for Business most major
universities in the world today use that
my kids school use that
I would say is the most fast best
project at Google I am driving the
profiles and pages effort and we've just
gotten started I mean we have so many
cool things coming down the pipe life
success to name for Google+ pages means
every business every band every artist
will have a page to the Plus page we
will all be using Google+ I would
declare victory if I have changed the
world if I have created something that a
lot of people use that I made a
difference in their lives and Google
makes it really easy to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
