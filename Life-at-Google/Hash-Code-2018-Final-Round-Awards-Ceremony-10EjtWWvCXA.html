day I hope you all had fun I hope you
enjoyed the problem the competition
definitely appears to be very fierce and
exciting competition you could tell that
by the fact that pretty much nothing was
happening in pick up in cafeteria like
everybody was very focused at work the
first time we we ran the final round of
hashcode when we brought in food it was
a big thing everybody jumped to the food
so either the food here is less
interesting that the one we had in Paris
or that event has become a little bit
more competitive and I really like the
pasta so I don't think is the problem
with the food yeah even when I announce
that there's like food till 2 p.m.
like nobody got up to run for the food
so yeah we thought you didn't notice so
we made the announcement but we were
worse recording maybe some people didn't
eat all right wrapping up the
introduction speaking of food this is
the last think we are going to do before
pizza so if you are hungry don't worry
in this final section we would like to
go over the problem very quickly sure a
little bit of trivia from the night with
you announce the winners and wrap up the
fifth edition of our code so without
further ado we are going to very quickly
cover the problem itself because we are
live-streaming this closing ceremony and
people on the livestream are not yet
familiar of the problem so the
computation problem was about planning
big construction projects in a district
of the city the input of the problem was
a list of different building products
and there were two different types there
were residential buildings like this
described by either shape and by the
number of people or families that could
live there so here we have two different
projects residential buildings with
different capacities the other type of
products that was possible to be
constructed were utility products those
didn't have any people living there but
they
had pipes so here's type 1 maybe it's a
shop and here is type 2 maybe it's a
park nice Green Park so now the task for
for the contestants for you was to put
those building products on the map
constructing new district in the city
and the points were of our awarded for a
single person having an access within
the walking distance to a single utility
so here we have sixty people living in
the area if we put a park in between of
those buildings you could see that all
sixty people have access to the park it
is within the walking distance so the
this submission would get sixty points
for this arrangement if we had a shop on
top we can see that forty people have
access to it giving a total of 100
points that's the problem the final
thing I want to say about the problem is
that we thought that even for a hashcode
problem is going to be a fairly hard
problem because we when we were thinking
about this we were pretty much know we
had pretty much no intuitions as to what
would be the right solutions like do you
put the residential buildings first and
then throw utilities around or do you
start with utilities do you alternate or
maybe the difficult part of the problem
is actually not that but fitting two
concave shapes together so that they
don't take much space we didn't know
we'll learn a little bit about what was
hard on all those easy from the winners
of hash codes as we are going to quiz
down on stage but that will follow in a
couple of minutes and now let's move on
to the trivia from dating yes we
collected some interesting facts now
about the competition so we're not gonna
announce any winners right now it's just
like what happened throughout the
competition let's get started and the
first thing that happened is that I had
a bet with max how long it's going to
take for the first valid submission to
be submitted in the judge system and I
was saying he's going to take less than
60 seconds and max was saying that he's
going to 61 seconds or more I lost the
bet by three seconds
and congratulations to heighten
Heisenberg's certainty principle team it
would be slow it was having slightly
better if you were just a tiny little
bit faster but it was still a good
achievement so congratulations and it is
notable that this was actually a better
submission that the one we had in the
example example output in the in the
problem statement many beautiful
inventions in the history of the world
happened by by accident you improved the
solution so that's like genetic
algorithms right alright then we come to
the first submission which was actually
powered by code so I did some maths and
I realized that that team spent about
1,000 points improve about 1,000 points
per second just like calculating the
first so this is a programing athlete
from Russia they scored almost two
million points in 24 minutes
those of you who have been with us last
year might remember that we wanted to
award or to recognize teams who were
able to submit solutions without ever
submitting an invalid solution but last
year there were no such things
this year we have four teams that
competed and never submitted an invalid
solutions so those are no future Danny
bye-bye Titian's love you Kim oh Sh
congratulations yeah this brings us to
like a very typical subject about
programming competitions right so of
course we had to compute some statistics
about programming languages so the first
one I don't fully know but like people
seem to like objects I suppose because
the first one is c-sharp
so maybe somebody convinced the rest of
the team that like it's not going to be
c plus s blood C sharp right can happen
on the second place that might have been
me because I actually like Python myself
they score second then what is really
really surprising to me I would actually
like to know in what kind of engine that
thing it was running to actually compete
at that because on the first spot
there's JavaScript so very impressive to
me like somebody some one team managed
to like solve the problem or attempt the
problem in JavaScript
getting actually quite some points very
impressive right you might guess it so
on the second place that's Java and
finally the majority like almost every
team actually used C++
now for the datasets part every year we
put the competition together we try to
find a few data sets that are very
different so our ideal situation is if
each of data sets if each of the data
sets actually requires a different
approach a different solution and what
we are going to show you is we are going
to display the best team that did the
best on each individual data set and as
you will see it's not like one team was
the best on all of them so tractor
specialists one on the example problem
and also worth noting is that a lot of
teams scored 75 a lot of teams scored
100 actually we didn't know that it's
possible to have the 25 the first time
we saw that I was afraid that we have a
back in this car apparently it's
actually possible now for the team that
won on the problem B we have an idea for
how to pronounce the name but we are not
going to reveal it yet
from a number C was one but an eye on
team
they Cassidy was PT Bank data city was
programming athletes from Russia and
they doesn't F was Warsaw robbers
I think I think that really shows that
there's not just one solution which
solves everything so every team had
different implementations and the
implementation is super well one the
problem but not on the other and I think
that's really really good
and if we were to do sort of if you were
to compile like all-stars team with all
of you competing together the total
score of such a submission was actually
many millions points better than the the
score of the thing that one has got this
year so if he would have 41 million you
would have easily won competition just
for your information next year all right
this is a screenshot of the frozen
scoreboard as of one hour before we
finished
you might just know it right not all
teams remain there just saying so we're
all excited to see what the results were
all right that's it for trivia and with
that we are going to announce the top
ten teams of hardcore 2018 so the way we
are going to go about this is for the
next seven teams we are going to
announce those teams one after another
and what we ask those teams is that when
you hear your name please stand up smile
wave to everybody so that we can
congratulate you and that's it now all
right
position number 10 it's getting exciting
who might it be actually this team was
not on the slide just before so this
team is not on the frozen scoreboard so
we want to congratulate the team moving
from position number 12 to position
number 10 please congratulate were
solely on
congratulations
position number nine according to our
records that was the first team to
submit solutions for all data sets
although one of those data sets got a
score of zero at that time finishing up
on the position number nine team and CA
please get up progress we move on to
position number eight
this was the first team to score above
like a magical mark which seemed to have
to be 30 million so the team is lean
Congrats on position number seven that
was the team that submitted apparently a
first actual solution at 11:45 all nine
seconds submitting a code of 193 lines
of code and scoring 100 points on
example one and their name is M IP t
amethyst contents all right
which Springs on us number six they did
something great they submitted after 33
minutes a solution which was able to get
points on every data set yes so compared
to the previous thing we said they did
not get that zero on one of the data
sets 33 minutes in into the competition
which brought him one spot up all right
he number six was our Robards now the
team that finished up the position
number five was the team to send the
first submission that got more than 200
points at 11:45 45 seconds those are
also the winners for the data set B
short walk and their name is programming
athlete from Russia all right
all right we get to the fourth place I
have to announce very sad news about the
fourth place it's a very successful team
and unfortunately they only scored four
it's the winners from last year hey I am
tech Congrats anyway thanks guys for
always scoring high you really rise the
level of Taylor competition alright
we're getting to the top three we are
going to have to change the methodology
a little bit yes so actually there's a
nice staircase over there right and
please use the store case to get up on
the stage and if you see your team name
over here you will get a medal and on
your way back from the stage we will be
able to collect prizes also there's a
cup but that's just for the first price
right alright so it was very interesting
to watch the unfrozen scoreboard in
real-time between 4 and 4:20 p.m. today
because there were three things that
kept alternating their position on the
first spot so the scoreboard was
changing very rapidly and those three
teams are the things that ended up
winning so in particular the team that
ended up on the third position more than
once was actually leading the
competition in the in the final half an
hour dose this theme is the thing that's
win on that one on dataset see going
green and their name is and I am team
did you cook please Sunspear like
there's this line here like WB's up for
a picture-perfect congress of storing
perk in this year's edition awesome
Congrats
thank you sir them at all
you could please stay so before you go
we have two questions for you the first
question is what approach do you use to
solve the problem who is the spoke
person so we use just a greedy approach
of course it is very slow to try to
place any building in any possible
position so we split board in 7% solve
them independently almost independently
for the second question we notice that
you improved a lot between the score
board fries and the the final result so
you moved from position a to position
three could you tell us what was
happening in the last hour of the
competition were you feeling that you
are improving everyone you're not sure
actually we just submitted tests if we
have zero points before the end we have
about eight million points all right
thank you very much and I am team
position three bronze medal hospital
dozen 18
all right we're getting to the second
place we know that just three minutes
before the competition finished there
was exactly one poisoned points between
position one and two very very small
margin yeah they were in the end the
winners of the problem D wide selection
if you remember who that was you know
the answer I I remember who that was and
that was a team called pitty pang
Congrats
all right
very well done congratulations the
question for you is about teamwork
so we when we started house code we
really wanted this to be a team
programming competition and we wanted to
ask the team that ended up in position
number two how were you working in a
team how were you splitting and
organizing the work was difficult was it
easy did you have any strategies okay
it was difficult enough for us but we
participate in other competitions
together and not all four of us but me
and Alexei and me and Julia another
competition so we have some experience
but okay in first hours we get some
problems with teamwork and I think we
were not even in top 20 but after that
were somehow figured out how to how how
to solve this problem good enough
apparently yeah what do you think was
the hardest part about the problem maybe
it was easy for you you scored second I
don't know probably hardest part was to
come up with something that work and it
was hard to get any nonzero points but
when you get some solution you can
improve and it's easier thank you very
much the team pity Bank position number
2 silver model 2018
population you can collect your sign
right now right now
all right now the tension is getting
high who is going to take home this cup
or that cup we're talking about the
winners of hashcode 2018 exciting it is
exciting I have to say that there was
part of the jury meeting that was really
like not planned we had a very
interesting discussion that was not in
the program the discussion was about how
are we going to pronounce the name of
the team but in the end I think we got
it right yeah the winners of hashcode
2018 are a Motley's of four people
rats for this year right
so could you tell us what is the winning
solution I guess you have a different
approaches for different test sets we
had one the main idea is to not solve
the whole board of CTO and just to split
it into small districts solved the one
district and filled up with the one
district which are all the same so and
then we have different approaches to
solve construct this decree table for
different test cases
I guess half of the test cases were
solved more by hand when we and we want
this this case actually it was solved by
oh okay maybe nd so but yeah main idea
is just to split two districts and after
some greedy solutions also use the
solution that optimize that that make
some small changes and think is it
better or not if it's better we continue
from a new position very impressive but
we also have to ask the obvious question
that we correctly pronounce your team
name you're satisfied so it's a moti so
for people staring at a laptop or do you
have a different at the screen for sure
congratulations that's a motive for
people staring at the screen
prices on your way thank you all right I
think it was really really impressive
work by everyone thanks everyone for
traveling to Dublin I think you actually
had quite some fun at least we have
really really great photos of people
having fun at at the office if you don't
have enough okay yeah we're gonna please
look at this part of the slide here we
had to anonymize the contestants so
because of that like like we can't do
anything else like there's nothing else
please read this part of the slide which
essentially means if you want to further
improve your solution you want to play a
bit around we're going to reopen the
competition to May the 7th it will
actually also open for people from the
online qualification round so many more
people can compete now you've got a
sneak peak into life at Google if you
want to have more insights follow us at
life at Google it's available on all the
social media like YouTube Facebook and
Twitter if we really really interested
you can of course check out their
curious Google calm there's
opportunities right for full time or for
students and internships so actually I
have two of these hats because at some
point I was an intern and then thanks
God when I joined again they gave me a
second of these hats what's next for
hashcode so of course this year's
competition is over the finals are over
as was mentioned several times during
the panel we're going to open up the
competition of a bit wider so we're
gonna expand it for more
around the world it's going to be more
exciting I highly suspect that during
your next finals there will be teams
from Asia Australia or America let's see
if you're not done all the coding
competitions by Google are available on
this website called coding competitions
with google.com so you don't have to
search for code Jam once the next time
for hashcode and so on please check it
out from that I would like to say thanks
to all the volunteers most of the people
here do this as they're like 20% project
or just showing up to help us it would
be really impossible to run this entire
thing without them please applaud to all
the volunteers from the competition
this concludes today we have nothing
else to do but eating pizza enjoy thanks
a lot everyone
