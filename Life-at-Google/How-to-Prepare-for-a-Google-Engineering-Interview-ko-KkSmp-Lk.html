about how to prepare for a technical
interview I'm Shawn technology and
engineering recruiter I'm Allison I'm a
software engineer I'm Jess I'm also a
software engineer although this video is
going to focus on the technical
interview definitely check out our
partner video on how to prepare for the
business interview as well
it absolutely applies here but without
further ado let's give me some tips
first things first
make sure you're ready to prove what's
on your resume we're going to want some
critical pieces from you including the
bread-and-butter of software engineering
data structures well you could argue
with me on that data structures and
algorithms so we want things like hash
tables stacks arrays as well as
algorithms space and time complexity we
also want things like be prepared to
code on a whiteboard this is very
different from coding on a computer so
it's highly recommended to go out find a
whiteboard or a chalkboard and try
coding something up it's a little
different and finally we want to make
sure that you're brushed up on system
design as well as object-oriented
programming in general you want to show
your problem-solving skills to the
question you are asked if it's a coding
question providing efficient code a
short time frame is key if it's a design
question work with your interviewer to
create a high-level system and if
applicable delving into deeper issues if
it's a general analysis question so that
you understand all aspects of the
problem and if necessary offer multiple
solutions discussing their relative
merits in the end the interview wants to
know if they'd be comfortable working
with you on it
specifically you should focus your
preparation in the following areas
coding so you're going to spend the
majority of your time actually writing
code in interviews
we do ask that you are pretty familiar
with at least one coding language
typically we'll interview you in C++ or
Java you may use Python or C in
different projects here you will be
expected to know api's object-oriented
design and programming how to test your
code and be able to come up with corner
cases and edge cases for yours and other
people's another big thing is algorithms
I mentioned this in the beginning and
it's coming up again because surprise
it's important all right so you also
want to know how complex your algorithm
is remember it's time and space
complexity as well as how to improve or
change it if you give me an O of n
algorithm and then you give me an O of n
factorial or o n squared and you tell me
it's better this is going to be a little
awkward so another thing if you get a
chance to study up on other algorithms
like Dijkstra's or a star it'll probably
help you to something is incredibly
important candidates of three or more
years of industry experience should have
hands-on testing experience if you have
less than three years within the
industry we're just going to test you
for your testing aptitude you can expect
questions such as how would you unit
test the code would you write what
interesting inputs or test cases can you
think of and we may also ask you to
design end-to-end integration load and
performance or even security tests for
real-world systems such as Gmail for
example data structures so you should
study up on as many data structures and
algorithms is humanly possible you
should know some of the most famous
classes of np-complete problems like the
Traveling Salesman in the knapsack you
should definitely be able to recognize
some of these very famous questions when
asked in a slightly different way also
try and find out what np-complete
actually it means you should absolutely
know trees some basic tree construction
traversal and manipulation algorithms
hash tables stacks arrays link lists and
so on also math some of our interviewers
will ask basic discrete math problem
don't worry they will be very relevant
counting problems probability things
that happen in everyday life so before
you come in spend some time refreshing
your memory on these things or learning
the essentials of probability theory and
combinatorics you should be pretty
familiar with n choose K problems and
the like recursion menu coding problems
involve thinking recursively and maybe
coding a recursive solution
prepare for recursion which can
sometimes be tricky if not approach
properly practice some problems which
can be solved iteratively but a more
elegant solution is recursion operating
systems you should understand processes
threads as well as concurrency issues
and everything related to that such as
semaphores mutexes locks things like
that you should also understand resource
allocation so what resources a process
or thread might need another thing
context switching just brush up a little
bit on that understand that it's
initiated in the and the operating
system and underlying hardware and then
one last thing maybe you might want to
know a little bit about how scheduling
works system design payments have been
in the industry for more than five years
should have experience with systems
design these questions are used to see
your ability to combine knowledge theory
and judgment towards solving a
real-world problem
sample topics include feature sets
interfaces class hierarchies distributed
systems and designing a system under
certain constraints you should also have
an understanding of how the internet
actually works and be familiar with the
various pieces routers domain name
servers load balancers and firewalls
also understand the basics of how search
works
now that we've talked a little bit about
some of the knowledge areas that we
expected to know we want to offer you
three final tips to really be successful
in your interviews first explain and
clarify it's extremely important to talk
through your thought process during the
interview it is much better to say what
you're thinking when to stay silent even
if you're discarding ideas along the way
your interviewer wants to know your
thought process which ideas you're not
going to use and which ivi you finally
settle on clarifying the question is
also important that most of the
questions like Google are intentionally
vague because the interviewer wants to
know what questions you would ask if
you're in a real world solutions that
have a vague question an example of a
question you can ask for clarifying is
are there any time or space complexity
requirements secondly we want you to
keep thinking we know this is really
strenuous interviewing is really long
but the first solution that you come up
with might not be the most elegant so we
encourage you to keep thinking through
the problems think about your current
solution and how you could potentially
improve it finally practice make sure
that you practice physically writing
your code you won't have an editor no
color code for comments no autocorrect
be sure to test your code be sure that
it's easily readable without bugs find
problems write code solve them there's
no better way of practicing than
actually writing out code rules that's
it for today
