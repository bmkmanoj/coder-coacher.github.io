complex problems if you do it one way
these ten things will happen if you do
it another way these ten things will
happen explaining that to people getting
their feedback which ten things which
future do we want to live in this future
or this future it can be a very big
decision has turned my hair gray
when I was a kid my mom tells me that I
was very difficult actually that was
pretty intense and pretty active and
then my brother came along and when my
brother was like two or three she took
him to a psychiatrist because he was so
calm and there's a guy listener he's
like this kid is normal you know I think
I liked math all along
I remember Matt Goss went very slowly so
I wasn't learning that much but I would
do all the puzzles on the wall
I went to grad school in computer
science I like the variety I like the
discipline there were very big problems
in computer science and there are very
small problems you can pick whatever you
want there's not kind of the Stanford
PhD program was an amazing set of people
although there were many many more men
than women I was taking in a really good
class one of my favorite - the lower
bounds class I really liked it and we
had a homework assignment it was
interesting and I worked really hard on
it and I just had an insight that night
on a way that you could attack this
problem that was really unusual I turned
in the homework and then the next day
the professor asked me where I had
copied it from it was kind of
discouraging
when you do a startup it's very risky
and we knew that from the beginning but
I like risk actually tension was a high
performance highly reliable data
management system it has different kinds
of indexing and optimization to work
better and main memory in the NAM disk
they kept things running it didn't go
down that was a really big deal but I do
remember at one point when we found out
that time son was gonna be used in the
911 system and we all were like whoa you
know because we write code and it's fun
but when you really find out that it's
being used in a very serious application
you think wow is that code any good you
know but I got to bucola I started
literally wandering the halls at Google
trying to throw out what I could work on
and one day there was a talk on BigTable
and one of the main storage system is
used to Google and after listening to
this hour of conversation it was clear
to me that they needed a product manager
I thought well I can do this job with my
eyes closed unfortunately on BigTable
the two people in charge were basically
the most senior engineers and all of
googles Jeff and Sanjay they were like
what's a product man or what does it do
who are you again when in Sergey walked
into the room and I just I just wanted
to die so that was my start at Google's
a little bit rocky I persisted I can
visit with any of this role and I did
and I did it really well it was like the
Wild West back then Google was expanding
it to new areas you know for a long time
Google had been mainly searched and to
some degree ads and the storage systems
were obviously built around search in
particular Valon came Gmail Along Came
orchid we did some acquisitions like
blogger and Picasa they were more
transactional they needed new kinds of
functionalities so there is a big
tension in between what the applications
wanted and what the developer team was
building you have to figure out what's
gonna work for all of these and what's
gonna be a win for all of them
for a long time we didn't have women
interviewing other women and now we try
really hard when a woman is interviewing
here to have at least one women on our
interview slate I think that men tend to
be more confident in their abilities and
women less confident women tend to
understand a little bit I definitely do
that what we need to do is just be aware
of that tendency and listen for that
tendency and correct for that tendency
if we think it's happening I spent a lot
of my career at Google building systems
that will work across all of our
applications one example of that would
be what we call hangouts on air hangouts
is a great Google+ feature which is live
discussions and when you can record it
and create a YouTube video from it it's
called a hangout on air there are all
kinds of stuff we can do that offer more
services on these platforms but you
can't do that unless these systems are
uniform and powerful I think it's
something that there's founders here
occur a lot about being stronger
technically so that we can offer a more
unified simple experience to the users
and I think I've been a big part of that
my daughter tells me every now and then
that I should be President I think it
disturbs her that there's never been a
woman president my tolerance too late
for that
but I told she pick me president</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
