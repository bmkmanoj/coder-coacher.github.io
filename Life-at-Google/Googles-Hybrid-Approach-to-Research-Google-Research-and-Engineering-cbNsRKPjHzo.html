research at Google and I'm with slug
Petrov
a reasonably new Google employee and
research who got his PhD in 2009 from
Berkeley and has joined us and also with
Peter Norvig who has been at Google
since 2001 and a variety of interesting
roles including leading search quality
and also being a head of research we're
here to tell you about our forthcoming
paper that's going to appear in the July
issue of the communications of the ACM
it's entitled Google's hybrid approach
to research this article describes our
approach at Google which tends to blur
the boundaries between research and
development to give us a chance to
organize and whatever way makes sense to
get the most research done and to bring
that research to users in the form of
products with as much rapidity as we can
so the goal of research at Google really
is to serve our users to bring them
practical and significant benefits and
to do so in a rapid timeframe and that
usually means that researchers are
writing production level code right from
the start we have many people that are
very much of a theoretical and and try
to understand problems from a
theoretical perspective but at the end
we all strive to do something practical
and applied and so a lot of times we'll
take a large long term research project
and break it down into individual pieces
that can be understood and also solved
rapidly and when research has done its
job we're ready to launch something that
will help our users rather than just
ready to hand it off to somebody else
the technology transfer the ability to
get good research into our users hands
rapidly or into our colleagues hands
rapidly is really facilitated if we
think upfront how should we do the
project that will
maximize our ability to do that so
rather than doing something at an
isolated lab and then having to convince
a whole nother group to go work on that
approach maybe the right thing to do is
to work closely with engineers from day
one
or maybe launch the product ourselves in
the case of Translate we launched the
product or self in many other cases will
we to say applied machine learning to
other problems at Google we worked hand
in hand with engineering really blurring
the boundary between R and B you don't
want everybody on your team working on
right now so I think of it as saying you
you have to have a portfolio of
timescales saying some of your
researchers are embedded with the
engineers and are shipping something
this quarter and some are working on
next quarter some are working on next
year and so on we don't have anybody
working on 50 years out because we don't
think or at least I know I'm not smart
enough to think 50 years out maybe
there's somebody in the in the company
who is I don't know what's gonna happen
but I have a pretty good idea of what's
gonna happen five years out and so we
break things into small chunks and then
readjust by taking a long term research
project and breaking it down into
individual steps we are able to to
measure progress and to have impact
along the way rather than having to wait
till the completion of the final product
also helps us in the research community
so when we're done we've launched a
service then we can write a paper and we
think it's more interesting to have a
paper that says here's what we did
here's the theoretically interesting
parts and by the way we prove that on a
billion queries to our users that's a
more interesting paper than saying I had
an idea I'm not sure if it works out
alright I just built a little prototype
to test it publication certainly can be
traditional forms of publication as in
conferences or journals but open source
releases standards and even new products
that set a new definition of the
state-of-the-art are in many ways
publications that really
advance the field part of what
influences us is the diversity of the
field of computer science as we look at
all those different facets of computer
science I think we see that there are
many structures needed to pursue
research in that in an appropriate way
access to large-scale computation access
to large amount of usage get the freedom
to go do deep analysis mathematically
that's what we're trying to convey in
the paper that that hybrid approach to
research is a valuable model and we hope
you enjoy the paper thank you Peter
