program manager in the trusted safety
organization at Google the core of my
job at Google within the twenty safety
organization is to find opportunity to
improve efficiency and effectiveness and
that usually involved working with the
combination of engineering teams and
other program management teams including
teams like marketing then figure out
where there are opportunities for us to
do better and then then figure out what
some of the common goals might be
between those teams so we can figure out
all right what can we work together on
to make progress it's all about getting
people aligned on common goals I've been
a technical program manager at Google
for about seven and a half years and the
main way that the job has evolved for me
has to be with the scope and complexity
of the problems that I tackle and so the
best way to think about it is that I'm
trying to solve problems where the teams
that are involved are further away from
each other within the organization so
they have less in common so it's more
complicated to figure out what the
common goals are to get people to align
around it's important to be able to be
self-reflective and self-aware to be a
successful program manager one of the
key reasons is that yet it's up to you
to build the team that is well-rounded
and that compensates for any blind spots
that you might have so it's actually a
sprain to know what your weaknesses are
simply the the size of the problems that
you're tackling and the technical
component of the problems you've been
attacked so even if you're on a
technical program manager but even if
you're not a technical program manager
you're going to need to have some
technical aptitude in order to be able
to have fruitful conversations with the
stakeholders that you're working with so
somehow are you're gonna be working with
engineers or other technical program
managers who have tech the rafa to that
you have to get up to speed
at Google were not married to any
particular program and methodology we
leverage waterfall we'll ever a j'l
whatever makes sense in the situation a
lot of times we do a hybrid of those but
people aren't thinking about them the
program management methodology much much
as they're trying to figure out how to
solve the problems they apply whatever
makes sense at the time and you decide
what makes sense by evaluating with
risks are defining what the project
scope is and that gives you some ideas
about what combination of methodologies
or specific methodologies to apply don't
be shy about talking about the failures
or mistakes that you might have had in a
career those failures and mistakes can
be really big contributors to you being
a well-rounded program manager we're
always looking for people that have had
real-world experiences who may have
failed at trying to do something big but
they were self-aware enough to learn key
lessons that they apply everyday to the
new roles that happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
