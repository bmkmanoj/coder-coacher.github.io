how's your coffee it's pretty awesome
great we got some more questions to
answer alright alright put away the
banjo alright little banjo later later
uh so hi I'm Brian Fitzpatrick and I go
by Fitz
I'm ben collins-sussman and I go by ben
collins-sussman and we're here to answer
a few more questions today I've got the
first question right here on the right
you pad ah you know the battery life on
this thing is fabulous it's great
visibility outside too
yes it works really well in low light
conditions so the first question is how
difficult is the interview process
currently I've heard horror stories of
as many as seven interviews expanding
nine months which is a long period of
uncertainty no sound sounds like a lot
of another lot of urban legends right I
mean I think is possible that may have
happened to somebody at some point but I
think it's an extreme outlying case so
of course that's what spreads around the
net it's certainly not the norm why
there's always going to be that one
person that made it through in three
weeks and then the one person took nine
right so what let's talk about the
center of the bell curve right I Center
the curve with the center of the curve
you usually get a phone interview or two
within a first within a week or two
right right and then if you do well then
you go on-site and you do a few
interviews in one day correct them and
then you know a week or two later you
hear back that's that's the typical
sometime there might be a follow-up
interview ask a few more questions but
that sort of thing that's the standard
what most people experience right I mean
we've done a we've done a lot of
research as to how many interviews are
the optimal number I'm not sure with
that it is but I know that we've tried
fewer interviews and more interviews is
what we know that you know we don't just
keep throwing people through interviews
over and over and right we're hoping it
will they'll get better or something
will change it's like it's a very
deliberate process but but the point is
the point is to evaluate people to say
if they're good for Google in the long
term not if it's just here to fill an
immediate short-term need right in fact
you know that's that's a fallacy we've
talked about before in other talks right
where sometimes a company will say oh we
need somebody let's hire let's interview
20 people and hire the best three no
matter what right and Google absolutely
doesn't do that Google says look do we
want this person in general for a long
time
right regardless of
whether we need them at this moment
what's important to find a match to make
sure not only that the person we're
interviewing is a match for a company
but that we're match for them as well
right so it's a sort of a two-way street
that I don't know I think that's it
that's it for that question all right
what's the next question I'll be back
later Oh we'll be back okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
