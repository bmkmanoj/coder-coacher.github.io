amazing it's not just the diverse
customer base that you get to talk to
and all the interesting problems they're
solving but it's all the engineers the
marketing people the salespeople are
really the best in the industry that you
get to learn from through your job that
you're doing every day it's an
opportunity you just don't get in a lot
of places so I've been at Google 10
years as a full-time engineer but in
2005 I was also interned a co-op for
four months I've worked at Google for
about two and a half years now I've
worked at Google for 6 years now I'm
currently a software engineer working on
Google cloud I started actually
answering phones for what was then
Google Apps now I work on Google cloud
specifically cloud datastore which is
one of our databases I've been on - sure
for 10 years and I think one of the
reasons I haven't left the team is
because a lot of the work we do is more
interesting because it's engineering
problems mixed with business problems
and you know we're solving engineering
problems but it's always with respect to
a real business needs so you see real
customers use it and that sort of keeps
things interesting so we noticed a while
back that there were a lot of Gmail
addresses that were of the form at my
company at gmail.com and we figured that
a lot of these users would actually
probably like to have sales at my
company com so we created a way to
enable the user to switch from Gmail to
my company comm a user is screen Gmail
and saying I want to read my email I
want to download an attachment I want to
watch this YouTube video and so over the
years we keep adding more collaboration
tools and yeah to get to where we are
today but it all started with with Gmail
Google is it just concentrating on what
are the unique environment that our
customers work on and what data can we
bring to help them out it's a form of a
lot of stuff right sometimes it's going
into the source code for a product and
fixing a bug
sometimes it's adding a feature to
existing customer facing and so it's a
lot of that kind of Engineering it's
around enablement for example one two
weekends ago we had
customer 10 XR traffic for 50kbps to 250
kbps their traffic was automatically
isolated away from all other customers
it's very important at Google that our
products just work work reliably and
work every time we appreciate and
understand that you're betting your
business on our platform you are
building platforms on our platform that
other people are betting their
businesses on this is a partnership I
have seen the best and brightest
engineers at Google really flocked a
cloud because it presents interesting
challenges the infrastructure that we
run the product we give out to people
it's more about having that culture that
enables innovation and encourages people
to talk about the right solutions one of
my favorite things about working at
Google is that I'm surrounded by really
really smart people and that there they
all seem to be experts in some field
that you wouldn't have even known that
they were experts in you've got all
these successful companies and we are
helping them be better one of the most
rewarding things about working with
customers is you see when they're
successful and when they're successful
that means by definition what you're
doing is successful if you're the kind
of person who is motivated by fixing a
problem for another human being and
getting that emotional satisfaction of
hearing oh thank you that is much better
then this is an excellent job for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
