this banjo let's answer some questions I
got another question here on my G pad
I'm keeping it in the new paper app
there is a paper for that there's of
paper for that exactly so the question
is from Saudi Arabia it says would you
work for Google to the end of your
career path that's a that's a good
question I think and I I actually like
this question because I've worked up and
we're both coming up when five years at
Google now and before Google I'd never
worked anywhere for more than four years
I had worked at Apple for under four
years I worked at cloud net wonderful
years I worked at a local startup here
for under four years and that sort of
was like the that was sort of the
barrier which would sort of get the itch
to like do something else or find
another opportunity or try something
else that's more exciting and that that
four year anniversary came and went by
at Google like I didn't even notice it I
mean there's so much for me there's so
much exciting things going on so many
opportunities to to have new challenges
to keep learning to work with really
smart and interesting Pete's true every
job I've ever had have always gotten
into a place where I get into a rut and
I feel like I'm trapped or I'm just
bored of what I'm doing this there's
really no way to change around and here
everything's just as fluid as as the day
I started right it's just as many
opportunities I feel almost like that I
have too many choices right and I have
to narrow myself down and choose what I
want but at anytime I can switch gears
and change because everything's changing
around it's really it's exciting and so
I I can't think of any reason I'd want
to leave right now
right it's too it's too much fun but
it's it's it's it's about it's a lot of
it's about the people new people are
coming into work and you you get to I
think when someone new comes in and you
didn't mentor and work with him I think
you get to see a lot of the things that
you've been looking at for a long time
through new eyes right and a new point
of view and there's part of that is that
you're always learning right I mean
whatever whether you're mentoring
someone or whether we spend some time in
a Tech Talk or we're looking at a new
technology or starting a new project or
talking about a design decision I think
we're always I'm personally always
picking up new things and new ways of
looking at
and old problems that's what makes it so
exciting for me yeah nothing nothing
here gets stale or old it's always
changing and always new and I'm I'm
really really happy about that
I hope it lasts for a really long time I
was just saying it's gonna be written up
in textbooks as like you know look look
at what Google did in its heyday it's
it's got this fantastic culture it's got
this crazy you know sets of people
working it's it's a lot like Bell Labs
in the 19th right right there's an
excitement to it and I think it's gonna
go for a really really long time I hope
it goes to the end of my career I think
it will that would be pretty awesome
yeah so that means we'd be working
together for that long Wow it's possible
anyway thanks for the question thank you
yeah we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
