on air from the life of google channel
my name is Tolu i work on our staffing
team here in Mountain View and joining
me today we have twinkle and Michael
from our Google staffing team and yes
twinkle is her real name today we're
going to be talking about technical
resume preparation we get a lot of
questions on our life Google page about
you know how do I apply for the right
role how do I prepare my resume do you
guys need a cover letter all that stuff
so we're here to answer your questions
today we received a ton of questions on
our moderator page so thank you to all
of our followers um so before we get
started and get into the meat of the
meat of the discussion
I'll let twinkle and Michael introduce
themselves so twinkle hi guys I'm
twinkle um I am on the operations
recruiting team I'm a recruiter here at
Google and I've been here for about two
and a half years hello everyone my name
is Mike Moriarty I was a sorcerer I've
been here 16 months as a sorcerer for
about 12 months finding candidates such
as yourselves and have recently been
moved to a sourcing account management
role dealing with our Android and search
team strategizing on how to find more
people like you for their for their
teams great ok so you know we have a lot
to cover in the subject of technical
interviews our technical resume
preparation I should say so um Michael
to start out why do you just talk about
some of the differences between the
various engineering jobs that we have at
Google so like what's the difference
between a software engineer and a
front-end engineer and site reliability
engineer yeah I think it's a great
question a software engineer here at
Google senator who's coding between
about roughly 60 to 80 percent of their
time actively writing their own code
there's four main languages that we look
for and that we use here at Google it's
C C++ Java and Python so if you're using
Ruby as other scripting language doesn't
mean we don't need those it's just not
going to fit our general software
engineering rack how that differentiates
for maybe like our front-end software
engineering role our front-end obviously
deals with our user taking our users in
to mine and we mainly look for people
that have more of a Java Java
script type focus in their background
and their experience for those roles to
be able to take the backend and take our
user in mind and make sure that the UI
and everything else is working
appropriately an SRE rule is a site
reliability engineer they're kind of
more of a real-time systems systems
level development type in jail they're
still coding but they're making sure
that our websites are running the scale
at all times you know they're mainly
working on automation troubleshooting
systems monitoring you know they mainly
use Python as their main coding
languages we even have software engineer
and test roll those are people that
those aren't like QA type people that
most people think it's different Google
we're actually developing code to
prevent bugs rather than just fixing
bugs there they're constructing systems
that technically will break other
systems and their coding as well 68% of
time and one of our four main languages
cool yeah that's that's a pretty good
overview I mean we only covered some of
them we didn't even go into like systems
engineer security engineer all that
other stuff I think that's a pretty good
overview of our engineering roles do a
go can you talk about some of the non
engineering roles that we have at Google
yeah so we have a lot I think it it's
about a hundred over 150 job postings um
that comprise of the whole um you know
non software engineer group which is
what the operations team does and so
there's lots and lots of different roles
I've worked on um the statisticians the
quantitative analysts so they focus on
statistics mathematics things like that
I've also worked on user experience like
visual designers interaction designers
used to experience researchers there's
web developers web designers onto our
doodlers you know the guys that designer
homepage there's so many different roles
there's hardware operations security and
privacy corporate engineering developer
engine developer relations and there's
also a lot of technical program managers
just across the board so there's tons
and tons of them it's basically all the
technical roles yeah all the technical
roles you can think of you know we
probably have a home for you at Google
it's insane okay so you know my goal
with all
different roles all these different
engineering roles all these different
technical roles
how should candidates decide which role
to apply for yeah I would like to think
first these candidates have a specific
background academic or professional that
they're bringing to the table and on the
job that does do a good or a decent job
of really explaining what the role is a
tail so if someone is feeling more has a
background academic professionally on
front end type work then they should be
you know ideally moving towards the
front end type stuff if they've been
working on mobile and working with you
know laptops and tablets and phone you
know there is a mobile option that they
can select so kind of just pairing their
background experience with everything if
they don't know on the sweet side on the
software inside I would highly recommend
just applying for the software
engineering rec and then we can move
them appropriately afterwards but I
would say that's just going to delay the
process a couple days so I would just
recommend really taking consideration
what their experience is really what
they want to do at Google and it does a
pretty good job of aligning that for
which one on the sweet side okay so it
doesn't necessarily matter if I only
have one year of experience versus ten
years of experience that there's just
like one role to apply for that's a
great question yeah there's one rule to
apply for the only difference on the
sweet side as far as software
engineering goes is for someone who's
looking for an internship so is still in
school there's an internship Rick as
well as if you're just out of school or
about to be out of school we do have a
new grad team and focus that you can
apply for so anybody who's six months
out of school or less or still in school
looking for a job when they come out I
would apply for the new grad software
engineer position but yeah if you're one
years or thirty years and it's a
software engineering wreck that you
would apply cool good to know um okay so
let's talk about resumes specifically so
twinkle can you talk about like what
what are the best ways to structure your
resume yeah sure so I would say I know a
lot of people feel like they need to put
an objective at the top we don't
necessarily really need an objective for
the resume I would say focus on your
education I would start with that start
with any degrees you've had any relevant
even if you've you know maybe done some
coursework in a particular field but you
may not
degree in that field go ahead and
include that coursework up there
especially if it's relevant to the job
that you're interested in so focus on
all of that stuff put all of your
degrees on there undergrad master's PhD
whatever you have include all of it and
then when you go into your work
experience definitely put your most
relevant experience not your most
relevant your most recent experience
first I'm sorry and go into those and um
you know depending on where you're at in
your career we don't we don't
necessarily need to see everything
you've done in the last 15 years unless
you've actually had relevant work
experience for 15 years I would really
focus on you know the internships that
helped you when you were in college are
relevant to the role any-any --fill for
that that's relevant to the role that
you're applying for so focus on those um
and of course at the end you could also
put in anything you like to do for fun
that's always nice to see any community
service you've been involved in you know
Google loves to see that um yeah just
you know other projects that you've been
a part of that aren't necessarily
work-related but still show skills that
would be relevant um to an employer like
Google yeah and to piggyback on that on
the sweet side um if you've had any you
know let's say you don't have top tier
education that we look for if you have
been contributing to open source
communities if you have done some coding
competitions or algorithm or math
competitions and you score well and
that's something that you're proud of
that's something really relevant to
Google and that's something we would
really like to see on your resume as
opposed to try to find out right I mean
what like how far back should it go
necessarily because let's say you know I
was on the debate team in high school or
something is that relevant like with
with interests and kind of side projects
and things like that like how deep
should a candidate go let's say back to
college you know anything well Ben can
call on but obviously something that's
still being used so if you took if you
got your PhD and we focused on computer
vision but ever since you've been
working on
something else and Ben did work and you
get the computer vision isn't something
you really do anymore please put it on
there but it's please make it clear that
what you're working on now is really
what we think you're probably going to
want to work on here at Google and then
that's kind of clearly outlined in your
resume okay cool um all right so
most people know that Google receives a
lot of resume and so what are some of
the skills and experience that will
really help a resume stand out to you
guys Michael yeah on the sweet side kind
of just hit on it I really think
anything outside work professionally
obviously Google's big on the open
source so anything commit contributed to
github and how many shares you have here
part of any blogs or teams where you can
have contributed something relevant to
Google so let's say you're passionate
about Big Data and you know about Hadoop
and MapReduce and you've worked on those
technologies but you haven't done in
your professional career that's fine or
if you made an app and Google Pleiades
general it's been downloaded 20,000
times please share that information
whether that's personally or
professional because that's something we
do look for it's obviously very relevant
to Google as well as the Matic ACM
competitions or anything else like that
that's something we really do like to
see okay um and how long should a resume
be you know because a lot of candidates
particularly if they have a lot of
experience they'll have you know ten
different employers oh they'll have
multiple degrees like and you know
sometimes it won't be confined to one
page like what's the ideal length of a
resume yeah I would say you know keep it
under two pages if you can if you
absolutely if you have work experience
that's really relevant you've had years
and years of it and you just really need
to include that and that's fine you can
go ahead you're not going to be dinged
for including the long resume but you
know keeping in mind the volume that we
do see it's probably best that you try
to keep it under two pages um but again
it's not going to count against yeah
that's they can see but I would like to
see the meet of your resume within two
pages we have a ton of experience and
then if you have you know 50 or 100
patents publications please add those
that's very important but just put those
on the pages three through whatever it
might be
but the first two guys you want to know
what you're doing where you worked at if
you can keep it to two pages that would
that's just better for us easy guys
so is it fair to say though that your
first page to be your most recent work
experience or your most relevant job
experience yeah I think that makes sense
go from well all the way back Raj okay
sounds good um and we're some of the
common mistakes that you see on resume
for me personally on the tech side I
like that people do explain what their
company does but I don't need to take up
three paragraphs and I still don't know
what you're doing at your company and
what technologies you're working on also
I I do not have a computer science
degree so explain something maybe to
technically also is challenging for me
where I'm googling it and trying to
figure out what layer on the stack this
guy's working on so something that you
know explains what they're doing but
explains it somewhat in layman's term
would be preferential for us um I'm on
your side tickle any I mean just general
rule of thumb you know any type of like
spelling mistakes or punctuation errors
those are just small things but for
recruiters for us it just looks like you
know enough effort wasn't put in when
preparing the resume it's not that we
think that you have any issues with
spelling or punctuation it's more a
matter of you know did you really review
this and go through properly before you
apply it and so that definitely shows
something and keep in mind like when you
come in for your interviews your
interviewers will be looking at your
resume so you want to just avoid any of
those small mistakes that could you know
easily be prevented yeah and also on
education let's say you got your your
bachelor's in something non tech related
but you got your master's PhD or
whatever might be in tech includes your
bachelor's just put all the information
about you that makes you you and that's
that's great about Google's we want
everyone to be themselves so if you got
a philosophy undergrad and a CS master's
please put that you got a undergrad just
so we know and it just looks like you're
trying to hide something which isn't
necessarily no good it just raises a red
flag it does need to be raised okay
sometimes so one question that I get a
lot on social media is are there
deal-breakers so like if I've worked at
one particular company or if I've you
know done one thing is my resume gonna
get tossed in the trash is that I
haven't at there's no blacklist at
Google yeah we're looking to bring you
know the best and brightest and most
passionate people to Google so just
you're still alive from Larry Page at
least on the software engineering side
we're looking for engineers that have a
healthy disregard for the impossible and
if you have that passion and that's what
I love to see my job and the people that
I talk to is they want to change the
world in a positive way and
that's what we're looking for okay cool
all right so we had a ton of different
user questions and so you know we try
we're trying to get get to as many as
possible today so our first one comes
from Joel Rosamond and he asked as a
computer science student in college at
the moment I'm trying to decide on a
minor that would best complement my
major
what minors would you recommend that
work well with CS and would look good to
you on a resume yeah my reality capital
I would say for the software engineering
side if your CS degree math is very
relevant to the algorithms everything
else we work on here at Google I've
hired some people to just have math
degrees and then they learned how to
code and their professional career on
their own so a combination of the two of
those would make you very you know
attractive to not like Google but any
software engineering company all right
cool
next comes from C Floy media in
California what are some prior
experiences that some Google employees
have had in their career before having
the opportunity to opportunity to join
Google um I could take that I think that
Google people Google employees come from
all over all the different experiences
all different walks of life all
different Creed's cultures religions so
on the software engineering side things
that are somewhat similar though that we
can see commonalities is you know people
that went to really good academic CS
backgrounds people that worked at
relevant companies that deal with big
data I think that makes sense for people
to come work at Google in the software
engineering side but the good thing
about Google and on this offer dream
size we have so many different products
that we haven't worked on big data but
you've only worked on I don't know geo
mapping or things like that we have a
team for you if you just work on social
media and fashion but we have a team for
you so I think people that the common
ties are people that are really
passionate about changing the world I
know it's cheesy and friends and help
you a lot but it's the commonality here
at Google or people that are really
passionate about wanting to have an
impact and I think that you know
probably doesn't help you a ton but is
really what separates Googlers from them
from other people outside yeah and also
we
IRA like you know across all levels like
new grad to super senior um so it's fine
you know if you don't have a ton of
experience and you still have the
relevant education I you know or some
type of coursework it's not that you
know you're not going to be looked at so
yeah and when you say education is
important to distinguish that it's not
just the college that you went to or
their particular degree it's more like
what you learn right like the skills
that that you acquired in your education
not necessarily a particular a
particular school a hundred percent now
there are schools that we like to see
people from but that's you know
understandable but there's only a small
population of people that work at Google
so the greater population of people just
like you you said that people have
learned applied that knowledge and
continually want to grow and learn yeah
all right so this question comes from
Sharon what are some of the common
attributes of top performers and do you
actively look for those attributes in a
resume
Michael addictive oh sorry okay know
anything son so yeah um we always you
know googliness is actually a term here
and so it's like that's one thing to
focus on is basically just don't be evil
it's one of our philosophies you know
it's just being a good person being
involved in other things that like I
said earlier that really just show that
you've you know demonstrated skills that
could be relevant to Google like
leadership or being able to work well in
a team being self-directed being also to
be able to work independently well I
know if we can see any of those
attributes in your resume that's that's
always great because I think everyone
that I've worked with at Google has had
those qualities and it must have
demonstrated that in some way when they
were applying ya notes and on the sweet
side what skill set you do know better
than others so if you're working on the
networking layer make sure to make that
clear one is within that layer where
you're working you know I think the most
relevant thing to Google that's similar
buswell sequel is data like I said
before so dealing with me so can you
have experience with that make sure to
note that that if you have a hundred
MapReduce those types of technologies
that's something we really really like
to see okay so in the middle from New
Jersey asks a question about a topic
that gets a lot of that where there's a
lot of uncertainty and that's coverlet
so he asks what's the perfect cover
letter to accompany a resumes for google
I could say on the software engineering
side
I wouldn't even submit a cover letter
it's not something I look at I'm a
mortgage to what you're doing and I can
decipher from there you know fact you're
applying is telling me enough about you
if you're new grad I would highly
recommend having a cover letter but if
you're an industry candidate you know
it's not something on the software
engineering side that we're really
taking the time to look at yeah same
thing on software engineering side I
wouldn't say it with the volume that we
get it's really just easier to see the
resume like a clear-cut resume that's
well structured versus having a cover
letter with that um but again if you
have any type of background that's not
really specifically aligned with the
role that you're applying to ya then
feel free to explain that in your cover
letter I think in situations like that
it helps you know where it's like okay I
might have gotten a degree in philosophy
or something but I really um you know
want to work in X area so I'll explain
like why I feel like I have this goals
to qualify for that particular field and
so that's when it's relevant but
otherwise I would steer clear of the
cover letters yeah I mean it might also
be helpful to explain gaps in your
resume um you know if you had to take a
leave of absence to you know care for a
loved one or something like that cover
letters are good perfect for that as
well definitely okay cool so this next
question is about how the resume is used
so it comes from I puns uh is a resume
you use in stages after the interview or
is it just used to filter candidates to
decide who to call in a resume is used
throughout the whole process from from
first finding you or are you sending it
to us to write until you get an offer
from Google so it's used throughout the
process and a very important cat piece
of data that mean someone gives us a
snapshot who you are where you come from
where you want definitely and everybody
that you meet with to when you come in
for your interviews I mean they're gonna
have your resume handy and that's the
first there you know the first
impression anyone's gonna get a view is
from your resume so it's key to have
that up-to-date and perfect because
that's really everyone is going to see
that and Apryl event experience is
really what you're going to talk about a
lot as well during your interview so you
want to just
all of that on paper in a clear way and
back to formatting on the sweet side you
know I see the same word dot formatted
or Google Doc formatted resume so if you
I've seen some that are pretty cool that
are unique you know we would think
that's googly yeah however you want to
make it different as long as you have
the same information and somewhat
manageable to get that information feel
free I think that's kind of you know
think about you're looking at a stack of
resumes what's gonna catch your eye
you know saying with me if I'm looking
at a bunch of people and something
stands out just because it stands out
it's gonna take more of my time to look
at that and you don't just help the
process also if we have any designers of
designers and Droid visual anyone I love
you know I'm hang out that's interested
in applying your portfolio link forgot
to mention earlier is the most key thing
it's really more important than than
anything you would have on a resume
because they really just want to see
your work cool um okay so this one comes
from John the accountant here in Silicon
Valley
how can one go beyond the job
description in a resume um in other
words how can one appear not just ready
to perform the job well but ready to
thrive at Google yeah I think what kind
of we just said a little bit you're
making resume different but I think the
one thing that separates like I said
people with Google is the googliness if
you can exclude leanness means a lot of
different things a lot of people but to
me it means something that people are
passionate about outside of work if you
can convey that on a resume your to
charity if it's a sport if it's whatever
if it's your kids whatever it is to
convey that and make sure that that
that's conveyed and you know when it is
passion is you feel about it
so we can really take that in because
that is evaluated in your interview
process here at Google you know we want
great intelligent people but you also
want really good people that can work
with other people and indeed team
players so I think that's really
something that most helped ease my
delicate I don't know but I know Google
it's very very important that we like to
see that your passion about other things
outside of Google yeah definitely
sometimes it can be challenging to try
to show on a piece of paper that you are
somebody that you know any of us would
want to work with when we read your
resume or any of your interviewers or
anybody you meet throughout the process
would want to just look at your resume
and say hey I want to make this person
because I want to work with them so I
think the best way to do that is to add
a little bit of a personal touch like
Mike was saying like include things
other than
you know work-related that that you're
possibly interested in cool all right so
the sex one comes from New York City
what are the best ways to meet
recruiters once a resume is submitted
are there any proactive things a
candidate can do to stand out Michael
want to take that one take that I think
obviously LinkedIn is a great way to
meet people I get you know a lot of
LinkedIn messages Google events are a
great place we do hosts you know code
jams and things like that you know I'll
be hosting a happy hour this Thursday
Google i/o you know those are just good
places to go meet people um but really
other than that I don't know how she'd
meet recruiters unless you're at your
happy hour on Friday I don't really know
otherwise to meet recruiters because
we're we're really busy and doing that
but I think you know if you're MIT if
you're really passionate and I get some
great people on LinkedIn that's any
messages I recommend you know connect
with them but that's not necessarily
going to give you a leg up it's really
going to be based on your background
Google+ is also a great way to it's a
very good blog is a great Avenue to get
in touch with us okay cool so this next
one comes from hello world and book in
Berlin apart from the submitted
application documents do you use
additional information to categorize
your applicants in the selection process
yeah I ever sleep um don't do other
searches I think my cuz yeah I
definitely do we we look for people all
over different ways not everyone's on
LinkedIn so we look at coding
competitions we're looking at math
competitions we look at pretty much
everything you can find up in the
blogging groups things like that and
we'll depending on what they're blogging
on or what they're coding and definitely
categorized them for certain roles
within here so I on the sweet side we've
try to find people as opposed to just
which people find us as well cool um and
then our last question comes from code
crews in New York if you interview
before but then did not but did not do
so well how long should you wait to
reapply so don't quote me on the stat
but I'm pretty sure
roughly let's just say greater than 30%
of the engineers Google have applied
more than have interviewed more than
once I think
Tyrel say 30 be safe that was my bread
and butter people that I've interviewed
before I think interviewing is a skill
and to be able to do it once and
understand the coding it don't be don't
don't be brokenhearted I think you can
come back you have to wait a minimum 12
months but just waiting a minute 12
months and not gaining any new
experience is a tough sell so if you
went to a new company and working on
something more relevant to Google if you
got a new certification something to
what has changed why should you come
back interview at Google what has
changed about you that makes us think
you're going to do better the second
time I think first and foremost discuss
you interviewed once will help you but
what else that was a great success for
me that was most the candidates that I
got hired here could work people have
energy before so it's a minimum of 12
months though on the software
engineering side yeah and then on the
operation side we see 6 to 12 months so
it might be a little bit more lenient it
kind of just it's really case-by-case so
if somebody comes in and they had an
interview and everybody loved them were
like hey I would love to work with this
person but I feel like you know he or
she could work more on her technical
skills let's reach out to them again in
six months you know that's that's
something that does happen often um but
you know if it's somebody that's you
know for some reason is a little bit
more junior in any particular area then
we usually encourage them to wait a year
so it it's kind of just arranged if you
feel like you want to apply for any
unrelated role you can do so at any time
it's just if you're applying for the
same exact role in the same job ladder
we usually recommend you wait a while
and you know the purposes it's not for a
punishment it's just so that you can go
get those experiences and go out there
and have some more work experience or
more coursework or whatever it is you
need to come back and and do better the
second time
and there's great resources out there on
the sweet side like top coder comms
period website that we recommend most
for kids go check out for algorithm
development things like that so I think
there's some especially when you go
through it the first son you know kind
of how the interview is structured it's
been I've never took computer science
but it's been explained to me but very
much I can cs101 interview so knowing
your general computer science is just
going to help you in brushing off that
cs101 buck isn't going to hurt you at
all yeah definitely the technical skills
are key in any of these roles brushing
up on that it's really what's going to
help you before your interviews and the
great thing about technical roles is
that you can improve right you can
always
this you know in the time that you
applied in and the time that you reapply
their new skills to learn there's new
languages to master so you know you can
improve it and reapply once you're
better fit 100% great cool well that all
the time we have today
