exception cultural within Google it
shows the will of Google to invest for
long term in France you know I think
Harris is special because it has it has
a lot of strong French culture so
there's a lot of diversity and different
ideas and so on
indicators you hear both French and
English to really international
environment visually I'm from Morocco
other people on my team are from all
over the world and they're all excited
to be in Paris physical Paris also
represents something magical for a lot
of them my minutes in Paris we will have
engineers developing and coding for our
users so user oriented and we will have
our usual sales forces focusing on our
partners and our significant customers
and the environment till the big private
engineering projects that exist in the
Paris office our YouTube
and Crum my project is about public data
and visualizations but I'm the most
proud of actually is the opening of the
European Cultural Institute in Paris the
Google Paris surface is very central I
mean it's in the heart of a city very
close to be oppressive shops and
actually it's at the center of
everything so it's very life the
location it's perfect it's close its
close to the railway station is close to
the center it's night it's beautiful I
mean what do you want more from life I
don't know if you've seen our to us but
we have outside we have a nice day us
with chairs when you can have lunch or
even coffee in the morning Under the Sun
so that's I think that's a nice very
nice environment and the free food is
not something you can really be unhappy
about so I'm free food is good as well
you have good a healthy food at lunch
you have snacks when you want to have
snacks you have very nice I won't leave
a brand but you have very nice tea and
we are very happy about our tea here too
I'm a big tea drinker my gonna come up
in the cafeteria working at Google is
also working with happy people and
that's I think that's a good good
environment your voice is heard when you
want to say something to your manager
when you want to say something to your
colleagues you can do it and you can
have an impact on this thing on the
projector you're working on the
work-life balance I mean we try and work
hard but we are soaked a hat and and
that's very smart
my biggest satisfaction at Google is the
difference we make the difference we
make on our society and on the people
around because of the work we have to
work on fantastic product that changed
the life of people over the last 10
years and the funny thing is when my son
wakes up in the morning is in mom did
you see the new Google application here
is a new one this one is great and it's
true every day engineers find something
new and it's it's a big surprise Google
has such an impressive collection of
engineers if you have a question the guy
that wrote the programming language or
the rope the guy that wrote the tool is
probably sitting in a between another
Google building according is fun it's I
mean you are paid to a friend what what
I said it can't be better it's art and
science and engineering all at the same
time everybody uses Google everybody
uses a Google product and and the fact
that I have anything that I built can be
used by the entire world I think that's
a really strong motivation for me and
that you know every day I try to make
things easier to use and more useful for
for our Google users Google is looking
for people that are highly motivated by
really being part of a company that is
yes it's big you have a lot of offices a
lot of employees but the behavior is
still like a startup Google is looking
for people that have energy we like to
dream
we love to dream we make a lot of fun
and somehow if you want we play hard and
work hard we have to be able to do both
and people interested in the books are
the one to succeed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
