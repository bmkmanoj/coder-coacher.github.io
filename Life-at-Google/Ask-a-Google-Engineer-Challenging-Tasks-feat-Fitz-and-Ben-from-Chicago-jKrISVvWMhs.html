answer one last question welcome back
we've got another question here another
one on the G pad a G pad keep it powered
there's a paper for that okay so the
question here is how challenging are the
tasks you get at Google what if you
failed at a task that's a good question
challenging are the tasks I think it
depends I think some days you got you
hit really hard tasks when it comes to
engineering problems other days there
are easier tasks and I mean I think well
it's not with a failure thing first
right yeah there's this whole failure is
not an option thing that people talk
about from NASA right and you know when
you're dealing very yeah when you're
dealing with human lives I think it's a
little different when you're dealing
with software that you know people are
using to search with whatever not I
think I think failure is okay
but the the point of it is is that
failures a way to learn really really
quickly as long as you fail fast and
iterate quickly right I think you're
you're learning and you're getting
better
and don't be afraid to try again right
well you're always you're always gonna
be failures right so we I could sit here
and explain to you for hours that this
stove is hot do not touch the burner
right but if you touch the burner and
burn yourself which is a motive failing
you were gonna learn very quickly not to
write to touch it you don't take a word
for it right so it's it's a way of
trying to fail early fail often I think
it's an important thing so there's no
stigma attached to fail in fact someone
wants joke you know people jumping out
of windows for failures right well I
think someone someone joked about
putting out on your internal resume you
know having a list of what you failed at
doing and some would be you know fussed
at or whatever right so yeah at Google a
failure is considered just as valid and
experienced as a success as long as you
have a post-mortem look and there's a
document describing what happened and
how you're gonna address it so that's
right and and and and some proof that
you've learned and gotten better and
improved right right so yeah that's one
of the things I really like about our
culture
the tests are challenging right I think
it depends on you know I'm concerned
with the first part of question okay I
think if you fail twice at the same
thing that's a problem yeah I think I
think failing at different things that's
okay but if you tried something don't
learn anything from it fail and then do
it again and again and again that's
that's a problem that's insane because
you're not learning right so anyway but
do it is are the tests you get at Google
tchau tchau tchau how challenging I
think they're very challenging um I
think I think one of the problems I see
at least among Googlers is that
sometimes there's there's too many
challenges and they have to choose which
channels they want to work on I mean
it's almost it's like too much of a good
thing right and great it's I have been
in so many jobs where I'm just looking
for a challenge trying to find one
somewhere cuz I'm just I'm bored and
here it's like wow there are challenges
everywhere which one am I going to
choose right where do I start yeah where
do you want to start and and a lot of
least at least some Island and my job as
a manager actually is advising various
people and these are the challenges that
you should look at I know they all
excite you but here's the one so I think
I think it's a good thing I think
they're very challenging and it makes
people very happy or at least that's the
kind of people we hire so right you want
to be challenged well we you have to
think of not only building something but
building in a scale right here instead
if you're building a little toy for you
and your family or your friends you're
building an application that could be
used by millions of people that at the
same time even saying yes and you
discover that you have to build a new
intuition about what it means to operate
at scale things that you take for
granted when you're just writing you
know a little program for one computer
those things you cannot take for granted
anymore when you're talking about
program running on thousands of
computers okay and and a lot of that a
lot of the challenge list for someone
who's just starting at Google is picking
up that vocabulary or that intuition
about how to design things at scale it's
really exciting actually you have to
wrap your head around it so to speak
yeah so that's that's the main kind of
challenge thanks a lot
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
