engineer my name is Gary Brown and I'm a
security engineer specializing in
forensics security is important because
it protects our intellectual property
and it protects our customers and our
users many companies that I have
interacted with a security engineer is
expected to know all parts of security
which can be a bit overwhelming but here
at Google you do get to specialize and
become really good at one part of
security in my current role I gather
evidence to support or refute claims of
malicious acts or compromise so in a
typical day my team will field queries
from internal users or weird things that
our detection team has found and our
goal is to investigate them further and
determine whether they are an actual bad
thing that has happened or what we call
false positive I spend quite a bit of
time doing research about new security
methodologies I spend some time coding
and then I spend quite a bit of time
doing analysis just looking at our
team's detections I think the culture at
Google it's very open I think people are
just generally more free to express
their ideas what I've noticed is that
people are just allowed to be themselves
and just you have your job but you're
also an individual and you're allowed to
bring that individual to work the
managers that I've interacted with any
way they'd much rather have you be happy
on another team than unhappy in your
current role the forensics is my second
team I started on the detection team and
I really appreciate that we have that
kind of mobility Google's user base is
absolutely huge and to be a member of
relatively small part of the company
that's entrusted with making sure that
our user data it's safe that's kind of
part of what keeps me going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
