and I'm an engineering director in
Google Seattle office and supporting our
big data efforts here despite my
suggestion I've encouraged not to
perform the Harlem shake or encourage
anybody on this hangout to perform the
Harlem shake so you know you won't be
seeing that what I have been encouraged
to do though is tell you about Google's
cloud efforts and introduce you to some
of our team that makes the product make
the product shine Google's cloud
platform is focused on building tools
and systems that can make developers and
businesses successful using Google's
infrastructure we have the basic
components like big store to store your
data a Google compute engine to help you
spin up a Linux virtual machine and do a
general compute and we offer full
platform products like Google App Engine
where you can deploy your web app or
mobile app with just a few clicks of a
button and you know get running on the
web
the piece that I work on is Big Data
basically once you put your data into
the into Google's storage what can you
do with it and so what I'm trying to do
is build products that transform the
data and then you can put it into
bigquery and perform the interactive
analyses over over large Leviathan sets
of data so we're investing heavily in
these and some not yet announced
projects and to make the Google
competitive computing platform for the
next ten years and beyond and you can
learn more about all of this at Cloud
Google com but the point of this hangout
is actually to introduce to members of
the cloud team that make our product
great what is different about this group
of people is that they're members of the
technical team that are not strictly
software engineers creating great
products is team effort and these are
the people that make the product shine
and they make it usable understandable
and beautiful with that I'd like to
introduce a couple of members the team
we have to my left I have Don and Don
these are user experience and research
teams folks folks see how to make a
beautiful expressive interfaces like
wave a Tony where's Tony hi Tony Tony
leads our performance security and test
team in effort to create high quality
reliable software we have Anthony every
way Anthony Anthony is a psyche
reliability engineer
we're centering our CD our systems are
always running even the face of failure
and that failure happens every single
day and then we have Marc Marc leads
developer relations efforts and works as
really developer advocate for Google and
and for their computer services so if
you're having a problem
he's the one who's also having the same
problem trying to figure out how to make
it better so with that quick round of
introductions I'd like to have everybody
you know to introduce a little bit about
what they do and and how they got here
so Don tell us a little bit about
yourself and how did you get to be a UX
researcher working on cloud ok so um I
joined Google in 2007 after completing
an internship in our Mountain View
office and in 2007 I joined in Kirkland
as a full-time user experience
researcher on ads and I've kind of spent
my time when in many areas here at
Google working on ads
internationalization search pretty much
all the areas that we cover here at
Google before Google I actually was a
returning student in my 30s to get a PhD
in human factor psychology way back in
the day I was an eighth grade science
teacher after majoring in geology in
English so I'm kind of one of those
women that sort of or one of those
people that started my career completely
over in my 30s and did an internship and
got a full time offer so I joined cloud
a late last fall and started running our
UX team in January so what are the
challenges in making cloud beautiful you
know within what you do good I think one
of the biggest challenges is it is a
developer tool and it's it's for
developers it's you know I kind of like
to think of it as we're designing
interfaces for developers to develop
often for developers so it's a lot of
developer as a user type of challenges
and it is a unique user group that is
not like our consumer groups that we
have difficulties recruiting people and
we really struggle with how to make it
easy for for new developers but not
dumbed down for very experienced
developers and just in our space working
on a lot of consistency issues
trying to get everything you know
consistent across all of our user
interface API documentation command-line
interfaces so working on for very
different interfaces but trying to make
them all consistent in line with Google
design standards as well as a pleasure
to use
it's family next I'd like to talk to
Tony Tony how did you get to Google
thanks Ruben how I get to Google well
first I want to address something which
is I actually got to Google as an
Anthony I'm now Tony so you don't have
to be Anthony to work at Google so I'll
start there I get to Google um well I've
always looked at you know data and big
data and I started out my career working
as a researcher and you know worked in
the DC area for a number of years worked
for Silicon Graphics which was you know
a great graphics innovator and then many
other sort of companies and zigzagged
throughout my career from you know
strictly developer roles to non
developer roles but the thing that I you
know learned you know after a long time
being in the industry is you know I was
a physics major and I always ask the
question why and there were all these
questions around tests about people you
know taking apart a toaster or
refrigerator and how you do it turns out
I actually did all that much to my
mother's behest and so I got to Google
because I asked a lot of the why
questions and and in particular I came
because I saw we were building cloud and
I I came to Google two years ago and I
really wanted to work on the next big
thing and I saw Google as a company that
was innovating far differently than all
the other places I had been and I saw a
group of people that were very talented
and I just wanted to be a part of that
and sort of drive the next generation
platform standing so what do you do in
your role because I I knew I asked a lot
of you personally because you do the
test and performance to secure it and
then I keep wondering what how can I do
it better so I spent a lot of my day
trying to figure out how we actually
improve the product and I look at three
dimension
always I look at security reliability
and performance because these are the
things that our customers care deeply
about you know making the systems don't
fail testing them to failure driving
them off a cliff scaling them beyond any
you know humanly conceivable dimensions
you know looking at the very specifics
like how fast as a disk i/o or how fast
can we move you know network packets or
how much CPU are we using and then from
the security standpoint you know working
with the team and building in you know
security you know mitigations and
strategies around how we protect users
data and in particular things like you
know encryption at rest which is
something we value a lot you know at
Google and we value a lot and cloud and
so making sure we live up to our
promises and so day in and day out I am
looking for every way I can help improve
cloud you know no matter what the axis
is in terms of you know you know things
that I do day in and day out so I am the
professional worrywart in the team thank
you for doing that
the so now to Anthony not Tony you know
how'd you get to Google so I got to
Google uh back in December of 2005 I
actually started as a help desk
technician so I've probably been here
the longest I think of the growth I did
that role for about nine months and I
transferred into the sre organization
has a technical program manager and
started to help build Google's data
centers and do capacity planning the
opportunity to join clouds started in I
think a spring of 2010 and I actually
joined the engineering team in asre
consulting role and helped doing the
production readiness review for some of
our cloud products I continue to do
capacity planning and I recently became
the SRA manager for the computation team
kikunojo necessary is basically
responsible for keeping the system up we
manage the availability latency
scalability and efficiency of compute
engine and we engineer reliability and
software and software engine into our
systems standing
so the
how hard is the job I mean what would
you know what do you need to do to be
successful as an SRE you Google well I
think that most s eries like high
pressure I mean we're on call they'd
like to be the people that saved the day
and you get opportunities to do that all
the time and thank you for saving
several of my systems I appreciate it
mark yes sir how did you get how'd you
get to Google so I always liked math and
computers I was a math major in college
and when I got out of school I wasn't
sure which of those two fields I wanted
to go into I ended up getting a job with
Bell Labs in New Jersey and I got my
master's degree in computer science and
never looked back I spent quite a number
of years 29 years actually doing
software development in the
telecommunications field and towards the
end of that period of my life I started
really getting interested in teaching
I've done some to spend a couple years
teaching at the continuing education
department of University of Washington
Python programming things like that and
the more I did the more I liked and when
I found out about developer relations it
seemed like a great opportunity for me
because developer relations does
blogging speaking teaching as well as
coding and so you know I looked at that
and I still love to code and and that's
a that's a big passion of mine so I
looked at that opportunity and I felt
like coding plus writing plus teaching
seemed like a dream job to me so I
joined Google on developer relations
team in 2011 so I've only been here a
couple years and I'm now the manager of
the developer relations team here in
Seattle for Google Cloud Storage and
Google compute engine so given
everything you have to do I mentioned
the error there that you know I I you
developer ratios as an advocacy
organization that you know helped you
know figure out what helped cloud figure
out what to do but having a prioritizing
what you're gonna work on next where
you're to you working on yeah so I'll
just say a little bit about what the
different things that we do to be a
little bit more specific so I'm a big
focus for us is just awareness of the
product so
speak at conferences we do screencasts
we do developer live sessions that are
very similar to this we blog we do a lot
of sort of teaching and education we
also write sample apps and demonstration
apps to kind of give people
instructional assets to help them
understand how to write their own code
my team is responsible for the product
documentation as well so that's a big
part of what we do the online
developers.google.com/maps come out of
come out of the developer relations work
and we're like you said Rueben we're
sort of we serve an advocacy function so
we try to consider ourselves the voice
of the developer at some of the design
sessions and and review meetings
internally that determine how we
continue to build out the product so
there's a lot of other things we do but
that's kind of the the major the parts
of what we do as far as how we
prioritize across all those things we
really try to weigh all that you know
when one of the challenges is there's so
many different areas we can get involved
in and we just try to away all the
different new products coming out new
features requests we've had from
different folks and we internally as a
team come up with our strategy on a
quarterly basis and then we share that
with our stakeholders the lead engineers
and the product managers for those areas
make sure they're in sync with us and
then we execute but one of the
interesting things about Google is there
is a very high degree of autonomy people
kind of have the responsibility and the
fun of figuring out what they should do
to be effective and so there's a large
element of that in how we do our
priority prioritization so the the
reason why we're all we're all on this
phone call partly is a was hiring and we
all you know everybody on this call
hangout is focused on you know trying to
bring on new people to help join we're
expanding in the Seattle in Kirkland
area we're having great new office space
and we're looking for our people more
people who can you know pass the bar and
you know join the company and you know
be our Carlile colleagues done yeah what
kind of skills do you need what are you
looking for so on the UX team we have
four roles
we are currently hiring for three of
those four roles so we have UI developer
interaction designer user experience
researcher and tech writers so we are
currently hiring for tech writer
research and interaction design
interaction designers were looking for
someone with strong skills or experience
skills and/or experience in in the
design process so a lot of our current
designers have a background and computer
science or they have a background in
some sort of design graphic design
human-computer interaction something
along those lines and they you know
we're looking for the folks that can
really think about these very complex
spaces and bring it down to information
architecture and a set of mocks that we
can can do research on so that sort of
leads to our researcher role our
researchers right now everyone on the
team has an advanced degree in
psychology sociology or anthropology and
we do all the research so we're looking
for folks that have experience we'd love
to get more people with with research
experience with developers as a customer
and the researchers really run the lab
studies they're on surveys they they run
any type of a research method that is
industry standard in the tech sector and
our tech writer is a new role for our
team so this person we we hope to hire
on to do a lot of our UI writing so
again because it is a developer that
we're building for we want to make sure
that we're writing in a language that is
good for that group of people and we're
hoping our tech writer bring skills that
that are you know able to take a lot of
words down to as few as possible as
accurate as possible and yeah we're
hiring actually in in our Seattle office
and we have a small presence in our San
Francisco office how about you Tony so
uh looking for kind of the three
different areas security performance and
test first and foremost I mean we're
always
looking for developers people that are
you know great at coding because all
problems at Google are solved at scale
and the way we scale is we scale with
machines generally not people and so
that means we have to write code so for
the three different areas for security
in particular looking for security
researchers people who are great at you
know pen testing you know security code
review building mitigations building
fuzzers and recently we did this thing
at Google called podium where we were
paying I don't know 3.14159 million
dollars to anybody that could hack from
OS and there was a researcher named
Pinkie Pie who almost got it and walked
away with a great bag of money so I'm
looking for Pinkie Pie and everybody
that loves to do things like Pinkie Pie
on the performance side I'm really
looking for people that meet the three
P's and na this is a hiring strategy
I've used for performance engineers
which is you know passion persistence
perseverance and most importantly
analysis skills so you know people that
are statisticians like to look at
numbers you know they see the the blip
you know in a series of you know a
million numbers and ask what why why was
that one thing there so for performance
those are the people that I'm looking
for and you know generally for the whole
team around you know reliability and
test people that like to solve those
problems like I've mentioned that scale
but in particular always ask the
question you know why you know take the
system apart look for the parts of where
it fails tries to find the tools to make
the team go faster so this is the
engineering productivity side of the of
the SCT role at Google which is you know
how do we build the the code and the
systems that allow us to you know
deliver a new release a new you know
Google Cloud you know compute engine and
App Engine a week after week after week
you know delivering a new kernel every
week I don't I don't know if anybody in
the industry that really you know does
that as regularly as as we have been
doing and say compute engine or you know
new databases regularly and so forth and
so it takes people really thinking about
how to make that go faster and then
putting in place you know the sets of
tools that allow us to do that
withstanding the the in I want to drive
war but we have a very constraining
amount of time because the you know
again we need all of that with respect
to the projects we're building right now
Anthony s re with skills you're looking
for what makes Nasseri successful yeah
sure so we're looking for system
engineers and software engineers for the
systems engineers most people have a
computer science degree if you don't in
lieu of the degree three to four years
of relevant work experience is fine
we're looking for UNIX system
administrators people with scripting
experience in shell or in Python for our
software engineers we're looking for
fluency in C C++ Java and also
familiarity with with Python or shell
scripting also managing large scale
distributed systems is a great attribute
to have and network analysis IP
networking that's another it's also a
great experience to have and you also
have to be able to be on call
periodically thank you and Mark what
skills makes a good for a great to you
know somebody with great endeavor l for
starters we're looking for an awesome
tech writer here in Seattle to help us
document all the great things we're
doing with the Google cloud platform and
if you actually go if you're a great
tech writer and you're interested if you
go to google.com slash jobs and search
for Seattle writer you'll see the ad
that I'm referring to but more broadly
in developer relations we are looking
for good developers so first and
foremost in order to teach developers
how to how to use our stuff really well
we like to have great developers so we
look for people who do a lot of kind of
take a lot of initiative with their own
projects like people who maybe are doing
some things in open source or on github
or whatnot we're also very interested in
people with a bit of diversity and their
programming skills so modern scripting
language like Python or Ruby along with
a little bit more of classic language
familiarity Java C C++ that kind of
stuff as well as web programming because
that's obviously a big factor in what we
do
Communications is really important for
developer relations people so we look
for people with good writing and
speaking skills we look for passion
people who love to find out about the
latest stuff and have a drive to share
it with other people get excited about
that kind of thing and we're looking for
also people who are continuous learners
because the one thing about this
environment is it's very fast-moving
there's always new things coming out all
the time and so people who who thrive in
that environment of learning new skills
and finding out what's what's the latest
stuff mastering it and helping others
learn how to use it is a great great
asset standard so with that I'd like to
go to the Dory and pull up a few
questions from there from and what was
that case you get the first during
question Tony what is the best thing of
working out for Google where do you
think there is some room for improvement
um so in terms of the you know the best
things about working at Google I think
it actually starts here which is all the
teamwork you know we can't build
products without everybody here and so I
want to thank you know everybody so you
know Ruben Don Anthony mark thank you
for all your efforts I could give a list
of many reasons why we wouldn't be
successful with every without each of
these people the second thing I like is
self-critical we're very self-critical
in terms of if you look at the ten
things you know we know to hold true
there's one in there that we always look
at which is great is only the starting
point and that's really true we always
look at ok this is great and then the
next section you know the next
conversation is always like how do we
take it you know further and then the
one though that really I think is the
most important especially you know in
some of the roles that we all play is
there's no blame at Google um and this
is really important I've worked at you
know places in the past where when
something goes wrong the first question
that's asked is well who did it
I've never heard that at Google I always
hear the first thing is what happened
and how can we do it better and I hold
that you know very near and dear to the
you know my psychology and how we
or how could we do it better I think
everything we I've said we could all do
better like you know there I don't
there's one thing we are self-critical
and so you know when you look at what
would we do better everything but that
doesn't mean that it isn't already great
thank you
this one's to mark how does Google
evaluate candidates what did Google
critters look for in an application it's
kind of similar to the skill sets that I
described earlier so active soft for
developer relations it's it's a lot
quite aligned with what I what I covered
the looking for active software
developers people who are familiar with
programming languages and experienced in
in developing applications good
communication skills passion and and
adaptability and learning working well
with people and teaching skills
excellent this one comes from my should
those last two came from London this one
comes from Wollongong Australia and this
one's going to Don I know that Google is
data-driven metrics to use and user
experience in design and how you control
for self selection in your data sample
so I'll just the second question first
so the way we control for self selection
in our data samples we basically have a
large team in Mountain View that does
our participant recruiting and they're a
mix of researchers recruiters and
software engineers who have built a very
large participant database so we
actually have lots of people in there to
draw from and we've worked with Mark's
team and other teams here to identify
areas where we can source participants
and build up a developer part of that
participant database so that's how we do
self selection it is a it's a pretty
wide mix of people in there of all skill
sets and all all levels of experience
and as far as metrics we it really
depends we kind of have a philosophy at
Google and user experience that we
really want to know what our research
questions are and then pick the
appropriate methods and metrics to
address those research questions so each
is different each project has very
different needs and we we do a lot of
qualitative as well as quantitative of
metrics to answer the research questions
for the teams all right let's see this
one is OS re if that's re engineers
become a really expert in a particular
project are there opportunities for them
to move into regular software
engineering position related to that
project and this is straight for Anthony
yeah sure so this is one of the best
things about Google I think is the
opportunity to kind of move around
between products and positions and I'm
probably a good example of that I failed
three or four different positions here
and I think as long as you're able to do
the work you will have the opportunity
to transfer to whatever role you'd like
to do now with us there is a formal
transfer process where you will have to
interview for that role just like
getting hired again but it's it's it's
not just based on the interview process
it's also based on your past performance
so if you've been able to do the work
you'll definitely get the opportunity to
to go for it alright I think we have
time for one more question this one is a
computer I've always associated working
at Google with young smiling developers
what are the chances for medium aged
grumpy sysadmin
I can take that one if you like I
I'm a young smiling developer but I also
happen to be of medium age and I'm I'm
gonna avoid trying to define that turn
go into specifics but Google one of the
great things about Google is we're
looking for great people of any age and
so there's you know I have not
experienced any negative impact or
repercussions due to my age people here
really look at judge people by their
attitude and their ideas and you know
how they work
with other people and so this is a great
place to work for for people of any age
I would maybe not ring the grumpy I'm
not sure grumpy works well here but
medium age or an
other age google is a great place to
work and it is really a great team to
work with here III was a approached by
actually somebody straight out of
college and they asked me what's the
best thing you bring to Google and it
was I gonna bring you know bring your
energy and enthusiasm that's that's the
thing that will help you most here and
with that I'd like to say thank you
thank you all for participating this
hangout and for watching and if you're
