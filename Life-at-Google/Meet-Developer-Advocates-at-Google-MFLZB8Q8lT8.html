developer advocacy manager
my name is Josh Gordon I'm a developer
advocate developer advocate is
responsible for teaching developers how
to use a project and we understand what
the developer experience is so that we
can feedback both the product management
and to the engineer so we create
something that's genuinely useful my
day-to-day involves working with the
product team with the goal of making it
as easy to use as possible so we wear
many hats and some of hats we'll be
writing code will also travel around the
world giving workshops at conferences
will make videos write tutorials and
give talks we deal with people that want
to take our enormous infrastructure and
build something of their own probably
the best analogy is if I gave you a box
of 10,000 Legos each one does something
specific and like Legos they all work
together and it's up to you to create
maybe a niche in a marketplace or solves
the need that no one else knows about
and will help you do that developer
advocate is a great role if you have a
lot of experience doing software
engineering and you enjoy teaching it's
a great opportunity to build a personal
brand to get your name out there and to
speak in front of audiences worldwide
I've been fascinated by things that work
at scale but I also wanted to work for a
company that has integrity that is
looking after the end user not just to
make money and is aware of the
consequences of what they do I came to
work at Google because I decided I love
teaching more than research and I was
looking for jobs where I could actually
focus on teaching machine learning
Google to a large extent has been a
leader for with respect to sharing and
open source and deep learning frameworks
helping people learn this field is
really rewarding
I come to work every day with the
smartest people I have ever met I work
with product managers software engineers
other folks from developer relations
there's a hugely diverse group of people
that I work with they also have an
incredibly optimistic attitude it's
never about why we can't do something
it's I think we can do it let's figure
out how we are going to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
