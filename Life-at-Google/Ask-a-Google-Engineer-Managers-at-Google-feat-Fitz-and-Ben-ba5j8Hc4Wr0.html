you for another question to be answered
here at Google Chicago it is and my name
is Brian Fitzpatrick people call me Fitz
my name is ben collins-sussman that
people call me ben collins-sussman and
we're here at Google Chicago and we've
got another question on the G pad for
today and this question comes from the
Balthasar in Luxembourg and says do you
feel you are being well managed by your
superiors no next question do you feel
being well wait I'm trying what's what's
going on in that class do you feel
you're being well managed by your
superior I said no is because I don't
feel like I am managed by my superiors I
mean I don't think that that's a
traditional sense you were right but the
same is being ignored but yeah I think
you know it and what you said this goes
into a lot of the talk that we're giving
now but traditional sense of management
at a traditional company is somebody who
stands over you and barks orders and you
know tells you what to do right they
hold out the carrot or they hit you with
the stick what are the other carrot the
stick thing which is more of the sort of
a holdover from from Industrial
Revolution right you want people to work
more efficiently so you hold out carrots
and sticks and on the assembly line the
assembly stopping meat into a can or so
right right but as we've been talking
about in various places the the thing we
really want to do in management is
involve management into a way where it
where it sits for a creative role right
if you're if you were managing people
doing creative things like solving
engineering problems it's not about
carrot and sticks and barking orders
it's about helping them be productive
and so my question is do you feel like
your manager is helping you be
productive yes removing obstacles or she
is your manager staying out of your way
and they're protecting you from
bureaucracy if there's a bunch of things
that a good manager should do and I
think right my manager said well we have
the same manner no no we do at the scene
ever hi I'm Ben we're back with the
question oh we already have to quit what
would you say what was the question
again
so Esther dance to answer the rest of
the question really is that I think it's
the wrong question to ask for Google in
particular the question is
the question would probably be more like
are your managers helping you get your
job done are they serving you well right
I mean right management really should is
a service oriented and in role where
your goal you said remove obstacles make
sure that your people that reporting to
you're doing your your their career is
going in the right direction for them
right so you do want attention from your
manager in terms of you know are you
productive are you happy right are you
on the career track you want but you
don't want them in your face every day
and that's certainly nothing wrong at
all right this is a place where they
really expect you to be self driven and
self motivated so that if if you are the
kind of person who expects to be given
orders every single day and you put on
your blinders and do exactly what you're
told it's gonna be hard to get along
right right if you when you were
expected when you get here they treat
you like an adult they say here you are
here are your responsibilities see you
later right and either you get your work
done or you don't and if you don't
there's you know no one's gonna come and
say stand over your desk every day and
say are you done yet or you don't like
right you don't get your work done that
is probable time for it micromanagement
doesn't scale basically it doesn't you
have to hire people that know what needs
to be done and can figure things out on
their own enough of a go-getter to go
out and write and get the next thing
that needs to be done so I drew my first
six months here my manager literally did
not say two words to me he said one and
it was hi and he shook my hand and that
was the last time I saw him for six
months yeah but that's a that's the
dream an exception in today's but I was
I said in the team to work with you yeah
and still productive we knew I wanted to
do and we got it done and we knew we we
had I had him there if I needed to get
something but I we had a we had our own
mentor to ask for questions we had other
folks on our team to go to and so you
sort of worked you just work things out
and you make things happen I think I
think for that reason it's it can be a
little bit scary right it's it's a place
that gives you tremendous trust right
these sub default assumption when you
work here is you're a generalist you can
work on any problem and we trust you to
be productive and in that sense there's
no red tape there's nothing getting in
your way
and
it's fantastic to have that kind of
freedom and that kind of trust right it
feels really empowering at the same time
it's also kind of intimidating because
if you if you fail you have no one to
blame but yourself right what's and
that's okay you know but you just need
to own up to your mistakes it's like
that's nice Carrie did that thing my
grandfather used to write on every the
top of every letter he sent me when I
was in college was freedom equals
responsibility right you're given a
tremendous amount of freedom but it
means you have a lot of responsibility
so what's up if something goes wrong or
it's a did you just don't get any work
that you can't say well he didn't let me
do anything or some bureaucracy got in
my way is right or my manager wouldn't
let me do it it's an excuse I mean and
there are again extreme cases where this
might happen somewhere are not my norm
it's rarely the normal so yeah I think
the management culture here is pretty
cool actually I really it's part of the
overall culture of responsibility and
Trust well I think if it wasn't like
this neither one of us would have wanted
to move into engineering management here
right because who wants to who wants to
sit all there and check if you've done
your work yet and I mean if I did that I
would wring somebody's mother we're
gonna take care right exactly so but
yeah this there isn't there is not a lot
of management at Google here it's a very
thin management layer but in engineering
I mean I don't know but sit I don't know
about sales yeah but an engineering I
mean it is acknowledged that some
management is needed but they're there
it's clear that there's a wariness not
to create too much right right it's
really like we said earlier it's a very
wide flat distributed engineering team
minutes
there isn't a lot of command and control
at all agree yep all right good
thanks a lot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
