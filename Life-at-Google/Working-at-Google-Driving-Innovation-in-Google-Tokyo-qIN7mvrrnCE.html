turning in from a pack good afternoon
for those of you out west a very good
evening to you I'm joined here today by
some of our fearless engineering leaders
here based out of our Tokyo Japan office
and today we'd like to give you a
basically a snapshot of some of the
exciting engineering projects that we've
got going on there worked on here in
Tokyo I really is highlight the scale
and diversity of product initiatives
that are driven from teams and groups
around the world now for folks of you
that might have questions as you're
going along this is an interactive
session so feel free to use this hashtag
Japan HOA ok and let's get started so
how about we start off with a round of
introductions if you let us know who you
are and how you got to Google I could
start my name is Chris yerga
I am the engineering director for the
Google Play team which means I'm
responsible for all the engineering
activity for Google Play across music
books movies in the store all that stuff
I also have the privilege of serving
currently as the engineering site lead
for the Tokyo office here which isn't
about shipping products so much as it is
about making sure that this is a healthy
environment for engineers career
development morale and all that sort of
stuff in terms of how I got to Google I
you know over the 20-some odd years I've
been in this industry I spent most of
that time working on embedded devices
whether they're set-top boxes or mobile
phones or you know video game consoles
and things like that
and I but a few years ago when you know
web services took off I became really
interested in the combination of devices
in the web and I thought there couldn't
be any better place in the world to do
that but Google with you know Android
and all the other great web services so
that's what brought me here and turn it
over to you yeah I'm my name is Jimmy
and I'm really glad Chris disjoined as a
Sai lead for Tokyo so welcome and it's
already been contributing a lot to the
site health
we just introduce myself a little bit
and my background so I've been with
Google for more than eight years started
from amount of your office and moved to
Tokyo about five years ago started as
the engineer at Google and gradually
moving towards tech lead role and
recently I started working on Google
Maps for Japan it's like who Maps for
Mobile in Japan and leading that efforts
as an engineering manager prior to
coming to Google I worked on various
things including a startup in Silicon
Valley and moving towards Google it's
probably sort of a natural thing and in
Silicon Valley you move around quite a
bit when I was laid off from my previous
company when it company folded so I was
looking and Google clearly became one of
the best choice and as my roommates I
was actually working at Google at the
time so and I was really excited to join
Japan actually when five years ago the
office who had only 20 engineers so it
really felt like a startup all over
again I really appreciate that
opportunity to do something I really
enjoy doing them hello what you can all
right I'm Kent decussate oh by the way
guys the there's a hashtag that we just
talked about for those of us job taking
late
it's a hashtag Google Japan h o EI h OE
for hangouts on air it's just all one
more there we're watching old you know
Twitter G+ real-time here in the string
actually so prefer energetic questions
are comments we all use our discretion
to respond to any of those that are
interesting so let's just get going so
okay my name is Kent have to say I'm
product manager and working on search
products I jump in
I'm eating about 10 years now seems like
still two years but it's been ten years
now already
mostl product that we work with some
Google products so it's called eight
products and also Japan specific
products to to win the hearts of
Japanese users here I've been in valley
since 92 actually know of the three
startup companies before joining Google
in the valley
many of you
- but you know dot-com went great and
went bust my before joining Google I got
laid off my my job and but I still have
the startup culture I'd like a small
company walking nimbly making great
things but I was kind of tired or
startup cost you off table because you
know do I get paid tomorrow you know
it's a chronic Markus Creek that's
actually appropriate so I want to walk a
company that has momentum but steals
things like a startup company and was
basically wanted to have a cake in 82
around the 2003 there was really like
handful if not one or two companies in
the valley and a Google was of one of
them just to basically mesmerize like
the first interview I joined it back
then and I mean cook just since last 4
years of sale and that's sort of a path
of my career you thanks guys all right
well you know now that we're all
familiar with who you are and how you
got here let's talk a little bit more
about some of the projects some of the
current engineering activities that have
been going on in the past they working
on now anything you'd like to
specifically highlight about what's
going on in Japan
yeah sure so I can get started so as I
mentioned earlier I was leading the
German which is Google mobile Maps
project in Japan and we started that
doubling this investment in this area
last year so doubling engineers resource
doubling UX and p.m. product manager as
well on this area we wanted to revamp
this experience using Google Maps on
mobile many of you if you use iPhone you
notice that we have launched Google Maps
on iPhone last year it was a lot of team
effort across Pacific we have a team in
Tokyo working closely with Mountain View
headquarters
contributed directly towards this Prada
Monch which I was personally very proud
of we pulled it off yeah half the team
is here and so we give a big shout out
to the team where it was launched we
felt the product cannot be better won
without international experience
without having diverse backgrounds where
Tokyo has much more density than
Mountain View or anywhere else in the
world today
what's the important note about Google
in Japan or Google in any country is not
that we work on a product for the
particular market or users Google as an
enduring organization works very
organically across the world so a lot of
people I'd say put like 85% of people
here actually welcome products including
Google Maps our locks also I'd like to
add that you know do you guys did this
the indoor maps right now it's launched
to the US and Japan and a handful
European countries I think laying out
the maps of indoor structures for those
who been to tell you I haven't seen
Tokyo we are full of really complex
underground three-dimensional structure
like even our building we get lost and
I've been here three months I'm still
getting live so we do really well
outdoors developing transits actually a
lot of the work is also done in Japan
public transit system and going from the
last mile we we understand it's going
indoors so last year we launched in
North Maps and it's been given a lot of
attention to users who want to enjoy not
only outdoor directions space but indoor
terminals
who deep in department stores subway
stations it's pretty cool stuff it's
super impressive and it's someone who
just moved to Japan like Google Mobile
Maps is like my lifeline right and I use
it all the time that's great thank you
you're on the subway and you can
actually see I need to go out on this
exit from where I am really impressed I
didn't also want to follow up on a point
Ken made about Google being like really
a global company for engineering in
terms of their products I worked at a
variety of companies large and small in
my career and many times it's like all
that you know interesting stuff happens
in company headquarters and the
satellite offices are localization or
sales or things like that but I was
really staggered
two and a half years ago when I when I
came to Google at how not only
how much you know really important work
is done in all the offices much like the
stuff that we just talked about but also
um how it's part of the culture like
every meeting you go to there's video
conferencing because you know there's
people like spanning the globe and I
think Google does a better job than that
than in any place I've worked in travel
yeah any given time there's somebody
from some other offices in office and
it's I think they're one of the real
weeks we have us actually in same office
so it's so funny I travel to Mountain
View pretty frequently and the last two
times I've been there I run into people
from the Tokyo office just randomly in
the cafeteria because people are always
going back yeah but both the video
conference and also face to face
communication is highly valued and so I
think we want to highlight both of those
at Google it's very very encouraged to
collaborate with other offices and make
a global product so I mean you know geo
is definitely a big big area coming out
of Japan any other is you wanna
highlight sir so the office has a huge
team of chrome as well we don't have a
representative here today but Google
Chrome that is the browser in chrome OS
again this team does a lot of standards
work on html5 CSS and and they really
sort of pushed for that web components
work people in coach actually worked on
quite a bit it was announced in not a
Google i/o few weeks ago so we have to
see it so the teams are really pushing
the frontier of the web and HTML and
with the engineers who work in Tokyo
office many of them are Japanese
engineers that's another example of how
the team here I can actually make an
impact in global is a number one browser
in the world I think that and I think
the important bit about the the web
components work we're doing here is that
you know it's fundamental platform work
but it's endeavoring to basically bring
a level of interactivity to web apps
comparable to what you're used to with
native apps and so I think you know in
terms of impact like you were saying
it's hard to imagine something with you
know more impact than building the
fundamental platform of the future of
the web that everybody uses every day
yeah I got an audience question down
that somebody's asking me I know it
about 200 words of Japanese would love
to come to Google Tokyo office to gain
fluency is this okay how many was the
deputy so let's see I knew
konbanwa and konichiwa when I got here
and that was about it so actually I was
very surprised at the pretty much
everyone here has a pretty good level of
English fluency and it stands to reason
you know as we discussed our global
company were in engineering we're
constantly working with people in the
United States and in other regions so
you know English is sort of the the
language of that happens and
and that's the story of how I crashed it
even Halen's Ferrari so pretty
entertaining
thanks guys sorry for technical
difficulties they were back on air now I
think we kind of got cut off at the
stage of just introducing everyone who
finished for those of you that might not
have got a area of Kentuck stay here
director of research team here in Japan
she may Chi who's leading the geo
initiatives for Japan as well and Chris
yerga who service spots with Google Play
globally as well as the health and
safety and well-being of the Google
Japan office we were kicking off some
talks about some of the projects
highlighting some of the different
engineering initiatives right now that
have been worked on how to Japan office
so well well we'll start again by going
through and if you like that yeah sure
yeah start by talking about Google Maps
on mobile so I've joined team of last
year and we double really to put the
efforts in investing Google Maps on
mobile we now invest to two areas one is
the iOS platform as well as the Android
platform for those of you who use iPhone
you notice that we launched our Google
Maps on the iPhone with a new user
interface and new design last year and
of last year was a big team effort but
collaboration between the office here we
have half of the engineering team in
Tokyo collaborating with offices in
Seattle in Mountain View so I was really
proud of this efforts we pulled it off
the with great great team morale so I
wanted to talk about this as an example
I was a huge product success and one
that you know a lot of the engineering
is happening right here in the in the
Tokyo office um one of the things that
struck me when I came to Google a couple
years ago was that unlike other
companies I've worked at where pretty
much all the interesting stuff happens
in headquarters Google engineering is
really distributed and so really you
know critical projects like GMM happen
in places like Japan or Zurich or all
over the world yeah half the team is
here yeah the cool thing I think Oh
so we started you a long time ago at
CERN in Japan more than five years ago
so I think ken has a lot of history I
started out building Google Maps for
Japanese DoCoMo mobile phones the
history of it they moved on to what we
call indoor maps for those who are in
the US or Japan or some parts of Europe
we actually have a map of the indoor
buildings and that was inspired by the
fact that we have such a complex
structure in Tokyo and anybody around
the world Google was basically there's a
great test bed so I still remember the
one big summit we had in Tokyo people
from all the world came over sorry the
building structures and so really got
the product idea inspired and may we
decide to launch it international scale
from that point on now you guys own you
know big chunk of the iOS now and I
think we just announced Android version
of it - yeah we're announcing I at
Google i/o this year that will launch
the new Android app as well as the iOS
app on both both phones and tablets this
summer so stay tuned on this new
development and I also want to call the
difference between Japan versus in
Mountain View there's kind of cultural
difference of the we're sort of
first-hand experience of a much denser
city and it's a metropolitan city
so in all aspects you have to experience
it first and then do the product
developments and I feel for product
that's meant for global audience you
have to have engineers around the whole
world to develop that that's an
excellent point someone so I actually
just moved to Tokyo three months ago and
as someone who's new to the city it's a
completely unfamiliar city to me but
also the logic if you even want to use
that word of how addresses are laid out
in this city is incredibly puzzling so
you know Google Google Maps is something
that I use constantly and so it's it's
always pretty awesome like something
that's so hugely impactful not just to
people all around the world but and I
would not have appreciated the value of
some of the feet
like transit directions are really
awesome for finding your way around on
subways and stuff if I hadn't spent time
here so I think it's an excellent point
and as I was saying earlier a lot of
products in projects here actually not
just Japan specific I'd say problem 80
to 85% of people working on global
products including Japan and the you
know Google Maps example in their
projects like indoor maps or even a
search where we get inspiration from
high density high population use cases
challenging languages and it's trying to
expand that globally and those a bunch
of projects I was talking also about the
chrome projects here by the way back
fairly sizable number of engineers
working on pushing html5 standard I
think we announced web components back
in our Google i/o I think it's a big
chunk of people worked on this here and
you know it's a browser that is actually
spread across the world I've met people
in Tokyo and people all over the world
because you know it's really a open
source project to thank contributor the
product that actually impacts the
internet usage around the world and
that's part of the things that that we
get the people motivate and excited in
the US office as well yeah so why don't
we also just promote our hashtag here to
people want to get in on the
conversation or ask questions this
remarkable sense of deja vu oops let me
already got a question coming in here on
the left hand side calor John so I'm a
syringe a software engineer and I know
about 200 words of Japanese would love
to come to Tokyo Japan game fluency
there is that okay so Chris how many was
the Japanese did you know image so
that's approximately a hundred and
ninety eight words more than I knew when
I came here so one of the things that
was a pleasant surprise to me I was
concerned about this as well when I came
here is how everyone here in engineering
has you know pretty good fluency in
English I'd stands to reason because as
we described you know Google's really
global we're always collaborating with
folks in the United States and Europe
etc so English is kind of the common
language that most of that is done in
but to kind of hint take the second part
of your question to sin
coming here I've actually picked up
quite a bit of Japanese and it's it's
actually uh I wouldn't say it's strictly
required for the job but it certainly
you know makes it easier and it's a heck
of a fun thing to do have you reached
200 yeah uh I actually just checked last
night I am up to 327 kanji awesome which
puts me almost at the second grade level
that's right
excellent you can read the kids the kids
picture books and a few yeah I've got my
Pokemon books as we can see this is
pretty representative of how to compose
it helps to know the language it really
helps that you're interested in learning
language but it's not a critical part of
the job hmm awesome
I'd like to kind of move for
conversation a bit away from the
specific project this time let's talk a
bit a little bit more about leadership
so energy management in general what
would you you know what recommendations
would you give to folks who are
interested in you know sort of moving
into the tech lead space range
management or even just kind of you know
pursuing an opportunity to the
engineering you know that drives a
project you know here are generally in
Google and even here in Japan I think so
when you talk about a tech leave there's
kind of two fundamental things you need
there that are right turn the name right
technical smarts which i think is a
given and most people like who come to
Google or even applying to Google have
you know some level of technical
competency they know how to grow that I
think the part that's a little less
obvious is the leadership part and I was
given some great advice at the beginning
my career that I give to folks now which
is anyone can demonstrate leadership in
an existing role you don't need to wait
to be tapped on the shoulder to say hey
now you're the leader of the team to be
you know sharing your ideas and
influencing things and I think that's
especially true at Google where it's
very much a meritocracy more so than
other places I've worked you know you're
successful based on the results you
deliver and the strength of your ideas
and so I've actually hired people
goes for not just people new in their
career but even seasoned you know
professionals I've had folks who you
know managed hundred-person teams that
came to Google and actually started off
as an individual engineer and wanted to
because you know they wanted to kind of
build that credibility and you know
demonstrate you're the leader and then
when that happens usually then it's just
an obvious thing oh yeah you should be
the technical lead yeah iWhat also
really agreed that at Google it's very
important to have this technical site
and also the leadership size so you
capture both the essential piece to
become a tech lead or manager role and
often I see successful cases is where
someone start as individual but again
prove to everyone else that they they
know how to lead and everyone respect
their leadership and they naturally
become the tech leads other cases I also
really encourage individuals to think
about leadership is not about having the
role of tech lead but also you can
demonstrate your leadership even as an
individual contributor so leadership is
about how you can convince people that
you can do the job and you can
single-handedly handle the job and
deliver results so that's also
leadership at the individual level I
think both are very highly appreciated
at Google so whether your manager or
individual contributor on leadership is
a critical piece to the success at
Google I think you guys said it there's
an audio audience question popped up
higher brainstorm of the innovation for
Googleplex do you just just a product to
see how to make it better that's a big
part of it too right but uh you know a
lot of product needs come from our own
experiences you know I still remember
the day the gmail came out that we are
dealing with client software every week
somebody sent me mail said hi my
laptop's laughter combusted send me
something in the next last few hours
can you seen it again so it was a big
pain point of you know how to actually
make the experience more smooth how to
make it happen a web but still make it
act like a sort of client software
really snappy speed and that's how you
know Gmail came out so with the company
of this size we are probably the most
critical users of services
but at the same time we learn from other
people like like that part of the reason
we are here is we pick up the knees from
the market you know market means that
are not often found in in all suburban
California let's say so that's what heck
water is highly / and highly densely
populated so and that's that the knees
we hear from users you guys speak up a
lot to us for me long something if you
screw up you as a variable about it and
that's how we learn we do brainstorm too
but by the time we started brainstorm
there are so many problems or so
opportunities that are available to us
it's really a matter of what to pick
rather than yeah there's always a full
docket of stuff to do but I think
there's a there's a important nuance
that might not be obvious from that too
which is that a lot of people actually
have input during those brainstorming
times when it actually happens you know
I've had cases where new hires to my
team within like a couple months come up
with some new idea it might be a small
thing but are able to get into the
product and use by hundreds of millions
of people pretty quickly so I think
that's another nice thing is that you're
not just kind of doing what someone else
tells you like we value people who have
a point of view in an opinion and want
to share their ideas yeah and go has a
really grassroots approach to ideas
product design so a lot of times we have
this demo days where you really feel
free to develop a demo or a prototype of
your idea and then we get together and
evaluate from all these ideas come up
with individual engineers there's some
thing click is it a real good product
and oftentimes we pick top ideas and
then immediately put that into a product
so this is very different from other
companies where it's top-down where we
do a lot more grassroot approach
bottom-up approach thinking about ideas
to develop but also I want to mention
that lots of I our ideas become good
ideas when they are applicable to
millions of users and said instead of
interesting yeah yeah
is that your yeah can a scale can it go
support more than just a couple hundred
users I found in uterus we care about
millions here
yeah it's and for most of the engineers
I know like one of the things that
motivates them the most is knowing that
they're having impact there's lots of
folks using their products and I've
never experienced anything quite like in
Google Play whenever we release a new
version of the Play Store we usually
roll it out kind of slowly so just a few
people get it but it doesn't matter like
what time of day or when usually within
minutes or you know an hour or so at
most someone's found it torn it down
posted a blog post about all the new
feet is so cool to be working on things
if people are not only used but are so
passionate about fantastic so they have
a couple minutes left here we were at a
tacking couple more on because we lost a
little bit of time in the middle but you
know how would you if you could describe
it in a nutshell it sounds like from
what you've mentioned so far you know
it's very ubiquitous as far as the
engineering culture the products the way
they get worked on the brainstorming the
sharing of this development across the
different offices around you know the
organization but it's Japan right and
you know how is the culture here in the
office different is it different is it
exactly the same the folks that would
wonder if that's going to be you know
different to working at Google in
Mountain View or in Zurich I mean
what-what would you have to say about
that and for Chris you particularly you
just moved here so your impressions are
pretty um yeah I'm actually super
interested to hear their perspective
because I'm sure it's different from
mine for me it's been a remarkable
combination of feeling very foreign and
incredibly comfortable at the same time
so you know things about the city and
the language and the culture obviously
are very different you know from being
in California but at the same time the
engineers here have the same kind of
qualities as the engineers that I was
working with in California like people
are passionate they've got great ideas
they're very opinionated right and you
know all those sorts of things you know
feel very very comfortable but layered
on top of that is sort of the
sort of Japanese way of doing things
right you know very giving and
personable and I mean as a newcomer I've
really benefited from how welcoming
people have been yeah I think culturally
definitely it's different a Japanese
culture is pretty obvious in the company
but I think we have also the very strong
Google engineering culture that that can
be identified so clearly in Japan office
the same way we have everywhere else in
the world so the the kind of engineering
culture I don't think that's anything
different and I'm not really surprised
we're able to get to that because Japan
in general it's more on the effort but
Google we focus on results and this
result driven approach is really obvious
in the in this office as well yeah it's
really part of that the way that we
collaborate it's a gigantic engineering
firm position spans across the wards we
are by definition we be sort of at the
stand at the same level one of the
questions just came out was like you
know is is Google say he's a giant
classroom where every co-worker is like
your teacher I agree you know when I you
come to Google four years ago I thought
oh good look there's a new our office
small office talent pool is different I
have to spread the culture right that's
why I came in I do some of that too but
like I learn a lot for people who are
hired here and grew up here in Boyer I
mean I'm 44 years old already I work
with people who are 20s they teach me a
lot I enjoy in principles management
principles I approach product hyperox
users it's a it is a classroom I just
don't stop learning being here no matter
which are wonderful well guys we're just
not running out of time so on a wrap-up
now I want to thank everyone here for
for joining us this afternoon thank you
all for tuning in if you're interested
in learning more about opportunities
with us here in Google in the Japan
office please go ahead and click through
the link on the G+ page life at Google
you'll see a link there to some of the
current opportunities and a bunch more
resources that you can click through
again thanks very much and we'll catch
you next time and let us know the
feedback through the hashtag do we
actually
that stuff so yeah it's the first time
we've done it it's actual first attempt
love to hear from you because I can't
see you how you felt about it what did
you want to learn more about it sorry
about the music for the technical and
even if you're watching this recorded
afterwards that's we just continue to
use the hashtag we're monitoring we're
monitoring this and it's where it makes
them more interactive oh yeah thanks
