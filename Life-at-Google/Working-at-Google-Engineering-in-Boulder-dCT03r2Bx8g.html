you a little description of Google
Boulder what it's like to work here
perspective from software engineers the
four of us will will be going through
the sessions
first of all we'll give you a little
overview of Google Boulder the office we
have over 250 people most of them are
software engineers we work on a set of
projects and it's a nice diverse mix of
projects we have a Geo team that's
geographic systems so think Google Earth
and Google Maps is a primary customer
facing output we happen to work on
metadata about three day 3d user
communities with respect to making
Google Groups better and a whole myriad
of other geo efforts we have a project
Google Drive and masca me describing
that in more detail but online
collaboration essentially moving your
files to the cloud and working with any
device you want we have a Google map
project that's a really cool effort
where Google essentially pushes
information to people about hey Scott
you need to leave for your denver
appointment in the next 15 minutes
because you're you're like it's a big
idea and a big project and Google has
Boulder has a effort in that we have
payments team and the payments team
works on a myriad of projects which
Kelly's going to describe in a little
bit more detail if you're not familiar
with Boulder Boulder is a college town
and it's a very livable college town
yeah we have a lot of snow we don't have
as cold weather as you might think
that's where you're from if you're from
San Diego we have some cold weather but
if you're from most of the country it's
actually the average high in January is
48 to 50 degrees so it's a moderate
Mountain climate
we're not far from Denver so there's
plenty of activities and generally
speaking
you know I've worked here seven years
and I've really never heard anybody say
hey it was a bad deal moving to Boulder
Colorado so it's a it's a very nice
place to live we have actually a
cross-section of people I said mostly
software engineers but we have sales
marketing product management UX a whole
cross-section of folks in our office the
relationship of Google corporate and
Google other offices Google headquarters
is in Mountain View as you may know and
it's about half the company we have a
whole set of engineering offices around
35 of them boulders I think eight
largest in that in that 35 last time I
looked and we collaborate as peers we
work together
typically with one or two other offices
we do a lot of video conferencing so not
now I'm going to switch gears and pass
the baton to Kelly who is working in
payment and we do a lot of work with
actually making payment processing work
one of the main platforms that we
support is Adwords so every time you're
setting up billing with AdWords that's
running through our platform and more
responsible for making sure that you're
not only happy but your ads keep serving
another place that you may have run into
us is actually the Play Store so if
you're making an app purchase on the
phone through Play some of those
payments will eventually go through our
pipelines as well we definitely tackle
some big problems and one of our big
efforts in our office is actually to
bring some of those payment options to
local entities so making so reducing the
barrier of entry for people around the
world which is a big effort for a lot of
people I've been working with the
payments team for about two years and
it's been a great project and I've
learned a ton
myself hey I'm Mike Cobra so I'm a
software engineer I'm on Google now it
launched last year at Google i/o and it
consistently surprises me and delights
me with all the cards that pops up I've
been the software engineer for about two
years of Google like Kelly and it's
great to be here I guess that leaves me
I'm Matthew Seidel I work in the area we
call Google Apps the most of the people
we have in this office work on the part
of apps called Google Drive if you've
ever moved your clouds to our store move
your files to our cloud storage or done
some photo uploading or use the editors
like spreadsheet or a word processor
that's all backed by the Google Drive
and worked on by the people here ok so
we have a couple more topics to go
through and then we're gonna jump into
some Q&amp;amp;A questions that have been posted
by folks dialed in so one of the
questions or one of the topics is how
teams are structured and and that really
depends on the genesis of the projects
so in the case of Mike's project Google
now it started as a 20% project that's
actually you know in a statistical basis
relatively unusual to have a project go
from a 20% project to a fully staff
project
Mike's projects is organized with a
lead-in in Mountain View and it spans
both Boulder and Mountain View in its
operation in Google Drive we're spanning
across a couple different locations the
director of that effort is here in
Boulder and we work with another peer
team and payments is a project that
spans across three locations and we have
I happen to manage the payments crew
here in Boulder
more generally we are very flat
structured with what that means is we
have a lot of individual contributors
and very few managers and fundamentally
the engineers are figuring out certainly
how we should do things in in many cases
advocating what we should do
prioritizing it so we don't receive a
fully vetted products back and then go
build something we collaborate that
brings up a point that we work in the
office so we're not a virtual working
group unlike some technology companies
we develop software here in the office
that doesn't mean that someone can't
work from home when their kid has a
baseball game or something like that but
by and large we're a work from the
office kind of crew collaboration is
important anybody want to jump in add
some color to that I've actually always
been very impressed by the cross team
I've definitely been in conferences
where there's people signing on from
around the world and it makes you
realize just how global of a presence we
are and I think it's a really unique
situation I've also had people jump in
from other teams and help me solve
issues that were very time-sensitive so
I'm always extremely impressed by
everyone's just consideration and an
ability to jump in and help out you need
all hands like that and I'll add that
travel is encouraged I really like the
boulder office care but each Google
office has a real unique spirit and
Scott mentioned several sites that our
projects collaborate with and we
definitely like to go and meet all our
teammates in person I know for my team
we have people spread across Mountain
View New York Zurich Dublin and we up
Seattle and frequently people go you
know do a European tour and spend a week
in one office in a week in another
office while they collaborate with those
people and teach classes and and sort of
keep everybody moving along the same
route one of the topics we'd like to
cover briefly is internal mobility and
so Mike's gonna covered that's right
yeah
transfer to Google now just with him
last month and so I'm I'm brand new and
and wall in a site like Boulder where we
have so many great projects to work on
it's encouraged to to transfer and the
process was really smooth for me I had
had many hallway conversations with with
the Google map team and I've always been
asking them questions about how the
product worked and when the time came
for me to transfer is really easy
process and so if you're interested in
any or all of the projects here in
Boulder I should know that that
transfers as possible and encouraged ya
not give you a little color on the
transfer process fundamentally you you
need to work in a project for at least a
year your your current project and then
essentially the process is if if the
team that you are transferring to the
prospective transferring team is
interested in having you you're gonna
transfer if they have headcount and
they're interested so in a lot of
companies your current team can kind of
block your mobility because you're
producing a lot and it would be
disruptive if you left at Google the
conversation shifts to well how are we
going to transition this so that's
basically that the difference between
Google and several other companies and
in that way at least ones I've worked
for next topic is what we're looking for
in applicants that you want to but
basically what we're looking for in
applicants are people who are passionate
about computer science and about
software and about making the world a
better place and hopefully are good at
least one of those things we're
definitely not looking for people who
only have Ivy League you know super top
school education I know I don't we're
not looking for people who only have
degrees we have plenty of people here
with bachelor's degrees or even no
degrees what we're looking for people
who have a track record if possible of
doing good work although we do plenty
interviewed plenty of new grads and
we're happy to do that we're not looking
for only senior
but we do want you know your resume to
show that you're passionate about what
we're doing and that you have you know
sort of previous skill in doing it
whether that's class projects whether
that's open source whether that's
previous work experience all of that
looks really great right so there aren't
rigid prerequisites and the the most
difficult thing is to do well in the
interview the few sharp and you engage
and you answer the questions so it isn't
a function of which school you want to
and some prerequisite rigid framework
yeah and that definitely you know the
once you get in and doing the interview
that's a big part of what we decide on
so we have a question here and let's
have Kelly address it but what's what
does an average day of a boulder office
employee look like well I guess the only
point interview I can answer that from
this my own but I consider myself
extremely privileged I get up a roughly
around eight o'clock in the morning I
can walk to work as long as it's not
sprinkling which is really nice again to
the office there's normally a hot
breakfast which is also delicious if not
there's plenty of snacks and the micro
kitchens all the coffee I want which is
essential and then I normally sit down
and handle email for the first half hour
or 40 minutes and just process through
what happened there's as we've mentioned
there's offices around the world pretty
Google so the word keeps going even when
you've left the office and typically
when we get in there's a lot to catch up
on um the first meeting I have is at
10:30 we do a team stand up which is
perfect so if I'm running late or having
trouble get out of that I can get in by
10:30 and everything's okay the team
stand-ups are really great everybody
says what they're working on and and
lets me know if they're stuck on any
problems which is great for the
cooperation aspect we get a lot of
things solved and stand-up and it keeps
the the group kind of together which is
really nice after stand-ups I'll go and
I'll start coding typically I'm actually
responsible for a lot of customer facing
issue
so I handle a lot of that stuff I tend
to go to lunch around 12:30 or 1:00 it's
open from 11:30 to 1:30 so there's
plenty of time to get in there we have a
amazing kitchen staff they actually do a
buffet entree and then a chef's exhibit
entree unless it's something that I do
not like I always go for this chef
it's fantastic and they make it right in
front of you it is fantastic
we also have a really nice outside
seating area so I love to sit outside
and eat lunch
we have cafeteria style seating so
everybody gets to know each other I've
met everyone in this hangout before and
had lunch with them so that's really
fantastic yeah there's no one of the
things that we've tried to do is at the
boulder office is not allow silos to be
created and I think we've done a really
good job that and one of the places that
go Silas get knocked down is that with
the lunchroom and then I head back to
work I do some more coding my just to
give everybody an idea my meeting
average is actually really low I
typically only go to about 3 hours in
meetings a week excluding stand-up which
is really great my managers have done a
really good job of making sure that if
I'm in a meeting I need to be there and
we have the freedom to say like do you
really need me in this meeting like I
have stuff to get done so that's really
great
at about 3 p.m. I tend to take a break
for some ice cream you have a nice
spring fridge and they keep their really
well stuff and then I normally work till
about 6:00 p.m. and try to get as much
done as I can
I actually am pretty productive in the
afternoons things tend to buy down a
little bit and the meetings tend to stop
after about 2:00 or 3:00 and it's great
I there's we actually got a new walking
desk which is fantastic and I tried it
and that's been really great so I can do
some email and walk and it keeps my
blood flowing I actually really like to
try it but it's it's fantastic I try to
get as much done as possible and then I
I guess whenever I get blocked I think
one of the big things I do is get out of
my chair and go awesome girl so yeah I
think that's pretty much my typical day
a lot of eating and
a lot of coding right thanks Kelly so
another question we have from from the
audience's what is it that one must have
to succeed in gaining employment at
Google Boulder office and then there's
parenthetically a list of ten years of
IT experience masters and MBA a
certifications Wall Street Nassau
educational backgrounds so Matt alluded
to this really what we want is people
who are engaged that want to solve our
problems that have demonstrated ability
as with respect to code analytic skills
data structures that have good
communication skills that are
collaborative as far as the pedigree to
kind of get to the point where you're
interviewed there has to be something
that stands out we get a lot of resumes
it could be open source work it could be
you did a great job at school it could
be an interesting startup where where
you made a difference and so some signal
like that demonstrated success in some
area we definitely venture into the math
physics type background if someone shows
an aptitude toward programming we have
less research than you might think basic
research so unlike some companies we do
a lot of practical application
development we have one area of the
company which does pure pure research
and that's not in Boulder so so we're
pretty focused on things that are going
to be used by people in the next couple
years so that gives you a little
background on on the profiles we have we
have new grads we have experienced
people Matt alluded to it but we've
literally hired people with no degree
and they've done quite well they came in
at actually an upper higher-level role
and did really well alright so next
question this one's for Mike
are there any chances to work in
artificial intelligence if you studied
artificial intelligence Mike oh yes so I
studied artificial intelligence back in
the day so I can tell you yes you you
have opportunities here even though we
don't do pure research like Scott said
we do lots of a applied artificial
intelligence here at Google even on my
project people now it's a predictive
application you try to predict and rank
what cards are useful to you right now
and think about all the computing
resources that Google has available to
it and you can apply artificial
intelligence and machine learning to
those to do amazing predictions speech
recognition almost exactly a year ago
Jeff Dean published a paper in ICML the
top machine learning conference on deep
machine learning deep AI multi-layer
perceptrons that could recognize faces
and cat faces in YouTube videos they
they they built their system to watch
youtube videos four years worth of video
and it recognized cat faces so there's
lots of really great AI and machine
learning applications here at Google
because we deal with just such hard
problems and our users have high
expectations of us they want us to just
present the right information at the
right time and so you need that are you
one of the topics certainly we want to
address but we're gonna address it by
you referring to the video is there's a
interview process and we'd like you to
be familiar with it it's very helpful to
just have a general idea so embedded
post-production we will have a video a
summary of this and it will include a
link and so you'll be able to learn more
about our process of interview I want to
go through a survey of things that that
our candidates often wonder about and
Psyche grow bolder as a site what I can
talk about is historical I can't predict
the future we started
an acquisition around fifty five people
we're at over 250 we've been growing it
at least the Google average norm for the
last seven years and every year I think
we're all surprised how quickly we've
grown and we've grown not just in number
of people but the dimensions of the
office so so we're doing a lot more
things overtime career growth so this is
a two-part issue first with respect to
most layer levels of individual
contribution both are pests tons of
opportunities okay
the math is there aren't very many Jeff
Dean's no matter which office or
building your perspective you kind of
look at so we don't have a Jeff Dean
like individual contributor but I don't
think we have any ceiling on individual
contribution here in Boulder now the
caveat that I was going to tee up is for
a manager type let's say the SVP level I
think it's fair to say that those roles
are going to be in the headquarters just
like most companies so with respect to
individual contribution
there's tons of career growth the other
dimension of career growth is that you
know we have 250 folks Mountain View has
half the company so there's obviously
more projects in Mountain View but my
position is that we have plenty of
options here in Boulder we talked a
little bit about profile I want to make
sure people understand we most of our
projects these days or java-based
but we hire people with C++ backgrounds
we hire people with C backgrounds we
have some projects that our client
projects that Google now has a Android
component to it drive has some front-end
work payments has some front-end work
drive has some Python people yeah
exactly
and the important thing is to just let
the recruiter know this is my strongest
line
and we'll meet people and we'll project
out if you're a good Python coder
there's no reason you can't come to
Google and code in sign language so we
tend to hire generalist some teams don't
but with in Boulder we have room for
most languages like I said the endgame
is typically to problem so so what we
want to hear from people is hey Ivan I
have an interest in living right so
that's that's most of the projects
Kelly alluded to work/life balance
I see like the survey result and I know
our self-reported work/life balance is
good I'd also declare that pretty much
across the board in the tech industry
people work very hard right so so it's
important that you understand that we
have flexibility we also work hard I
think Kelly did a really good job just
describing the day in the life of and so
one final note when we have our jobs
posted online you go to google.com slash
jobs you'll see every job that's the
avenue to apply we have real human
beings that look at these postings we
spend a lot of time on the upfront
categorization of the resumes so people
really do look at them and thank you so
much for your time yeah we appreciate
you spending the time to thialand learn
a little bit more about us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
