hangout on air or in some cases good
afternoon depending on where you are
we're doing another hangout on air here
on the life of Google page today we're
going to be talking about staffing all
things related to hiring applications
interviewing at Google
my name is Tolu I work on the staffing
team here in Mountain View and joining
me are two of our Europe recruiters Andy
and Melanie so today we're going to be
you know talking about all things
related to our hiring process and
answering the questions that you've
submitted yeah our life at Google page
and also on moderator so to kick things
off Andy do you want to introduce
yourself sure
hi hi everyone my name's Andy I'm Dublin
in Ireland the moment I am part of the
sales staff and team so focused on
finding great people for our core
business here in Dublin great Melanie
sure hi everyone my name is Melanie I'm
based in our London office and I work
within our G&amp;amp;A team which stands for
general and admin effectively that means
I recruit for anyone that doesn't
forward in sales or engineering to all
the other functions I've been at Google
for about two and a half years now great
great yeah thanks for joining us so to
kick things off you know I thought we
kind of tackle some of the more common
questions that we often get on the life
at Google page so to start out with how
do you decide what role to apply for a
lot of people are interested in working
at Google therefore great things about
the company but they don't know you know
how to find one of the one of the many
roles that are on our job site so andy
DME advice for just determining what
role to apply for yeah good question you
know our job titles sometimes you know
confusing enough right so I think the
best advice is to kind of you know find
a title that may be best at estimates
you know close to where you at the
moment but you go into the stand and
look at the responsibilities and
requirements sector we have essential
requirements
and the food requirements on all our
girls backs so that should really give
you a good indication of the kind of
skills we are looking for on that one
one tip is don't take some time to find
the right type of role don't apply just
willy-nilly 4:23 roles
that's very that is kind of a flag for
us it means haven't really put too much
thought but I would suggest you apply to
two or three roles and bear in mind if
you apply to similar roles the
likelihood is it's going to be the same
recruiter I've been after the whole
animation once you're in the recruiter
CBE and they will continue there for all
all roles of that type not just one you
apply for great Melanie anything to add
any any advice that you've found over
the years sure and I mean I agree with
Andy that sometimes it can be a bit of a
maze and a bit confusing some of our job
titles in a different department so
really I just look at the
responsibilities section and the
requirements for each area and maybe not
focused so much on the title because you
know manager here might mean something
totally different in another company and
vice versa
so just take a look at the requirements
if you still feel it's something that's
suitable I guess my advice would be to
definitely apply but also try and tailor
your CV and also your cover letter for
the role specifically so that we're
really bringing out your transferable
skills to the recruiter when they review
a CV yeah I agree I mean that's that's
one thing that I hear time and time
again from recruiters and and our
staffing team is you know don't just
send a general resume or a general cover
letter like you want to make sure that
you're tailoring your application to the
specific role that really helps and also
I think the terminology in some
companies is different so sometimes I
don't know for example in recruitment we
would call it internal mobility here so
when people move around from one job to
another and that could be called
something else is another company that
you've been used to working in there
maybe just having a look at the
terminology and kind of cooling that out
in your cover letter or even adapting
your CV so that really stands out right
right
great so another you know really common
question that people have is just
what is our recruiting process so could
you kind of walk us through like what
what the process is like from the time
you apply you know interviews or phone
interviews and that sort of thing
Melanie sure so I guess the key thing to
to say to begin with is that we always
look at your CV so when you apply for a
role a real human being a real recruiter
is that you're going to be reviewing
your CV so that's the first stage if we
see that there's a match between the
requirements of the role and your skill
set then a recruits will reach out to
you and that's a really good opportunity
then to be able to ask the recruit
certain questions and for us to really
explain the role to you beyond the job
description so if you then decide it's
it's of interest to you
we were then set up an interview between
yourself and usually the hiring manager
which should be the manager for the
position quite often it's not always the
case but usually that's your first point
of contact after the recruiter that
maybe over the telephone all you may
come in and actually have an interview
either face-to-face if it's in a local
office to you or over a videoconference
facility by going into a local office
office and meeting with the hiring
manager at another office from then on
typically you might have up to say for
interviews also you've probably read or
maybe you've had experience yourselves
before of Google being notorious for
having lots and lots of interviews and
you hear people saying WOW you know when
I joined Google five years ago I had
like 15 interviews and we really really
tried to condense that and now typically
candidates that I recruit I'd be
surprised if they had more than five
interviews for a particular role and and
you can probably talk more about the
second change I guess depending on the
department you're applying to so
typically you can expect to meet people
from the area that you are applying to
so again the hiring manager may be one
of the peers that you'd work with
usually somebody from a different
function as well to give you a bit of an
insight into the business so for example
if you're applying for a public policy
position you might interview with
somebody from the legal team for it
or maybe from the marketing team and at
the final interview stage you would
typically be informed afterwards as to
whether we feel that it's going to be a
match for you as all if the panel will
have met you then you advise us if it's
something of interest to you still at
that point and from then on we take a
few weeks where we review your
application overall and all of the
feedback from the interviews and we take
some time to go through all of the
details and then we come back to you
after a few couple of weeks usually and
advise on the outcome yeah I mean all of
that is I mean I only thought on I mean
the the pieced episodes is after the
recruiter screen and after the first
week of a conversation manager we do
then have those kind of three or four
interviews and require as best we can to
do them all on the same day right so so
it's not like five weeks we do it one
day with three or four the whole process
they actually process you know it can be
quite quick quite a dependable
availability um and also we did have we
did have some issues with the process
back a number of years we'd look at that
so it's a lot more user friendly these
days yeah absolutely it's you know I've
been here eight years and it's
definitely improved over the last few
years like and I you know I've heard
that we've done a concerted effort and
you know it's really improved for
candidates so that's great to hear
so and just for another thing if I may
decide which might be helpful to people
listening just in terms of the actual
content of the interviews quite often
you may have heard that sometimes we ask
problem-solving questions and I think
the key thing there is that you know
sometimes the questions can appear quite
difficult but it's not that we're trying
to trick you out or anything we're
really really keen to understand how you
think and to really get to know you and
your problem-solving skills so it's not
always about having the right answer
sometimes there's no right or wrong
answer to these interview questions it's
very much just about how you tackle the
question and really being able to
explain your logical thought process no
matter what the conclusion is that you
come to at the end of it
you know I think that also corners that
have a question is only one part of the
interview process they'll be obviously
questions around the world questions
around your leadership skills if you're
people managers so the other kind of
shoppers will see your question as well
so so that's the the problem is one
important part of you yeah absolutely
and certainly not the the only part yeah
absolutely so before we get into the
user questions I just wanted to see if
you could give an overview of our Europe
operation so Andy you know we have tons
of different offices in different in
different countries in the AMIA region
could you kind of give an overview of
you know where we're we're hiring which
which offices are we doing the bulk of
our hiring these days yeah I mean so in
Dublin we have the EU headquarters you
know this is kind of close to 3,000
people here in Dublin now and it says
being a hub for our sales operations
Europe by sales and customer service and
support as well as sales so typically if
the sales or governing is the hub and
then in country we have more offices and
they're very much sales focused dealing
with typically our our larger clients
and really that's a very simple kind of
picture of the other sales all looks
right we were hiring every agency we
have any need double in you know it's a
constant a pipeline of new graduates
needed because we have a large team here
that feeds the rest the organization so
dumpin is always hiring going on and
then their goals
okay okay so we got a number of
questions that were submitted on
moderator and on Google+ so we can just
dive right in so our first question
comes from Rafael and he says I'd like
to know how you choose between all the
people that you interview and all the
resumes that you get and one of the most
important
spec's when choosing a person to get a
job at Google Melanie you want to take
that one sure so apologies I'm probably
going to overlap and repeat a bit of
what I said before bet them so I think
one of the key things that we do look
for would be transferable skills so
thinking about you know what is what are
you going to need to do when you
actually step into the role and what
have you done before that will prepare
you in order to do that on the other
hand however it doesn't mean that your
skill set has to be an exact match we
also look at transferable skills in
other ways as well so for example you
know as a recruiter we have something in
our recruitment team who used to be
within sales and then they moved into a
recruiter role because some of the
transferable skills are pretty similar
the consultancy work that they're done
will super useful for the recruitment
role that's not to be disheartened to
think you haven't done the role for it
means you can't step into it it's just
about really calling out those
transferable skills and also on top of
that I would say a proven track record
of achievement in whatever you've done
so sometimes is extremely useful to add
to kind of make it quantifiable so to
add facts to it so academic achievement
of courses great to add on your CV and
also in your role as you've been
achieving you know if you for example
set up a new function in a company like
how many people are in that function how
long did it take to set it up maybe you
were running the society within a
university how many people in the
society did many people run for it
how long were you doing it for etc so I
think there's some good things to
definitely add in your CV and that
really makes it stand out to a recruiter
did you have anything to add Andy a
great point only I'm you know I would
just I would agree with the date on the
scene useful as I said I do out sales
recruitment you'd be just amazing many
people who are applying for sales job
but no dating and they're about their
achievements against target right which
is kind of important but I think it's
also important remember that we I always
talk to my candidates about finding the
right landing role
the right initial role but we are hiring
what long term as long to Google Google
pies right so we look at the breadth
there as well sometimes it's just not
just the role they don't to do for the
first 18 months two years like what else
can this person add add add value - yeah
absolutely
ah great so our next question comes from
RS and Lithuania is Google interested
mostly in getting already high
experienced professionals so should a
potential candidate wait more while
while they get more experience than
their current position or hurry and
apply and EU don't take that one yeah I
like this question so the
straightforward answer is you know it
depends on the road right I mean
obviously for for new grad positions we
do a lot of new grade higher knowledge
so we would expect a minimal experience
there you know any any project work or
internships which is useful and then in
looking at managers which is what I do
Marilee then of course we need people
with experience being managing teams or
whatever so the reason I the question I
do also believe in your trajectory have
to match let me explain one times I talk
to people and say look where you're at
right now any expectations how isn't
quite imaginable what Google would
expect me so there is a find I think I'm
talking managers that's very often I
would hire people are you have to first
say I was going to go away and do
another year this is this and then and
then out the right time for us and to
you right so I hope that makes it the
5500 - you didn't write that that's
really that you do apply the way the
management position
Melanie anything bad yeah sure so I love
that question - and I've got a good
example actually which I hope would
encourage people and in the lethally I
was advertising a position and we had
people with like so much experience a
quite a senior level applying and
honestly is there a future I myself
thought that we probably would end up
recruiting somebody at that particular
level but what actually happened is we
interviewed a candidate who you know had
less experience but just had some really
really solid experience and what they're
done today and had done some superb
research and they came in and just blew
everybody away and we actually ended up
and I'm not saying this always happens
but we actually ended up with do team
11th of the roll a little bit but we
really wanted to go ahead for this
person so you know that doesn't happen
every day but certainly I think you know
if you see a roll and it's really
calling out to you and you think it's a
fit then you know absolutely do go ahead
and apply one last one last point which
Oakley students as well I was just
actually doing some as looking some
major to my hires this year's of the
first quarter for twelve and I have
hired five people that I have talked to
in the past just this week but wire to
some I hired a gentleman my first vote
in 2008 now that's four years ago so but
my three other people I spoke to a year
ago
and they weren't quite ready and now
they're now they're joined Google I
divide it right so it can be the kid
that proves the point I'll try and make
it look yeah that's great to hear I mean
I think that's one thing that not
everyone understands is that in our
recruiters are willing to build those
relationships over time and you know
just because you get a no right now that
doesn't necessarily mean that that's a
no forever so it's important to maintain
relationships that you build with
recruiters oh ok so our next question
comes from Yuri I are there people that
need relook are people who need
relocation considered less than than
others and and and the question kind of
goes at what kind of help does Google
offer candidates who are willing to
reload relocate particularly within the
EU Andy is that something you want to
take yeah there's several moving parts
for that one so I'll try address them
all so let's take the black the white
the first
obviously these are the different depend
of the country but I can speak he speak
for example in Ireland I look above a
certain level of compensation it's
pretty straightforward
but I wouldn't be complicated every
country in Europe so that depends on the
20 we do offer a unique and really
pretty cool relocation packages the
countries and they uniquely fall out of
the move they make me move pain free and
at worst cost neutral and so I mean
they're pretty good and then as far as a
more complex part of Attraction as far
as when we look at someone for a role I
I will answer this by giving a pretty
obvious example but if we're looking for
let's say a sales manager for a
particular region that's a German your
friends right then it's obvious really
we would prefer someone who knows the
region because the seller to it has the
land right so that's a external facing
so they need those skills for the role
right then we're behind who is more
internally facing ISM is in the Alps
wrote an analyst or a project manager or
into a consultant type or in our
memories world and then then suddenly
there's their regional experience glass
important for us so that make sense yeah
great okay so we have a few more minutes
left so I'll try and answer as many as
we can so this question is from hey soos
do you have any suggestions on what to
show in your CV for a PhD with a lot of
research but little company experience
Melanie you want to take that one yeah
so I think again coming back to the
transferable experience definitely think
about you know what you've been doing
within your PhD that is transferable to
the physician so for example if you've
been involved in teaching and the
research project maybe you've built up a
network of contacts that are relevant to
the position or maybe you've been
researching certain topics that would be
you know hugely relevant to Google or
the role and again that quantifiable
stuffs really
hortence and I think in your cover
letter as well it's an opportunity to
also really kind of focus on the
transferable skills as well you can also
separate your CV into you know what
you've been doing in terms of
responsibilities within it but also
achievements as well so you can really
call out what you've actually achieved
or she theme within it once you've been
studying towards it yeah absolutely
thing to add that's all Andy just
quickly on PhD because I was saying
earlier you guys I've hired there for
PhD candidates in the last couple years
and the typical routine to Google tends
to be just so that serve a senior
analyst type role because they have
those transferable skills to do it but
for now assisting the PhD but the good
news is you know if the analyst isn't
gonna Chloe both of us you like two of
those people who have recently moved
into into different roles both of you
who were four twelve eighteen months
they've grown Network Europe what is
moving to the people management position
at Google and one is moving the project
manual so so I think that that also I
understand the path Google PhD attention
particularly isn't right so the role
that you started doing isn't necessary
what you're going to end up doing at
Google yeah we've got a whole internal
mobility team that just really focus on
you know managing talents and helping
people move into roles that they find
really satisfying and actually also
surprised to me almost when I joined and
I had one of my reviews with my manager
and he said to me well you know anyone
any other areas interest you at all and
I was kind of thinking wow am I like
really bad at recruiting them I mean
what does this mean that actually it's
definitely making sure that you're going
to be fulfilled in your career and then
rather go with you rather than you you
know leave and go and do what you want
to do elsewhere so they're super
supportive of that and you don't know
what to do what you're going to want to
end up doing cement or figuring out
issues work on different projects and
get to know different business areas
yeah I'm the poster child for interim
ability I've had about five or six
different roles here both in sales and
in people operations in my time here and
that's one of the reasons why I stayed
so long it's just
opportunity to advance my career through
internal mobility so I've really valued
that okay so our next question comes
from Tom in Germany and he has a
question just about the hiring process
so if if you successfully go through the
hiring process but realize that you can
accept a particular role at a given time
can you apply for another position after
that Andy you want to take down yeah
this will be a short answer absolutely I
mean we're we're very practically Google
you know this the big thing we're on
they called life right it's like you
know family issues or challenges
absolutely so it goes back to the day of
the week thing if the reason is
reasonable and then it's it's not
measurable
yes great so Melanie have a question
here from Matt in the UK he's wondering
about the rules that are on the job site
or all the roles on the job space still
unfilled for example some positions have
been on there for a number of months
sure so it's the answers yet they are
all available and I hear that question
all the time
some people ask me that I've seen this
particular position advertised in
January and it's now December and how
can this being and we don't have a
closing date first of all on our
application process no notice and that's
because we just keep on recruiting and
receiving application until we feel that
we found the person that the role is
really right for so we don't really have
a date where we like like we must close
this position and secondly some of the
roles are pretty difficult to recruit
for so and when I say that I mean just
that maybe we're looking for a
specialist skill set so you know there
may be some more context there so
therefore you know it can happen that it
google it can plan to take like up to 12
months to hire somebody I also want to
really add that that that's not the norm
and you know we do try to move as
quickly as we can and sometimes you know
I've recruited people and it's literally
taking like you know four five weeks or
so
so it really depends but in summary yes
yes
available yeah and another thing to
consider is that sometimes we have
multiple openings for a given role so
for example we have tons of software
engineers so maybe we have you know we
need 10 and we've hired six of them so
far right so the role is still up there
okay so we have time for one more
question so it comes from Andrews in
Lithuania so I'm in Adwords and
analytics qualified individual would
that be considered a plus during my
hiring process Andy you want to take
that one we have time for two more
questions yes absolutely
former Boehner absolutely
- Chris yeah and even if it's not
directly related to the specific law
you're applying for it absolutely just
shows that you have an interest in in
grooving and technology and what we do
so it's cool for whatever role you apply
for oh great great okay so that just
about wraps it up um thank you so much
for for joining us here on this hangout
on air and thank you to Melanie and Andy
for your for your insights it's been
really valuable hearing things from the
Europe you know we've tried to do a
number of these ones that are staffing
specific to give people an opportunity
to ask questions who are recruiters and
staff and team members about our hiring
process so hearing from you directly is
really valuable um so you know for those
of you out there watching please
continue to follow us on the life at
Google page on Google+ and look out for
more hangouts on air to come thanks
everyone
thanks so much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
