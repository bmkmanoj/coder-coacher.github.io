everyone that works for me generally is
going to be smarter and better at coding
and math and yet I'm an engineering
manager or Google and so I have to prove
to them I add value regardless if I'm
the rock star engineer that they might
be my name is matt Sakaguchi I'm a site
reliability manager I just hit my
ten-year Google bursary so I run a
couple different teams that support
Android so if you go to the Google Play
Store on your phone and everything loads
up that means my team's doing their job
it's subtle things that you do on a
daily basis that create the culture it's
all these million little things that
happen over time in one instance I had a
team where everyone was really smart the
issue was that we had some junior folks
that felt so intimidated so then the
meetings became really quiet and I can't
allow that as a manager first of all you
got to feel like you can show up as your
whole self at work and voice your own
opinion and be heard what I implemented
it is a little policy and I said the
very first question you have to ask
after someone throws out an idea is how
can we make this work I don't care how
crazy it sounds but that's how good
things happen crazy ideas right we had
this product that was hard to support
Ludden negativity amongst the esterase
because it was just a lot of work so the
developers were trying to push all these
features out and they didn't seem to
care so much about stability and we said
hey you know what is there a way we can
figure this out and so what we started
doing is sending a couple of our
Surrey's over to their desks and then
they started realizing oh this is a
great feature but if you implement it
one way it doesn't scale but another way
it will scale now every idea was like oh
wait huh I wonder if we can do this
sometimes you just have to figure out
what the team needs to get to that next
level the nice thing about being at
Google is that we have very very
talented people managers we have this
incredible amount of research and tools
available to our people managers to make
Google the best place to work so when I
show up at work I'm able to do all the
things that I love solving hard problems
and working for the people
manage that makes it worthwhile for me
to show up every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
