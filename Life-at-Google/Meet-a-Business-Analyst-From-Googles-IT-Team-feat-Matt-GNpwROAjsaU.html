certain strategy or directions been set
within Google I T something changes
within the company our requirements are
different because Google moves so fast
that that as an IT organization within
Google we have to also move just as
quickly usually it starts off with with
something all Googlers love to do is
let's solve a problem right and so
whether it's a software engineer or an
accountant sitting in the same room and
maybe an analyst such as myself
you all start whiteboarding and figuring
out that the best way to fix that
problem is one of the things that's
fantastic cool is we have an incredible
team behind the scenes they build the
fastest networks they build the best
wireless they build real products to
solve needs they do real engineering
we're constantly being challenged to
build systems that are greater more
redundant that your typical
organizations and your typical
off-the-shelf systems don't offer some
of our senior management highly touts
that they want that type of non
traditional IT growth to happen where
you bleed into the product and you bleed
into the solutions that we provide to
our customers
we had an opportunity to work very
closely with the product team at Google
Fiber and part of the solution that we
delivered was highly integrated into the
product that's going into people's homes
in Kansas City today Google Fiber says
what would happen if every user actually
had a gigabit bi-directional for their
house how would that change the world we
actually had an opportunity after
deploying the system and launching it to
see our hard work actually light up
these homes and become such an integral
part of this product that we delivered
to this customer one of my first
experiences at Google was walking into
my first few meetings and sitting down
and thinking it was gonna be like any
other traditional company and what I
found just amazing what really opened my
eyes was that the caliber of people
sitting at that table and the
discussions that we had was something I
hadn't had in 15 years prior to my
career at Google who was inspiring it
was innovative you were constantly
talking about new ways to make things
better
I see things move so much quicker here
large objects large obstacles are just
picked up and moved out of the way you
just feel like you can get more done
