on air on the life at Google channel
today we're here to talk about sales
staffing in the Sydney office so joining
me are four members of the Sydney
staffing team
my name is tole Thomas I always forget
to introduce myself I work on the
central staffing team here in Mountain
View and I had the pleasure of hosting
some of these hangouts on air so to
start out I thought we'd introduce
everyone
so Karen do you want to start yes sure
I'm hi I'm Karen I'm a recruiter with
the seal staffing team here in Sydney
I've been with Google since 2007 and
primarily I look after recruiting for
our large customer sales team for
Australia New Zealand and also some of
the emerging markets in Southeast Asia
thanks Sophie hi I'm Sophie and I've
been with Google for about a year and a
half now and I work alongside Karen and
the rest of our team in sales staffing
for Sydney and I look at I recruit from
predominantly the smaller sales teams
and across Australia New Zealand great
dinner hi I'm Deanna I joined Google in
2010 as a recruiting coordinator and
back then I was working across the sales
and the engineering staffing teams but
now I work on the sales side and I
recruit into the enterprise and a large
customer sales here in this Memphis and
hi I'm kitty lastly I started actually
in the London team and moved over to the
Sydney of staffing team this year and
really enjoying working so closely with
our staffing colleagues across the whole
of the asia-pacific region and indeed
obviously globally but specifically here
in asia-pacific we've got seven guys in
Japan and China in Hong Kong Singapore
Taiwan and India so it's it's a great
team this particular enterprise I'm
crossing over at the ANA there I'm also
actually doing a bit of work within the
the Singapore market and I'm working
alongside
sofa with some of the partnership side
as well okay
well thanks everyone for joining us it's
Thursday in Australia Wednesday over
here so we're doing this trans-pacific
hangout here
so before we get into the user questions
that were submitted on moderator and
your Google+ post I thought we could
talk just generally about the Sydney
office and what you guys do so Sophie do
you want to give an overview of what
goes on at Google Sydney you know like
how long we've had the office and what
kinds of teams we have there port yeah
so Google it's quite an exciting time
for Google Sydney at the moment we're
approaching our 10 year anniversary we
started in October 2002 and
predominantly in a sales function and an
engineering joined us in 2004 and we're
one of a few offices in APAC you have
both sales and engineer and on-site here
roughly the split is I would say 40
percent sales 40 percent engineering and
20 percent and all sort of finance and
HR and legal teams as well so and the
sales team that we root for in Sydney
and a number of different teams within
that organization um as I mentioned
earlier recruit some of the smaller team
and so what I mean by that I guess is my
recruiter partnerships and I recruit for
our G Tech and which is our Google
technical team and which have a sales
component but also an engineering
component and I recruit for the teams
that deal with our small to medium size
businesses across Australia museums ok
great
and then as far as kind of different
sales teams because each of you you know
support a different sales team so Karen
do you want to talk about your sales
teams and then Deanna and Kitty you can
talk about yours as well yeah definitely
so um I mean we do have you know as
Sophie mentioned quite a large sales
team here in Sydney it is divided into
sort of different components the largest
one is our large customer sales team and
this is these are basically the guys who
sell online advertising solutions
to the large clients across Australia
New Zealand so I support that team and
yeah deanna deanna helps me with that as
well so yeah so I work on the the
enterprise guys which are focused on our
cloud services and other IT products
such as Google Apps Google Earth and
maps and so they're split into the sales
side and the outside so then the
operations is more of a deployment and
the technical cost of customer support
side and we sell to small to large
businesses educational institutes and
government agencies as well so I guess
lastly just to add a bit about
partnerships that myself and Sofia both
working across ultimately it's there to
strengthen Google's core product split
really into three key functions content
syndication and distribution ok cool so
that's a wide variety of different sales
teams how do you go about finding
candidates just in general you know are
you mainly hiring from Australia or do
you look to hire international
candidates as well um anyone can take
that that that question yeah I can take
that um look we we hire across the globe
you know of course a lot of the
applications do come from Australia New
Zealand as you know people are here
looking for a job in the local market
but we certainly look across um anywhere
that the people looking for a job in
Australia so yeah ok we have roughly
a.m. and you can probably tell totally
we are with quite an international
office here in Sydney and Kitty is from
London as she mentioned I'm from Dublin
and I'm Karen originally hails from from
Singapore so and it's quite a
international office here in in Sydney
and and it really and he you know keeps
us growing and also keeps of learning
about different cultures yeah how much
collaboration do you have with the other
sales teams in other Google offices on
the huge amounts of course I can oops
sorry can you go so I was going to say I
mean we particularly with with the age
region for the time sort of time
differences that's easiest for us and we
have a regular meeting we share
candidates where I'm speaking really
daily to understand sort of both
everything from best practice to you
know who's a great candidate who might
be interested in more than one office so
there's a lot of collaboration there
okay great so you know we're here to
talk about staffing and you know I'm
sure a lot of the people watching are
interested in kind of our hiring process
you know you hear a lot about what
Google's hiring process is like what our
interview process is like but you know I
thought you know we could use this as an
opportunity to set the record straight
as far as Sydney goes at least so kitty
do you want to give an overview of what
the hiring process is like for someone
who's thinking about applying for for a
role at Google Sydney absolutely so
after the individual has put their their
application through in the first
instance their CV is reviewed and it's
likely to have been reviewed by one of
the four of us so obviously we'll
consider that background as to whether
it's going to be the right sort of a
sort of fit for the role that we're
looking for and the first stage is for
us to normally have a have a quick chat
with that individual over the phone and
that's really just to get a general
understanding of that sort of background
current situation you know sort of what
they're looking for in the near and sort
of longer-term future we'll also share
that CV with the hiring manager to gauge
whether it's going to be a good fit if
it is then we would move on to the the
actual interviews now we tend to look at
between sort of four or five interviews
maps of a max I know that there are sort
of ideas that there's going to be lots
and lots of interviews we really do try
and keep it to four or five so you've
had an opportunity to meet with both
individuals within the team they may be
at the sort of the similar level that
you'd be coming in at but also that the
manager of the team and potentially
someone from outside of the actual
division that you've applied for and
that's a great opportunity to understand
a bit more about you know Google culture
how the different departments all fit
together so basically about four
interviews in total and sometimes if the
individual is interested in a couple of
roles there may be a telephone interview
with the hiring manager before the
actual on-site meetings happen I should
also mention that if the individual is
perhaps by
outside of the city or the country where
they've applied they may go into one of
the other Google offices internationally
and have a meeting over videoconference
which helps you know to you know to
start that process as well I should add
that at the end of the process there is
about a sort of a two-week period or so
whilst we really review that candidature
everything from the you know the
interview notes we've received going
back over the CV again thinking about
references before we make a final
decision on the individual so the whole
thing can take up to about sort of six
or eight weeks or so I would say okay I
think one that if I might add is you
know we do try to keep the interviews to
four or five but you know sometimes if
someone is not right or you know just
missed out on a role they originally
applied for then you know we might have
a couple more interviews for a different
role so those four or five is really
restricted to the one role and then you
know of course it their different roles
they were considering them for there
might be a couple more and and I guess
probably like as well that while Katie
mentioned that two-week period at the
end while we sort of review and you know
all all the interview notes and
references and CV and and it can seem
like quite a long time for somebody
who's waiting on an offer and but it
really I guess the reason we take so
long and I guess go through it in such
detail is we want to know that there's
going to be a role for this person not
only for the next two years while they
you know will they apply for but also
you know we have succession planning in
mind we want to make sure that this is
somebody who's going to be with Google
for the long term and that there's
really a place for that person and sort
of you know not only for the next two
years but for the next you know 10 15
years so it's really important that
everyone buys in and we get their
opinion on the candidate for the long
term right right and so if you know if I
were a sales candidate just at the
beginning of the process you know you
guys have talked about how there's a lot
of different sales teams and Sydney how
do you go about determining what the
right role is to apply for in the first
place I think it's a combination effect
is I mean you know when when someone
puts in an application for the job
we give me advice um you know that you
you look at the roles that are available
you look at the skill set that you
and you applied for the roles that
you're you know qualified and then
secondly that you're really interested
in doing because you know we we do as
Kitty mentioned earlier you know we do
sort of work closely with the rest of
the team and a pack in four of us were
really close to the other to make sure
that we put the right person to the
right job but at the end of the day you
know we want to make sure individual
wants this to be their career as well
and this is what they want to do in the
sales side right okay great that makes
sense
okay so enough of my questions let's get
to the user questions so these are
questions that our life that Google
followers have asked on the moderator
page that we set up for this hangout or
have posted in the comments section
unlike Google so our first question
comes from Dave Scott and he has a
question about work visas so he says I
heard that getting a visa to stay in
Australia isn't that easy someone like
me will Google help out with this and
maybe provide sponsorship or something
similar
Karen do you want to take that one yeah
sure um so with visas um it's always
done in a case by case basis I mean
again like Sophie mentioned if you look
at the office here um you know we it's
predominantly made up of Australians and
and qyz New Zealanders as we call them
but you know there is a very fair amount
of people who hail from other countries
and who we do sponsor I think at the end
of the day again
case by case basis it really depends on
the skill set that we need and um you
know what the business requires from
that pump from a person so if you're the
best person for the job you've got the
right skill set to take the business to
the next level
um then certainly we will sponsor great
okay so it's next question actually the
next couple of questions come from
Michael O'Gara
and he asks what advice you have for
applicants changing industries to join
Google Sophie do you want to take that
one yeah yeah sort of at Toto we receive
and applicants applications from
candidates you know from a variety of
different industries and you know from
pharmaceutical sales to teachers and
really em I guess you know the
overarching team and what you have to
remember is you know bringing something
external
that we you know from from Europe and
past career is great and something that
we would welcome but always you know
when you're applying initially and just
remember to make your application as
relevant to the role as possible so say
for example that you were in real estate
and and and you were applying for an
account manager job and you know I would
you know encourage people to look at I
guess the responsibilities of the role
and you know perhaps you know you could
draw comparisons between your and your
role as a real estate agent and also um
you know the client facing time that you
would do with the with the clients here
at Google I guess and your pipeline
report sales targets that you have to
meet and you know perhaps even apply for
a role within our within our teams that
deal with real estate agents with it
with local and FM B's as well so just
really you know drawing as many
parallels as possible and but certainly
it's you know it's something that we
welcome and and it happens very often
that we have and people changing careers
and coming to Google but really bringing
their knowledge in taken into work
company yeah absolutely I mean I've
worked with so many people who've come
from all walks of life and they've wound
up at Google so yeah and it really makes
it very interesting you know your
colleagues can be ex-athlete they can be
you know ex and lawyers and you know it
really makes for a much more diverse
interesting culture of work yeah
definitely okay so our next question
also from Michael I yes do you advise
applying for several positions at once
or is it better to submit different
applications for different roles and he
has a follow up question about how much
time it typically takes between initial
application and then the first
conversation with staffing kitty do you
want to take that one yeah sure I mean I
guess to answer the first part of it
applying for that for numerous roles at
once it can be a little bit dangerous I
would think because you know if there's
a couple of roles that you've seen
online they're quite similar they're
perhaps sort of with you know closely
aligned teams both requiring sales
experience both requiring a similar sort
of background it absolutely makes sense
you think oh I like both of those
sectors I'd like to give it a go
absolutely go ahead a couple of roles no
problem at all as soon as you get to the
point when you start applying
you know 10 15 I've seen applications
where they've you know clicked on about
a hundred different roles and you really
start asking the question you know what
does this individual want to do if you
know some of them within the engineering
departments some of them with in
partnership some of them within the LCS
side and you really start questioning is
this individual wanting to be an
out-and-out salesperson or they wanting
to more the technical role and that's
really making us question whether
they're you know directed in the in the
right approach and whether they're going
to fit into these teams so I think the
best advice I can give is to say really
have a read through the different job
descriptions really the side which is
standing out for you and which is sort
of closest aligned to your backgrounds
and experience and then really sort of
go for that one and we certainly would
sort of appreciate from our perspective
when we look on it's much more
impressive there's just a couple of
roles that really really closely align
to that skillset and we're more likely
to take note and the next part of the
question I guess is is that the time
that passes between the initial
application you can imagine we get quite
a high volume as with with all the
offices of Google we get quite a high
volume of applications coming through so
we all in always endeavor to try and get
back to individuals as soon as we can
and you know I would hope that you know
if we're going to move ahead with with
an individual we'd hope to get in touch
with them over the phone or by email
within the first sort of one or two
weeks because of the high volume that we
receive if unfortunately can't get back
to absolutely everyone in their
application I think that's something
that people will receive a notification
on when they're making their application
as well okay great just on the first
part of that as well if it's a matter of
wanting to get your survey same I mean
we review every single one that comes to
me we all sit together so if we see
someone who comes through for one role
but we think would be a benefit in
another area we will pass her to one
another okay that's good to know
okay so our next question comes from
Leon he's with you guys in Australia
with online open courseware courses
becoming increasingly popular are there
are these courses considered in high
rate
Danah do you want to take that one yeah
sure so I mean it's always great to see
someone furthering their education but
if it's a matter of an open course or
you've taken time off to go to
university we really don't different
differentiate between the two and it's
fantastic and I mean everyone has
different circumstances as to when they
can study and so it's definitely not
something that is a hindrance it's great
to see someone furthering the education
in any way possible yeah absolutely
okay so this next question is about kind
of the Australian Way of business and if
it differs differs from the American way
of business
Ashley asks how will leadership and
business be conducted on Australia
versus in the u.s. will it be different
or will it still be aligned with
Google's corporate culture so Sophie do
you want to talk about that yeah sure
it's a good question I mean Ashley B and
being a global company you know we would
like any global company and was officers
you know from you know Japan to the US
to Australia to you know France there's
always going to be differences between
how people run business locally and I
think before applying to any well
internationally it you know it would be
a great idea to you know get yourself up
to speed on the difference of culturally
and you know in business socially and
you know I guess just all-around between
how and you know your local company or
your local and you know company our
country just business and also and I
guess have that whether the role you're
applying for just business and obviously
we're and we work closely with you know
with Googlers and you know all over the
world so there are going to be
differences but you know in terms of
specific leadership differences and you
know it just varies on on a local and
basis consciousness by country I think
perhaps just to add to that one of the
great things when you do go to the other
offices you know in different locations
you always get this sort of similar
feeling of a fan of real passion for the
products you know and and a general
interest and it is a very friendly very
sort of flat structure and a great
environment to work within and I think
that is true for if all of the offices
yeah absolutely I found the same thing
okay so we have
a question that I think and that any of
you can answer it's a follow-up question
from Ashley and she says what do Google
recruiters look for on a resume or cover
letter in order to determine that they
would move forward with this candidate
so Karen do you want to start yeah
that's an interesting question and we do
hear this quite a lot with you know
cover letters and resumes in particular
do remember that those are the only
documents that you submit to us when you
apply for a job so your resume in
particular I feel like you know a lot of
effort needs to be put into that piece
of document cause it's the piece that
sells you to the to any company that you
apply for so I think what's really
important is going through it making
sure that you know you don't have any
spelling errors
you know you highlight the relevant
information your dates are correct don't
make it too long don't make it too short
just make sure it's relevant and it's
Sophie mentioned earlier as well you
know think about the job you're applying
for if it's an account management job
what you want to do is highlight the
skills that you can transfer into the
rule that you're applying for um if you
were in the similar role before then
great if not then um you want to you
want to explain to us well why am i the
right person for this job I'm sure the
girls have other things to add so you
know I'll let you go yeah I mean
absolutely apparent that you know we
receive you know lots of these CDs you
know we look at CDs every day and what's
really impressive is you know if you can
see that somebody's put time and effort
into making sure that even from a
formatting perspective but it all lines
up and I guess you know not only to list
your responsibilities in a row but also
what's really impressive and what I
always find interesting to read is your
achievements in that world so say for
example you know you can't and you know
in account management world rather than
go through and unless you know that your
responsibility does we're probably in
the Job Description and when you applied
for that role your achievements no
mention targets we're a data driven
company and mention your achievement
against those targets and if you can and
that's something that you know will
people some context on on what a star
performer you are
great kitty or Deanna you have anything
bad yeah certainly I think I'm just
making sure to keep it concise as well
you know it's great to see someone
submit to a one-pager on the great
achievements in their past experience
and and I think as well just making sure
that you add all of your experience on
to the CV I'll often get CBS where I'll
have that two or three years experience
so just relevant to the role but I can't
see what they did beforehand so if you
could just add everything and even if
it's not relevant just showing what you
achieved in those roles is also
fantastic yeah okay so we have time for
one more question um so it comes from
Wendy and she says I would like to know
more about the process of joining Google
Australia will this be applicable if I'm
not from Australia so you know we
touched on this before but Karen do you
want to talk about what it's like if
what the hiring process is like for non
Australians yeah sure
so we when did the hiring process would
be pretty much the same you know on a
global level and you mentioned you know
that the steps that we go through in
terms of reviewing a CV doing a phone
screen having on-site interviews and so
on so the process the the process should
be pretty similar whether you hail you
know locally from Australia or applying
from somewhere else the the difference
is that I do see though might be in my
tip attention take a little bit longer
um you know just sort of getting time
time getting around time differences and
the more this by which you might get a
little bit different so you know for
example while typically you'll have like
a phone interview recruiter and then
perhaps wanting to be with business and
then on-site interviews it might be to
the very last stage before you come
on-site for interviews or you might go
into another Google office I'm closer to
you for interview and then of course
somewhere in between you might end up
doing it to describe hangout instead of
um you know sort of face to face they
will def well most of the time I for my
experience anyway um all the time I use
one face to face interview because it's
always good for you to come to office
and see what it's like first to see what
you're like um but yeah I mean
process-wise chambers
and just on that as well and if you do
require business sponsorship or newer
visa and this as well it's just going to
affect the time that we take from an
entourage interview to a I guess a time
where we might be able to extend an
offer so and just to bear that in mind
about to take sort of an additional six
to eight weeks just depending on how I
guess busy that could be the teams are
and in Australia great great all right
well that's all the time we have I want
to thank all of you guys for
participating I think this is really
good information and you know I think
now everyone has all the info they need
to to apply for sales roles in Sydney I
want to thank everyone for watching and
for submitting questions as well and if
you want to watch more of these hangouts
on air please follow us on life at
Google on Google+ and with that I say
thank you and goodbye thanks everyone
