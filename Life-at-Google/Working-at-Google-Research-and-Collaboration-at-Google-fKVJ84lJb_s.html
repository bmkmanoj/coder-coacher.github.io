hybrid research model as we call it has
been really successful and allowing us
to innovate in our products as well as
to produce lots of great research
results as engineers it would be in fact
impossible to function and actually be
able to produce the the products that we
do without the research insights being
able to find what related work exists
and also be able to come up with novel
solutions as researchers we wouldn't
have the opportunity to discover
problems of practical importance because
outside of Google we wouldn't be working
at a scale where these problems would
even be present so being able to have
your work be reflected in products that
the entire world is going to use your
research work is a very powerful thing
when you do actually want to publish
something you know that your algorithm
has actually be tested on real world
data on real world problems and and that
that just gives so much more credibility
to to to your publication there are
actually a variety of opportunities for
software engineers to remain connected
to the academic community externally
quite a few of them are available
through our programs in University
Relations because we have each year
several research award programs that we
run that provide these opportunities for
internal researchers and software
engineers to either serve as a Google
sponsor or for a focused award to
actually work directly with researchers
in academic institutions on areas of
mutual interest Google has also done a
huge amount in terms of open source
projects and you know just pointing out
obvious examples like Chrome for Android
indicate how Google is really not just
creating large open source projects but
open source projects that are having a
huge impact and huge benefit for other
companies and other research programs as
well one of the reasons why all
end up in research and also going to
graduate school and learning about the
various scientific subjects is because
our innate desire to be to learn things
to be curious about all the things that
there is in the world and one the
advantages about working at Google is
this ability to really go after really
large problems more and more people are
carrying around cameras with them phones
and other devices want to interact with
the world through taking pictures and
understanding them and we've been able
to do that with things like the Google
Goggles take a picture of something
we'll figure out what that is I think
research at Google can be summed up in
one equation it's it's big resources
plus big challenges equals unprecedented
opportunity researcher Google is also
humbling I think that my experience have
been that all the engineers are
incredibly smart and there's something
that I can learn from everybody that's
