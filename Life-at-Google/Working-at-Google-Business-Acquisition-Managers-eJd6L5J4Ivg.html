on air my name is Talia Thomas I work on
our staffing team here in Google
Mountain View and today we're going to
talk about the business acquisition
manager role in our Europe headquarters
in Dublin so we're gonna talk about what
the team does what Marcus they support
what skills you need to join the team
and our different a whole host of other
topics as well so to start I'll
introduce everyone who's who is here
with us today
beginning with Michele hi everyone I'm
Michele Kingsley I'm a recruitment
specialist here in our European
headquarters in Dublin and I recruit
across our inside sales organization and
I suppose the thing that I love most
about my job is guiding candidates
through the the Google interview process
which can be a little bit tough but
making that call to candidates to give
them a final full time offer at Google I
remember getting the call myself two and
a half years ago and it's a great
feeling so it's it's nice to be the
person that's able to deliver the good
news
Christmas hi people my name is Krystal
Saros I am a this acquisition manager
for the Greek Cypriot and Maltese
markets remember the business for just
over about a year and a half now always
recruit always hiring within that it's
not hiring finding a new perspective
advertisers within those particular
markets and what I love about my job the
most is in fact because we are still
growing as a market within the region
that I cover the fact that you can
contribute in that growth and via online
advertising field and about you speak
daily and with some well established
names but also some media advertisers
especially within and such a market
which has such a high economic crisis
and it gives you the ability to really
help grow that and be part of something
big I which affect overall the economy
in the country okay great Paul yes hi my
name is Paul Sharkey and like Christos I
work as a business acquisition manager
here at Google I'm here just
- over a year but I've been in sales for
like ten years so I've had a lot of
opportunity to work in different sales
environments what I like about Google is
a the challenge and be I suppose the
opportunity and consistently amazed at
the clients that aren't on board at
Google and aren't using online and it
represents a wonderful opportunity as a
salesperson to acquire those clients
okay and Natalie hi everybody my name is
Natalie Bagnall I've worked in Google
for five years before that I had a long
career in the advertising industry
selling ads in newspapers on television
on on the backs of buses and the reason
I really love working in Google is
because I work with a really smart
eclectic bunch of people from many
different countries in many different
languages and it's a lot of fun great to
hear
so you know you guys have a you know
wide variety to meet wide variety of
different backgrounds but I was
wondering if you guys could just give me
an overview of the offer so Natalie
could you kind of tell me like what what
is a mia sales from our really high
level yeah sure so it's a really diverse
team in the Dublin offices and we also
have hubs in Hamburg and London in the
Dublin offices we have over 70 reps who
sell in over 15 languages and they're
speaking to customers potential
customers in 20 24 different countries
so it's a really big diverse group of
people and all the people we hire speak
at least two languages they've all lived
and worked in other cultures before but
they have great experiences great
cultures and great stories to bring em
to the the overlay of all eyes oh and
they are group great and you know Paul's
women could you give a little bit of
background into you know what the
business acquisition manager team does
and what the what the roles are within
that team yeah no problem like a lot of
people like when I was doing my
application for the loan and Google I
didn't really couldn't get to grips of
exactly what it was so hopefully I'm
going to give you a breakdown of what I
do so at least you'll get a good grips
of what the actual role is but in a
nutshell I suppose as an acquisition
manager what we're trying to do is I
identify advertisers that are new to
Google so these are people that could
already be on the offline world via TV
newspaper radio etc or when we find out
that they're not on Google it gives us
as a salesperson opportunity to reach
out to them so it might not sell how do
you go about that I suppose once you've
identified a new a potential new
advertiser to Google you need them to
find the correct decision maker within
that company and ensure that you're
trying you judge made contact with them
and have a conversation with important
done ones here is finding the correct
decision maker the person that actually
holds the purse strings or makes the
decisions in in relation to marketing
budgets from there really how I approach
it is I'd very much like to have a
conversation with them it's normally
over the phone the majority of times and
it's really to get an idea from them
about what they're doing currently
Martin Martin marketing terms why
they're using outdoor our national press
or radio and where Google could fit into
that mix with themselves I suppose
another thing which reminds just across
to our questioning with people is to
find out their pain points with the
current marketing so where are they
seeing a return on investment how are
they measuring that and really found
that conversation what you're trying to
do is come up with solutions for them
where we can help them through those
pain points and help them achieve their
marketing goals
I suppose one of the beautiful things
that Google can offer people is we can
actually give them the metrics if you go
out and spend I spend money in the past
on TV thousands I couldn't tell you
whether helped the business in any way I
know I spent the money or Google can
actually show people is how the money
was spent and the end result so they can
make informed marketing decisions going
forward I suppose once we've had these
conversations and we found and talked
about solutions with the clients the
goal for us then would be to come back
with a documentation or proposal for
them on how we would expect them to use
their marketing spend with Google and
use our various products and platforms
that we have for them to advertise with
once we gain that support we have an
account management team backing
ourselves off that'll actually help that
client get on board and use Google's
best practices going forward so they see
returns on investment early on and once
they see those
turns they continue to advertise with
really great great that sounds good and
then you know crystals could you give
them a little bit more color into kind
of what you do on a day-to-day basis in
your role essentially the role as Paul
already mentioned we cease out by the
new advertisers and the new advertisers
to us would be supposed to know maybe
still a global international brand which
is yet to use Google AdWords as an
advertising platform all ranging right
through to smaller more innovative
startup mode companies as well but
people want to achieve is grow their
online presence and find new innovative
ways to reach their new now on a daily
basis are may be interacting in people
such as a chief marketing officer a
managing director of a business or even
advertising agencies in many cases which
is an external partner to these new
advertisers and which through these
conversations what we seek to understand
is what is the business model trying to
get to grips with it trying to
understand what the bottlenecks of the
business might be or what their
ambitions might be even ends through
those conversations trying to enact a
solution which may include our search
engine advertising products it may
include our Google Display Network
product YouTube advertising or even
benefiting through mobile advertising
which essentially forms a bespoke
proposal which myself and my team work
on and present to these customers if all
goes well what we then get is the
customers approval and they benefit from
working directly with someone within
Google preparing of up to three months
and receiving that account management
and following that particular from that
particular team but it all starts from
us so I think that's what's the really
exciting part about it I mean and
outside of that play to day activity we
also get a chance to interact with many
different departments within Google
there's loads of business units the
loads of different teams whether it be
marketing or whether it be other
programs such as the Adsense program
which we on a daily basis we get the
opportunity to interact by new
innovative ways of reaching out to new
customers or finding new customers but
also looking to work on common projects
which allow you to get
all the visibility of the business
reorganization and break up that
day-to-day activity and get involved and
more interesting further interesting
work as well and added to that what we
also benefit from is in country visits
as well so if you have a new innovative
way of reaching your customers you may
have you have given the free rein as
well if you have a business purpose to
organize an event and so for example I
remember my most recent event was in
cyclists of all places where we managed
to hold a financial summit for online
businesses great eventful in loads of
new revenue for the business and
Gaussian opportune speeds many new
innovative businesses out there and I
guess the Sun and the beach was just an
added bonus - yeah just just a pure
coincidence that that you traveled there
wasn't my it wasn't my choice and you
know you mentioned you know countries
and and other travel and things like
that how much interaction do you have
with the other country teams and other
language teens within the business
acquisitions team well I think not to me
really hit the nail on the spot earlier
on when she mentioned that was great
diversity on the team you know we're
currently sitting out that 20 plus
countries that we cover all of which
speak the local language or have
experience of living within the marquee
or work in the market so everyone I
think brings something different to the
table
I myself I cover three different
countries and have the opportunity
speaking to other countries as well but
I also I get to benefit from learning
from other people on the team as well
whether it be my teammates from Italy or
my teammates with France or Spain or
further afield so really being able to
where as an individual and learning off
them as well but also getting more
visibility as to what's happening in
Europe overall great now the could you
talk a little bit about the career
progression within the team because you
know I know that we have different you
know different people at different
stages of their careers but all kind of
you know stay within the business
acquisition manager team yes yes and
everyone always asks this when they come
for interview is how they can progress
with Google and the truth is that it's
very exciting and there's a really
strong career progression within
acquisition and I've had reps who have
worked with with the teams for a couple
of years and then moved on to do
exciting jobs in Sydney
New York Singapore the Mountain View and
then closer to home in Paris or London
across a variety of different
opportunities such as Android display
training etc they're really strong
career progression and after you've been
in the company for six months with us
then we'll work with you very closely on
a personal development plan and linking
in very very clearly about what your own
personal plans are where you want to see
yourself in three to five years and the
truth is that an app you'd of time in
acquisition in Google it stands there
very very well to you because you get
very hard tough commercial experience in
a multi-product format so not only did
we sell ad words but also YouTube
content Network etcetera so and a good
variety of different products mobile as
well and and the fact is that you've got
your very attractive after a couple of
months of experience in acquisition to
other departments in Google and that's
how these opportunities come about for
RIT so we very much encourage it we hate
to lose people but at the same time we
know that it's better for them to move
and progressive in Google than for us to
leave them outside great great and you
know speaking of candidates Michele do
you want to talk a little bit about what
roles we have open on the team and kind
of what went what skills are needed for
those particular roles that we have
hoping yeah absolutely
so this is one of the fastest growing
teams in Google and so we have a lot of
roles available at the moment
across a multitude of languages but just
to name a few that we're really crying
out for would be the Danish the Dutch
the French the Spanish the Russian Czech
Slovak Germans literally anyone that's
got some sales experience we want you so
apply now typically what I'm looking for
when I'm screening see these are people
with at least that one year's
acquisition sales experience so if
they've got cold pouring experience
business development but we will look at
people that have potential so I often
get applications in from candidates who
don't exactly have the exact fit for
what we're looking for on paper they've
shown a clear interest in joining an
acquisition based sales team and I'm
more than happy to talk to them so it's
really about the passion to get into
sales
and you know very competitive hungry
individuals obviously we work on a base
salary and then a commission structure
as well because Google is a company that
really rewards hard workers
overachievers and this team is
definitely that so that's the kind of
individuals we were looking for in terms
of what I'm looking for and on CBS you
know I think if you're a good
salesperson or you want to get into
sales what I look for is metrics and
what people have achieved in their
previous employment so you know it's
great to have a nice CV or well
formatted CV that I really want to know
what you've achieved in your previous
roles so really try and sell yourself
you know by kind of utilizing you know
metrics and as I said what you've
achieved in your CV we also look at
extracurricular activities you know what
else you were passionate about outside
of work and university so it's a range
of things that myself and the other
recruiters would be looking for great
great and then what about like
interviewing like what kinds of tips
could you give for someone who's going
in for an interview like what should
they expect in that in that process yeah
absolutely I mean I don't think it's any
secret we definitely gonna be touching
base on your CV and again particularly
if I'm recruiting first salespeople I
want to know that they're level four or
passion for the kind of joining a sales
organization there are metrics but I
will also touch base on their product
knowledge and AdWords is obviously one
of our main revenue generators so I'm
definitely going to be asking about
their product knowledge and you know
some general kind of questions about the
online industry in general it's like any
interview if you're going to an
interview with a company you should have
a bit of background knowledge about that
company and the way Google works and
roots and interviews is that competency
in scenario-based format so have
examples that you can share with your
recruiter if the recruiter then is happy
we do move to a telephone interview with
the business so that would be typically
with one of the senior members of the
inside sales team like these guys
sitting beside me
and then we would invite you to an
on-site interview so you actually have a
good few chances to really sell yourself
and as I said we're looking for loads of
people so definitely go to the Google
job site yeah absolutely and we actually
have one user submitted question that's
about kind of the job seeking aspect of
things its how important is a degree
when working in your business
acquisitions Department yeah absolutely
I mean it's not something that we look
for in particular as I said we look for
a range of things I mean we're
definitely it's a plus if someone has a
degree and it's something that we'll
talk to them about as part of the
interview process but there are plenty
of people who have great experience with
food companies in Google who don't have
degrees and who can do the job just as
well as anybody else and who are some of
our top sellers so it's not a must as I
said we look at a little bit of
everything great great great to hear
okay so we have time for one other
question this one comes from Roland in
Texas in the States so it's when working
in the business acquisitions Department
are there sales goals or any type of
quotas that are under the microscope
that you must meet when you're in the
department so Paul do you want to talk a
little bit about that absolutely as
Michelle said earlier on in the Hangout
it is a sales environment we are target
driven I worked as I said for about 10
years with different sales environments
in different industries I've got to meet
a sales person that doesn't have a
target so yeah do we have targets yes we
do but they're they're achievable
they're well structured so you know what
to expect when you start each quarter
but that's that's as you want and sales
you want that challenge that's what's
kept me going in sales for so long is
those tires and the pressure that comes
with them you handle it in a team like
we appear we all help each other out so
you're not an individual you are part of
a team and that's one of the things I
like about the eyes our team the
mentality is we're in it together but
there aren't it is a target driven
environment like every sales environment
is across any industry sure great well
we really appreciate you know everything
that you guys shared about the role you
know
sounds like there's a lot of different
challenges a lot of different areas a
lot of different languages so if for
those of you watching if you're
interested in learning more and finding
out about the opportunities on the team
just go to our job site at
