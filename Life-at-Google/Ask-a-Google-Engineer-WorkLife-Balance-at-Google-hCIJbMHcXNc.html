Bette and we're here to answer your
question what's the next question about
the fit well let me check on my G pad
right here you know I've got some new
apps for this actually when you call the
pencil and the new ones paper app paper
app yet the paper app is fabulous it
really feels like real paper calendars a
little rough though
yeah the calendar is a little especially
to make a lot of changes anyway on to
the question the first question we have
here is from May Hank I hope I
pronounced that right and it is how much
time you give to your family and friends
how much time do you give to your family
well it's a personal question you know
that right I think maybe what he's
really asking is you know do people who
work at Google have time for family and
friends I think that's the implicit
question I've seen other questions like
that well you have a family and I have
friends so together I think right now
I'm just kidding yeah absolutely is the
answer I mean I work life balance is
something we talk about a lot and it's
it's really important I think you know
we talk about long term and and hiring
people for the long term we're a good
match and the blade analogy right only
way you're going to keep people for the
long term I think is that if you have a
good work-life balance keep them happy
right well the blade analogy is is
actually has to do more with ongoing
learning I would say but also ok ok
buddy go so just burning out your
engineer right and I think also yes
what's up with that so yeah most
companies are out there looking for the
sharpest blade measure our that's the
recruiting product we look program we're
looking for a very sharp knife so that
we can use it to cut things right right
cut through hard engineering problems
and a lot of companies will take that
sharp knife and they will grind it
against the sidewalk 80 hours a week
right we're going to do that and then a
couple years you're like I have a dull
knife I want to get rid of this knife
and getting enough and then you go and
they spend a lot of time to find a new
sharp knife so just being not a
sustainable strategy right so having a
good work-life balance is part of a way
of sharpening that knife and part I
think part of the big part of it is
ongoing education right be a lot of Tech
Talks here a lot of interesting people
come in and talk about when you're doing
in computer science a lot of I think
just interesting talks about what we're
doing and right ProjectWise yeah we
share it's very academic internally very
academic community but maybe on that
as managers we are encouraged to be very
aware of work-life balance and to see
what our reports are doing do they have
a life are they spending too much time
at work right it's really amazing I mean
I know there's a lot of rumors I've
heard rumors that they're oh if you work
at Google you're going to work 80 hours
a week you're going to be burned out bah
blah blah they expect you to live there
and I have not seen that ever in five
years I've been here I mean it's really
just there are times I think was a
little bit of a crunch right what are
your super Triveni come you're going
towards right a goal and so it's like we
have a deadline a deadline but we're
trying to launch that as long as it's an
occasional thing it's an occasional
crisis and occasional deadline then sure
everybody works a little harder but it's
not the norm say like in the gaming
industry where you really are expected
to work 80 hours a week all the time and
if you don't like it there's 20 people
lined up to take your job at Google the
follow the theory is if you are working
more than 40 hours a week all the time
then something is very wrong with that
team and will get attention and it will
get corrected and we even have a case
sometimes of engineers getting so
enthusiastic Go Go work too hard without
realising I think a team right it's the
biggest challenge because you're working
with a lot of exciting technology with
you know really big scalable systems and
it's tempting I think to continue
working on stuff just because it's so
fascinating so much fun we've seen
examples of like folks maybe who are
just out of college they have no spouse
or kids or anything and they just get so
excited they just stay at work late
right and know what's stopping because
they're so excited about it but the
truth is if certainly as a manager if
that person keeps doing that over and
over they will burn out and you have to
stop them and say wait relax take a
vacation we've seen this happen yeah we
stopped it we put ourselves included by
burning ourselves out right so it I
think it's important to maintain the
balance and the way to keep a focus on a
long time the message I've heard from
from upper management is you know if
people work too long and too hard and
burn themselves out it's not worth it
maybe you get more hours out of the
person but you get very bad code I mean
right quality of the work goes down and
it's just not worth well I think you can
you can you can do that sort of grind if
you're not doing anything necessarily
creative if you're just if you're just
cranking out just really simple boring
assembly line type code
it's not good you can get that's
definitely not good I think I think
writing really good scalable code is a
very creative endeavor and it takes a
lot of creative thinking and if you're
not rested and you haven't had a minute
to step out of and look at look at
different things I think then it's hard
for you to really get into that creative
mode so X so the answer is Google is
actually quite aware of the tension
between work and life and is we focus on
it and we try to find that balance very
and Googlers do have family and friends
yes all right all right we're done
that's good for day thanks a lot bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
