lead in Google's recruiting organization
doing a hangout on air today with a
bunch of folks from our G tech
organization really excited to be here
and before we get started wanted to
actually start off with Ben from the
team Ben if you want to introduce
yourself and just tell us what the G
tech org does that would be great yeah
sure
hi my name is Ben Said's based here in
Mountain View California and we're here
to tell you a lot about what's going on
in G tech so G Tech is a global team
that works with all of googles many
partners and customers both consumers
and businesses to help make sure that
their experience working with Google is
really world-class so we try to leverage
lots of tools and products to help make
sure that whether it's a consumer using
one of our consumer products one of our
business partners using our business
products that took much like we all
experience Google products to be really
amazing and magical that their service
experience with us is equally as magical
so we're really working very hard to
deliver a very Google level experience
for our customers really excited to talk
to you guys more about that here today
awesome and now you guys touch both the
technical and the sales side is that
right yeah so we work with a lot of
Democratic customers of all different
sizes and we're trying to help make sure
that their technical use of our products
works as expected and if it doesn't do
we want to be here and have a very very
responsive intuitive way for them to get
assistance awesome very cool yeah I
think should be fun to learn a little
bit about this I guess we'll start going
around the room and introducing
everybody Anwar if you want to start
that will be great sure
hi everyone my name is Anwar Aram I lead
our consumer operations team and I've
been with Google about six years now Ben
you already introduced yourself so you
don't have to go twice oh the next I'm
my name is a key key one I've been
Google for a little little almost nine a
half years and I manage the partner
solutions team so we focus on has been
mentioned support we work very closely
with our product and engines as well as
BD and sales and we focus primarily on
partner onboarding technical onboarding
and ongoing support across about 40
as Google products primarily the
consumer products but just on the
partner side so we're kind of the flip
side of the coin to Anwar's organization
we focus on the partner he focused on
user cool and Megan hi my name is Megan
pie I've been at Google for 10 years and
I still love it and I manage a team that
focus on publisher business which is
basically we're partnering ristic with
Ben's team they're focusing on the
advertisers were focusing on the
publishers we are working with
publishers to reinvent a digital media
business yeah I didn't hear that also so
I've been here five years and my team
focus is on largely just this display
business for Google so whether it's on
the Google networks or YouTube helping
make sure that our users have a really
good experience with their ads and
advertisers have a really good
experience using our systems to reach
their audiences awesome so it sounds
like you guys work a lot together or
your team's interact a lot together
because you guys give me sort of a I
don't know a quick take on how you guys
interact not only with each other but
also with clients and sort of in
collaboration I don't know key maybe you
want to kick us off sure so as I said on
Laura and I focus on a lot of the
similar products but he focuses on it
from a slightly different user base so
the clients that he's working with are
really our end users whereas we focus on
the partner so we really then both work
with our product organization very
closely so what we want to make sure is
that we work together to make sure that
when we put in requests for things
improvements we need to see that are
better that the relative prioritization
of those future costs are balanced and
then so Anwar and I have pretty frequent
conversations about how we can make sure
that we have kind of more of a cohesive
message back to the corresponding
product organizations but then there's
areas where we don't necessarily overlap
where for example I do focus working
with kind of our BD and sales teams
because our partners tend to be more on
the not pure business side because we
work with groups like transit agencies
as well as nonprofits but we're focusing
more on that side of the house where as
I know Anwar again is focused more on
the user side yeah I would you
add in there that you know generally at
Google it's difficult to draw clear
distinctions between customers and
partners and you know paying users
versus just general consumers so we we
all need to work together because um you
know somebody who could be a paying
advertiser could also it is usually also
a user of Google's products and so that
necessitates us working together to make
sure we bring the best that we can of
Google for each customer partner user so
on cool and I'm Megan eat so you must
interact with these guys to I'm like
doing this visual thing but how do you
how does your team fit in the things
that's interesting no it's it's
interesting as I was listening to a
pennant and on one hand the key sorry
and so um I was thinking about the ways
we're working with them so on in keys
case and we are working on for example
in he's in a world where things a lot
more nascent and and things are getting
incubated and when things are touching
publisher business when things are
getting mature and things will get
probably migrated from her world to
adoption business so into a standard of
business and kind of sort of work world
in the immense world and we are sort of
like the two sides of the same coin and
they are the advertiser digital advisors
and media advertisers in display
business where the digital digital media
business on the publisher side so
without and these two teams how to use
the work together and the whole
ecosystem will just break them and then
in on laws world and just like almost a
lot of in all times these fine lines
between consumers and publishers and
partners and the customers really are
getting blended together and and his
team supports consumers who use a lot of
our products and and we work with a lot
of larger partners like these creating
these services products into a consumer
world so we do have a lot of overlapping
you working together Coon Bend how do
you fit into this whole thing well
one other thing which is interesting is
uh is that we actually have a lot of
folks move within our teams so it's
really good as people come to Google
they'll learn maybe one of our
businesses in terms of working with
publishers or partners or consumers or
my case advertisers and agencies and
then over time they don't want to take
that experience and that skillset and
try that and different in a different
light so one of the other things is
really good at being in this
organization is people actually will
move different to teams so you get a
chance to take that knowledge and apply
in a very different direction which is
which is great very cool now obviously
we wouldn't be doing a hangout on air
with the someone from recruiting hosting
it if we weren't we're hiring it'll be
kind of ironic but what what are we
looking for as far as people to join the
team's unwired if you want to start kick
us off but what kind of folks are you
looking for and skills and that kind of
stuff you know obviously when we hired
Google we hire for Google and so all of
those things around passion and and you
know be incredible and amazing all of
those things apply I think specifically
for my team what we're looking for
primarily as people who are passionate
about the consumer and doing what's
right for the consumer um and I love
that about Google in general that we
really think about you know we're not
thinking about necessarily what is the
cheapest way although being responsible
stewards of Google's resources is
important but what we're really fired up
about is you know bringing along a
magical support for the magical products
that Google has and so if there's one
thing that I always look for in
interviews is does this individual
really have passion for customer support
and and for working on that side of the
business and then on top of that quickly
I think the other two things are usually
you know you don't have to be technical
but a little bit of tech savvy is a good
thing because we do work closely in with
our products obviously that's what we
support and then operational
effectiveness so hardware before I can't
get to the other folks I'm going to go
one one question deeper on technical
skills we
we say thank you no technicals good do
you mean like a little bit of
programming experience just you know
comfortable with technology like how
technical are we talking you know there
are definitely that there's definitely a
spectrum of that within the consumer
operations work clearly the more
technical skills are much more
specialized but in general what we're
talking about is you know being a
passionate user of the technologies
today is a good thing right if you're
not a power user of Gmail or you know in
general products like that that's that's
an issue also just being able to
understand you know current technology
trends and whatnot so that's generally
what what I'm thinking about when I
think of some tech savvy awesome
then how about for your your part of the
organ yeah I think one thing I would add
to that just agree with everything on
horse said is we want people who are
really good at solving problems and
really solving problems at the root you
know so you know it's really good to be
able to respond in a very responsive way
put out fires and so on
but we really are trying to crack
problems into the core and really think
about how to unlock those kind of things
in a big big way so with the amount of
people that we touch in terms of whether
it's publishers or advertisers or
consumers everything is in a very big
magnitude here at Google some people
could really think through problems a
couple with really innovative solutions
I think that's really something that we
expect from anybody on our teams to
contribute yeah I think that's a really
important point that you touched on the
sort of size and scale and scope of the
sorts of things you guys are doing right
we're not we're not talking about four
users using Gmail in a corner we're
talking about major systems and that's a
big part of the challenge on the phone
I'm guessing sure
TV if you're not writing the product to
think about a product that's going to
potentially be used by you know people
all over the world and different
languages and
how is it going to look to them how is
good work than that how do we make sure
that every customer as equally as you
know equally magical experience and that
takes out you know a lot of good
problem-solving stills to crack yeah
it's really cool
that's really cool okay how about on
your team what do you look for on your
team so I think what you'll find in
general is that across GTECH we do hire
somewhat profiles of people just in
terms of background and experience I
think the thing that's very I don't know
how different it is but in particular
the thing that we really make sure that
we focus on is is trying to bring in
folks who can deal with change well so
as Megan said we work on a lot of
emerging products and products that
haven't launched yet or are new to the
market and as a result it's a really
fast evolving landscape you may go from
just a handful of partners to thousand
to ten thousands kind of in a very short
period of time so people who can wear a
lot of different hats one day deal with
the client the next day you know think
about how we scale out a product or kind
of really think at large how do we
tackle big problems but then also be
able to dig into the detail and deal
with the fact that the product may take
a 90-degree turn tomorrow and so people
who can be flexible I think it's really
the key for people who are very happy
and successful in my organization
there's not it's not total chaos but
there's not as much stability so you
might find some of the other teams which
I think you have to have the right
attitude to really like that kind of
environment yeah I think it's a really
good point just to jump in there like
you know it's not about what the job
description says is I think what the
need of the day is one thing of the
business is and anybody who watches
Google the news you can see we're doing
all kinds of new things on an ongoing
basis and people who can quickly respond
and be agile will be much more
successful here absolutely I think I've
told many a candidate that if you're
looking for really straight and narrow
it's probably not know what you're
looking for make it what's it like in
your part of the art so um you got to
give me the frame the the frames were
frozen for bit yeah
are you hearing them they sound great
and I see that jihad is really the
technical arm in the business
organization at Google and we are
business arm in us in human organization
so we look for two different kinds of
people and in my organization and I
think it probably wise to achieve health
as a whole as well to me to some extent
and they will look for engineers and who
enjoys solving problems and for clients
and who enjoy working with clients and
we equally we like to find people who
with a lot of for climb skills and but
with a lot of passion in solving
technical problems or business problems
for our clients and so we find a good
blend of people who kind of enjoys and
being a quasi world connecting the dots
with technology and business and
speaking clients and solving problems
and high doesn't hide the complexity and
and you know offer simplicity to the
clients now when you look for engineers
Megan do you look for like hardcore C++
and Java engineers you scripting
languages okay what kind like what you
know really high-level what kinds of
engineers do you need you for so unitary
I talk about two kinds if you're looking
for engineers if you enjoy talking to
friends and those people wouldn't need
to be able to actually be a programmer
okay not and we don't need machine
learning algorithm but today we need
them to be able to solve problems and
that's a technical but we also enjoy
having people who are we should find
experience so we have a lot of fun
resources and program who we can use to
train people who want to horn and for
their technical skills so we can train
em up ok cool very cool
I apologize for the dog in the
background there so we actually have
some user questions that have come in
that I think we can we've got about five
minutes left or so I know everyone's
probably out there meeting so we'll
quickly jump through the questions that
came in but the first one is a good ones
from huijiang Kansas City I'm here May
probably good one for you guys it's um
what kind of soft skills do you guys
look for beyond just the technical skill
I know we talked a little bit about it
but are there like really specific
skills like I don't know presentation
skills or or analytic skills that are
relevant sort of stuff you're looking
for yes I think is is Megan mentioned or
it does we both mentioned a lot of the
folks that we have an organization we
work very closely with partners or
publishers or external folks and so I do
think soft skills like presentation
skills I think there's things around how
you manage client relationships because
often times we don't always have answers
that maybe our customers want to hear
and so people who can be kind of
empathetic and know how to manage tricky
client situations is always very helpful
and then then manage some of that kind
of basic problem solving which isn't
pure technical but the ability to kind
of jump into a situation and figure out
what can I do to turn this situation
around and not just turn it around here
but figure out how I turn it around
across the board so that we don't have
the same problem again I think those
skills are really important Megan I
don't know if you want to add anything
to that actually I will mention that
we've hired people who have rich clonic
strengths and but until I want to learn
expressive and clean them we do the same
for technical person always a strong
engineering background poke button
there's less fun experiences we also
have programs with untrained people
these soft skills as well okay cool so
you guys can really really take a really
broad spectrum of folks and hadley
practice it's really great all right so
we have an other question that came and
I think Anwar this one's probably for
you my question is is technical support
going anywhere in terms of further
integration and ease of use with Google
products if so where can we expect to
see them I don't know if we can answer
that piece of the question but at least
sort of what's the integration look like
from us a user standpoint yeah you know
I mentioned how what we're really
striving to do is to make our support
experiences as magical as the Google
products are and I think there's you
know there's too
two trends that we're basically
targeting one is to make support more
predictive for you so help you before
you know you need help help you be aware
of new products or new tools that will
actually make it easier make your
day-to-day life easier so the predictive
angle is one and the other that goes
hand-in-hand with that is the
personalization right so as your as you
use your devices for more and more
things being able to give you the
support that is tailored for you
specifically and not you having to you
know go through page after page of the
Help Center or thread after thread in a
forum that's what we're trying to do is
to make the stuff that's relevant to you
be apparent and ready for you much more
quickly if the one thing that I'd add
and it may not be clear I mean part of
the reason we're all part of GTECH is
even though we start sort of slightly
different constituents in many cases the
ideas we have the same approach and so
what Anwar is talking about doesn't just
apply from user perspective what we
apply it to all the the kind of users
that we support across all the products
so it's a general philosophy and of
course that we're trying to take your
processor yeah what's really cool if you
guys can figure out the predictive stuff
it'll be exciting I'm happy to be a beta
tester I'm a disaster all right so we
have one more question that came in from
a mirror and it's a he'd like to know
what sort of things he can do to study
to get into Google and get a job at
Google and so I'll take that one there
there are ton of resources online on the
life Google page on the career site for
someone who's looking to get a job here
at Google and then just sort of me being
a recruiter I always recommend
networking as a another great way to get
a job at a place like Google and you
know who do you know I guess as the end
of the question there and so it's
actually the end of our time together
guys I know it's been really fast but I
just want to thank you for taking the
time to chat about GTECH I certainly
learned a lot and on where I might
follow up with you a question about
iGoogle later my father had one but I
couldn't know to ask so I think I know
where to go now but um I really
appreciate you guys taking the time and
I'm Cheryl chat with y'all soon thanks a
lot guys reminisce thank you thank you
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
