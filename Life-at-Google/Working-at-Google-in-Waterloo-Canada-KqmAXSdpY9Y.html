they wanted to be a number of years ago
the community has this really
interesting history of watching
Brownells and it goes right back to the
Industrial Revolution and we wanted to
make a statement that look we are going
to help drive the next hundred years of
innovation and entrepreneurialism but we
want to be part of what is in this
building of some of the most successful
startups we've seen in the last 10 years
if you were to take a look at the
resumes of the people we hire you would
see people who are astounding musicians
athletes we have people who've been to
the Olympics there are people here who
are professional jugglers we just
somehow they found us is that diversity
of ideas that lets us be innovative in a
way I think that helps people above all
we're trying to create a community
people come here they love working here
we're very open we just had an all-hands
earlier today Google does a lot of
things in the community many of you are
helping out the way that geek Street
will work is we will have about 20
partners from throughout the region
including FIRST LEGO League which is
being being managed by one of our own
Waterloo Googlers and then a couple of
other startups from the region who will
also be featured to act the digital
street fair the fact that we work on
projects that have enormous reach around
the world is a huge thing it allows us
to try new things and I'm enormous
impact best thing working on fiber is to
imagine what the ideal TV is once you
imagine that you can actually build it
the ads work we do up in Waterloo is
actually really cool we have to make
sure our product and the other ads
products works everywhere we've helped a
lot of publishers greatly improve the
content they have and make sure that
they can continue offering it by being
more profitable you wanted our current
two sort of flagship product would be
Gmail for iOS you know people are
looking for our expertise here it's
developed over that many years at Google
Waterloo what I'm looking to hire people
for my teams I look for generalists and
flexibility we work on all parts of the
technology stack probably the common
unifying part of all of them is the
Google scale billions of users
millisecond latencies and things like
that we have people with experience in
bounce back and front and it's great
having that mix in one team every
project in the office serves googles
mission which is to help organize the
world's information and make it
universally accessible and usable it's a
community of the best engineers and
product developers you could ever
imagine and that's a pretty amazing
place to work every day
we reach billions of people with Chrome
and so the changes that we're making
affect so many people's lives for the
better and that's what gets me up for
working morning it's a rush every day
you release software and it affects this
many people well that's one of the
opportunities that you have working at
Google actually you just affect so many
people the reason to come here is that
you are never ever going to work with a
group of people who are higher quality
who are more empowered to take their
ideas and make them real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
