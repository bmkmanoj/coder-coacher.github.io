quantitative analyst my name is ELISA
Tucker and I'm a quantitative analyst
quantitative analysts are involved in a
lot of things at Google working with
teams like search ads YouTube geo or
often working with really really
complicated systems and we're trying to
understand how products are doing where
they're doing well we're not doing well
and what can be done to make them better
I'd say about 40% of time I'm doing some
kind of coding I'm implementing some
algorithm I developed 30% of the time
I'm in meetings brainstorming or so on
and the rest of the time is kind of
split between either exploring and
sanity checking data or coming up with
algorithms I started working here
because I was really interested in
search than the problems in search and I
continue to find that fascinating to
this day we have a variety of
backgrounds and in fact we deliberately
hire from a variety of backgrounds my
background is theoretical math actually
not statistics we deliberately seek
different perspectives because Google is
an international company and we look at
analysis in over 100 languages and so
having a diverse perspective as possible
is a wonderful thing
as a quantitative analyst the impact
that you have is amplified just by the
scale of Google by the number of people
that are using Google products when I
look at Google search results
I do feel proud of the influence I've
had I often though find myself critical
and thinking how much farther we have to
go
being a quantitative analyst is like
being a lifelong student of statistics
we try to make sure people are working
on problems they're passionate about
that way everyone's happy and analysts
produce great work my teammates are very
accomplished they're very helpful it's
not a matter of let me do work so that I
can do better than you it's more let me
do work so that I could help you roll in
the same team being a quantitative
analyst at Google is so much fun if
you're a data person having huge amounts
of real data to play with and also
having an impact on the world around you
is such an appealing combination
