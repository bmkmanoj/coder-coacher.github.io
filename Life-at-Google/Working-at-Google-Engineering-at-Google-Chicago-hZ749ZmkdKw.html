hangout on air
will channel with my friends in Chicago
benefits and we're really excited to be
here today to talk a little bit about
Chicago engineering you guys want to
introduce yourself to everybody and
we'll get started from there sure
I'm Brian Fitzpatrick most people call
me Fitz I'm ben collins-sussman people
call me Ben Collins it's good to be here
yeah nice to be here again on the
Internet I love you Hannah mmm
the interwebs are amazing yeah so we're
gonna talk about Chicago engineering
which you guys are like the Godfather's
of Chicago engineering right should we
have like some theme music I've been all
joking aside you guys know Google a
while and we're some of the founding
folks there in the engineering team so
we'd love to just sort of share a little
bit with people listening or watching
live about the office how it got started
you know what it was like in the humble
beginnings and sort of where we are
today relative to that jerk so that the
office started in 2000 actually it's a
sales office a couple of guys they got
and like a windowless closet and they
hid behind all they had and they bought
it by clicking on a Google ad yeah great
good SiC 12 years old now crazy but when
we came 2005 yeah Google approached us
in 2005 and we find out refused to move
to Mountain View or New York and said
let's find out like just let us work
here in your office we don't have an
office there like what hey you do like
what engineering up its really well II
couldn't
it was it was a small sales office yeah
it's like 40 48 people yeah
crammed into a very small space and then
they cram medicine in that face it was
so it was 40 and when we started with 45
we didn't move out until there were 60
people in the office and then and I were
so jammed in that we could actually get
like forks and knives out of the micro
kitchen now getting up I could just
finished okay grab some chopsticks yes
so they do this nice to the tech stop
guys and people would come and ask us to
fix their outlook or something we just
way back in the day you couldn't help
them yeah wow bigger space where we are
now and now we've got what Thanks
500 people 500 plus people and like six
hours
Spillman yeah it's fantastic and the
portion of that is edge very cool very
cool
here so and we got half a dozen or so
project more than that yeah that's it's
funny it's a very similar to the
Cambridge office humble beginnings of a
sales team crammed in and then
engineering shows up and all the perks
kind of with it which is just great
right was so nice very nice they're like
super to here so friendly and they are
friendly but finally someone's like oh
we're so glad you guys are here Michael
thanks like yeah now maybe we can get
some better perks internet connection
you know that's what happens when
engineers show up they're like once
anyone for everybody remind me to do a
hangout on air with the sales team that
was there before you guys started get
the whole story
okay so I'll joking aside you guys have
got a bunch of projects now on a bunch
of different kinds of things it sounds
like there's no sort of like you know
we're ads office or were infrastructure
you guys have a lot of different stuff
going on mixture yeah well we started
with Google code yeah back in 2005 we
were we were very involved in the open
source world and Google's had an open
source office so that was run by Chris
DiBona
and I guess he was he was a bit
concerned that catch the Codfather that
is the truth
whether he you know he was concerned
that Batman SourceForge was was
essentially a single point of failure
for the whole open source community and
he was failing and I wasn't doing well
all right so he's like we should give
them some competition let's let's create
a place on Google to host open source
projects yeah that was our first project
it's the two of us here and a couple
guys in Mountain View and that's what we
spent our first year working on and
writing and watching yeah and it later
we launched it at Ascot in 2006 and it's
still going now we also have like so
many 10 people and it's uh it's mostly
here yeah it's still mostly here in
Chicago we've moved up
projects available at brew a while I'm a
stripper bit and you manage it Fred and
then you move go and do other things so
the Chicago read a passage yeah you must
manage we've got a bunch of other cool
projects here now they're sort of
started through various acquisitions of
the people living here yeah and then
some projects that Fitz created just
because he was very passionate well we
look at we were we were when we started
it was just Google code we wanted to
grow at the office and when we talked to
is Bill corn we talk right more like
we'd like to growth office is it well
what do you want to do well like an open
and I want to talk to you Jesse
we're talking with since write some
product managers about what we wanted to
do something that was like
philosophically aligned with open source
but not necessarily write more open
source and our we come up with this idea
of starting today Liberation Front which
was a team that would work to make it
easier for users to take the data in and
out of Google it's different from the
for any leverage definitely different
from the front for game liberation which
is funny because you know people work
well what did I get the money inspired
by the like Brian but I mean the real
the real reason we want to choose this
because we all agreed and what we wanted
to do when we started the project which
could agree in a name
like it's a portability or data
import/export service because we were
just as internal team and we're like
well we're just this internal team no
one will ever know publicly the name the
team so let's do something silly and
here we are they on this last orders yes
we have our own actual de libération
bolt-cutters - I brought those along to
hang out can you read this can you read
that yes they delivered yeah absolutely
I gotta be quiet not
not to be mistaken with the bicycle
liberation fronts bolt cutters which are
very similar remarkably different but
DNA and not a Google project so we're
taking off I mean it's weird you're
still here we we started off going
project to project and doing the work
and now teams are coming to us saying
how can we integrate with Google takeout
which is our product that's in queer
trying to incorporate you know as many
Google products we can get in and it's
even built into Google+ net which is an
actual data Liberation option yeah yeah
who does that is fantastic
yeah hello so there's twice the fun
notice I had a weird crash it happened
so other projects so project so talk
about that well they will then we
acquired feedburner which was a Chicago
company
so eight feet were in here I'll let in
more yeah yeah that will have more to no
speed burner and then something else but
you could tell but um and then we
acquired double-click right and that's
that's your project well I don't know
when double-click acquired it it
literally doubled the size of Chicago
office both sales and Wow and and
suddenly there were a bunch of display
ad products here that engineers working
on so kids and I both have now managed
display ad products in particular the
productivity I work on that which fits
used to managers called the Google
Affiliate come on essentially it is an
advertising product that connects
advertisers website
helps helps advertisers place ads on
websites and the website of commission
for ads that cause sales yeah and that's
the simplest way to describe it
and it searches the cost per click this
is a cost per acquisition right power
cost per sale cost per sale yes person
cool
I think it's an older form of internet
advertising first you have a for clicks
and sorts of things came along search
ads what it is really gonna see the big
big percentage of the engineers here
work on that and looking some pretty
exciting things what's exciting for us
are our office to own our own ass it is
a Chicago product in the entire sales
cool and now been when you guys are
looking to add people to that team like
for your next great noogler
you know it's at the same general sort
of skills that we look for across the
board or do you have some specific needs
for that team because it is hire
generalists in it and it still applies
here right we use C++ we use Java ping
pong ping pong ping pong go and we use
we you know most of the Somoza to say we
are a typical Google product in terms of
the technology and so it's interesting
you've got a lot of interesting big data
problems big data challenges that's the
cool right on your right because there's
a lot of advertising information that we
can broker that we see and that's that's
right for machine learning those people
I bet who care excited about machine
right big opportunities there and it's
it's a very it just as an interesting
product right I mean I had to make it
when I was before I took over I was a
little bit skeptical because I said oh
it's advertising that can't be as
interesting as open source right that's
just sort of the engineering back and
head saying it turns out I was wrong
like advertising has the same
interesting computer science problems
embedded in it that every other project
does it's not obvious at first when you
get into it you're like wow these are
really hard interesting problems I mean
it doesn't have to do I mean there's you
can sort of skate by I think the product
it's always a two-pump it's not a very
good product and
and that's not right
I mean you can do things that no one
else is doing did you go well we know
because you've got you know a couple a
number of really good engineers who
really understand computer science
working on things are excellent applying
their skills to solve these problems
cool that's the Google Affiliate Network
and then we so then I said well we start
the wizard next Google web server that's
that came that came next so we've got
our site Lee here will Robertson and did
not want to join us just for the record
II he did not want to join any job he
did not were joined it but I told him
that we were going to talk about him
like a dog that's right no GTA he might
have her mountain do you start adorable
for us and I hit the day he came here
he's his new product you're starting on
but an interesting thing so a lot of
companies out there if your products
cancel you get laid off which is is
possibly the dumbest thing I've ever
heard of we've spent all this time
hiring great people like Jeff to find
impossible engineers to work with and
there these guys are great in right if
say if your product gets moved or
canceled or something then you should
certainly it and that your Google takes
is that lets why don't you look around
and see what's interesting you and find
a new product everybody every engineer
hired by Google is treated as a valuable
piece of gold it's just well what can we
do with this person so it's not a
question of oh this person's only good
at this project you know they're they
are connected to the project the end
it's okay reallocate mix where we gonna
where you can apply their power now but
what are they interested in - it's not
like okay you know your projects moved
or something if you don't want to move
then you're gonna stay here right but
you know that was before years ago
before we got like this solid set of
probably so we'll actually they started
a part of the Google web server team
that's that's the team that's there's of
every query that goes through Google car
I'm not sure everybody knows that Google
has its own web search google comm is
not running
or ice or web server and it uses it all
but search and ads and many many big
things yeah and the the Google web
server teen is distributed across many
offices yeah and it's a very powerful
and it's very powerful team with very
strong culture that is a very serious
C++ work yeah yeah it seems serious
absolutely
so we're really excited to have those
guys in our office and so that was the
next team and then so involved with the
dead liberation stuff I sort of had my
year that was going on that policy world
and I had dinner with an old friend of
ours
Jeffrey all right right oh you would -
hi squirt Icicle we taught me seat time
and who I've known her 13 years now
because I'm in and then when he so he
came to Google in 2006 and anyway he was
like he had dinner and he's like I've
got this 20% project I'm working on on
government transparency and we're gonna
publish data that no other companies
publish he was super excited about it
and I started talking to him and looking
into what those guys were doing and they
they launched I mean they launched this
got the government request site it's
Google calm
so I transparency report and they
launched traffic which was delayed by
almost two days looks like what did what
did it show the traffic oh the traffic
showed traffic to our products like the
amount of gets we hit we received not
the numbers but sort of the graph it
shows around the world over 100
different countries and so some other
engineers are working on this and so I
thought this was amazing and I talked to
some of our folks and got permission to
start a team here that Matt's actually
leading now is the tech lead where we
work to make the government request
stuff a lot better you know in which
were publishing that twice a year now
and the traffic stuff Matt and his guys
worked on and they brought it from being
35 hour delay need to near real-time
traffic so if you have a transparency
report click on traffic and you look at
the all products thing for any one of
our countries there you look
easily delayed by two minutes I mean
incredible that's that's pretty cool if
they cut off the access to all of our
for all Google products in some country
in the world three minutes from now
you'll be able to see it on that graph
if it's one of the graphs that we've got
I guess if you have a room so it sounds
like I can imagine a lot of governments
don't necessarily like well but there
are some people that do like them I mean
you're it's a and I we've been brought
up in UN reports we've been brought up
and mentioned in in Parliament number
different countries I test and I know
that folks in in DC and in Congress are
aware this and all but the point is is
that you know let's not let's
acknowledge that there are government
takedowns or government's request us to
take the data out of our products that
government's request that we provide
data about our users and we're and that
we were legally required to comply with
some although not all of that we do
fight it when we think it's not that's
overreaching or something like that II
do but like any cut any company in their
company gets these requests all the time
we just think it's important to sort of
shine a light on them so that if
Internet freedom is really important to
Google because it enabled us to do what
we do it's really important to most
people who use the Internet and so we
think the best way to preserve that is
to measure it absolutely it's so nice we
are about twenty minutes into our half
hour hangout if you can already I know
time flies when you're having fun
I know like hey let's go and see you
later
Thanks no kidding um so you guys want to
just jump through the last couple
projects in Chicago no I got through
people over almost related to analytics
and okay not not the Google Analytics
part but you might think of but similar
analytical functions for other projects
so one project we have is double-click
for advertisers DFA there's a whole team
here that's focused on analyzing traffic
patterns for the ad serving that we do
for these advertisers you wanted a
gigantic data
yeah lots of analysis going on like a
couple gigs
at least a couple gig minutes yeah
keeping even a terrible you know I'm
including other team that actually does
analytics for for the +11 am part of
Google+ so if you're a website owner and
you put the +1 button on your website
you get to see all these wonderful
graphs what who's visiting your site and
what the demographics are yeah again
really interesting challenges together
those are present core will be that's
what we can talk about ok cool well
because I we're about 20 minutes through
doing a little hangout on air through
the life of Google page with benefits
awesome and we actually have some
questions that have come in from the
folks that are floating around the
internet which is even more fun so I'm
gonna go through a couple knees I'm
gonna hit you guys and see what you have
to say I'm gonna actually start with one
that we didn't see before we start our
hangout just so you guys aren't prepped
I prefer you guys unprepped what type of
activity should feature job applicants
do in their free time
that's from from Joey Arnold well it's
pretty easy open source yeah that's all
I mean we work we're biased towards open
source because that's where we came from
but but the point is it's it's what we
all say it's like a free internship
right you might still be in school or
maybe you're just in a job that you hate
if you go home and you work on open
source it proves to us that you have a
passion about programming that you enjoy
doing it for the sake of doing it yeah
and it also shows us hey here's there is
an auditable thing we can look at that
you worked on you work with other people
on a real product and we can see what
you did use what you have and you know
how to work with the team you don't play
well with others and and odds are that
if you're terrible at programming you're
not going to do this like this open
source again people who work at open
source in their spare time tend to be
and I'm not talking about write your own
widget and go off by yourself but like
work on a product with other people tend
to be really solid engineers because you
would never work as for him if you don't
love it and you're not good at that's
true so that's would be my primary base
a resume jump out of the pile I mean we
see that chicken spc open source but
what do I tell you when instance all
that guy I'm like
right if I can see an N check that they
worked at an open-source product that's
out there that has use it you know again
not like you work on some widget over
yourself yeah I think if I had a dollar
for every time I told someone till they
should work on open source ID I'd be
retired
well they buddy the question I was here
is what open source project should I do
I think well the answer is figure out a
niche that you want to scratch and then
go look for a project that probably
solves it but not quite and then
contribute right start with you sir with
your habit and if you're been your hobby
is collecting hobbies I want hobby so
easy they're an open-source project for
that probably a spreadsheet right yeah
all right so we have more questions for
you guys
sure um all right this one's from
someone named Kongo samurai I'm not
making that up I wish I was I wish I was
that witty but I'm not in love and in
the the samurai wants to know when I
look at open positions I see someone you
know see that we're looking for 4-year
degrees also states relevant experience
is wondering how often you actually hire
people who have no degree mmm and I can
speak to that but I'll let you guys go
because you're the stars oh no no no I
want to be no seriously
so your degree doesn't have to be in
computer science Wow mine's not my dad I
mean my degree is the more practical
than Ben's iodine is Green math yours
isn't math and my degree is in Latin in
Greek but in case that didn't work out I
got a minor in ceramics and that's why
it's a Google that's why so I would
argue that it doesn't matter what kind
of four-year degree that you have but I
would say having a four-year degree is
is really important well it's it's about
it's about maturity this is one way I
think they think about it's a kind of um
it's about it's about being able to work
well with people that's what I've
noticed is that often when I work with
people that for years degrees it's
sometimes hard to work there's an
impedance mismatch there I mean the
matter just my own experience right yeah
hard the best rule it's just if you
don't have a 4-year degree you you're
gonna have to done some
amazing like you have to show up and say
I'm better than you know my own computer
language is used by 700,000 engineers
around the world or I started a company
or that kind of thing so but it's it is
definitely the exception it's where it's
exceptionally rare and not yeah not not
easy it's like going from Chicago
Milwaukee by way of England you know
it's the hard way very likely to be sunk
by this paranoid that yeah I mean I I
think I think you guys both actually hit
on what I would say is that it's really
about you know life experiences and
having done cool stuff it's not
necessarily oh I got my you know my
ticket punched at a four-year degree
program and for science but it's you
know I did some open source work when I
was younger and I started this company
and I did this thing and I think I'd be
a good fit for Google and chances are
you probably are as opposed to sort of
worrying about that hard and fast thing
so yeah all right
we have got more questions people like
to ask questions actually I have one
specifically for Ben yeah exactly
and it's not how can you work all day
with Fitz hey it says that I I saw that
and started using javascript do you guys
have any plans to use go language and
your work if not what languages use
day-to-day and that's from Ralph in the
UK who's probably sleeping interesting
so go is use the Google Alerts
they've got connections all well you
wrote something that didn't I well yeah
so last year I started learning to go it
was pretty awesome I had I used it a
little bit for work you know instead of
instinctively
opening up my Emacs and writing Python
script like let me write a go script to
do this you know paralyzed paralyzed
double work right sundry tasks but it
was a great way to learn the language
and then later on I did write more more
interesting go program to to decode a
live stream of Morse code into ASCII
which sounds a little esoteric but I'm a
ham radio operator so I have this dream
of writing an Android app where I can
hold my phone up to my ham radio
somebody's sending Morse code to me and
I just want to see the text on the
screen and it's actually kind of a hard
problem but it's you can break
little components then how does
everybody out there internet know that
you're not lying
why you can go look at the open source
it's on Google Code uh decoder - bot you
can go look at it now you want to see a
friend of mine wrote the same algorithm
that we at Haskell this is Haskell code
in there some good yeah and I started
actually I started working to go to
Toronto like a week ago and I'm really
impressed it is pretty awesome language
that people are using it so right yeah I
used to write close to C++ nowadays
alright look mostly email welcome to
mana I have not downloaded the go
language if you were if you're wondering
I have not let's go you should do it I
downloaded the Android SDK once what
have to do what I wrote I wrote hello
world I actually did it and there's a
lot of trash talk about a Jeff Moore
hired me app a lot of trash talk though
okay we've only got a few minutes left
so I want to get through one more
question no one wants to hear about my
coding experience no one recruiting
experience does anyone hear about my ham
radio no no alright last question it's
from Conrad and Berlin International
here and the question is is there a
specific software process that you guys
follow yes engineering process how's it
structured how often do you work things
out you know
what's the communication like on the
team this is like your bread and butter
right what's it what's the like on a
team yeah well I mean we have a we have
a kind of process that all engineering
and cost rules require to use which is
called the get your stuff done and ship
it process not be so cheeky
um the process if each team chooses the
process is that they find there's a
couple of base things that everybody has
to do you everybody's gonna have code
reviews code review you cannot submit
code without having a source control
without somebody you're gonna follow our
style guide company across the slides
for every line I'll just make everything
readable right so then when you switch
teams in which you're encouraged to do
not
coming into some desired dialect of C++
right or whatever and beyond that but
beyond that it's like if you want to be
an agile team that's in your team that's
what you do that's great you know
whatever whatever one has and one works
but but the thing is definitely don't
see here what you might see in a more
stereotypical Dilbert kind of culture is
there isn't a program manager coming to
your desk every day saying so are you
done yet you've done yet what have you
done what have you done today like thank
you there's no babysitter right tapping
you on the shoulder you you are expected
to get your work done on your own time
you know terms and if you're not moving
fast enough it's obvious to your peers
and that that's usually all the
motivation gave me yeah so no TPS
reports no GPS we do have a nice system
actually the the snippet system which is
basically once a week you spend about a
minute and a half writing five bullets
into an email about what did you do last
week and that gets archived where you
get to these next week and what are you
gonna do next week and that gets
archived new data's because it helps
keep you on track looks your peers know
what's going on if I want to know so
it's on some other teams doing and I can
still look at his snippets over the last
more than four minutes writing it you're
doing yeah it's very good and everybody
anyone in the company can see it so it's
not like it goes into some Dilbert
emanager who just like you know plows it
away it never reads it anybody like
scribe to all my teams on snippets I
subscribe to your snippets like social
network where you can subscribe to it
yeah it's a transparent social network
within to come well we and it's a part
of the whole picture right you can see
what progress you've gone by other apps
we have people can look at your
objectives and key results to the
quarter your resume should be online or
up-to-date internally so people can see
what you've done in the past at Google
or Google so yeah you know having all
that stuff available across the company
is great all right so we are pretty much
exactly on time I can't believe it I
think the last time we spoke we were
over by like 18 minutes or something but
we are pretty much done I want to thank
you guys for spending some time hanging
out today it's always I was a pleasure
yeah
and just for those people that are
listening at home or will watch this
video later just quick reminder follow
the life of Google page on Google+ and
also hit google.com slash jobs for
information about jobs and if you want
to do cool stuff in Chicago apply to
work with these guys yeah yes exactly
and well hopefully you guys see you at
Google i/o absolutely at Google i/o and
if you're not there we'll be doing some
live casting will be a lot of laptops so
people can have fun catch you there
