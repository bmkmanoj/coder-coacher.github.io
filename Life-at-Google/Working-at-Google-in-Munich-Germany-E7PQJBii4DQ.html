like any other Google of his Google
Munich is a great office to work we have
a lot of projects we have fun at work we
have challenging projects what I really
like about the Munich office is it's
right in the center of town it's like
three minutes away from the madding club
if I look outside of my window I can
literally see directly to the
provocation we have nature around we
have beautiful view over the city from
our rooftop office it's just a great
place to work in we're closed Italy were
goes to Switzerland were close to
Austria and we're close to you know
Prague and the Czech Republic's people
at Google Munich come from all over the
world we have a lot of people from the
u.s. from Germany from around Europe but
also from New Zealand and other
locations from really everywhere around
the globe Canadians Hungarian Bulgarian
even some German project and teams are
always quite small so everyone has a
high impact maybe we have usually three
or four or five engineers working on one
specific topic so what you do and really
Hoopa has a very engineering-driven
culture really means a lot of the ideas
are driven by them even many of the
decisions also are essentially made by
them I mean obviously management is
involved in it and help steer but it is
more engineering driven than any company
that I've been at and it's very much
bottom-up there's good information
sharing and they really care about your
productivity you're not just a cog in
the machine here you're expected to go
out and do things and make things happen
and that's also then recognized and
rewarded which is a really good feeling
it's one of the reason I think the
motivation is so so what I really enjoy
is just work is fun and interesting and
in the Munich office
it's where the topics that really
inspire me we have a prawn team we have
a privacy team we have a team who works
on internal systems and last but not
least we have a team who work on
engineering productivity tools
oh yeah the perks the perks are great at
food is really good
it's their snacks everywhere it's
definitely a danger to your waistline
you have to get a bit of discipline the
coffee is good as a whole the one thing
that gets the most use is the foosball
table about about what once a days and
sometimes up after lunch or something
sometimes during the afternoon just to
take some short breaks from work we're
looking for I guess mainly good
motivated passionate people who care
about their craft to care about
developing have fun with it who take the
initiative to do things themselves and
can do a good job I was actually quite
nervous about applying to Google because
I thought they'd never take me but then
I thought there's no harm in trying and
it would be interesting to have that
interview experience and the end worked
out really well and I'm really happy
