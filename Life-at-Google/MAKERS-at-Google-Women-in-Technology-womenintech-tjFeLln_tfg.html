us her at or um at Johnson Space Center
and they asked my brother what he wanted
to be and he said astronaut and then
they asked me what I wanted to be and I
said an astronaut and they said what
girls can't be astronauts you know in
their mind they were right they just
didn't realize that the future would be
different it's hard when you're young
you're a teenager there's a lot of peer
pressure to conform there is a certain
stigmatism being a woman in technology
doesn't seem to be something that you do
I didn't want to be stuck at my desk
you know programming on a computer you
know 810 hours a day every day for the
rest of my life it's just not how I saw
myself but so much of it is also
collaborating with other people and
brainstorming and problem solving it's
working as a team it's building things
together it always feels like play
doesn't feel like work I'm always
surprised that there are not more women
going into tech because I think it's
growing and there's just lots of
opportunities there is no roadblocks you
know being a woman in technology there
are a lot of naysayers they're like
don't do that
you're never going to be successful and
so one of the things I learned very
quickly is you've got to stay focused
and you just have to believe in yourself
and just make it happen
I come into work every day excited about
the challenges and the possibilities
it's incredibly satisfying to know that
you're doing something that has that
type of impact and that type of reach
you really feel like you're doing thing
that's helpful and it's making a
difference I'm able to create something
that most universities in the world use
you know how impactful is that five
million businesses use the products that
I've been working on every time you type
in a query you're using my code and that
means that I'm reaching billions of
people a day you see the impact every
single day on real people and your
friends and your family
that's just magical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
