Edgar OB welcome to this hangout I am a
program manager in emerging markets with
us with a focus on sub-saharan Africa
what what is emerging market so I would
define emerging markets as nations with
social or business activities which are
in the process of rapid growth we are
program managers here at Google and with
me today I have two of my colleagues
first one you and got rich who is based
in our Paris office I'll let you and
introduce himself in a second and we
have my colleague yin schoolís who's
also a technical program manager based
in our our our office in Ghana over to
you thanks like a hi guys my name is you
got rich I'm a manager I'm also an
emerging markets working with a NGO and
yet my focus is on Middle East and the
North Africa all right my name is James
I'm a technical program manager I'm
mostly working on infrastructure
projects in sub-saharan Africa and I'm
based in Google Ghana okay thanks guys
and so I'll start with what I do for
Google and how I came to choose this
career path and as I said in the
introduction I'm a program manager based
in sub-saharan Africa and my focus as a
program manager or how did I actually
choose this path prior to moving to this
role of a program manager in sub-saharan
Africa I worked as a systems integrator
in our corporate engineering area in
Google and I've always had a passion to
make a difference in in the African
continent having you know being of the
African descent and I was actually quite
excited when I found out there was a
role in sub-saharan Africa specifically
to be based in the region and
coincidentally my colleague Ewan who is
also present here today interviewed me
for that role so the reason I chose that
this career path was because I was
passionate about Google's goals or
mission in the region which focuses on
reducing variance for access improving
content so having
relevant content and building a
sustainable and viable internet
ecosystem seeing that mission and kinds
of tying that with my passion to make a
difference in the region it prompted me
to you know to apply for the role of
role as program manager in the region
and here we are today so Ewan
can you tell us a bit more about
yourself what you do for Google and how
you came to choose these carrier part
sure so with that I joined people about
six years ago the first three years
worked in our corporate engineering
department supporting the engineering
activities within the offices and
helping engineers are I then moved on to
the emerging markets group and I think
crime already because it's nice about
the challenge of helping increase the
accessibility of the internet from from
the perspectives of social change and
technological change and I've learned a
lot over the past three years having
worked in sub-saharan Africa and now
North Africa and Middle East and it's
exciting III think the role as a program
manager is generally interesting to me
because I get to meet all types of the
whole spectrum of skillsets both in
Google and outside of Google so I work
with software engineers hardware
engineers product managers legal
compliance I get to learn about
everyone's job and everyone's role and
interact with them day to day so I love
the flexibility of variability of the
role so personally I work on two core
projects in Middle East South Africa one
is working with universities which I
think a go is going to go into in a bit
and secondly to work with partners such
as ISPs to help them deepen their
relationships with the users so for
example we put in we work with the local
ISPs in-country for example in Egypt
Morocco etc to help them deliver content
to the user so they store some of our
content locally so they can deliver that
faster and at lower cost to the user
okay thanks you and for that yen's do
you want to tell us about your you know
you do for google and how you came to
choose hysteria pop sure so I'm in
Google for about five years now and I
started as network engineer in the
Google Dublin office but from the
beginning I was kind of looking at the
efforts Google was doing in Africa
because before I started at Google I
worked in Africa and I was looking
forward to going back at some point so
eventually after about two and a half
three years I started doing 20% time
with the Google Africa team so 20% time
is this really cool thing in Google
where you as an engineer can spend about
a fifth of your time doing some other
projects than your main role so I I
started there and explored and did a
first trip to Nigeria in this role in my
20% time while still working full time
as network engineer and after this trip
I realized it might be an opportunity
there to try and achieve full time and I
applied for a role which was open to
work on infrastructure in all
sub-saharan Africa and I've been doing
that for about two years working on
infrastructure projects where we work
with ISP partners to try to improve
access to to either reduce pricing if
that's something which is important for
us so more people can afford going
online or in other ways improve the
reliability of internet for example with
all these cables which have land that
it's important that there's separate
ways for people to go out of the country
so if one of these cables cuts not
everybody is it's affected right away so
that that's part of the things I work on
I also work on the University projects
reviewing infrastructure DDoS design
universities - if they want to improve
their Wi-Fi or similar things like that
and this it's really really exciting for
me okay thank you thanks a lot for that
ye ends I think that's a good segue into
you know one of the areas we'd like to
discuss which is you know what would be
the number one top challenge in the role
and in the region and how we
chocolate in you know I would we would
start with with UN but I you know I'm
sure you know we'd all struggle to tight
down to one there will be a top
challenge what you know this is why
we're here as technical program managers
and program managers to address these
challenges so un do you want to start
with what the challenges in Middle
Eastern and North Africa yeah sure I
think to set the context it's worth
bearing in mind the across the the
countries we we work in and they go to
find emerging markets the there's over
two billion people and the average in
iteration rate is between 10 and 30
percent and if you compare that to
somewhere like the UK at 85 percent you
can see there's a huge difference and a
huge opportunity for us to help make
change and work with the people that are
enthusiastic to make that change and see
it happen is really rewarding so i guess
going to into more specifics one program
that we all work on is called google
apps supporting programs which is a
program to work with universities within
our within our regions to provide
training and technical training and a
Google Apps for Education which is free
but also to help really work through the
process of deployment with them and help
also the right II admins and
universities strengthen their network so
we look at areas where we can help
improve that through consultancy perhaps
offering some financial support etc but
I think one thing we've learned from
that and to address aygos question of
what is the number one challenge is that
it's all very easy to go in there and
offer Google products and then walk away
but what we see is that we need people
to lead the change it's impossible to go
and they're just provide a product and
then walk away right you have to work
with people beyond the ground help find
the champions in each university that
really want to make the change and give
them the claws and how these people to
bring other people on board and
let them see the benefits of using the
Internet day-to-day right I actually I
definitely agree with you in and you
know your focus is Middle East and North
Africa although the challenges you know
the challenges do do exist in all all
all of the immediate emerging markets
but they are in some ways different so
you know you and talked about being on
the ground and working with these people
to strengthen their campus network
infrastructure where we're dealing with
university but another thing I'd like to
add is you know we have to build a trust
right so you know we go in we understand
we aim to understand the challenges in
the different country so in so in the
different regions or well and countries
as well so you know if we take a sub
Saharan Africa as an example and you
know the number one challenge is is
actually the infrastructure a lack of
decent infrastructure and access to
which then ripples into access you know
to the Internet so through our various
programs you you and mentioned the
Google Apps supporting program we
actually work with the universities to
understand what their challenges are so
rather than go and impose a solution on
the these universities we want to under
understand what their challenges are and
work with them to improve that and help
them take ownership which then feeds
into our two other focus areas which are
building relevant content content as
well as you know building or fostering a
viable and sustainable internet
ecosystem where we work with them we
allow them to to own this so that when
we go away I mean the relationship is
ongoing however they're able to take
ownership and drive this forward and
that way you know I feel that you know
we've we've influenced the the chain we
set to achieve so on that note yen's do
you want to talk about the number one
top challenge in your role and how you
act how you actually tackle these on the
access front in sub-saharan Africa so I
mean II both of you mentioned already
important challenges
both the people and access one thing I
would add maybe an internal challenges
here is data so Google is a very data
driven company and whenever we do
something we need data to back it up in
sub-saharan Africa for most of our
projects no good data exists it's very
hard to find good data how many people
outline how much bandwidth are they
using how much how much data does go out
of every country or every ISP or
whatever and the data you find is often
very poor quality because it's been
collected by government etc so what you
mean by ISP so yeah Internet service
providers who are the top internet
service providers in the country and who
do we need to talk to that's often the
question where it starts like who are
the big guys and who don't and often
enough you have to go ourselves and
collect the data in the beginning
ourselves so when we start a new project
or started in your country the first
thing is always talk to people collect
data and try to get a better
understanding of what's going on in
order to really make a difference in the
project so so we're not blind basically
okay thank you
so you know moving on if someone is
interested in applying for you know for
job in in in the region as either a
technical program manager or a program
manager you know what would you say
yen's are the key qualifications and
skills we look for in order for them to
actually succeed in that role so
Technical Program Manager it's actually
good if you come from a technical
background so either if you have some
background in either network
administration system administration
software engineering some kind of
technical background in that area which
will help you basically manage two
programs ask you will come if you're
working on infrastructure projects in
each one
Stan what's going on etc and then it's
important that you do have some
knowledge about the market you gonna
work in so if you're working in
sub-saharan Africa you should have some
knowledge about that if you're working
on Middle East North Africa you should
maybe know what's a bit different there
if you know a local language that's even
better and then it really paid today
what you will need is strong project
management skills so so you will have to
work on projects from start to finish
and the important thing is you'll be
you'll be in all elements of the process
so you'll be on the ground you'll be in
the office you're the go-to person for
that and would you say it's key to you
know to manage vendors how would you how
would you describe the requirements
needed for you know relationships and
partnerships in South Africa yeah so you
do all the external and internal
communication so internally you talk to
all the other stakeholders so you were
mostly cross-functional which means you
work in people in engineering you work
with people in finance you work with
people with the country lead for example
to make sure the project flies and
externally you're working with partners
with vendors you make sure that they do
their job that they get paid etc and all
of that and you you need to be on the
ball for all of that okay thank you
un would you like to add anything to
that yeah I think you guys are given a
great summary I guess the two key things
are regional knowledge and experience or
at least a passion to understand the
region and really it's not a desk job
it's it's if you have a passion for
travel then this is for you and you know
we say passion for travel but you know
they do get they do get challenging too
so if you're happy to maybe sit at the
airport for editor six hours of flight
delays then then that's fine
I mean thank you thank you for that and
you know just a another thing that III
couldn't actually emphasize
is on more is the fact that you know
relationships being able to engage with
all levels both outside and inside of
inside of googlies is king so you know
as a program manager myself I find that
to achieve our goals we have to be open
to building relationships with several
levels of of several levels within each
country so for example I was at a at a
conference recently where I had to
engage or interact with government
ministers of you know Commonwealth
countries and the idea is to expose them
to raise awareness of you know what
Google is actually doing in their
respective countries and to start some
sort of dialogue because on a day to day
basis although some of us may well have
the opportunity to meet with government
ministers our focus is usually with
other stakeholders that my colleagues
have mentioned from getting you know
senior level brain on government buying
it helps with us achieving our goals so
you know you have to be open to building
those relationships and look for
opportunities for partnership building
as well because you know Google can't do
this you know the work that we do in the
region we can't really do it ourselves
we leverage experts in the field we
leverage other partners so you know it's
it's key to be able to be able to do
that so you know I think it's really
we've kind of expressed a lot of passion
about what we do and you know we've
talked about you know what the skills
and qualifications required and just in
a few words can we talk about you know
what we enjoy most about the position so
if we start with you in and then I'll go
next and yes you can finish up sure I
think what bubbles up most is working to
be talented people of course I'm always
honored to work with colleagues in
Google who very passionate really on top
of the game in their role that's
inspiring but also on the other side
because we work in emerging my
it's generally you you find yourself
working with people who are passionate
about change they're really a driven to
make change for their community their
society their university for whoever and
it's really nice to work with people who
will put all their energy into achieving
something because you get much more done
and you see the impact of it it may take
time but ultimately you see the impact
and that's very rewarding right I
totally agree I think you know you've
actually said everything I was planning
to say around what I enjoy most it's
really the you know the interaction with
you know the difference the different
stakeholders and as you said you and the
the passion as well you know people want
to make a difference and then they
embrace and welcome organizations such
as Google who are passionate about
making that you know positive difference
in their in their community so it's a
case of matching like with Mike and you
know although in some cases you know the
results do take time to manifest and you
know it's it definitely worth it and you
know just seeing the the the the
fulfillment from our you know
participating universities for example
you face if I you know if I may if I
mention if I mentioned the Google Apps
supporting programs it's actually
rewarding you know to see that you know
you started something two years ago or
18 months ago and you know the the
community's starting to see the you know
starting to see the rewards and they
then become our champions and and and
and ambassadors so you know whereas in
the early days you have to spend time
you know trying to tell these
communities about how Google can make a
difference and how it would impact them
positively we find that we're doing less
of that so you know I would say that's
what I enjoy the most I'd like to I'd
also like to balance that a little bit
by saying that yeah although you
interact with very passionate people and
you're empowered etc and you see change
it's very tough markets where services
are available companies are there to
support you it's not the same in
emerging markets where you
need to rely on a partner to provide
training services of scale to provide
deployment to even install something
simple like a Wi-Fi system sometimes
those companies don't exist and you
can't just walk away you have to help
develop those companies themselves so
you're mentoring those companies to grow
themselves which you can then use to
help scale your projects and programs in
the region so I think the challenges in
themselves are also very rewarding yeah
I mean I totally agree it's all about
the people that that's what makes it
rewarding and especially similar to what
anger says for me it's really the best
thing when I see you do something and it
gets gets driven further after you go
away so for example when I do technical
training and first I do it myself and
then I have apartment do it and suddenly
the people who were trained do their own
technical training and they just keep
keep training more people and the
message can spread across and to
knowledge spreads etc I think that
that's great
okay thank you Thank You yen's and and
Ewan for your comments there I think
it's time now for some user questions I
believe you know we have some questions
here so I'll start with the first one
and it says it is well known that in
emerging markets people have a certain
resistance to change to new things
how would you confront with that and you
know who would like to take that
question you and I yin I can take it so
I think that's actually very interesting
question because it's true people who do
have a resistance to change and things
which we take for granted people might
not take for granted and even changing
to let's say using email on campus is a
big change for many so what we what I
think always works is show people I like
actually demo it works and show it with
a small group that something works maybe
don't don't go full scale yet and that
gets people excited usually once they
see that people really like and some
change after they've tried it
and then it kind of drives itself so
once you have two first few people
convinced they drive the others and it
goes that far on this on a larger scale
let's say you're rolling out a solution
to one University they will tell all the
other universities at the next
conference how great they've done and
then someone will be interested that
does I think how how we can deal with
resistance like that and taking time for
for any questions people have taking
them seriously like not just showing
them oh these are our normal frequently
asked questions if it's not on there
it's not a no take the time to answer
the questions find solutions which are
for the people okay thank you thanks for
that so yes okay so the next question is
what is the skill set you're looking for
in potential employees for emerging
markets and are very different from
those that you would be looking to hire
for other markets UN do you mind if I
take that it's good okay so and I would
say you know as we we alluded to earlier
on the skill sets that we're looking for
would be an in-depth market knowledge
and it's vital that there's a thorough
understanding of the market because then
that allows you to you know to address
you know some of the challenges and you
know hopefully achieve the results that
we set out to achieve and the other
would be strong project management
skills from start to finish and it's
vital that one is able to manage vendors
because that's key as you and mentioned
earlier you know one of the challenges
we face is we can't do this ourselves
and we need to engage with you know
partners from training technical
training partners Google Apps for
Education training you know technical
consultants as well and we have to
ensure that they in turn have the right
skill sets to be able to support us on
our various initiatives and then you
know one of the other things that I
would say is key would be our
relationship building I think I
mentioned that earlier and partnership
building and also with our you know with
externally and within our
our teams at Google and then you know
the the question is asking would we be
looking to would they be different from
you know from other non emerging markets
and the answer would be no the only
difference being a knowledge of the
actual market in which they're an
in-depth knowledge of the the markets in
which you're expected to to operate so
the next question how much of your work
in these markets are googled of all
projects you and you want to take that
short so I think the key difference
between google.org and people.com where
we work is that google.org is focused on
driving technological change in in
philanthropic so put on tropical project
so for example disease control where
we'd be mapping Flu Trends and trying to
control disease through basically
surfacing data and using our tools and
the scale of the data process we have to
enable such things whereas in google.com
we work on producing programs which
ultimately benefit Google in some way
like for example we're talking about
education so when people use the
Internet in the long run that benefits
Google when people use Google products
of course that benefits Google so the
key difference is that Google at all is
is a philanthropic arm of Google and
google.com is is projects to benefit
google.com
thank you un so do we have any more
insights we'd like to share yes do you
have anything else about the last thing
I think if the question is how much do
we work with google.org we don't work
ourselves on projects for Google that I
like to have their own people which
which they hire for themselves offs but
we do work together because often the
girls are overlapping so for example on
scouting trips I mentioned or something
like that we might do them together
because we all need good data to to run
our projects ok ok thank you very much
so I'd like to thank my guests and
colleagues UN and yen's for your time
and I'd also like to thank the 40
for tuning in to the life at Google and
if you have then if you'd like to follow
us I'd say if you you can follow us on
the life at Google G+ page and for those
who are you know I would say if you want
to check out the the jobs at Google if
you go to www.youtube.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
