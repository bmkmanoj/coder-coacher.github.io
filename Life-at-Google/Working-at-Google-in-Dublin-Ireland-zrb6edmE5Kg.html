work in the Google office here in Dublin
family no basis is the biggest one in
Europe a little bit of an office we have
somewhere north of 50 different
languages spoken they enjoy the fact
that it's hardly ever goes above 25
degrees when the Sun is out the air is
absolutely clear and it is brilliant
interested outside of everything about
the doubling up to do the engineering
building it's entirely themed after
Ireland from Irish writers Irish music
places in Ireland Dublin City Irish
legend and folklore this is like a real
Irish bath here in India please google
has a bunch of big product areas and
they try and group services together
that are important to them under one
only you can find any range of
experience from hardware to software
people who have written routing code
people who have helped design routing
Hardware normally by day I work with the
data center automation team the remote
access team I manage those guys but I
also get my hands dirty on engineering
matters by knife I look after the
workshop load of tools and stuff
basically a rumor of geeks can come and
hang out I don't want to get away from
the keyboard it's very challenging it's
it's an environment where where
technical knowledge and sound design
always win when I joined Google first up
the first thing I was told essary hope
is not a strategy I didn't get it for a
while until I realized it was all about
proving that software was definitely
reliable but Google+ launched we changed
it we launched new feature every day for
something like a hundred days it's a
very very tough incredibly rewarding
though and if you do your job perfectly
the outside world doesn't know you exist
my team is working on the web crawler
which is the infrastructure within
Google that downloads the entire
Internet say hello to the camera
we're downloading the entire Internet as
quickly as possible and use that data to
to form the index that is then used in
web search I love the people that I work
with they make this more than anything
else more than the perks working with
the best and brightest people in the
field pushing the boundaries of what
what can be achieved every single day
and and making something that nobody has
ever done before makes this job worth
coming through every single day we have
so many people here with a lot of
knowledge that always you are going to
find a colleague that knows about
something that you don't know what
motivates me at Google is actually the
fact of being surrounded by plenty of
people you are so much more brilliant
than I am here I feel a real need to
push myself to be the best I want to
find ways to challenge myself I want to
find ways to challenge others and I want
to find ways that we can improve the
internet together what we really need is
passionate people eager to learn and
willing to challenge themselves come
work in Dublin go for it and mostly have
fun during the interview process you
will learn more here you'll grow more
here and you'll have the sound of your
life working here in Dublin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
