New York this November there are four
states with marriage referendums on the
ballot Washington Maryland Minnesota and
Maine
I support marriage equality as well as
many of my friends and colleagues here
at Google hi I'm Raymond hey I'm Matt my
name is Cynthia hello from your friends
at Google there are millions of people
fighting for the right to marry and it's
important that we support them My
partner and I are actually engaged and
finding a way to get married right now
is this kind of tough it's hard
every time I fill out a medical
insurance form I have to check this
thing off this comes back to equality if
you're in Washington Maine Minnesota or
Maryland
now you have the chance to negate fear
and Prejudice this is a really important
part of our culture and the way we're
evolving it is gonna be these civil
rights issues off our generation the
civil rights should never be up for a
vote but the fact that it is means that
we have to get people behind the class
as much as possible and I think this is
the tipping point make that realization
that your vote doesn't matter we need
your voice there's momentum around
marriage equality and the possibility
that with your help we can give people
the opportunity to love and marry who
they choose so go out and take a stand
