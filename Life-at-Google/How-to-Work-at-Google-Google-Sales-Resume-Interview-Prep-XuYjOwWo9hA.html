on air on the life of Google Channel
Plus today we're going to be talking
with the sales staffing team and we're
gonna be talking about resume
preparation and giving interview tips so
joining me are Michele and Margaret -
the two members of the sales staffing
team so Margaret do you want to
introduce yourself sure hi everyone I'm
Margaret I've been at Google for about
four and a half years I spent my first
three years in sales here and then moved
to recruiting about a year ago and I
hire salespeople here so I'm looking
forward to speaking with you
hi I'm Michele Riccardi I am based in
our Mountain View office I'm responsible
for the leadership hiring for the sales
and operations side here and I've been
at Google for a little bit over two
years and excited about helping everyone
out there to try and get into Google and
I'm told were Kahn the central staffing
team here in Mountain View I've been at
Google for eight years and I work with
recruiters on different ways that they
can advertise their jobs so to start out
I thought we could talk just basically
about resumes Margaret what's the most
important thing to keep in mind when
preparing your resume for a sales job
sure so we hire people from a diverse
range of backgrounds but the most
important thing is to really cater the
work you've done in your current or past
job around sales and around you know
qualities we look for in salespeople and
I'll talk about a couple of specific
things that would be important for any
sales job in general you know really
highlight direct work you've done with
clients as well as internally you know
sales has a lot of different moving
pieces so highlighting your organization
skills and multitasking you've managed
in the past and your project management
skills is important anything you've done
around business strategy or really
really getting at the goals of your
client whoever that may be and then put
quota achievement on there if you've
carried a quota because that that's
important in any sales job and finally
you know we look for people who are real
self-starters who are very action
oriented so highlight things you've done
and beyond your you know the
requirements of your job that would make
you stand out right yeah
make sense and I think when when you say
like your sales experience that could be
anything right that could be like retail
any customer service like you would
consider that sales experience wouldn't
you yes I think really any job can their
sales elements you're selling yourself
on your resume so yeah just um cater
those toward sales and really highlight
the impact you've made they're great
great so what are some common mistakes
that people make on resumes I mean I'm
sure you guys see tons and tons of
resumes every day like what are one of
the pitfalls or I guess what makes a bad
looking resume so I could answer that
one thing you have to keep in mind is
your resume is a representation of
yourself and you've got 20 seconds to
impress the recruiter on the other end
so one of the biggest mistakes that I've
seen are actually misspelled words
believe it or not so it almost looks
like that person lacks attention to
detail or they're not thorough and
looking over their resume they're kind
of rushing so that's one of the biggest
things that I actually see in resumes
that I review another one or
discrepancies on dates dates they either
graduated college or discrepancies on
the end and or the start and end date
for jobs they were at and again I want
to repeat the metrics like Margaret was
mentioning metrics especially for sales
roles metrics are really important to
put in your resume so just keep in mind
that you don't have to keep your resume
to one page it's good to keep it to yeah
if you could explain in detail but put
as much information about yourself where
like I tell everyone where you whet the
palette you know where you want the
recruiter to call you and ask more
questions about your input on your
resume right I mean I think a lot of
people struggle with what to put on the
resume what to leave out I mean
particularly you know if you're if
you've had a long career and you know
you've analyzed different roles maybe
that some volunteer work maybe had some
extracurricular work in college some
projects or teams that you that you are
part of
I mean should you put all that on there
or or should you leave some of that
stuff out I think you should put it on
there I think it's important to list as
many skills and extracurricular
activities that you have done in college
we Margaret do you any suggestions on
that you think yeah I agree especially
the ones that are most applicable or
show that you are an entrepreneur things
that really make you stand out from the
rest okay yeah that makes sense okay so
let's move on to just some basics about
interviewing so in sales like what is
the overall interview process like
Michelle so well it's pretty rigorous so
it's great we try to prepare our
candidates upfront so starting from
phone screen it could take at least two
weeks from there because I'm responsible
in leadership hiring so a lot of the
clients are the demanders that I deal
with their calendars are usually booked
so it could take up to two weeks to
complete the phone screen on the client
side and then Google hires on consensus
so let's say the hiring team that you
interviewed with on site decides they
want to move forward with you so we have
to go through these committees to
actually let go through these committees
to get approval but I mean all Margaret
I'll let you add on to the rest of that
if you'd like
I'm sure yeah I mean the interview
process is does go through a couple of
different steps but um I think the most
important thing is just really you know
preparing for your interviews well and
making sure that you do a little bit of
homework so that you come in and you
know you're able to make a great
impression on your interviewer since the
process has been consolidated a little
bit more so than we had it in the past
so you'll you will and we have a handful
of interviews total so in terms of
preparing for these interviews um you
know definitely come now go online and
research the products and anything that
the team works on so that you'll be
knowledgeable and you want to show that
you've done your homework which is true
of any job interview
and I would also encourage you to
prepare a couple of you know smart
questions ahead of time to sort of lead
your interviewers thinking and leave a
great impression on them at the end and
then remember to follow up and you know
send a little thank-you note after your
interviewers so that they'll after your
interviews so that they'll remember you
and you know have that that great
impression finally don't be afraid I
know a lot of people prepare you know
questions ahead of time and answers that
they want to talk about don't be afraid
to be spontaneous at Google you know we
want to hire authentic people that you
know really would make a great culture
fit and are influenced by love teamwork
and influence by a team and so be
yourself be authentic and don't be
afraid to be spontaneous when you answer
your questions and really get at the
answer to the question and not just
provide you know a certain scenario that
you've prepared for ahead of time yeah
that makes sense
do you guys want to talk about the
difference between a phone screen
interview and an in-person interview
like what what's the difference and what
should people expect in terms of the
types of questions that are asked so my
process might be a little bit different
than Margaret's and not sure since so my
my phone screens there's two the phone
screen with me and the phone screen with
someone from the hiring team and then if
they pass that phone screen if that the
person from the hiring team then you
request that they come on-site to meet
the rest of the team and usually they'll
meet four to five people at most on-site
and then after that we make a decision
whether we're going to move forward with
that candidate or not okay is there a
difference in the types of questions
that are asked in the phone screen yes
there are um most phone screens are a
little bit more general on the questions
but once you get on site it's really a
lot more specific specific to the role
that they're applying to okay and and as
far as like the types of questions that
that are asked in an interview how much
how much of it is based on the specific
product or the specific team
on that that you know that the hiring
manager is interviewing for market you
want to sure um you know I would say
about half and then some other questions
are going to be around your experience
but really um you know highlighting how
you approach certain challenges you know
your thought process your reasoning
skills how how how you confront
challenges and solve them and bring your
own unique creative solutions to the
table so and so I would say that you
know maybe maybe thirty to fifty percent
would be around the role and then that
other half is really around your
background and how you could contribute
to the team in the larger sense what
you're bringing in great great that
makes sense yeah okay so now that we've
kind of had an overview of you know what
it's what resume preparation is all
about and we've given some interview
tips I thought we'd kind of go into our
user questions so user submitted
questions on the length of google page
on google+ and then also on our Google
moderator page so our first question
comes from Tim in Washington DC and he's
asking about his grade so he says my
grades in college weren't very
impressive but I'm confident that I have
relevant experience deep knowledge and
passion for Google's industry and would
make a great fit at Google do I stand a
chance of ever getting hired by Google
Michelle you want to take that one no
I'll take that one
actually Tim from Washington DC yes you
actually can't get hired here at Google
again as Margaret mentioned we love
creative you know we love creativity
here at Google we like people to be
different and you know as long as you
can handle the ambiguous environment
that we're in you'd be a good fit now
even if your grades weren't all that
great in college but we also look at
your experience in your background and
how well you've been doing in the work
in the work force so yeah you still have
a chance here so so please don't give up
on us yeah especially if you've done
some work in the summers between your
your college terms right because we look
a lot at like resume and summer jobs
that sort of thing right we also ask why
of why your grades weren't is great
I mean I've seen people who have to
self-finance their their college and
have to work full-time so there's always
reasons say we'll work with everyone
right okay so our next question comes
from Nikki in Minneapolis she says my
goal was to work at Google farther down
the road
what experience or college credentials
would help me and then we also had
another question that was along the same
lines just asking about you know are
there any jobs that could be a stepping
stone to a Google sales job so I guess
Margaret what advice would you give to
people if they want to sort of prepare
for a Google job down the road sure well
I started in sales here myself and you
know the preparation I did I think
positioned me well for sales I
definitely I had an advertising
background which is is very related it's
actually sometimes one step closer
closer to the client and so coming from
an ad agency that we partner with a lot
with our advertising solutions was very
helpful being able to speak that
language and having that client
experience I also in college I did a
couple of internships um to show my
interest and you know volunteer to work
on projects in school that had to do
with advertising so I guess just knowing
you know it helps to really closely
define what your goal is and if it is
advertising sales you know immerse
yourself in that industry or you know
try to find a role or maybe dabble in
something on the side within your
current job that could help them
advertise to show that you're aligned
with the same no type of function I do
want to say though that we don't just
hire people with advertising or sales
backgrounds I mean we hire a diverse
range of backgrounds and like I
mentioned at the beginning you know
sales sales as a skill in any sort of
background so I think it's just most
important to know what your goal your
goal is and then to create sort of a map
for yourself with those stepping stones
so that you'll be best positioned on
your resume and then those conversations
is very good anything to add Michele no
that's great Margaret okay all right
so the next question that we have is
someone who's interviewed here before
so v 5.0 in Perth Washington asks I've
been interviewed by Google previously
about a year ago from then till now I've
gained more experience and improved
myself
well applications I submit today still
be considered by Google Michelle you
want to take that one here yes you still
have another opportunity to come at
Google I in the past have hired people
who interviewed even less than a year
ago and even for the same role but just
different organizations within Google
and actually this this can it's actually
starting next week so yeah there it it
really depends on the role the group
cultural fit the opportunity and this
particular person actually within just
that one year gained a lot a lot of
experience and was able to come back and
interview with a different team it was
just a big fit great great so it's
definitely not any kind of blacklist you
get if you don't you know make it
through one one interview right no not
at all
not blacklisted okay great
our next question comes from Abdullah
and they asked in the interview is the
focus more on personality or knowledge
please rank an order of importance
competency motivation and fitting into
Google's culture so Margaret do you want
to talk about kind of how we how we view
team fit in our interview process sure
so um I will say you know we do look for
a culture and that's probably a better
way to sort of define personality it's
it's sort of your whole the whole
picture of who you are as an individual
and I would say that we we do probably
rank that higher than knowledge because
we know if we hire strong smart capable
individuals that the knowledge can be
acquired they can come in and learn
about our products and I will tell you
that it at Google in my experience here
you know things change quickly there are
tons of moving pieces and so you know
even if you do have strong product
knowledge as you come in that product
may change and develop you know a couple
of months down the road so I would say
that culture fit is very
important you know being a team player
bringing your whole self into work and
all the diverse characteristics that you
you offer it's probably more important
to us than your knowledge that being
said I would encourage you to do
research before your interview so that
you you know feel confident in your
answers to some questions that may be
more role related right and in terms of
like the culture of our sales teams here
how would you say it differs from the
other sales organizations in terms of
like what makes a Google sales team
really feel really feel part of the
Google culture sure I mean I would say
that um how we would differ well I
haven't worked in sales elsewhere
however I would say that um we do our
sales people carry a lot of
responsibility and are really given the
leeway and a chance to sort of shine in
their own way we do have sort of a
framework but there's no real you know
Google sales training where a Google
salesperson must function in a certain
way it's more consultative selling we
like to you know think of ourselves with
partners with those agencies and clients
we work with and it's a real team
atmosphere so we want people to be
comfortable we know that you know a lot
of minds and a lot of thoughts all
together can come up with a better
solution than just one person running
with it so that would sort of be our
atmosphere I do want to mention with in
terms of preparing for an interview or
an interview our salespeople often you
know do have client calls during the
course of the day and so if you come in
to interview for a sales job you're the
person who's interviewing you may be
dressed for a client so they may be
wearing a suit or wearing something more
something that you wouldn't think of as
being googly so I would encourage you if
you are interviewing to dress dress up a
little bit just so you can feel
comfortable and and feel in line with
what the person interviewing you great
that's a good good piece of advice okay
so our next question comes from Ken in
Mexico and he asked what are the main
competencies that you look for in sales
candidates in international markets and
what are some examples of them in action
Michelle do you want to take that yeah
we want self-starters definitely
Google is a big company but we're still
young so we want self-starters
go-getters again creative people not
afraid to to to take risks you know
that's what we look for we look for
people who have online media experience
of course right we're online company
were global very important but not
necessarily you have to have it I mean
again we'll work with you we again we
like self-starters you like go-getters
we like people who can navigate and Vig
you at it you know I think it's very
important in this company um those are
those are the key that I could see in
answering that question yeah yeah he
touches on you know the fact that we
have international markets and you know
we have heat we have some big offices
you know here in the US and Dublin but
what about some of the smaller
international markets how big of a
factor is language in terms of looking
at candidates like whether they speak
the local language and knows know the
local market well you got me on that
yeah I would say I mean because we are a
us-based company it is important that
you know our candidates who even if
they're based in in other countries we
do you know conduct business in the
English English language however if you
do if you know another language that's
too great plus if you want to work in
another market and and always something
we ask about so if you please do
highlight if you are proficient in
another language highlight that on your
resume because that's important yes plus
one on that one very cool keeping the
Google Plus spirit here okay so our last
question comes from JW Hamilton in
Chicago and he says I'm a sales
professional and actor with various
sales / marketing experienced in
different industries but I've never
worked in technological sales I'm a
Googler at heart how can i how can i
best position myself to get in get a
foot in the door at Google so Michele do
you want to take that one actually the
key was
I'm a sub I'm a Googler at heart and
that's that's great right there it's
longer passionate about what Google does
and what we do definitely don't be
afraid to don't be afraid to apply
online again like I hired someone who is
purely biotech and everyone's afraid
that we couldn't get this individual
hired here because they didn't have
online experience but she has been so
she's done a great job she's just
passionate about what she does what
Google does and she believes in her work
and so don't be afraid please apply I
mean again we love creative people
go-getters self-starters good it's the
Google way right how big of it how
important is it to have tech sales
experience like how different is it
selling in the tech industry versus you
know consumer packaged goods or
something that was non tech so it's it's
huge but at the same time if someone it
can sell if someone's a great seller and
they can just sell they can learn the
product ok that's one of the key things
when you can get to interview at Google
please understand the product understand
what Google does understand what we saw
and you know there's a lot of people who
who know that you know there's a lot of
people out there that want to work for
people come to Google but you need to be
passionate about Google and understand
what Google is all about it's not just
coming to work at Google and you know
getting the benefits that we get the
free food or or getting um you know the
bowling alley that we have here on site
or the rock climbing or the halfpipe
those are great benefits but again it's
about your passion about our products
and how do you see house I would just
add to that
um I've hired people from diverse
backgrounds including finance
which you may think is far from sales
but you know these people on the on the
side that they they may manage an
AdWords account you know for their
family member and be familiar with that
there's even an ad word
you know quiz you can take online to
test your proficiency and learn more
about it so just getting immersed in our
products in ways outside of maybe your
daily job it's important to highlight
that sort of thing to us too because
that shows if that shows the passion
that Michelle's referring to great great
yeah so we have a couple more minutes
left and we've got a new question coming
I thought that was pretty good so I'm
going to put you on the spot with this
one I hope you don't mind I have 10 plus
years experience including management
experience if I wanted to join Google
what position level would you recommend
would you recommend taking a small step
back in order to get in the door with
Google and work your way back up and
that question comes from Phil in
Louisville Kentucky so I guess you know
the heart of the question is how
important is it to kind of match one's
level when when when looking for jobs at
Google well it's more we could to share
this because I'm sure that you probably
have quite a few with that a
misunderstanding here at Google that
outside of Google we're such a flat
company and we don't really care too
much about titles it's how you perform
and how well you do here that's the key
um it again it's important to read the
job description that you're applying for
to understand where you're fit don't
worry about the title it's definitely
it's the it's kind of the core the work
that we're asking you to do that is what
you want to look for Margaret do you
want to add to that yeah I mean to that
point I think it's just important decide
to decide what your personal goals are I
mean if your goal is to be a people
manager because we're so flat we may not
have you know an opening for a people
manager at that level but we do hire
senior sales people and people who make
who are career sellers so it would just
like Michelle said you know just make
sure that you haven't that there's a job
opening that you're interested in and
and that you know you would be excited
about and we can get the conversation
started great
well this has been really good
information I mean I think people
learned a lot about our resume process
and our interview process here so any
any last words of wisdom for aspiring
sales Googlers Michelle well you know I
just want to say just look online don't
be afraid to apply give us a chance and
again if you're creative you're a
self-starter take a look at our website
and apply great Margot I would agree
with that and I would also say you know
I mentioned change at Google we're a
fast-moving company and you know our
recruiting process has changed so don't
be afraid don't don't be scared off by
any myths or anything and just yes don't
be afraid to apply we'd love to see it
great great and you know we have sales
openings in almost all of our offices
you can find them at WWE google.com/jobs
and please follow us on Google+ were the
life at Google page and you know we hope
to have more information about sales
roles and other departments and keep
doing these hangouts on air so thanks

much to Michele and to Margaret Wright
