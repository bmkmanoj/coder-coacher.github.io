senior product analyst hi my name is Wei
yang I'm a product analyst my name is
Dan Blum I'm a business analyst a
business analyst analyze data to find
different insights that will drive a
business impact and we analyze products
and we drive decisions around those
products and figure out how how to make
a product better what users like we
really want to understand our users and
your main role is to make sure we have a
really strong culture around data and
using data to inform and drive our
decisions we're all very passionate
about data we get very excited about
looking at a new data source there are
just a million questions that you have
to ask before you launch and after you
launch what are we trying to make happen
how can we prove that quantitatively and
are we confident in that right now I'm
in the youtube data science team we
guide all of YouTube on things like
product direction or experimentation and
analysis we want to make developers
successful so we look at what developers
think success looks like and try to help
them achieve that being a product
analyst at Google is unpredictable but
it's always exciting Google has a unique
scale which is very global which you're
not gonna get anywhere else so even if
you make a small improvement when you
multiply that by a billions that can
definitely be worth your time to have a
say in the direction that data science
is going is something that really sets
apart that experience at Google over
other companies
Google encourages you to you know be
open with your manager and have your
managers support you in looking for
something that is going to be fulfilling
for you professionally and personally
Google is set up as a company to allow
people to take risks in some cases
you're taking a chance at looking at
that data when the business or the rest
of the world thinks it's a gear or
ridiculous if we never try we'll never
know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
