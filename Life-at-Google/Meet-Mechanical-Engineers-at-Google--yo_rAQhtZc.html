engineer at Google my name is Michele
I'm a mechanical engineer at Google my
name is Justin Woodridge and I'm a
mechanical engineer on the Google home
team we're responsible for the part of
the product that you can touch and see
and feel and hold we design products and
we put them through manufacturing and we
test them and we iterate and we ship
them it goes from something that's just
on a white board somewhere to early
prototypes to lots of prototypes that we
test the early and then into something
that gets mass-produced and shipped to
customers so you get to see that whole
process and watch the product evolved
from just an idea to a finished product
which is pretty exciting
it's very cyclical I start up in like
architecture up front and then I'm able
to go and travel to the build travel to
visit vendors and to visit your
manufacturing sites is a great
opportunity because it helps you kind of
to put everything into action and do
lots of problem-solving and just make
everything a reality Google Hardware is
really growing and really maturing
currently so it's a great opportunity to
really be part of that I really like
this job it's challenging it gives me
great purpose it's stressful at times
mainly because of schedule and because
technology changes so fast but I love
what I do
hopefully we're working on you know the
next next thing and keep pushing the
envelope
the next product whatever that may be
could be totally different so it's nice
to always be changing when we release
products like Chromebooks or tablets or
phones you know that it's reaching so
many different users when you go out and
you see other people using your product
it's pretty cool because you can you can
take away like hey I worked on that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
