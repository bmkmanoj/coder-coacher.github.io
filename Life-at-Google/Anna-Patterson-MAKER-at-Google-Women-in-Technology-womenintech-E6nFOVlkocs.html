artist is you see a blank canvas and it
can be anything that's one of the things
that led me into computer science
because you can open up a blank file and
it can be anything and it can do
anything my dad was a NASA engineer he
used to tell us all kinds stories going
to space and you know kind of dreaming
big dreams I wanted to be a painter I
was applying for our scholarships and I
was putting together my portfolio when
my next-door neighbor came home after
studying art and she moved back in with
her parents when you're 17 you're really
dying to make sure that you can stay
away from your parents I mean stay
independent on your parents I realized
then that I should really think about
you know my other passions I didn't know
as a high school student that I had a
talent in math a lot of people out there
don't realize you know what their
talents are one of the things that led
me into computer science is you can make
things that really change people's lives
a lot of people encouraged me to go to
graduate school and so the second I got
into Stanford I felt like I won the
lottery the atmosphere at Stanford was
really that you know we are the ones
we've been waiting for things were out
there waiting to be created waiting to
be discovered waiting to be monetized we
were going to be the ones to do it
one week it got warm I asked people I
had no idea who they were
hey let's go to the beach I could not
find anyone to go so I vowed that I
would meet and make friends with the
most irresponsible people at Stanford
and that's the week I met my husband and
Sergey Brin Tom and I've been married
maybe 15 years and we have four kids
pregnancy is a really creative time and
a lot of people ask me does not mean
that you're going to be taking time away
from work and does that mean that you're
going to have to slow down and you know
what I always tell people is there's
nothing like a hard deadline it's one of
those times where you really have to get
your work done beforehand because you
never know the last few weeks when when
you're in have the baby so my first
startup was a company called ZIFT
get a few friends from graduate school
programmed it up on some angel money and
that's when the dot-com crash hit and
funding was very frozen I did have to
think when we entering the workforce
what are my strengths what are my
weaknesses what do I like what I want to
do when I started at Android it was a
sub hundred people so really felt like a
startup
and it wasn't clear that it was the
rocket ship that it became I joined
mobile because I thought it was going to
be transformative for society you know
we're at the next mobile revolution and
you know I feel very fortunate to have
started with Android when it was so
small we just shipped a new search
infrastructure on the phone that will
index all your personal data in a lot
more mobile friendly way we could index
the web in eight minutes on all the
Android phones in the world through my
work in search every time you type in a
query you're using my code every time
you use your phone you're using my code
and that means that I'm reaching
billions of people a day and it doesn't
get better than that
