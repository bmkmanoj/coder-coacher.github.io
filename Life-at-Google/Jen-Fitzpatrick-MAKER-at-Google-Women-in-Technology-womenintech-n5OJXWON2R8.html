exciting as a field to be in is because
it's your entry ticket to this world of
just amazing kind of fun opportunities
most of which probably don't even exist
yet I grew up in Wisconsin one of two
daughters as a child I was in my sandbox
and playing with my Matchbox cars and
you know building things with Legos and
I wanted to be getting my hands dirty I
wanted to be doing things my dad was
constantly giving us math problems and
little challenges and just you know
games to get us thinking about how to
use our brains I would say I started as
a student at Stanford in 1994 it really
wasn't until I got almost halfway
through college that I almost by
accident took a computer science class
and then another I really started to get
intrigued particularly by some of the
non programming parts of it and some of
the problem-solving and really kind of
piqued my curiosity and got my got my
brain excited I think in some ways
looking back I was incredibly spoiled
getting started because Google was my
first work experience I was part of our
very first summer intern class there
were four of us my dad thought I was
crazy for taking an internship at this
company I guess you know it was just
this crazy little startup and if I think
back when I started no one had heard of
Google to watch over the course of the
next several years it turned to
something that everyone had heard of and
everyone was using it was really fun to
be involved in something that was
clearly touching people's everyday lives
one of my fears was I knew that I didn't
want to be stuck at my desk
you know programming on a computer you
know eight ten hours a day every day for
the rest of my life is just not how I
saw myself it was a real pleasant
surprise to me as I did get here to
Google and start working that yes there
was an aspect of you know sort of
programming and all of these pieces but
so much of it is also collaborating with
other people and brainstorming and when
you pair that with
the programming pieces of it that's
really where the magic starts to happen
what's kept it so fun and exciting for
me is being able to work on lots and
lots of different products that anyone
can use and love and make part of their
daily life the only way you can do that
is to have people working on them that
kind of our representative of as much of
that world as you can and certainly
including some gender-balanced and so I
always felt very lucky that even in the
early days of people I'd never felt
totally isolated as a woman there were
always other women around and I think
looking back that made a big difference
I have two kids a little boy a little
girl they're four and two and in many
ways they have been a fantastic addition
to my career I can't imagine at this
point not us we're both working in and
having a family to me that's almost the
perfect balance I get to have this
incredibly sort of fun and fulfilling
you know career and days at work where
I'm surrounded by smart people and
working on huge interest in world skill
problems then I get to go home and I've
got you know two little sort of adorable
bundles of joy you show up and you know
sort of scream Bobby right and you get a
big hug and you know that's that that
that's fun and a whole a whole different
way
you
