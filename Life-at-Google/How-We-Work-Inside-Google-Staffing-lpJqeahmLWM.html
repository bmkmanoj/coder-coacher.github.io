so excited to have you with us for the
next hour we're gonna spend some time
together really dig in inside Google
staffing tell you all a little bit more
about how we work who we are what we do
my name is Kyle Ewing I'm the director
of talent and outreach programs here at
Google been here almost 12 years my team
really starts with the belief that
future Googlers are everywhere and it's
our job to connect with them where they
are whether that's on campus or an
industry research conference grow any
skills they need to be at Google and
hire them when they're ready I'm joined
by two colleagues Olga and Anthony and
I'll let them introduce themselves now
great hi everyone and thanks Kyle my
name is Olga Donnelly and I'm a director
for staffing teams that look after
hiring for a sales organization but also
for GNA M I joined Google in 2005 in our
Dublin office which is Google's European
headquarters and three years ago I moved
over to Mountain View which is Google's
headquarters and to take on this
position and so I worked as a recruiter
and I was also hrbp for an for a while
and back in Dublin and yeah I'll hand it
over time Tony great thank you
my name is Anthony Abraham I look after
our staffing channels organization and
what our staffing channels organization
is focused on is really looking for
talent in the marketplace it's starting
to build discussions in relationship
with that talent to understand how they
might actually fit into Google and what
their aspirations are I'm going forward
and I've been in the role for one year
now newbee let's let's see what we've
got in store for you today we're gonna
spend some time on Google Staffing's
mission in our structure really talk
about how we built Google some of the
core values that we have in staffing in
the roles that we have we're gonna share
some opportunities to join our staffing
team we look forward to hopefully
working with you all someday and then
we've got some time for live questions
at the end and because this is a live
event you can submit your questions in
the chat throughout the event and we'll
make sure we have time to get to as many
of those as we can so let's get started
by talking about the mission of Google
Staffing well start with the mission of
Google which has really stood the test
of time we hit 20 years later this year
and our mission as a company is to
organize the world's information make it
universally accessible and useful pretty
ambitious and the role of Google
staffing is really to hire the very best
town in the world to help Google achieve
that audacious mission so when we think
about the roles that we hire for across
the company you've got the engineering
function whether that's a software
engineer a product manager UX design and
the list goes on the global business
organization which Olga touched on our
sales and marketing function and then of
course the GNA functions of which Google
staffing is part of so ultimately in
Google staffing our mission is really
finding that talent cultivating those
relationships and then hiring them for
Google so Anthony can you share a little
bit about what makes Google's approach
to staffing unique yeah from my vantage
point what makes them Google's approach
the staffing really unique is that we
focus not only on the short term but
then also on the long term as both you
know the references we got started this
morning we look for opportunities to
actually not only understand where
talent is but also understand how we can
engage in building and developing that
talent for the future and then also
maintaining those relationships as they
move throughout different experiences in
their career and I find that to be a
very unique approach that we have
because it really is about knowing the
individual where they're at and kind of
understanding what is the right time and
place for them to kind of initiate if
you will their relationship and
engagement with Google so I find that
incredibly you know different and unique
and at the same point that teams
continue to innovate you know one of the
things that I you know it's just really
inspiring for me to see about the
organization is really looking for
individuals that are gonna act as
co-owners through the organization and
actually help develop us for the future
in the right way so it's not only what
they do but also how they show up
culturally and building the organization
as well well let's touch on that a
little bit let's talk about some of the
people that really bring this work to
life so there's obviously lots of teams
across staffing a couple of which you
know I think we can each be somewhat of
experts on but Anthony maybe tell us a
little more about the staffing channels
specialist role and really the
that they're able to have yeah when I
think about the staffing channels the
staffing channel specialist role in the
way I explain it to folks is that they
are you know some of the first people
that a candidate meets from Google if
you will right and the whole focus of
the staffing channel specialists is to
understand like the background of that
individual to really actually get to
know them as a person right so it's not
just about you know that kind of one
interaction that we're having but
actually getting much more detail around
what their stories and what's kind of
built and gotten them to the point
they're at because at that point we're
really able to collaborate and partner
with our staffing partners on providing
much more rich information about the
candidate that actually helps our
staffing partners and their mandate
going forward awesome
and Olga tell us a little more about the
recruiter role I mean you've been in
this org for a long time obviously
really passionate about recruiting so
tell us a little bit about why so um
well I'm a recruiter true and true so I
think the the great thing about the role
of the recruiter is that we act as
advocates for the company and for our
business leaders but we also act as
advocates for the candidates because it
can be a little bit overwhelming when
you apply for a role at Google you want
to have a friendly face that is working
with you as you navigate the hiring
process and somebody that truly is an
advocate for you your skills and how
those skills then can transfer into a
role and into a role at Google and the
recruiters also acts as a consultant and
a trusted advisor and so would work very
closely with our business leaders to
help them think through you know what is
the talent that I need to bring into
into my organization where could the
skills gaps be how do I want to think
about reaching out into the marketplace
and and identifying those folks so truly
the role of the recruiter like they you
know they play both sides which is
amazing and and very magical and and and
very special absolutely and then you
both have touched a little bit on how we
really partner with the business so
there's I think you know I've been here
almost 12 years and there
has been a real transition I think in
our approach in terms of really
consulting with the business not only
where they are now and what they might
need today but planting those seeds of
talent for the future as we look at huge
areas of growth in Google's business new
lines of business completely so tell me
a little more about how we really
partner with the business to find talent
I don't want to so and I can give you
actually an example so when I started in
the Dublin office I think we had about a
hundred people working in in Dublin and
we had unlimited growth right so we work
very closely with our hiring managers
with our business leaders to understand
ask questions actually what is the what
is the business plan and business
strategy what are the growth aspirations
and how do we link the business
objectives and the business strategy to
the talent strategy you have to bring
the two of them together because they
can't work in isolation of of one
another and so I think it is spending
time with with the business spending
time with our clients almost becoming a
part and extend a part of the team and
so joining team meetings understanding
what are some of the drivers and then
really just trying to connect connect
the the people part in that and the
business part and you know to be a to be
a great consultant and to be great
trusted advisor you need to be a really
good listener as well so truly and truly
listening to what some of the needs are
and then be able to kind of connect
those dots and understand the context
and some of the nuance in terms of where
we want to get to and yeah that's that's
what I've seen work before in the past
anything about you know how we kind of
other ways that we influence business
leaders yeah yeah I mean I love all this
point on being able to listen mmm
because one of the things we think about
influencing where the business is headed
forward and how talent may feed into
that it really drives us listening in
two dimensions so the first area that we
need to listen to is actually as Oba
mentioned the strategy and where the
business is headed forward but one of
the things that I think Google does
uniquely well as we're able to listen to
actually what we're hearing with our
candidates in the discussions that we
have and there's a tremendous amount of
focus that's actually spent on building
those personal relationship
and as those conversations are coming
back we start to gain insight on where
is talent in the marketplace how is
talent growing and that actually starts
to you know bubble up a couple of things
that were able to actually sit with not
only our staffing counterparts but then
also with the businesses on how should
we actually think about where their
opportunities to build talent
differently or actually to find out in
the marketplace that we may not have
looked at before mm-hmm absolutely when
I think about a lot of like I'd
mentioned a lot of the areas of growth
that we're heading into now the business
is really looking to us as the ones
who've we've been on the front lines we
kind of have a pulse on the market and
then look into us of like how can we
grow this talent how can we bring this
in and I think one really unique thing
about the way we work in staffing it's a
bunch of different teams you know
working together and like let's just
talk a little bit about how all of us
work together on a pretty regular basis
and just what are some of those really
core values that drive Google Staffing's
work and some of our collaboration I
think for me the you know the first
piece that's just really exciting is
that everyone does act as a owner within
the organization so what I love is that
whether it's some of my organization
your organization and all this
organization everyone is focused on that
ultimate objective which is actually
bringing great talent in for Google that
will help build Google for the future
and it's a way our team's partner
because people will say something hey I
noticed something over here that we
might do differently or something that
we could expand and do differently and
I'd love actually seeing that come
through from our teams because it really
highlights that even though they sit in
separate organizations that they're
actually operating as one team
definitely let's talk a little bit about
community I think there's like internal
community there's external community and
the important role that we have in
staffing in in terms of really building
building on the culture that that has
made Google what it is for the last 20
years so do you wanna talk a little bit
about some of the community building
efforts that we have I'm here yeah
absolutely so and I think it's one of
the things that I'm I'm really valuing
I'm most proud of is Google's investment
in the
and that's everything from helping
communities get online to the month-long
efforts we do around Google serve where
people can get involved in passions and
interests and help bring their skills
and expertise to others right that won't
naturally or might be exposed to it so I
think that that's that's been truly
awesome and also we have really good
communities inside of Google as well
through our ERG s or employee resource
groups and really being active and
involved in terms of building that
environment where everyone feels like
they belong and everyone feels that they
can thrive and I think I'm very proud of
the efforts that I you know my team I
get involved in as well and but just the
freedom the openness to be able to do
that I think is just very very special
and quite magical about Google that sets
it apart absolutely I think it's it is
pretty exciting when you think about the
role that we have and been building this
company tremendous growth that Google
has in front of us and you know we won't
be able to build the products that we
need to really serve all of the users
around the world if we don't bring in
the right folks so I think it's a pretty
awesome opportunity and let's talk
through again you you just hit your
one-year mark congratulations no longer
a new blur and we've been here for a
while but I'd love to hear Olga maybe
tell us a little bit about how you've
developed your career over the last 12
plus years yeah so and I joined as a
contractor and as I mentioned earlier in
the in the opening I joined in our
Dublin office and and I worked as an
individual contributor I was a recruiter
and then I got converted to a permanent
recruiter and a full-time opportunity
and one of the areas that I was able to
kind of think about when I was growing
my career was I was always looking for
opportunities to fix things right
there's tons of opportunities as tons of
challenges and I was just always
intrigued about like trying new things
and you know sometimes it worked and
sometimes it didn't but it was a huge
learning opportunity I was able to
progress my career and
and I took on some people management
responsibilities and then I decided to
make a bit of a pivot and I had been in
staffing for so many years I wanted to
try something completely different and
so when opportunity came up to take on
an assignment and that was to be a hater
business partner which you know which I
jumped at and I did that for ten months
and that was the assignment and peace
and I learned a ton and during that time
but I also learned a ton about myself
during that time and I am a recruiter
true and true because I absolutely love
the the role of the recruiter I mean
because you know it's it's an art and
it's a science at the same time and so
it's a science in that you know we can
dig in and we can have a look at metrics
and we can have a look at an analytics
and we can figure out ways and identify
you know through pattern recognition to
tweaking and to tweaking things like we
could do we can do take in a different
direction over here but it's also an art
as well because like truly you're
talking to the most amazing people
you're trying to seek out and find the
most amazing people and to try to make
some magic happen book for the candidate
and for an inferred the for the for the
hiring team and and then I guess the big
kind of like change that I made to to my
career was taking the opportunity over
here in the u.s. I had always worked in
Europe and I wanted to do something
completely different I wanted to work
out of a headquarters and I wanted to
have an experience working in the u.s.
it's very different from working in
Europe and I'm learning a lot about
myself but also a lot about you know the
cultural differences of working in the
US and I feel that I'm growing as a
leader in that regard so it's been it's
been one hell of a journey but it has
been something that has been and every
day is different and that's what I love
every day is different and there's so
many different challenges and huge
opportunities that keep you really
excited something kind of cool yeah no
boredom over here get excited about so
Anthony tell us a little bit about how
you think about your team's longer-term
career development to manage a large org
yeah you know really when I think about
my teams you know development how they
grow over the long term
I'm really trying to tap into exactly
what just came out of what you know Ola
said in its and it's fine I actually
still have a little bit of chills
because it's like that raw excitement
right of the growth and actually being
able to interface and different
opportunities and different challenges
and how you're kind of growing and
developing yourself so the way I look at
development for my teams is how are we
actually kind of helping them understand
where there are those opportunities for
additional growth and similar what Olga
said I think you know sometimes it means
being in a different region sometimes it
means being in another organization I
think it's making sure that there are a
whole host of options where someone can
stretch and grow right because I think
not only are they you know developing
themselves to be able to do something
different there's also this awareness
and discovery that comes out that I
think it's just you know quite
remarkable to the individual so that's
how I think about you know career
development across my team and
essentially what we're trying to do is
have thousands of people actually arrive
at the point that hold it just walk
through where there's that excitement
and that magic on how they're going to
contribute to the organization and move
forward yeah I think just just to add to
that as well I think one of the things
I'm very like I feel great about with
within the staffing organization is that
we set up opportunities for folks to
take on you know six-week developmental
opportunities where they can apply to go
to you know a different region or or a
different state and onto a different
team you know within the within the
staffing community and and work on an
initiative and that's been really cool
because I've actually seen some amazing
growth and learning up potential in
folks when they've really leaned into
that opportunity and decided it it's
something different because you learned
so much about yourself when you're
you're taken out of your familiar
surroundings right with your team or
what you're used to doing and just
jumping in and kind of trying to do
something new and something different
and it's it's cool and it's been great
to see not only the folks who've been
able to grow their own career by these
new opportunities but when they come
back with like a new Khan appreciation
for a channel specialist role that
recruiting
coordinators role a staffing analyst
role it's like all of a sudden our world
that's gotten pretty big as we've grown
becomes so much smaller yeah and then
somebody becomes more than just an email
asking you for something so I feel that
this org regardless of how big we get
we've really found some awesome ways to
keep us feeling really small yes and
keep us so connected to the work that
we're doing how it ties into googles
mission but connected to each other and
that's been pretty awesome but to see
overtime so let's talk about hopefully
the question you're all asking how do
you get a job on Google staffing team
we're gonna talk through some of the
some of the overall things I'm gonna
hand it over to Anthony in a second
we've got opportunities all around the
world and in the United States here most
of our roles especially um in in the
core kind of staffing roles are
available in the Bay Area in Austin
Seattle New York Boulder and a few more
and I'm gonna let Anthony now share
about the core attributes that we assess
for when considering someone for a role
in the staffing organization great thank
you so we're looking at the staffing
organization there are four areas that
we primarily assess folks against so
what I'll do is actually kind of walk
through kind of each of those areas so
the first one is we assess like how a
candidate thinks and think about that as
the general cognitive ability and the
reason that we do that is as you noted
from an older walk through her career
journey as Kyle's talked about people
transitioning across different orgs you
know within our staffing organization
that really what we're recruiting for is
not someone that is going to stay kind
of in one organization that someone that
can actually move across multiple teams
within our organization so we're
actually kind of testing for that how
comfortable someone with moving into a
new area that they may have not worked
in before because the clouds' point
that's what keeps us not only kind of
close and tight but it also allows us to
build people in a way in which they
think across one team versus the
individual organization that they're in
the second area that's really important
for us is as well as we think about
someone's leadership and one of the
things I would say about leadership it
goes beyond as somebody you know
formally
led a team it's more of given the
opportunity that someone's had how have
they actually showed up so we see folks
that have had formal opportunities kind
of leading others we also see folks that
have worked at as individual
contributors but have actually led in an
informal way you know that was one of
the things through all those example
when she talked about looking for things
that were broken and actually figuring
out how you engage in those like you
actually need to rally and bring other
people around with you and and that's
leadership right so we look for all of
those different signals in someone's
background on where are the types of
ways that they've actually led the third
area that we look for is actually
someone's role related knowledge and
even though we move people around and we
you know want to kind of have folks that
can do multiple things we also want to
know that there's a really good
foundation there right of where someone
is very good in the craft that they've
spent a large portion of their time in
so we actually test for that like how
good is somebody in their a specific
area of expertise and depth and then
finally the fourth area that we touch
for and people will often ask is is
googliness and then yeah like what does
that mean and you know the way I act
often you know kind of think about
googliness when we're looking for
individuals is what is someone's
orientation right is their orientation
on the collective version on the self
and I think when someone's actually
oriented on the collective that that's
actually what googliness is because
you're actually thinking about what am I
going to do that kind of benefits the
massive benefits everyone because for us
the magic happens when we're all working
together and working as one team and
it's very hard for somebody to do that
if they're just oriented on themselves
that we want some people that are
oriented on the collective and what the
collective can actually do for everyone
so that's how I've kind of termed
kuleana so those are really kind of four
areas that we look at and I'll
transition it over to Olga to talk a bit
more about our hiring process cool great
thanks so what does the hiring process
look like well first of all it's not
essentially a process I like to describe
it as an experience and because it is
truly a set of conversations and that
you're going to be having with the
recruiters and with various different
team members and indeed a hiring manager
as well so in terms of the applications
so
as soon as we get an application the
recruiter is going to reach out and
schedule some time to have a
conversation and that conversation is
either over the phone or over a Google
hangout and depending on on kind of like
what what the preference is and really
that's to learn a little bit more and
about you about your interests and to
talk to you a little bit about the the
role itself or multiple roles because
usually we're considering people for a
multitude of a multitude of positions
and assuming and you know folks are
interested in moving forward and what we
would do then is we invite people on
site and so there you get to meet we'd
have four different interviews and
they're all on a one-to-one basis and
that's an opportunity for you to come
on-site at Google right and to really
kind of experience Google and the magic
of Google but also to meet with some
folks that you potentially will be
working with as well right so you're
assessing them just as much as they're
assessing you essentially and after that
stage and the application goes through a
review by a committee which is a bunch
of folks that have not been involved in
the in the hiring process and or hiring
experience and who will make a decision
on if we're going to go forward with
with an offer and then we get to make
the offer which which is awesome so the
entire kind of like time and and the
length in that in that experience is
determined really by by you the
candidate and so we will move at your
pace as fast as or as slow as you want
to move forward too and yeah and then we
go from there
and then hopefully you come on site and
have an amazing career at Google
hopefully and now we're gonna actually
go ahead and just transition to some of
the live questions that you've all been
submitting and if you haven't had a
chance yet go ahead and submit those now
let's see here okay so what is the
biggest misconception about Google's
hiring process I'll call it hiring
experience or a big misconception about
working and staffing like six months no
okay no so I definitely think that
the that kind of like the number of
interviews and and the time it takes I
think there's a huge misconception
because truly we can move at speed I
mean we can close an offer in a week
with somebody so again it's very kind of
dictated in terms of what how fast the
candidates want to go through and in
terms of your own availability so I
think that that would be a huge huge
misconception also around the types of
questions that we ask during during the
interviews so and you know we don't ask
brain teasers or anything like that
we're trying to dig in and get to what
Antony talked about earlier which is
around kind of like the core attributes
of the core skills and we can get them
through just asking regular questions
yeah good good good good let's see here
how do you strike the balance between
polls personal cultivation and broader
recruitment marketing so for example
hiring fairs versus head hunting versus
referrals to bring the right people in
that's a really good question I'll start
off if I think about the work that my
team does and I've seen a pretty big
evolution over the years from you know
one we want to make sure that we are
scouring the world to find the very best
talent and we know that that talent
doesn't always show up to the career
fair that talent doesn't always go to a
certain school or a certain conference
so it's really important to us that
we're casting the widest net and then
we're really honing in on a targeted
kind of skill set and ultimately
creating those those relationships
Anthony touched on in the beginning you
know this is a journey it's it's a
candidate's journey in their career and
we might talk to you today you might not
be ready to come to Google for two three
five years and it's really important to
us that we're able to create an
organization that encourages the time
that it takes to really cultivate and
develop those relationships so to answer
that question a little bit more
succinctly I'd say that it's important
that we're casting the widest net
possible but really using what we've
learned over the last couple decades in
this space to target our strategies even
more deeply on where we know you know
folks folks are so we can meet them
where they are really help develop any
skills that they need and then hire when
they're ready anything that you too want
to add on kind of the personal
cultivation versus their really broader
like more
that we need to do I mean the one thing
that I would add especially you know
coming in you know someone new alright
is that I think what Google does really
well in this space is doing all of them
really well right I think I've you know
seen where it can be easy to focus on if
it's a hiring Fair or if you're head
hunting or if you're just you know doing
what firls but not only the way that the
organization is pulled together and
constructed you know provide us a way to
do all of those really well the way that
we actually kind of develop and move
talent across the organization actually
allows us to do that well as well too so
you know we have folks that have done
referral events that you know end up in
programming or we have folks that you
know have been you know building
candidate relationships that move into
recruiting so it's all of you know the
movement across the organization that I
think allows us to do all three really
well which is really unique and
interesting to see one other thing I'm
just thinking about we really have we've
really prioritized the investment in
that long-term relationship and I think
that that that we really do stand out in
that way I think back to just one of the
programs that my team runs for incoming
freshmen so these are like high school
kids and ultimately we know that you
know the tech industry isn't really
where it should be in terms of
representing the talent market
representing our users and the
communities where we operate so this
program that started about ten years ago
now was for incoming freshmen to expose
folks typically underrepresented to
computer science that was a pretty big
gamble and we're willing to say you know
they're not gonna graduate from college
even for four years but now ten years
later we're finding this is really
increased retention in computer science
and it's it's an investment that we've
always prioritized and that makes me
really proud to be in a place that's a
bit a bit less reactive like clearly we
have to react to the immediate need hire
hire the right people and plan for the
future which is great good stuff and I
think I might have just answered this
but okay tell us more about proactive
sourcing and strategies that you've seen
be effective do sorcerer's partner with
Google's business leaders so maybe you
can take that yeah absolutely and I
think when you think about the way our
sorcerous partner with business leaders
you know here again it's in actually
understanding via listening what are
they trying to kind of achieve with
their actual businesses and
understanding not only where talent
exists in the marketplace but how we
might actually get a sense of finding
talent in different areas you know some
of the things that we've done here that
I think it just really kind of
interesting is you know we'll look at
different coding challenges that might
give us exposure to folks that didn't
formerly go through a you know
university driven you know program but
are actually really good coders right
and it's a way for us that kind of
uncover if you will where those
individuals are out in the marketplace
so I think by listening to our
businesses and our staffing partners in
conjunction together it allows us to
really kind of think about doing some
creative things like that because we
have a much tighter lens on what those
businesses are actually looking for need
for the future so then we can actually
try some things that are a bit more
innovative and creative because we know
exactly what we're looking for what
they're looking for
why is diversity and inclusion important
to you as staffing leaders what steps
are your teams taking to diversify your
pipelines to Google do you want to take
that I can jump in yeah no and so why is
it important well I mean if you think
about what Google does right it's about
building building products for everybody
and so you need to have you know a
diverse set of perspectives in the room
that are creating those products and
working with our communities so I think
number one I think that that's really
important from my own personal
perspective though and I think it's
about it's it's it's important that we
reflect the community communities in
which we operate truly is important I've
you know I mentioned to you a little bit
earlier about when I move from Europe to
the US it's very different very
different culturally very different
perspectives very and it was a learning
opportunity and I think I have
personally grown and as a as a human and
as a person
- and be open to even more perspectives
and I think that that is something that
I get from having different people
around the table different thoughts
different and different insights so I
think I I would look at it very
personally as well as kind of like what
we're doing - to build products for
everybody yeah and I think if I'll just
build on some of the some of the
tactical steps that we're taking across
staffing to really diversify pipelines
for Google I mentioned a few programs
that that we run for you know as early
as we would go back to elementary school
for things like Google science fair and
Summer of Code and these are all ways to
expose folks that might not have the
opportunity like what what is in
computer science and and what could a
career in tech look like so I think
diversifying in the tech industry it's
something that we're really really
passionate about here and then
ultimately if I think through as a
staffing leader like I obviously lead an
organization of folks from all kinds of
backgrounds and it is so important to me
that everybody who comes into Google has
an experience where they feel truly
supported where they can truly thrive
and a lot of that goes back to like how
we all show up as leaders the
opportunities that we provide and then
ultimately I think I like really
understanding the the critical role that
we play in like what will Google look
like in five years and actually like I
can tell you that we will be more
representative of the talent market we
will be more representative of our users
in our communities because we've been
taking these and making these
investments and we've been you know
building out these programs and
cultivating these relationships for the
better part of a decade so I'm
personally so proud to kind of see us in
five years time and see that it that it
really does look different than it does
now okay what makes you nervous about
leading Google's hiring efforts and what
keeps you excited Oh nurse well well I I
have one but it's and it's you know I'm
nervous and excited about it and so you
know we're diversifying the company's
diversifying and significantly and so
we're moving into the hardware business
we've got the client business and I'm
excited uncomfortably excited about our
growth and so we're you know going to
have a big hiring year this year and
we've a lot of work to do and I think
that that is something that I am yeah
that we think is gonna be a huge
opportunity but also challenging in
terms of how we're going to strive to
hit that because you know when you think
about the role of the recruiter and
we're frontline in terms of helping hire
folks that are launching new products
and hardware or building out our cloud
business and so that has that's yeah
yeah I'm terribly excited yeah how about
you absolutely so I think somewhat Olga
I mean when you think about you know
just the amount of growth right that
we're chasing after for the organization
but I think also in combination with
that growth also knowing that from a
staffing organization perspective that
we are some of the initial folks if you
will that inform the cultural basis of
the organization so not only
understanding that yeah we're gonna grow
but making sure that we grow in the
right way with the right folks that's
the excitement in the in the stress
because that I think it's a remarkable
you know opportunity that the businesses
and Google in general is entrusted with
this organization right it's not only
build us but build us in the right way
and reinforce our culture and like those
are the things that you know get me
excited but then also are the things
that make me nervous
[Laughter]
so we we've kind of covered all the live
questions that have come through but I'd
love to kind of hear like again from
from each of you like what are you
really most excited about we're growing
you know in a huge huge way what what
are you most excited about for the
coming year really in terms of seeing
your team's grow the way that you need
them to I think it's for me it's about
bringing new talent on board and kind of
like creating next generation recruiters
and and bringing people in who are
excited about that opportunity and that
potential people who want to you know
break new ground
try different things and who were
interested in social who were interested
in getting out there more and more in
the community and yeah just that
different that different perspectives so
um you know as I mentioned you know
staffing is really at the forefront of
Google and the ability to and the
opportunity to have huge impact on the
company and the growth of the company
and the direction that we're taking I
think is you know super yeah it's super
exciting for me you know for me I would
say that what really gets me excited is
not only the space we play in but what
we do and then the way Google does it
right so when I think about the tech
space overall it's pretty interesting
because it is this space where there is
an opportunity for people that might not
went through a certain school might not
have had certain training it actually
arrives that were you able to kind of
build the skill let you need it and
actually kind of put it in the right way
right therefore you know the people that
we touch right from the standpoint that
our products touch users all over the
world right it affords us this
opportunity to really change communities
that people live in right and do that at
this tremendous scale right and what
kind of excites me about what we're
headed into this year is the ability to
continue to do that and do that even a
you know much larger scale because you
change people's lives their communities
and as a default of that you have the
ability to change the world right so
that's what actually makes me really
excited about what we do
hopefully you want to join us in our in
our excited efforts thank you so much
