I am a hardware reliability engineer
little hair that's good a hardware
engineer works on something that's
physical I'm uh RF antenna engineers I
design our systems and antennas I do
black magic at Google actually literally
because we are dealing with invisible
waves so we have a Google group named
black magic so in my role there are kind
of three parts of it figure out how a
user will use a product create a test
that will simulate that users use figure
out what happened when a product breaks
in that test scenario
working as a hardware engineer at Google
it feels like working in a start-up but
with the good support I worked on
several products in my time at Google
one of which was the Explorer version of
glass we have a real impact on normal
users hardware is a perfect timing thing
at Google it's broadening as you've seen
more and more hardware products come out
of Google I have a PhD in chemistry from
MIT I worked on making solar cells out
of nanoparticles and now I do almost
nothing related at all to that the
people that Google tends to hire are
very interested in a lot of different
things and want to keep learning
engineer have the freedom to work on any
projects or ideas my teammates are the
best they are smart and competent and
curious working here is never boring you
have a lot of adventures I like feeling
like a contributor to something that
people interact with on a regular basis
and it makes their lives better by
organizing their information and making
it accessible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
