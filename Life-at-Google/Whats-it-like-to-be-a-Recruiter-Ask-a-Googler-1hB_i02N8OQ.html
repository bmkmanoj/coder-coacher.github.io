recruiter at Google as a recruiter I
would say I'm a relationship manager as
well as problem solver and I often
worked with not just external cannabis
but also Google's internal partners and
everyone who is involved with the
overall hiring process from the next
year of perspective you guide candidates
throughout Google's recruitment process
and basically this can be anything from
the initial outreach about getting their
interest in Google to expand offering
explains than what that involves from an
internal perspective that involves
working with hiring teams to evaluate
what their business needs are and create
data based solutions that meet these
goals
no day is the same for recruiter but on
a regular basis I'm communicating with
candidates at different stages of the
process
partnering with internal hiring teams
who were looking for talent for as well
as checking in with team members who are
helping us with different hiring process
at that given time as a recruiter it's
not just about the relationship
management piece but also the
problem-solving component so for that
reason we need individuals who are
organized can think outside the box come
up with new creative ideas have
attention to detail and think about the
experience that we provide to everyone
involved with the recruiting process
from the candidate to the internal
hiring manager you might be working with
I like being a recruiter because of the
impact I have on the business and
helping grow internal teams at Google I
also like the problem sama component
which regularly expands my skills and of
course I like the impact I have on
individual candidates you really do
change people's lives and that's
something I don't take for granted
think about the problem-solving skills
you have the influencing skills you've
used before as well as the impact that
you've made on the organization's you've
been involved with those are all great
skills that we look for and recruiters
