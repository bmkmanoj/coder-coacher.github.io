throw you in headfirst and what I like
about that is it gives you a sense of
the type of responsibility that you can
rise to I am a product manager at Google
I came in through the associate product
manager program and what I do is I work
with engineers designers marketing legal
public relations and we basically just
work on making products happen the
process of taking a set of technology
and turning it into a user experience
means that you have to define a product
the APM program is taking people that
have lots of different experiences and
putting them in situations where they
get to you know build a product so the
product manager has this really artful
roll in the middle has to understand all
these different aspects and has to work
together with the other teams to build
something which is truly amazing you
actually have this rotation where you
get to spend a year kind of getting your
legs at Google and then you go and
search to find what might be your home
for the next couple of years you are
able to talk and and see so many
different parts of the business
primarily you'll be working with
engineers or design but a large part of
your job is also working on
commercialization of a product so I
started at Google on the Google search
team my biggest project that I worked on
was actually joining the Google Instant
team within the last four months before
I got launched and what I worked on
there
was our internationalization I was
basically the one who got to say okay
we're going to be launching these
countries being able to have access to
this huge product that is Google search
was something I never would have thought
myself capable of instant was an
interesting case because for many years
we had tried to make a faster and faster
search experience and then somebody got
the idea what happens if we could put
pages up as you type characters and
instant was an incredible technical
challenge to be able to do
but it also was addressing a user need
what's the fastest I can get a result to
our users for every person it's just
maybe a couple of seconds but those are
really meaningful seconds when you
multiply that at Google scale then you
start to get into hours weeks months
years and that's when you also start to
really feel like wow I really made a
difference like I just saved the world
years is a pretty cool thing to be able
to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
