Emily Moxley I'm David rip Hagan my name
is Ken Lu my name is Richard run Jen my
name is Jeremy Johnson and I'm a product
manager product managers at Google are
responsible for deciding what to build
being a product manager is like being
peanut butter you have to spread
yourself everywhere and just get the job
done the product manager gets to dream
up the future and then gets to help try
to shape it with engineers with
designers everybody at the company
together building what the future looks
like and one of the things that we have
to be constantly aware of is the fact
that our products are global the biggest
perk of my job is the impact that I'm
able to have I'm able to build things
that I use my friends use my family uses
there's nothing scarier than watching
your family using your product but it's
also a tremendous opportunity as well
you have access to the best technology
in the world some of the best engineers
in the world and the scope especially
for a product manager is massive there's
very few places in the world where you
can go and have impact on buildings in
people's lives one of the first things I
noticed when I joined Google was just
how much I loved the people that I
worked with I've never seen so many
different people who are all like
extremely smart but have different
viewpoints I think that's that's googly
to being googly means to never assume
that you know everything to be googly
means that you're both nerdy but fun I
love cats and a lot of product
management and actually both things come
together on my sure that I bought while
I was on a work ship in Japan technical
but grounded you get to do a little bit
of everything whatever it takes to try
to make your project successful and have
a really positive fun attitude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
