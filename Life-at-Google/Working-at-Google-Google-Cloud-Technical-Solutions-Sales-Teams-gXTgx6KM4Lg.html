I lead our global SMB your online sales
team for G suite and I'm really excited
to welcome you to YouTube live for this
Google cloud fireside chat thank you for
bearing with us and being patient um
we're excited to get started and we'll
dive in um but so why are we here we're
here to first of all connect with you to
get for you the opportunity to know some
of our leaders in clouds we have proved
here today which I'll get to to share
some of the exciting things that are
happening in Google cloud and then
really most importantly to be able to
hopefully answer some of the questions
you have about Google cloud what we're
doing so today we're looking to have
Bruce portolan here with us hi everyone
Bruce is a technical solutions director
within Google cloud so he runs a team of
customer engineers and they help our
customers through their entire journey
to the cloud starting with the technical
evaluation the evaluation of solutions
just deciding what would our cloud
solutions is best for them and then
onboarding into Google cloud Bruce has
been with Google for 11 years and
Counting
so he's really seen that Google evolve
over the years as well as Google cloud
and prior to this he spent time at
Verity filenet and General Dynamics
Bruce hails from the great state of
Texas and his hobby one of his hobbies
is smoking brisket so if we have time
you we can hear from him some of his
techniques or recipes but two quick
housekeeping things first and you'll
notice in the description there's an
RSVP link so please if you've not yet
filled this out do so so that we can
keep in touch with you after this and
and then secondly as a reminder we'll
have folks monitoring the chat on the
video so please feel free to ask your
questions throughout and then we'll
address those during the Q&amp;amp;A session at
the end um but just to start with you
Bruce
so um cloud is is hot right now a cloud
can mean a lot of things to a lot of
people but um if you talk about you know
why is it so exciting right now at this
moment
sure yep so is I know I look incredibly
young but I've been in the industry for
a while and
so opportunities like this don't come
along very often about generally one per
generation where you see these major
movements in enterprise computing so
mainframes cloud to client-server the
internet revolution Louisville etc and
so you're seeing what's probably the
biggest mass migration of IT in the
history of mankind are the history of IT
and so that's exciting to see what we
can do to help really transform
businesses as they discover not only how
can they offload a lot of that compute
infrastructure to the cloud but think
about how to do things in different ways
if I could do two at the same time
there's actually I think a second
revolution that's taking place almost
simultaneously and that's the area of
machine learning which we'll talk about
I'm sure a little bit later but really
democratizing the accessibility of
machine learning to business is to use
to solve their problems in ways that
perhaps they have any thought of before
so the tools are really starting to get
accessible to more and more users as
opposed to being in the realm of data
scientist is where it typically has been
in the past yeah she learning front I
think that's it's exciting as a Googler
to see the power of machine learning for
us in our work and that then we can
bring it to our customers as well so
many of you know we had a large
conference called next a couple of weeks
ago here in San Francisco the really
great turnout and a lot of really
exciting announcements on the product
side
so Bruce kind of you know being at max
and kind of understanding the wealth of
announcements and new releases we have
what for you or the two most exciting
things um so I think the one that got
the most news in Oz and I agree with it
was probably the announcement of the
video machine learning based API the
ability to essentially stream a video
through a machine learning algorithm
that's pre-built to look for entities
within the video itself and tag it along
the way it has a lot of possibilities in
a lot of different industries there's a
massive video archive out there for a
lot of companies that I think it could
really leverage the sort of technology
to their benefit the second one is
probably cloud spanner which was
announced just a little bit before next
but essentially the ability to to scale
horizontally sequel based databases with
consistency globally is just something
that just
has never been able to accompany has
never been able to accomplish before so
for us to do that as a managed service I
think this is really exciting capability
that we've brought to to the market and
if I can cheat that a third one yeah I
would say that it's may not be the
headline grabber a headline grabber per
se but the jam board to me was one of
the most interesting things for anybody
who uses whiteboards on a regular basis
in a team setting the ability to kind of
share the screen at the same time with
others in a very seamless way even
either within a conference room or
across hangouts or even around the globe
simultaneously was really interesting
and fun perfect its nominal hope you
guys get to see Jam word soon on the
just deep tongue in the first one on
that machine learning video what's doing
a use case that a company might use this
for its previously this would take hours
and hours now it's anticipated well
there's a few things so one is you could
you could do the speech-to-text just to
kind of get a transcription of what's
going on the conversations that are
happening on video but if I'm you know
perhaps work for National Geographic or
Discovery Channel or in work places like
that where you have massive video
archives essentially you're looking for
let's say archive footage of a cheetah
or elephants or anything that is
identifiable as an entity to be able to
really rapidly scroll directly to where
those things are in a video saves hours
and hours of time as opposed to having
somebody really literally watch that
video through which and tagging them
manually so Google's been very
successful in bringing products to
billions of consumers how how is Google
going to successful and enterprise game
it's great question I would say that the
value add that we really bring in in my
mind is the no lock-in proposal right so
historically enterprises have have
addressed their vendor relationships
with a little bit of animosity because
in Phinney cases offender is focused on
making sure that they're locking them in
to what their platform has to offer and
kind of putting barriers around
migration or moving in or out of those
platforms the Google technology really
centers around is based around a lot of
open source technology so you find a lot
of
services that we're offering have
open-source equivalents and what that
means to an enterprise is essentially
you can run at whatever makes sense to
you is that can run on premise using
same sort of technology as Google Offers
I can run a hybrid approach so I have
some on premise and some in the cloud or
I can do a multi cloud approach so I can
run essentially the same technology on
multiple clouds so I get the benefit of
really cost benefits that I can
understand how to simply financially
make decisions around how I want to
distribute my compute so that's one key
aspect of it the other one is is the way
that we expose a lot of us services is
essentially through the idea of service
computing or managed services so really
abstracting even further away from
setting up servers and CPUs and
understanding how many cores I have to
fly etc using a managed service takes
all that out of the picture it really
lets the customer focused on what's the
functionality I can bring to the
situation to solve problems so maybe a
little bit more about you and your team
and what are you guys working on well so
our team is called customer engineering
most most of the industry would
typically call that a sales engineering
our solution to engineering team our
reason for a rationale for calling
customer enters obviously we want to
focus on customers not fixing customers
engineer the customers but we want to
focus on customer problems so
essentially where their cost errors on
the technical front we want to make sure
that they not only understand fully how
all the products work and can be used to
address their business issues but we
also escort them through a full
technical evaluation of the product so
we'll run things like technical
workshops to help them understand how to
apply big data technology to situations
or perhaps even we are well we do have
workshops centered around machine
learning so if customers want to get a
really good understanding of how not
only pre-built trained models can work
to solve problems for them we can also
bring to bear some more of that data
science magic you know pixie dust that
it comes from a machine learning help
them really understand how they could
apply that as well so yeah it's a bit
you know like I said being the concierge
for them through the Google experience
and helping them get ramped up into
production as
interesting part of our broader team
because it's a team that really deeply
understands technology and the products
but gets to interact with the customers
every day and bridge those two so in
terms of the customer engineering team
what are you looking for when you hire
you're doing a lot of hiring oh yeah
hiring is one of those fun things to do
it but let's never stops right so
there's a few things I would say we look
for bringing something to the table so
having some role related experience or
knowledge around the space that we're in
is pretty important but I would say also
there's a character issue or a character
attribute that we look for as well it's
how do I connect can the person solve
problems and are they resourceful to
solve those problems as well are they
willing to go to whatever extent it's
necessary to contact people or do the
research or contact customers or
partners and bridge across to other
areas to get the answers to the tough
problems to help them overcome whatever
challenges are there so a lot of it is
just you know resolved really to solve
problems and the ability of the
knowledge and the cognitive ability
really to do that absolutely the
problems are probably changing every
week yes yes definitely and so in terms
of people that are interested in roles
in cloud and Google what advice would
you give them um I would say if you're
if you're not already looking or getting
experience with cloud oriented
technologies or especially in the
open-source community so you know if
you're if you're not tinkering around
with something that has to do with
Hadoop or things that are on the cutting
edge around Qi and learning like
tensorflow I would say start to explore
that so you get a good foundational
understanding of what's going on but
yeah I would
what would my advice would I go you have
just apply honestly um we are constantly
looking for great people you know there
are lots of opportunities not only in a
customer engineering team but sales
marketing product etc so but know
something about what we do I think is
pretty critical so don't just come and
expect us to you know look at you as as
a candidate you need to come and explore
us as well and bring something that you
understand about what we're doing
great advice and for those that are
interested we will cover that at the end
so what would you think generally
speaking makes someone you know that
comes onto Google the group plans
successful in their role or what could
falsehood should people avoid to not be
unsuccessful um don't be a Wallflower I
mean you've been at Google for a long
time too it's it's sitting in a cube and
expecting to get be accomplished and
what you have what you're doing without
interacting with others is pretty it's
polish that won't work
so be outgoing vivacious just be
energized and energy and engage with
other people cross functionally
especially as a key element of it and it
doesn't have to be just senior level
people cross functionally engaging it's
it's any individual contributor should
take it upon themselves to get to know
people in the product team in the
entertainment marketing team etc because
great ideas honestly come from
everywhere at Google I think we know
that and they often come from the
collaboration of those who aren't
similar or in similar roles so being
successful really takes a lot of that
that cross-functional engagement
tenacity to just get things done do all
of that and so we I think some audience
questions we'll just like to see give us
points and so a live question from Pablo
of convivial machine-learning search for
topics in audio videos so for example if
I have a large archive of speaking
videos can I automatically catalog my
archives by the topics spoken about in
the video can I speed uh ninjas that's
an excellent question yeah so um there's
probably a combination of machine
learning services that what you'd want
to use in that particular case so the
video API for understanding of the audio
and then also identifying of entities we
do also have a translation API I'll have
to admit that I act I don't know if the
video API does multiple languages for
audio so you might have to extract audio
and then use translation speech and Tech
speech detects rather with translation
because of this
Tech's will do the language for you if
you need to translate to another
language office you can do that as well
and and I mean I just interject a couple
of questions throughout the audience
questions so Bruce you've been at Google
11 years and you've probably been to
many Google offices yeah how many have
you been to you know and then what is
your favorite and why well there's
actually an internal tool that you can
look up see how many offices you get a
badge for how many offices you've been
to I want to say I've been to around 20
to 25 of our offices one of my favorites
is still the Zurich office it has some
very interesting tie-ins to local
culture which I think make it super
interesting plus there's also the fire
pole which you can swing you can slide
down and from floor to floor and then
there's really a slide that you can come
down into the cafe area which I
understand they do for noogler day when
they're announcing Googlers I believe
they actually will announce the name and
have them come down with their propeller
hat and then they can have it's usually
I think about happy hour convenient
great so we have another question from
Bala so Lindsey I have a question for
you is Google cloud running with
third-party support or purely a Google
product and we could probably talk to
miss on the other G suite side I guess
the Google Google G suite we kind of
have as a platform and we can fully
support that as a product and a suite of
applications through Google but what
we've done is I've been given the
ability for lots of other businesses to
build on top of Google whether it's a
CRM or email marketing solution and so
that like a more and more product
integrations and api's to allow
businesses to tie in to Google so that
it's an entire ecosystem in the units I
don't know exactly if this what the
question um yeah so Rylan with
third-party support of a purely a Google
product yeah so when we obviously have
our own Google support organization for
up to the various products there are
situations where frontline support might
be handled by a third party as well that
we certify so yeah thanks or if that's
what the hopefully that's dressing the
question yeah yeah
and we provide you know pretty
comprehensive support for customers
directly and then also through our
partner ecosystem and so to their life
question from Anuj um how do you best
determine where to spend your time a
good question because we're profiles
segment technology embedded etc let's
big question for you right I don't have
copious amounts of free time that's an
interesting question I think it probably
I'm going to try to answer in two
different ways because I think it's
partly as an individual how do I figure
out how to spend my time or how would
somebody on my team spend their time and
perhaps I think as a question implies
talking about where does the sales team
focus their efforts whether it's young
industry verticals etc so from an
individual perspective it's going to
vary obviously based upon the role of in
detail or the level of the individual or
my team my customer engineer on the
front lines is going to hopefully spend
the majority of their time with directly
with customers I'm hopeful it's on the
60% plus side of things and then the
additional time would be spent with you
know there's obviously a bench time that
you have to take into consideration for
making sure you're coming up to speed on
your product features etc and then the
cross integral function --all engagement
that had would have to go in to resolve
customer issues so you might be
interacting with somebody from support
perhaps even someone from someone from
product or engineering and then of
course you set your sales counter port
counterpart rather where you're just
devising the strategies and tactics for
making sure you're dividing and
conquering a customer situation
appropriately and where did I would say
Google's doula spends its time as a
sales effort in the market not
necessarily on any particular vertical
there are some that make a natural fits
with Google turn currently and you'll
see that with what we call digital
natives so if you see an announcements
around Spotify for example it's a great
example of a company who is a digital
native that grew up in that space they
hope they are already operate in many
respects the same way that Google does
internally so for them it's a more or
less a natural conversation for them to
right to a cloud platform as opposed to
an enterprise traditional enterprise who
a lot of their workloads are more of a
lifted ship focus and their internal
operations haven't really flipped over
into the same mode you know DevOps sorts
of things as most digital natives with
the missile they miss it further play
servers that said I think the only out
ad from individual perspective for those
at Google there's always limitless
possibilities of things to work on and
things to do and so it is something that
you know people are continuously working
on to figure out how to optimize time
there's never enough of it I think that
three of the things that the team
members and the teams think about is how
do we optimize impact and so you know
thinking about how to to drive the most
impact for the most number of customers
or users possible as well as growth you
know what things are really going to
provide great growth and then scale you
know we're we're always thinking about
how to be scale even more in the
business particularly on the online and
SMB side okay so and so Fred Bruce
you've been at Google for several years
and what do you appreciate most about
Google what's kept you here so it well I
mean the food was the first thing of
course you know it's not as if I haven't
put on a lot of weight since I've been
here at Google 15 yeah hopefully I
didn't go past 20 but there's a lot of
appeal I think for me in the early days
with my first few years here that
appealed senator lot around the this is
the general interest in Google across
the world so in the early days of Google
it was wow that's the other fantastic
announcements day after day Google's
getting into a variety of different
areas and so waking up in the morning
and going to work it was always
interesting and fun to find out oh my
gosh what did we do overnight you know
if we got into self-driving cars and
those sorts of things so that that's I
think this still happens to a certain
degree and I still get excitement from
that but honestly at this point having
been in and our enterprise facing
efforts for so long my goal at this
point is to change Google from being
considered a consumer tech and ads
company into a business
transformational company so I think the
opportunity that we have here in cloud
really fit represents to me anyway the
first real true opportunity for us to
make that switch and have Google thought
about in a very very different way and
of course I'll retire and ride off in
the sunset some of my personal skin yet
totally um
so from aparna content circle help with
both detection and mitigation where
accuracy requirements are critical so
far we've only students so far only
experience security experts are trusted
oh so fog detection and mitigation um
potentially so I think there are parts
of Google that are already using machine
learning for that sort of detection of
what's going on vulnerabilities and
threats and what's our security stance
etc there's an analysis that happens
across a lot of the traffic that we see
on the Internet
my assumption is of course that we have
used tensorflow to help develop and
refine those models but yeah I get
depending upon the data source that
they're looking at is there because
their high quantity of data is there an
ability to more or less structure a
model out of that and yes I would say
tensorflow is very applicable to that
sort of space great bad so next question
so what is Google Cloud policy on patch
and change management immediate
installation of patches updates service
packs as well as release management
patches isn't it like patches were all
for on-premise ah yeah no but I
seriously the there are essentially
rolling updates all the time with all of
the Google services that address not
only feature improvements functionality
improvements but also of course bug
fixes and then any security issues that
come along the way are addressed in
rapid fashion through just a rolling a
constantly updates happening on so a
daily basis for almost all of the Google
products so yeah our policy is is fixed
as the way that we do it however so if
you think about it let's say from a
compute engine so if I'm running
virtual machine and Google compute
engine we can actually update and patch
all the underlying infrastructure
without the customer ever really
realizing and having or being impacted
in any way so we support this
functionality called live migration
which essentially will take a running
instance of compute engine and move it
off into another part of our
infrastructure so that we can do
whatever patching and updating that we
need on the piece that it was running
before and again the customer never even
realizes what's what's going on under
the covers it's seamless from from a
customer perspective reading live
updated questions as we go yes the power
of collaboration here and so um from
Peter
you mentioned openness and running in a
multi cloud environment what other
public clouds are compatible today with
Google Cloud
what other clouds would you like your
customer to go to well I don't want to
go to other towns but um well but I'll
be quite frankly if if a customer is
using open source technology then they
can essentially use any cloud they would
like to and so we have this philosophy
at Google that you know we don't want to
have any sort of lock-in we want our
services to win the day but at any time
we fully understand a customer can make
a decision to choose so we have to earn
their business on a daily basis so if
you look at Google search that's again
the philosophy that's been there since
day one is any user at any given time
can go use a different search engine so
you have to make it compelling and
interesting for them one to watch this
day I would argue that of course most of
the open source technologies that are
out there will run better on on cloud
but I think it's incumbent upon a
customer to really do the investigation
and validate that for themselves and
then also check out other vendors for
their support for that sort of open
source technology as well we embrace it
fully I think you'll find with most
clouds there tends to be more of that
closing in of their infrastructure or
their or their platform so that it makes
it more difficult to move around and
it's really a tenant of Google's
philosophy across consumer side of the
business side of you know being able to
take your data and with you not having
it
nothing like in any specific solution
and so does Google cloud guarantee
completely and reliability data deletion
that disappeared as we were reading uh
so and I missed the rest of clenches if
there's a way to scroll back to see it
it disappeared okay I can't you read it
let's get it let's counter interview
this one's from Stefan um how much
acquisition for Google Cloud do you
anticipate over the coming years
um boy that's difficult for person my
paygrade to say honestly uh I you know
there's a lot of consolidation that
happens all the time in the in the tech
industry and of course there's always
new players that come into the space
that perhaps either have a different
twist or they still a gap that is very
pressing on the part of customers best
way for me to say it was that we're
constantly looking at those situations
and we have a team specifically tasked
with evaluating who's in the market and
what opportunities that represent and
you know where do we need to perhaps
fill gaps in our technology and there's
a good bill verses by these usual
arguments that you typically would see
around that great so M is colocation
required and working at a team in Google
ok employees live in a different city
different Google office and work with
the same team well um yes we can work in
multiple cities if you look at my team
we're spread geographically across all
of the Americas North to South America
so I have folks who are in Atlanta
Chicago DC New York Toronto Seattle if I
co call somebody on my team is going to
say why did you say my city
Austin's Apolo Mexico City I'm not going
to come all
so my team specifically is spread
geographically now they are appeared
with sales reps typically and what we
try to do is to make sure that those
those pairings are in similar locations
it just makes more sense for them to be
closer to the customers that they're
serving as a selling team but yeah we
actually have as well as a group of
architects we're spread globally that
will name all of those cities either but
it it's definitely possible to work in
its distinct locations from a team that
you're working with it just depends upon
the role as well and I'm sure you
probably have teams that are across the
globe that you could speak to as well
yeah and I have folks in in Gurgaon and
India and sipping Dublin here in
Mountain View San Francisco and I think
that at Google the power of our
technology provides such seamless
collaboration whether it's through og
suite products hangouts and so there's
always that balance of you know how do
you allow people to work from wherever
they choose and remotely but also
creating that that scale on that you
know that's part but how do we work
together but I think that it definitely
possible to work them know it's harder
to have brisket though it is harder to
have risk it yeah because every one
location you could all have risk
innocent okay so from Anuj what values
and principles do you try to uphold with
regard to technical technical customer
success to a specific customer example
hmm
well I'll revert a little bit back to
the philosophy of openness that we we
espouse my team in particular what we
are trying to here my team around
focusing on is specifically on the
customer success so if there is an
aspect of a solution that requires
another product that might be better
than ours I mean certainly we should try
to make sure that the customer is number
one and our thinking and make sure that
they are not choosing us just because we
want them to but they're choosing us
because we're the right product for the
situation and it also helps with
situations where you perhaps need to
bring a technology partner or services
department to help round out what you're
trying to do do I have a specific
customer example oh not to tell my head
right now but give me a couple minutes
and yeah maybe we come to that come back
to that one
and so from saqib what are some of the
challenges to moving to the enterprise
from being consumer focused clearly
there's a level of understanding that
needs that you need to have is to want a
true enterprise suffers through day to
day basis when you're building a
consumer tech service you're really
trying to get in the skin of a consumer
and understand what their motivations
are it's no different in the enterprise
you can understand typically at a
hierarchical level which which each
level of a company what are they're
trying to accomplish so I think hiring
is the right people who have an
understanding is one aspect of that
we've done quite well in that area where
we've hired people either directly from
that from enterprise and industry and
then also imparted upon that how we've
our training and onboarding people to
really have a focus around what
enterprises care about so it's al it's a
combination of a lot of things that
challenges I think also just to throw in
until we've if we're doing it right now
I think in history Google is not
necessarily taken seriously it is a as
an enterprise prater primarily because
we were best known for the things we
brought to consumers and I see that as
that transformation has changed the
realization that Google can really
address the enterprise problems it has
completely changed over the last 18 to
24 months
so from Aparna what are some of the
competitive advantages of using Google
cloud platforms machine learning tools
um well again it sound like a broken
record a little bit you know openness is
one of them so you can use tensorflow
to create models train models and run
predictions on your models in a
completely different environment from
our own we have a product that we
recently another announcement from
Google Docs called cloud machine
learning that essentially allows you to
take those tensorflow models and run
them at massive scale in Google's cloud
so it's this ability to kind of move in
and out of the environment that you need
to and then run in a serverless you know
managed service sort of environments
where you're not worrying necessarily
about provisioning of a lot of
infrastructure hardware that I never
would want to speak badly about a
competitor but I would challenge them to
have that same level of freedom to move
into them and just the depth of focus on
machine learning across the entire
companies is phenomenal and they the
amount of talent that we're bringing in
focusing on straight machine learning
it's really amazing learning first
mindset yeah and if you look at the to
speak to the point if you look at how
we've started to expose that in some of
our products the GP product in
particular has a number of new features
that are driven specifically by the
machine learning that was coming from
from underneath the covers and those
were built essentially the tensorflow
models so from Mike and other clouds he
spent the last two years moving into
global enterprise IT at scale with all
the integration complexity being applied
to see gcp moving in at that scale or
more selective I think it's going to be
a commendation honestly they so the
recent announcement from a partner of
ours named cloud indoor basically
provides the ability for any company to
migrate their VM to TCP I believe for
free free is always fun yeah so I think
it's going to depend upon the companies
that we engage with we certainly want to
bring mmm excuse me Wow I almost broke
you two but I was going boys
so we certainly want to provide them
that ability to do a lift and shift
migration but we also are challenging a
lot of companies to think differently
too so don't just lift and shift
something just so you can offload and
get a little bit of financial gain also
think differently about the problem
itself because I think you'll find when
you start to dig beneath the covers of
all of the other surfaces we had
services that we have to offer you can
not you can not only solve the problem
perhaps more elegantly and with more
innovation but with even less compute
requirement as well great another one
from sac cube dive how do you sustain a
partner spacers partner ecosystem and
support partners in GCP and what are the
best things that partners can do to grow
their sales on top of Jessica this is a
very timely question yeah so I just
spent most of yesterday we call that
batch hiring day when we were looking at
a number of of Engineers specifically to
work on my team to focus on our partner
ecosystem so we have a couple of
different teams it depends on if you're
meeting a technology partner where we're
working with an ISV
perhaps trying to help them understand
how they can run their services on top
of our platform or perhaps how do we do
tighter integration with their products
or a services partner who really adds
value on top of our cloud platform and
delivers solutions for customers to help
them ramp up and get their production
workloads running on cloud platform so
we have I'm hiring specifically team of
partner engineers to work in the field
with those services partners to help
them not only understand the platform
get educated get trained get certified
but also work with them with a customer
specifically so as they get through
their first couple of engagements
they'll be arm and arm with those
partners and working through
architectures and excuse me helping them
onboard overcome obstacles escalate
issues etc so stay tuned if you are is
to keep from a partner we're bringing
the army to you but if you're interested
in in those sorts of roles we're also
hiring for this campus and building and
hoping grow the partner ecosystem is
this is such a key priority for us and a
lot of the announcements
there was a big focus on our partners
and also underscore that and so does
Google cloud have redundant networking
of the cloud data centers yeah so the
platform network actually Google's
network in general is it's unprecedented
in its reach and its scale so I forgot
the exact numbers that have been
estimated externally and I can't
necessarily give credence to them but on
estimate its you know what 25 30 percent
of all network traffic the Internet
traffic if I'm if I miss dating that one
with somebody on my team is going to
kill me
runs through Google's network and so
we've had to not only build up the
capacity excuse me but also the
redundancy across the interconnection
between data centers and so if there is
a loss of connectivity between data
centers there is a redundant path that's
always available to make sure that
there's a loss of no loss of access and
so a similar a previous question but is
there a success story where your team
has invested capability with customer
and then been able to deliver on a high
value business initiative Oh lots of
them actually some of course I can't
talk about some of the more interesting
ones are not quite in the press yet
let's see I mean I mentioned the one
about Spotify for example I think the
Home Depot is another really good
example for those again sort of a
traditional Enterprise I think they're
very forward-thinking and how they adopt
technology internally and yeah we
invested a lot of time with them early
on as I said before what my team does on
a day to day basis we had workshops in
Austin Texas where we brought a lot of
their developers in-house of course we
gave them free food because that's one
things you have to do with the rules
make sure you provide food but we
brought them in for what we call a
technical acceleration workshop
essentially where we walk through I
think the first day was spent really
just educating walking through the
various services that were relevant to
the problems they were trying to solve
and then following up that that with
the next day where they actually got
hands-on keyboard and we're trying to
figure out all right now we have a
business problem or two or three how do
we start to prototype those alongside
the Google engineers from my team and so
over a three or four day period we they
were able to come away with a really
clear understanding of how this would
work for them and since then you can see
in some of the press announcements where
they have a significant portions of
their stack now running on cloud
platform so that's really where we've
the investment upfront for us is paying
off down low for us but it's also paying
off for the customer and so what are our
plans for CDN content delivery network
space of course then we have to pick a
question I don't have expertise in so
the the CEDIA there are some seeding out
announcements I think either in alpha or
beta and so this is where I wish I had
somebody on my my chat my team who could
hit me up on Jack give you the
background information for that but stay
tuned for more announcements I think
you'll see here over the next couple of
months with so many products and so much
going on it's hard to keep track of I
apologize for not knowing the exact
answer for that one where did I miss one
so last question I believe we have time
for what are the key metrics you use to
measure the success of the partner those
are actually evolving frankly so you
know we clearly would want to understand
how quickly it is that we can get
partners up to speed with the platform
itself so we'll look at accreditation
tiers for example that will measure
essentially how many people they're
getting certified on through the various
training to certification programs and
we have revenue is obviously an easy one
but it's not necessarily the only focus
that we want to have we want to see how
many opportunities our partners able to
run with more independently so over time
when they're doing more and more over
time independently without our
assistance that to me is a great metric
that indicates that they're they're
having great success on their own part
so there's a variety of that it better
of that nature
yeah and I'd add that we you know we
really want our partners to be
successful and on the sales side as well
we incentivize our team
channel neutrality just to ensure that
we're helping build and grow that
ecosystem from a sales perspective group
and great so I think we're will wrap it
up thank you Bruce for all of your
insights you're gonna get a chance to
talk about brisket but next time thanks
to all of you who joined from all over
the world um just a couple reminders
please do take the chance to RSVP and
hopefully we can stay in touch and if
you're interested in learning more about
Google cloud job opportunities we have a
link in the description you can follow
to learn at learn more and so thank you
that's a wrap hopefully see you again on
another YouTube live session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
