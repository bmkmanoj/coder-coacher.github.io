like if everyone were aware of
the stereotypes that they have
and the biases that they have?
When we talk about unconscious
bias we're basically saying
our worldview can exert
an influence beyond
our conscious awareness
and it creates ambiguity.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;You go to an engineer who's
built something extremely
innovative and you say,
Who do you think your user is?
This is where I have the
most fun.
My name is T.V. Ramen.
I led our work on Android
accessability for 3 years.
Write down everything that you
think you know about your user
with respect to abilities,
inabilities, special abilities,
disabilities.
Almost every assumption that you
write down
about this is the user I think
I'm building for
is questionable, because our
various unconscious biases
define the boundaries you're
unwilling to expand.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;These biases, they're
the shortcuts
that our brain has created
so that we can deal with
the information that we process
every single day.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Right when we see anyone,
whether we think about it or not
we are implicitly, automatically
making judgements
about how warm and competant
that person or thing is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;All humans need to make
decisions.
We fill in the blanks because
our brains are wired to do that
and we fill in the things we
don't know with past experience.
Oh, you pattern map to someone
I think I should hire so I'm
going to hire you versus this
person because they didn't map,
because I can't fill in the
blank, because they don't look
like me or they're not from
my same background
so I can't see how they're
going to make the jump.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Every single person is great
at things you may not expect
but it's really hard for us
to see that when we're so
powerfully guided by things we
expect to be true in the world.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;I grew up surrounded with
this conversation about
what you can't do and what you
won't be able to do.
My name's Enrico and I'm
an autistic software engineer.
The first time I went through
the performance review process
I was asked for 5 strengths. It
was the first time that I had
ever been prompted to think
in that way about myself
and it was a life changing
moment for me.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;When we are working in
our day to day jobs
we are still making judgements
about the people around us,
about the resumes we see, about
the employess that we're trying
to decide whether to put them
on teams or not.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;People are very wedded
to the idea that
that they can percieve
something objectively and
statistically they're wrong, but
it's hard. You become attached
to this idea that you can assess
something by looking at it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;These subtle assumptions
we make about people
can have lasting effects on
who we're promoting,
who we're hiring, who we're
putting in leadership positions.
We have the responsibility to
understand the assumptions
that we make and understand
the errors that we make.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;But it's not just for the
collective good.
If you take the time to
understand more about this,
There are things that you can
implement for yourself
that will help you develop
as a leader
and to do your job even better.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;It made me realize how often
I have a very strong belief
that is simply incorrect.
When I look at one of these
evaluation situations I ask,
How can I eliminate the
sources of potential bias
and leave just the data so that
we can make better decisions.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;If you're not conscious
of the biases that you have,
you're just not contributing
at the level that you could,
and you're not innovating
at the level that you could,
and so your products won't be
as good.
Your results won't be as good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;When you think outside the box
with respect to the assumptions
you made about how someone
will use
this wonderful thing you've
built and when you
broaden that perspective as to
who you change the world for
you build something even bigger.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
