is site reliability manager my name is
Liz Fung Jones and I am a site
reliability engineer at Google my name
is Christopher T Weldon and I'm a site
reliability engineering manager when
explaining my job to my parents I tell
them that I am responsible for keeping
Google systems up running and available
24/7 365 days a year
it's about making sure you can always
access Google when you need it a day in
the life of an SRE manager is is an
unpredictable thing I think I have
overall responsibility for making sure
that the projects that I work on stay up
there quick to respond they are cheap to
run they're easy to repair you can very
simply expand them anything that's
required to keep the system going on day
to day basis reading designs writing
designs writing code this can be a lot
of fun if you're into debugging or if
you really like working with obscure and
challenging technical problems it's a
blast but ultimately you were the person
responsible for whether a service is
working or not
being a site reliability and here at
Google is a unique opportunity because
of the fact that it's truly a
multidisciplinary role Google runs some
of the most widely used pieces of
software in the world the single most
rewarding part of my job is watching the
projects that we work on and have it
direct impact on our users it's
definitely more of a behind-the-scenes
role but it's a very critical
behind-the-scenes role that has a
massive impact on all of Google's users
rather than one specific product my
largest impact is ensuring that as the
products grow and evolve that they
maintain the really high standard for
reliability that people have come to
expect from them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
