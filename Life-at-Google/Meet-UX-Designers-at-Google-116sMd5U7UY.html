design manager on the material design
team I'm a UX designer here at Google UX
designers on a daily day basis design
interfaces navigation models UX patterns
for a lot of different apps and surfaces
the UX design family at Google is really
broad we have a lot of different
specializations that go into what
contributes to these our experience
Google promotes a culture of autonomy
and self-direction because that's where
a lot of innovation lies I think that's
a way for each person to grow and help
them build their career here Google
cares deeply about good design Larry has
this design anecdote a toothbrush test
he wants us to build experiences that
users use twice a day every day to make
some meaningful difference in their
lives we build new ways of doing that
whether it's a video or you can you know
send some new beautiful emoji that our
team has worked on
designing a product where four million
people use or billions people use that's
scary it's hard to get out of bed every
day and think about a billion users but
it's easy to get out of that everyday
and think about making something useful
for a billion users and doing your best
to create that I think that's the best
part of it where I helped change the UI
in a way that's more usable and more
efficient to users and that might help
each person and individual on a daily
day basis it's a very humbling
experience
I can fondly recall moments where I
would be sitting on a plane or on the
train and see someone pull a device out
of their pocket fire up that thing that
I'd worked on and not make any fuss
about it but just go use it do something
with it it's wonderful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
