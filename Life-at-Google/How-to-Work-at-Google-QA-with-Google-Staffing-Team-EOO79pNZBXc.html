Google's staffing team and we're here
for another hangout on air this time
we're talking about staffing and all
things hiring and with me today is Matt
and Karim from our staffing team so you
guys want to introduce yourselves yeah
sure
I'm Matt Stephenson I work in the
engineering recruiting department here
at Google specifically on our sourcing
team which is our front-end engineering
recruiting process I deal with a lot of
passive candidates and can talk to you
guys a little bit about applying and how
do you tailor your resume and my name is
Kara Jen courts I work on global sales
staffing here in Mountain View and I do
scheduling and recruiting for our
commerce group and the rest of the sales
organization great great yeah so we
wanted to have this hangout on air just
because unlike the Google channel there
are a lot of questions about you know
how to apply how to submit their resume
and everything and so when we put out
the call for questions we were
overwhelmed we got more questions on our
moderator page and in our comment
section than any other hangout that
we've done before so you know just just
before we get into the questions I
wanted to sort of set the table a little
bit Matt do you want to talk about you
know as a sorcerer what do you look for
generally in candidates because that's
probably our number one question that we
get is what does it take to get hired by
Google sure especially with engineering
- I think a lot of it is going to be
relevant skills and expertise and just
kind of finding people who are going to
be a good skill set to our current
openings like right now we have a strong
need for front-end engineers and mobile
apps developers and even mobile device
engineers but we don't want to also shy
away from what we normally look for
which is kind of like generalists so we
really are just looking for really
strong backgrounds with transferable
skills especially that's that's probably
number one right and Cara what about on
the non tech side like what would you
say what kind of skills and attributes
do we look for from from resumes I think
like Matt was saying um tailoring
resumes to the specific job opening that
you're applying for is key so if you're
looking to become an
let's do google showing that you have
strong excel skills maybe some sequel or
some other you know like coding skills
that would really be applicable or you
know if you're looking for a position as
a salesperson that you have an
outstanding quota run rate and that
you're you were just a high performer
okay great great
and could you guys just give an overview
of what our hiring process looks like
because I mean there's a lot of myths
and lot of stories out there about how
you know we get resumes how we interview
how we hire people can you can just give
a brief overview I can take that one um
I think the big myth is that Google kind
of has a black hole when it comes to
resumes them is actually completely
false we have a human that we reviews
every single resume that goes in there
and screens it so there is no algorithm
there is no way that we're sorting
resumes out somebody does actually
review every single one did you add
anything yeah I mean that process after
that usually is obviously reaching out
to the candidate usually begins with a
recruiter phone screen or email and then
the hiring process from there well it
would involve usually a phone interview
with the team or a hangout interview and
then meeting the team in person is
usually the last step we've actually
also done a lot you kind of eliminate
some of the steps in our process you
know back in the day and you will
probably find this publicly to but
people are called back in four three
four or five rounds of interviews we've
certainly taken that that considerate to
consideration based off your feedback
and we've consolidated that into you
know one day's worth of time very very
occasionally we ask you somebody to come
back for further interviews and if you
have to do that it's usually via the
phone so very cognitive you can farm
right so you mentioned a phone screen
what's the difference between a phone
screen and a phone interview in a
hangout interview the phone screens are
typically something that's just an
initial conversation and make sure that
you do in fact have the the skills that
are going to transfer over to Google so
it'd be more what we consider like an
initial pre screen and it's really just
a conversation with one the recruiters
it's not really evaluated by any means
that the technical phone interviews
we're going to get a little bit deeper
dive into the fundamentals and kind of
what's required for the job background
and then the actual on-site interview
very similar to the
interview but you're actually meeting in
person with either engineers or just
other Googlers to kind of just either
even further diamond in the details and
okay sounds good
cool so yeah we have attentions that we
hope to get through in the next twenty
or twenty-five minutes so we can just
dive in and so again these questions
came from users from on the light that
Google Page who either posted questions
on the comment section or on our
moderator page that we set up so this
first question comes from Samuel R and
he asks what advice would you give for
someone who's applying for an opening
that's in a different career path and
what the resume shows but requires a
similar skill set so Matt - gonna take
that one sure yeah um again it's gonna
be a lot of it's going to be
transferable skills right
similar skill sets a different career
path I mean for example I had a sales
background coming into Google and now
I'm a recruiter at Google the skill set
is very transferable a lot of recruiting
skills have you know a complete
correlation to sales skills so I was
able to just show that and also show
like quantify quantifiable success on my
resume and I think that's kind of where
you know I stood out and was able to get
the phone call great any anything to add
car yeah I think um Matt sort of hit it
on the head I think first of all showing
that you're a strong performer in any
area that you have experience in is
great and then really relating that to
the job that you're applying to and
showing showing us you know what makes
you qualified for it right okay so the
next question comes from Scott and
Florida is very similar so he says how
do you get a call back when you had
transferable skills to be successful but
not necessarily the ideal background
yeah very similar to Samuels question um
again I would just say you know make
yourself stand down make yourself pop
you know make it you know show your
success especially if you can show it in
you know percentage over quota as we've
mentioned or you know productivity URL
table able to help your team save things
like that that would go a long win and
showing that you really were an impact
player in your current position
and I think you know sometimes what also
helps is if you kind of look to other
roles that maybe our expert
extracurricular or roles that you
wouldn't think you know would
necessarily apply so maybe in college
you know if you were the president of
like one of your student clubs and you
learned a lot of skills about team
building management that sort of thing
like that's that's a way that you can
you know identify a skill that's in your
background but maybe a isn't on your
kind of traditional list of jobs and put
that on your resume yeah that's very
true I'm we like to that you know what
we call googliness here and you know
people show that all the time on the
resume and it's like completely not
really to you know the work that they're
doing but like they're in a unicycle
club or they're on the fencing team or
something like that it just shows that
they do have you know a life outside of
workers we also really like to see yeah
okay so this next question comes from
jet from Jessica Latham she says I'm a
history major minoring in professional
writing and editing I plan to keep
working here at her University's IT
office and she has plans on attending
graduate school but her dream job is to
continue working in the tech field and
Google's her dream job but she's
concerned that her major is is holding
her back so you know she wants to work
in tech but has a major in history so
what advice would you give her that I
think that someone coming from a strong
academic background has a leg up and and
I think that what we're really looking
for here the message that we're sort of
heading on is that whatever you've done
in the past it's it's pretty easy to
just pull out a couple highlights and
show us why those few things make you
the right person for the job and how you
can transfer that skill set to doing
something at Google I mean for instance
for Jessica here she's you know a strong
writer but loves tech maybe she wants to
be a technical writer at our enterprise
division um so I think that thinking
about what you know and what you'd like
to learn and applying that to your
application yeah that's fun cool okay so
our
next question comes from Ralph corduroy
he asks does Google consider does Google
reconsider applicants they passed on if
they reapply some time later yeah I'll
take that one absolutely and that's part
of my job in the sourcing organization
so like I said I was in the front end of
recruiting so in my position and we're
actually actively seeking more passive
candidates right so we're actually
looking through things like our database
things like LinkedIn and finding these
people who might not have applied to
either the right role or who have
actually interviewed with us in the past
to see if they might be interested in
reconsidering opportunities so we
certainly are using our database and
going back through and making sure you
know if somebody didn't reapply for the
or somebody did apply for the wrong will
the first time you know we'll try to see
if we can better align them with a role
you know moving forward even then if
somebody applies once and then applies
again down the road like we will
consider every single application as a
new application right so I guess how
different should someone's resume be you
know because I know we get this question
a lot and so you know sometimes people
are just wondering you know is three
weeks later is that too short of notice
or kind of wait until you know I have
like another job on my resume or another
skill like I guess to what what how
different should the resume be the
second time around definitely is the
situational case like you were saying if
it's between applications where you
haven't interviewed I would say you know
give it a give it a couple weeks like we
said there are actual people reviewing
the resumes and our volume is very very
high you know unfortunately this is
another thing that we get feedback on a
lot oh we never heard back in Google
sorry or like what's going on there but
like the hard part is that we do have
such a high volume that it's almost
really difficult for us to close the
loop with every candidate so we do send
you you know thank you for applying
email and we kind of just state that if
we do see a relevant fit a recruiter
will be in touch so that's that's the
really difficult part and we wish we
could figure out a way to change it but
it would be really difficult to kind of
you know get back to every single canon
and just let them know that we didn't
have a fit but do know that we are
keeping these resumes in their database
and we are trying to find matches for
everybody and you might hear from us one
day
out of the blue yeah and with respect to
reapplying I actually applied to Google
twice before I got an offer for a job so
miracles can happen and I think that for
me I just waited a few more months and
saw a physician that was a better suit
and then it ended up working out and
another thing if it is between if you
have interviewed and you're interested
in reapplying again you know it's not a
requirement but it is always nice to see
that you have taken steps to further
kind of your areas of expertise and
especially like developing your
interests and things like that so
whether that be through a you know
completely changing your job or at least
just changing you know focus or jumping
on a different team or just doing new
things it always helps her or you know
contributing more to and say open-source
projects in engineering or getting
involved and like things like top coder
or get up or something yeah yeah
definitely I mean and I think you know
car your your example is perfect because
a lot of times people will don't apply
for the right role the first time it's
not that they're a bad candidate they
just you know have trouble finding the
right fit for them do you guys have any
advice for how to find the right role
that matches your skill set because I
mean there's tons of jobs in our jobs ID
there's tons of different locations and
everything like that and also yeah I
mean you have to consider the number of
applicants that are applying to each one
of these rules right so you're
unfortunately going to be in a big pool
of people so it really is important to
stand out and find a rule that's really
going to be a good match to your
background you know we've kind of hit
that a couple times but just making sure
that your background is is going to be
as close as it possibly can to that job
applicant or the Job Description so that
you will stand out amongst the others
and then really be a fit in that role
yeah okay so this next question comes
from Sean ley and yes I suppose this is
a bit of a selfish question how hard and
fast are the qualifications I'm assuming
that if you don't meet the minimums
you'll not be invited for an interview I
have eight months of experience for a
job that requires a year does that lack
of four months not make me eligible so I
definitely not ineligible but it's kind
of like Matt was saying if there is a
candidate who does meet the requirements
they're probably you know they have a
bit of an edge so I think this is really
all about fit and the jobsite was
recently refreshed and it's designed to
help candidates better navigate their
way through the Google application
process so that they can find the right
job for them and find the right home at
Google okay let's say I can give up
those guidelines and not hard and fast
rules definitely you know it's be nice
to have but you know again even we do
say four years of degree
you know CS would be nice before your
degree and that can go ahead and go back
to the to Jessica's question about you
know having a history background or
something so it's all relevant
experience and especially you know I
don't think that eight months is going
to discount you from somebody who has a
year of experience I think it's I think
it's just if you have the if you have
the good solid experience and it's going
to transfer over well it will definitely
take a look yeah and you might have done
more in eight months and someone else
did in 12 months okay exactly yeah and
the other things like so many of our
jobs have you know ten different
requirements listed and you know if
you're a great fit for nine of them and
you just barely miss on the 10th like
it's still worth applying if you like
you're a strong candidate you have the
skills to do the job okay
so rolling right along here so this next
question is from time war in Kiev and
yes I submitted a resume a couple months
ago but got no reply is it worse
submitting again if so after how much
time so it's similar to a previous
question that we had yeah absolutely
like I said I could take a couple of
weeks you know for us to actually get to
your application
I don't think it you know if you don't
hear from us you know certainly reapply
I would say you know be cognizant of how
many positions you are applying to at
one time I think there was another
question on the moderator we might not
get to today about if I don't hear back
from one office can I apply to another
one yes I mean there are going to be
different readers looking at these
applications but you don't want to get
yourself in this situation where you
know you might you might well I guess it
would be a good thing that you might get
calls from recruiters we do want to
minimize that and kind of preserve your
experience as well and that's why we're
interested in finding the best fit for
you you know but certainly I think it's
worth reapplying and I would say in
terms of application number it's that if
you apply to save three jobs it shows us
that you're really focused to that again
my team in sourcing is going to actually
be looking through a lot of applications
in resumes and if we see things that we
do like you know we'll be in touch with
you too so you know whether that's
within two weeks or three weeks of when
you actually apply that that might
differ but it's certainly an opportunity
and possibility great okay so this next
one comes from Pei Pei in Orange County
California so what can I do to stand out
when submitting a resume I've lied
recently to a few positions and haven't
heard back I think it would be a
fantastic fit and wanted to see what
makes you call or what makes you call an
applicant for an interview
thanks so much sure you know a lot of
the same kind of questions here you know
definitely again
Pei Pei making sure that we have your
you know the best interest your best
interests or online with the job
descriptions interests and what they're
looking for you know if you can show
almost a direct correlation what those
tasks are and especially how it's going
to map to the position and
responsibilities of the position that's
going to be your best bet so so making
sure that you are taking the time to
read the job descriptions and understand
them and kind of make your work mimic
the don't make it mimic but make sure
that it does kind of do a lot that
translates to your background and the
work that you're currently yeah okay one
of the biggest pitfalls that we see
particularly strong candidates is on
their resume just using the resumes sort
of a list of everything that they've
ever done rather than calling out three
to five key bullet points per job and
that really directly relate to the
position they're applying for so what we
want to see is your relevant experience
not all of your experience right yeah
and and so what what would you say are
the things that really make a resume
like Matt you mentioned that earlier
like you're looking for things that are
maybe quirky or unusual like what are
some examples of things that really
catch your eye when you're when you're
screening resumes the one thing I really
like to see is more short and concise
impeccable mrs. Karda said I'm I would
rather see the direct impact that you
have to the team rather than having you
know big long sentences of everything
that you've ever done in your career I
mean I'm not gonna discount anything
that you've done I think it's all great
obviously but definitely making sure
that these are the here like aren't the
most important things that I've done and
here are the things that stand out the
most of this to this is what makes me
who I am and I think we also like to see
numbers we like to see quantifiable
things if you were the top performer at
your company where you a top performer
out of your startup those five people or
were you a top performer out of your
division of 200 people and so the more
numbers you can put on your resume will
just show us better you know a better
picture of who you are and I think also
one thing that we always like to see
it's fun is like the additional section
like I recently worked with a candidate
who had built a prototype of a robot
when she was in college that sort of
stuff is quirky and fun and it's smart
and it's physical you are yeah they love
that Glynnis right okay yeah we're
hiring our cue mates right okay so the
next question comes from Bhavna in Ann
Arbor Michigan where we have an office
by the way if I have questions about a
particular position at Google is it okay
to approach to approach employees
working at that position or recruiters
via social media sites one of the other
ways I can get connected to employees at
Google that's a very good question you
know that's going to be I guess some of
the sensitive answer because a lot of
recruiters I think your best bet is
going to be recruiters versus employees
at Google just because you want to
preserve people's privacy as well and
some people might be open to receiving
those messages and then some people
might not so like myself I do get some
messages time to time
which is fine you know I like to see
them very personalized as well so if you
are going to take the time to do that
just make sure that it is personal and
it's not just like hi sir here's my
resume what can you do for me it's more
of like here's what I've done this is
the positions I see that you recruit for
is there something that you know that
you can see or again we might not be
able to provide you feedback and some of
the times they might not even get back
to you and that just because they could
view as a spam message rather than you
know something that's really worthwhile
to them so again make yourself stand out
even in those messages but I would
probably refrain from reaching out to
people who aren't used to getting those
like engineers or salespeople or you
know people not in a job function where
they're going to be interacting with
candidates so much yeah and if you have
friends or you know someone in your
weekly exercise class who who's you know
spouse works at Google I think that
tapping your sort of personal Network
first is always a great a great way to
get to get your foot in the door yeah I
think you know if you know a Googler
like whether their recruiter or not I
mean that that's that's a great way to
reach out I think all Googlers are
receptive to helping other people find
jobs at Google so that that's a great
way to to get your you know your your
your foot in the right direction at
least um okay so we have a few minutes
left and here's a question from Olivia
in North Carolina she's asking can you
work from home at Google so I think this
is sort of a team by team basis but I
think in general Google is very
understanding of having a work/life
balance
um I have a dentist appointment coming
up so I'll probably work from home that
day so that I can go to the appointment
and but I think in general it's very
accepting of balancing your workplace in
your personal life yeah to add to that
too I mean work from home everyday no we
really don't do that the
telecommunications thing we really like
to see or telecommuting I'm sorry we
really like to see people in the office
just because mainly it's the team
environment right we thrive off of each
other's thoughts and creativity and
that's kind of what enables our our
products and it's just it's teamwork
it's oh you're always learning when
you're in the
I feel like I'm actually a lot more
effective here than I am at home the
other thing too and this is kind of just
a funny thing I work from home one day
last week this day something is actually
well I don't think it's as fun just
because I don't have all the the fun
perks and everything going on around me
and so it is actually kind of fun to
come in the office every day and see
these people and take advantage of what
Google s offer yeah I completely agree
I've been at Google for a long time and
I've always found my time more
productive and more active when I'm in
the office as opposed to working from
home but yeah at eka what you said I
mean we try to make accommodations and
special cases you know a lot of Googlers
are parents and so you know there they
they often have to leave the office
early or they may have to stay home to
take care of their kids so you know on a
case by case basis but you know managers
usually accommodating but for the most
part you know all of our roles are you
know are in office and we just find that
there's so much benefit you get from
working within a team that you know that
that's kind of the standard where we go
cool so we have time for one more
question
it's kind of a fun one so with a company
called with a company culture being as
relaxed on business formal we're in the
workplace what would you say is the
appropriate attire for an interview
business formal business casual or just
casual and that comes from kua Boston so
I would tell Kate you to bet on business
cares about our hiring process about how
to prepare your resume how to get
interview tips it's all there on
google.com slash job website so yeah I
hope to hope to do more of these
hangouts on air and give you more
insight into our hiring process and
various teams and various offices so
thanks for joining us and we'll see you
on the like the Google page thanks guys
you guys I think
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
