impacts on the world and people in the
research division to think very deeply
about this and figure out how can we
help as many people as we can as much as
we can the problems that were really
hard and interesting from a research
perspective actually we're really
important to Google the pace of
improvement in many algorithmic areas
has been quite staggering in the last
few years the glory is time for machine
learning working quantum processor would
be an amazing feat in that it can do
computational tasks now that before were
utterly impossible to achieve I've never
seen such diverse but also driven
passionate you know in all the best ways
slightly crazy set of people working
towards a set of common goals it's a
very open and accommodating culture with
respect to new ideas and new ways of
doing things so the research groups at
Google working what we call an embedded
model they work alongside product teams
taking the latest leading-edge research
that they're working on and trying to
put it into product experiences the
users will see shortly after
breakthroughs have happened when
everyone shares the same idea it's very
easy to innovate because you know that
you know if it doesn't work out it's
just one of the necessary steps before
success the culture at Google research
is really about having the most impact
in terms of ideas and on users as you
can the next time we see that new
problem that we've never solved before
and we don't have a solution for we all
jump in trying to solve it the models
that we develop were always sort of
guided by this principle that it has to
actually work you actually know that
it's useful to people which to me is
like the greatest feeling ever
makes it easy for people who are fresh
out of PhD to kind of come up with a
great new idea and have it you know
impact the world very very quickly every
single piece of work that I've done has
been in
the impactful is being used by hundreds
of millions of people if not billions of
people we have the resources to run on
we give you the freedom to also pursue
the problem space in a more theoretical
foundational manner this reading nothing
to lose we think this is an especially
exciting time for computer science
research and we're seeing really great
advances so we were super excited about
the progress we're making and we look
forward to more people coming to Google
and helping us with these problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
