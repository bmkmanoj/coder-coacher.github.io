move to step forward and you move one
step backwards but you have to keep
going and order to learn in order to
have a rich life experience I grew up in
Hong Kong my mother is a school bus
driver my father runs a small business
both had primary school education their
families were very poor and they had to
work and they were very young and they
never got a chance to go to school so me
getting an education was really
important for them we weren't very
well-to-do so I wasn't really exposed to
technology until I went to college I was
admitted into Hong Kong University for
Law School but I wasn't very sure I
really wanted to decide what I want to
do 1990 I went to University of
Pennsylvania and because I was already
late in registration I was looking for
an alternate class so I went into the
computer science class it was amazing it
was an eye-opening experience it was
very interesting and that's how I
started with computer science with the
first class and it just went on from
there I always loved solving puzzles and
a computer science class was just like
sitting there in solving puzzles all day
there's this such a sense of
accomplishment when something is solved
and getting a resolution generic media
is the company that I started I was
going to do real-time video transcoding
I wrote the prototype that got us the
funding for the company twelve million
dollars from the venture capitalists we
had customers like canon USA we had NTT
in Japan as a customer eventually ran it
all the way to the ground which was an
interesting experience all by itself
because shutting down a company is also
a lot of work and as a person I grow a
lot just going through the live
experiences of a setback internalizing
that learning from it and coming back
out of it and learning what I really
want to do I took about 18 months off
set and played a lot of music try to
find my place in life eventually it was
time to work again I came to Google in
2004 I started in the ads team as a
program manager and at the time the
problem was described as you know things
seemed very chaotic
and providing a structure for the team
to work together in collaborate so that
it can create a better holistic product
was something that I I spent you know
the first couple years working on and
then I moved on to work on the building
platform of the company AdWords is a 40
billion dollar business so every dollar
every cent that go through the system
let's go through a payments platform
everything that we do actually has
significant effect to how we operate as
a company there's a lot of statistics
out there that have a lot of girls being
scared of technology or worry about
sitting in a dark room facing a computer
but it's not the computer that you're
talking to you also have colleagues and
is a very collaborative field the
applications technology that we're
building you see people use it and you
know you see people getting something
out of it and especially when it's
completely out of your expectation what
they use it for
that's when is the most amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
