should come to Google when they feel
that they can have their maximal
possible impact at a company that has
high aspirations and high capacity for
doing great work in order to conduct
researcher you're not a pure researcher
in Google you are actually developer as
well in order to formulate the problem
you need to understand how systems work
and you need you learn about that on
your own but also we do work by working
with those huge teams of engineers we
expect our people to keep up with the
state-of-the-art in the field
part of that is listening and reading
and part of it is interacting and
talking and doing projects together our
success depends on maintaining a strong
dialogue with that the outside active
research community that's because we
don't have all the good ideas in the
world we need to if we even if we have
think we have a very good idea but it's
exposing it to criticism exposing it to
discussion to review might enlighten us
in ways that we will not be able to be
enlightened just if we can keep working
on it on our own I I think at Google
people go out of their way to make sure
that others are informed that that
opportunities for collaboration I think
the future of speech on mobile devices
in particular is that the quality with
which we can understand you will get
better and better and better over time
we're always looking to that but also
our ability to to have you say longer
and longer things on your mobile device
will get better and better
and finally our ability to have you
command and control your mobile device
will only get stronger as as we do more
work a lot of the research that's been
done at Google has made the impossible
possible if you think about building
self-driving cars or even just building
an index of the internet that you can
search instantaneously from anywhere in
the world that's an amazing
accomplishment and not something that we
would have said was possible just a few
years ago I think it's hard to define
the Google culture and I think if you
ask 10 different people at Google don't
tell you 10 different things and also
they'll have had 10 different
experiences of how their career has gone
and I think that's the beauty of it
research at KOCO is solving hard
problems and finding an understanding of
why your solution is a good solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
