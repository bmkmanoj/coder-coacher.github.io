allows you to be your authentic self so
when you embody San Francisco values you
embody those values at Google and you
embody those values on the street what
one market represents is sort of the
best of San Francisco and the best of
Google sort of all wrapped up in one and
we wanted to create a space that sort of
connected Googlers to the history of the
city each floor has its own concept the
concept on floor three is actually yerba
buena and Presidio the original
locations in San Francisco where the
city started we have a library it's a
library that would come from urban space
the couches in there are super soft and
velvety and right next to the library is
a micro kitchen it sort of looks like a
city park there are tilted trunks within
the space and some branches which are
actually light fixtures so when you're
walking through there again it'll sort
of feel like an urban public park on the
fourth floor we have the cafe it's
called the sage cafe and it's named
after Sabella Krauss and because of her
vision they actually came up with the
farmers market of the Ferry Building
my favorite part of the fourth floor is
actually the walkway between the
elevator in the cafe the ceilings are a
little bit darker you feel like you're
walking more on a city street the
windows actually do the tech talks that
are adjacent to this hallway sort of
look like industrial windows as well one
of the things we really wanted to do was
incorporate this concept of Biophilia to
sort of connect workers in an office
space to the outside to nature so as
you're walking through the space you'll
see a lot of plants and terrariums so I
loved it it was only fitting that we
landed on art as a cornerstone to
incorporate San Francisco into these
office spaces it's a unique project it
honors the work of community artists we
want to describe our city to people who
maybe are not from here
let's find things that represents San
Francisco the San Francisco Twins we're
representing Al Capone the Haight which
spurred the Summer of Love
Vesuvio cafe in North Beach we're
counting a little bit of the whole
history of San Francisco we wanted
people to know what made this so special
I did all of the elevator lobbies
there's 11 of them I think depicting all
the different neighborhoods I love that
space when you actually get off the
elevator and seeing that artwork and how
its associated with that theme and
concept on that floor we've partnered at
various levels with a lot of these
different nonprofits a luggage store
gallery proceeded eise's managed the
project they brought in a few of the
artists including tw5 we wanted to open
the conversation with these pieces you
know and we wanted to create kind of
like a conversation between the visitors
and the locals is not just bringing our
art in but encouraging the workers here
to come out and experience San Francisco
every artist that participated was
extremely excited to be involved with
this for us to be able to put out IKEA
and do this it was like pretty pretty
amazing
you have all of this together
engineering and art sort of all melding
into one that is what San Francisco is
supposed to be right it is supposed to
be a city for everyone we will continue
to be embedded in our neighborhoods and
our communities it is important to us
and we want people to know that we care
this is our life you know this is our
day this is our moment in these
neighborhoods and welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
