on air that we're doing on the life at
Google Channel today we're doing a
candidate coaching session talking about
technical interviews and joining me
today is Kevin and Vicki from our
Pittsburgh office so I'm going to
introduce let them introduce themselves
and then they're gonna take over from
here hello my name is Newman Serafini
I'm a software engineer here in the
Google Pittsburgh office and I'll be
walking you through the presentation hi
my name is Vicki I'm also a software
engineer here the wonderful Pittsburgh
office um I'm gonna be making sure that
Kevin doesn't leave out any useful
information from the presentation good
because that's that's a that's could be
a big deal okay so let's start so first
off how do we hire software engineers
software engineers are really the
biggest hire here at Google they
comprise the largest group of people
that work here when we do that we'll
generally have multiple interviews and
multiple steps along the way first off
we'll have one to two phone interviews
basically their phone screens they get
you they give us an idea of your skill
level and kind of what you'd be
appropriate for assuming you pass those
then we'll have on-site interviews and
the on-site interviews we'll have up to
five of these note that if you're
located in a place that has a Google
office you can actually do all these at
once right we'll bring you in for the
phone interviews as well as the on-site
interview so the phone interviews will
actually be local even though even if
you're not actually applying for this
office you can just still get the crimes
done correct so if you're at one of the
local schools here in Pittsburgh will
often bring you here to do the phone
screen and the on-site interview even if
you're gonna end up working in Mountain
View or something like that once you
pass the main interview then it actually
goes to a local hiring committee the
local hiring committees each office has
one they basically go over all the
candidates that came through and then
select the candidates that we want to
extend an offer they'll put together a
pack
hiring packet and then pass it to a
regional and company headquarter of you
those are really higher-level things
there Mesa Kalia justing head counts and
kind of strategic decisions once you've
reached that level though your ear
you're should be in pretty good shape
barring some great change after that
then the HR person will put together an
offer and contact you and let you know
basically the details of here's your
offer here's what it entails here's the
office you're going to work at and all
those kind of things so let's talk a
little bit about preparation what to
expect a standard Google interview lasts
roughly 45 minutes give or take
depending on how things work out there
will be a short introduction usually
when I interview I'll give a quick spiel
on me on the office maybe something a
little more about Google but it's
usually short 5-minute kind of just to
get to know you then we'll do the meet
which is the actual technical assessment
so that's where you'll have coding
questions a series of coding questions
and problems that you'll walk through
and then at the end usually the last
five to ten minutes depending on how
things go we'll have an opportunity to
kind of review what we've done and then
give you the opportunity to ask
questions a lot of people would like to
know either more about the office or
more about working at Google in general
and that's when we'll cover those things
and usually by the end of the day most
of your questions are answered so that
that part can usually be pretty sure you
usually get a nice big line yes with one
of the engineers that's not part of the
interview itself so you get to ask as
many questions as you want that's it's
usually a very nice the nice part of the
day the relaxed one yes exactly so
that'll be a break like in the middle of
your day um so the skills assessment is
all about writing code right we want to
see that you can write good code it
depends on your skill level so if you're
new grad you know we might have
different expectations than if you're
been around in industry for years the
coding questions involve both code and
algorithms and data structures so we
want to see that you understand the
basic data structures and how to use
them and how to apply them to different
problems we'll keep track of your
analytic skills so you'll get questions
that have maybe interesting bits and we
want to see how you approach those bits
a lot of them will be something that you
might not have studied in school or
might not have had before and we kind of
want to see how you adapt to that and we
want to make sure that you have sound
design in your code right like we want
to make sure that you understand
limitations or corner cases and things
like that error checking it's something
that you know we want to make sure that
you're doing when you're writing your
code I was gonna say testing for
you yes right right and that's an
important thing right like you know feel
free to say hey you know this could be
null or this could be zero and make a
note of it but we want you to make sure
that you're at least making a note
preferably writing the code that says
you know to doing these checks so just
to make sure that you're doing clean
kind of production grade eventually but
like production grade it's a difference
from school where you can tolerate
something's not working or I'd kind of
like to not account for that situation
when you're writing for doctrine code
you need to understand exactly what
could go wrong and you need to show that
you can account for that yeah yeah that
something is it's just a simple
interview question that's still part of
the process right exactly so how to
prepare for your interview um basically
the basic idea is review basic
algorithms and data structures it's hard
to emphasize that enough right you need
to understand what things are what a
linked list is what a heap is what a
hash table is understand how they work
and why you use them why you use them
used one over the other a lot of
questions will involve some kind of data
structure or be made easier if you use a
data structure and your interviewer you
know you'll go through the question and
your interviewer will look favorably
upon you if you have the right data
structure or even if you have a
suboptimal one if you can explain why
you're using it and then if the
interviewer says oh you know a set would
be better here than whatever you're
using understand why they said that and
why they do it and it's
it's good like that's that's really
important stuff um so where were we
right so review algorithms and data
structures understand how to use them
and and use them in your code like we're
we're probably not going to ask you to
implement a hash table but if you should
understand how it works right and and by
how it works we're probably talking
connotation Big O notation about all
these things how long does it take to
find things how long does it take to
short things you don't have to prove
anything like do mathematical analysis
but you still may be able to understand
how they work and say that right right
and the other part of practicing is
write a lot of code right like fine go
to one of these sites find the problems
there write the code solve them um
there's no better way of practicing than
actually writing these algorithms
especially you know if you've been in
industry for a while you probably
haven't used basic data structures
you're using whatever custom data
structures you have on your job so you
know you might be a little rusty it's
definitely worth practicing also
practice on a whiteboard or on just on a
notebook or something there's a big
whiteboard yeah it's actually better to
be on the whiteboard because you know
you're used to writing with an editor
you won't have an editor it won't color
code your comments it won't highlight
anything it won't
autocorrect things it won't insert
parenthesis it doesn't do any of that
and it's a very different thing if
you're used to just typing in an editor
writing on a whiteboard and no one's
gonna penalize you if you forget a
semicolon somewhere but we do like to
see code that's pretty and that it's
functional so are you able to produce
that without the help of an editor is
really important for an interview
because it's actually going to speed up
how you write the code if you have done
this before
exactly exactly and we don't you know we
don't want to use pseudo code right you
shouldn't be writing in pseudo code you
should be writing in code whichever line
would you choose that's fine right we
can we'll work through that whichever
mainstream I'm in check
right right um generally we do our
interviews here in C++ or Java some
other roles might allow Python star C or
C yeah C's fonts he's fun but the UI
roles might have JavaScript that's well
that's true that's true so you know but
it will be one of those may major
languages it's not going to be you know
these kind of random I don't I shouldn't
say random but a lot of nonsense
specialized language that's good way of
saying right like we don't do interviews
in those so so during the actual
interview right so you're here you have
your question you're starting to solve
it we're really interested in how you
approach the problem it's just like in
school show your work you're going to be
graded as much on your work as you are
on the final answer right um I always
emphasize interviewees when I'm
interviewing to think out loud just tell
me what you're thinking what what are
you going brainstorm however you want to
call it um if you're standing at the
board and you're not saying anything I
have no idea whether you understand the
problem what you know because that's not
an issue right we want to see how you
think through these things and by kind
of working through the problem then I
can understand and and either guide you
or understand like oh yeah they're on
the right track you know this is all
good yeah because the the interviewer
wants to help you if you have an issue
but they also don't want to give you a
hint if you don't need it exams are just
you know they're not doing you any good
so making sure that the interviewer has
a clear idea of which step in the
process you're at and what you're
thinking is super important we cannot
read your mind
exactly so um and the questions are in
depth right so these are questions that
generally don't have a simple solution
they might have kind of a phrase that
they won't have an easy solution they
might have a simple solution right and
I'm which is fine right there's a
difference there and a lot of them are
set up so that there's a simple or
simple inefficient solution and then
there's one that's better or that'll
have a simple solution and then we'll
expand it to cover other situations
right and um showing your work there and
and showing how you approach like given
the solution the first solution how you
approach and expand it to these other
roles is super important right that's
kind of what we're really interested in
seeing how you kind of think how you
think on your feet about these different
the right answer is nice but not
necessary and right answer is kind of
relative right like personally I don't I
won't criticize you if there's some
slight um error in the code or there's a
semicolon out of the way or something
that's not important the important thing
is you took the problem you understood
it you broke it down you solved it
that's what we want to see okay so
here's a sample interview question right
this is a question you will not be asked
I can guarantee that um but it gives you
an idea of what kind of question you
will you'll be asked in an interview
right this is a question that has kind
of a simple solution I wouldn't say
suboptimal but kind of a simple solution
that you can start with given basic
assumptions and then we can change the
assumptions and make it more complicated
we can change the solution to make it
better and the better solution is more
complicated and it's one of these
questions that can actually expand to
fill as much time as necessary and don't
be surprised if that's the kind of
question you're asked and don't be
surprised if you don't reach the end of
the question but yes questions do not
have an end they can go on for as long
as you want
exactly and that's all part of we really
just want to see how how well you handle
these different questions and what you
know and and if we ask the question that
was super simple and you answer that we
wouldn't know anything other than you
know a simple question right so our
sample question here is write a program
that breaks up a string of words with no
spaces into a string with the
appropriate spaces so if you had for
example one word peanut butter right
this method will split it into a
sentence peanut space butter um if you
have multiple words it might not do that
if you have no words it won't do
anything
I guess what Kevin is trying to say is
that you will probably get asked a
question that fits in a sentence but you
can't answer it unless you start asking
questions of your own that's a very good
point that's a very good point most of
these questions are under specified
exactly for e reasons because we want to
see
what questions you need to ask in order
to answer it exactly so uh and that's
actually a great segue so you're ahead
of ourselves awesome so right so
basically the first thing you should do
is clarify the problem right exactly
like Vicki said these questions are
under specified for a reason and so the
first thing you should you should do is
ask questions like oh you know this is
fun do we what if we have more words
what if we have an empty string what if
we have a null string things like that
right you need to talk to your
interviewer and and actually this is all
part of the yeah I know what I'm doing
analysis right because you can be given
a problem that is under specified and
help you know figure out what some of
these constraints are and you know it
shows that you understand how to solve
this problem right so oh god I was just
gonna say that if if a candidate saw
this question and then just immediately
started writing code on the board that
would be a red flag because there's so
many questions to answer like how do I
do where I don't even know where to
start with a question so getting on
board and writing code is not the right
thing to do here exactly that's exactly
right and that's like she can't stress
it enough right oh yeah it's very
important to understand the problem and
show that you understand the problem
because one of the other things is that
you may be thinking you're solving
problem a and your interviewer is
thinking you have to solve problem B and
that's where the whole problem is gonna
collapse right because he's expecting
different things that you think you
should be doing and there's a
communication problem there right right
and you know it's just not gonna you
know you won't get as high of a review
as as if you were on the right track and
it's really I don't say through no fault
of your own but basically because there
was just a communication mismatch and we
want to avoid that so so for this
problem um you know clarify the problem
consider example that's rich enough but
not tedious so fast man peanut butter
same thing right
disambiguate the result so that's where
I was saying you know you asked what if
you have more than one word what if you
heard more than two words multiple words
what if you have an empty string what if
you have a null string what if you have
all numbers right like these are things
that
you know usually if someone would ask me
a question like that I would say either
you know it will guaranteed not be no or
you should verify that it's not null
until the right thing one or the other
depending on the question but that's a
question that you should ask that you
need to ask um so the next bullet you
know state and clarify key assumptions
right and so in the question like this
the question you know the question we
have in the slide is where do the words
where do we get the words right in this
case use a dictionary um your
interviewer might not say use a
dictionary and or you know what exactly
does a dictionary meet right it could
mean that you have a big set of words it
could mean that you have a function
called words and your interviewer will
clarify that you know usually they'll
say okay assume you have a dictionary
here's the API for the dictionary right
Dictionary dot asked dictionary get
whatever some some kind of API and
you'll use that in your solution and
then the last step clarify the function
signature so make sure that you
understand what's coming in what's going
out basically um so the next thing that
you should do is start with the first
solution that comes to mind right um it
doesn't matter if you think it's dumb
right it's much better to have a dumb
slow solution that thing is dumb if it
solves the problem it's fine it could be
slow could take five those clarifies a
memory it's still something that solves
a problem it's better than nothing right
and then you can iterate on that
solution so you say you know what I know
this isn't the best thing but we'll
start here and go from there and in fact
in a sense a lot of questions that I
asked are exactly that right they
usually have some I wouldn't say obvious
but like a fairly straightforward
inefficient solution and you know you do
yourself a great it's very good for you
to implement that straightforward not
optimal solution and then we can work on
it from there
because then no matter what happens
later we still get a coding sample from
you exactly exactly and usually you get
a lot of interesting conversation out of
it as well right you see you're gonna go
easy the problem points exactly exactly
and so like so you know as the slide
says are usually a brute force solution
and I often joke and say every problem
that we have has has the brute force N
squared solution right like it's
something that's not great but it solves
the problem and I bet you there are
pieces of code in cool right now that do
use a very simple brute force solution
code that works right right exactly um
it says we run a run through at least
one or two examples to check that's very
important right you have your initial
solution and I will always say ok you
know given these examples you know let's
see what your code produces hey one tip
here when you do that do not assume your
code works
because a lot of people do oh I know I
just wrote this his works and they just
blindly run through an example they
don't actually check that did what I say
actually work sometimes there's like an
you have a less than there should have
been a greater than for example you
think the lives on his ride you read it
you don't actually do the math and you
miss the point you miss the bug so just
assume someone else wrote the code and
actually do step it through line by line
yeah exactly pretend your debugger
exactly and you know a lot of times when
I ask a question
I will actually specify examples of you
know so for this question I would say
well what happens if the strings you
know if I give you peanut butter it
should show peanuts based butter if I
give you you know blood should come back
with blah and it's very helpful if your
interviewer asked that as the you know
when they ask the question if they
actually give you examples run through
those examples there might be a reason
why they asked it that way um check for
edge cases that's very important right
there's a lot of these solutions that
look really good but in the edge cases
they break down and that's something
that you need to address make sure your
recursion terminates for example exactly
exactly make sure there's no off-by-one
errors make sure that you know things
like that
um don't plague your code right because
that's that's certainly going to be a
mark against you um try to use
reasonable variable names and clean up
the code I realize or we realize that
you're writing on a whiteboard not an
editor so it's not going to be as easy
you don't have Eclipse
to refactor things and it's perfectly
fine to have variables named X and I and
and and then whatnot right so that's
fine it'll make things much easier you
know a lot of people sometimes they try
to be very you know in production code
sure you'll use more descriptive names
and this you know they don't have to be
perfect because it makes writing it much
easier later right um and then before
you actually refine and ask the
interviewer if they have any questions
the interviewer might actually have you
know might point out something that you
left out might point out an edge case
that you didn't remember or you know
might actually ask you about the
solution like the solution might be
perfectly correct and they might want to
say well so you know what's the runtime
of this what's the memory usage things
like that right so so leave some time or
make sure give you give your interviewer
the opportunity to ask those questions
so it goes a long way
so then part three is refine the
solution right so in this case this is
where you might end up either a doing
better right so you end up with a faster
solution than before or B you might
start exploring different parts of the
of the question so for our question
right um the initial assumption was
we're going to have two words well now
maybe we'll assume it has multiple words
three words or whatever right
or even the words there's different ways
you can speak the string right for
example um peanut is is also in display
and not yet yeah exactly right so turna
right so so so that's an issue right and
that's something that again you know by
going over these things and working
through them with your interviewer um
you'll end up you know your interviewer
will have a better understanding of your
understanding and the interviewer would
probably guide you he will find that
like for example the peanut butter case
like what happens here since this can be
spilled too way so they'll just say oh
there was not part of my original
assumptions but I can change my
algorithm of this this this and that and
now it can also handle this case exactly
um and there might be you know there
might be a faster way to do it right you
you had an oh you know
squared and now we're going to come up
with the oh you know log n or n log n or
something like that and working through
those different solutions you know is is
is another way to provide input on like
yeah I really know what I'm doing this
is how I solve the problem you know and
so forth
one question that a lot of people ask
and I always say you know a lot of
people will ask about do I need no
specific library calls or anything like
that and and for me the answer is no
right like as long as you understand
that yeah there's some way to get the
length of a string you know or there's
some way to get the size of an array or
some size of a set or something that's
fine I'll give you like feel free to say
I know there's a way in Java to do blah
I don't remember what it is and I will
give you the answer or we'll make
something up if I don't know the answer
or I'll make something up and won't say
that I'm making something but I mean
there's Candice I can do dog length
things that does size oh my god such a
terrible mistake
exactly I give them wrong - yeah exactly
and that's why and you know in general
we're not you know again you don't have
your your api's you next to you you
don't have you know so don't feel bad if
you can't remember something like that
we'll just it's not a big deal um so you
know the next slide here talks about
these problems kind of the the first one
right how do we handle these multiple
words it's late situations right and you
end up with could end up with a very
complex solution and that's why you want
to talk through your interviewer the
next couple bullets are start going down
themes that you might see this next one
in particular what if the dictionary
cannot fit memory right that's a common
theme in google questions I know I'm not
giving anything away by saying that
right like Google operates at scale
that's that's pretty big and you will
often see like a solution for a problem
in kind of a isolated you know I'm doing
a homework problem answer is great if
you expand that problem the scale that
solution often will not work right and
and even if you don't necessarily code
the solution for this big crazy problem
like you know the big crazy scale
problem
we'll talk about it as long as you have
some idea of how to approach that that's
what we're looking for right because we
don't expect you to have done you know
some big crazy multiprocessor solution
right but as long as you have an idea of
how you would approach the problem
that's important that's also why it's
important to get a coding sample early
because if you go down a path that leads
to a very technical and hard to solve
problem then you will probably not be
able to code it and that's fine because
that's not what the interviewer wants
you to do they want to see how you think
about different problems but having had
the coding sample in the beginning they
are also confident that had you had the
time you would have been able to come
exact codings exactly exactly
um and then the last two bullets here or
something like you know are also more
refinements right how do you print the
most likely multiple choices like the
peanut butter thing right you know it
could be you know you might have to make
some decision is it going to be peanut
butter or peanut butter right two words
or three work through with your
interviewer they'll come up with
something pretty sane um what if the
words aren't spelled correctly so this
is a super advanced problem right where
you you you however you tokenize the
string then you would you know do a
spell check some kind of spell check
I'll grow them on the string I mean
that's you get to that point you're
probably doing I'll be honest with you
but like in general right like it just
shows you that there might be twists in
these problems that are just more you
know taking the base problem and then
extending it into these different
different regions and it provides a lot
of interesting information
and makes interview fun yeah exactly and
the interview should be fun
I know it does the sound it's not going
to feel like that but you know the good
interview is really just a conversation
between you know two engineers right you
have a problem you kind of work through
the problem you talk about different
solutions and you know we understand
that you know we understand you're
nervous we understand all that stuff but
you know when all is said and done you
know as you work through the problem
this is really just a discussion of you
know here's the problem I understand how
you solve it this is kind of what I want
to do to sound sane yes--it's ounce Ain
Hajime
and it's really just you know almost
like a conversation that you'd have
every day at work right ideally you
should enjoy that right right right
if you like your job that's exactly what
her everyday exactly exactly so here we
have an example solution this is the
example for the super simple semi brute
force um Sam I know I'm resources mm-hmm
I just watched I don't even know I don't
know I don't even short circuit anyway
now so this is this is a pretty brute
force solution but it gives you an idea
of you know here's step one right like I
have the problem I want to put something
on the board that gives us a starting
point and then we can refine from there
um so you know we called it this is in
Java I called it braking spaces it takes
a single string argument and basically
all this solution does is loops through
the string splits the string into by
where the current index is and sees if
both words are in the dictionary and in
this case right I used a set to see if
the words are in it but like I said you
would work through with you you you
would ask your interviewer and say how
you want to do this your interviewer
will pick something right they might say
yep you have a big set called dictionary
or we have a class called dictionary you
can you can use it to look it up here's
the API and then at the end this return
source
note that this solution is is pretty
basic and actually does not satisfy some
of the other criteria like the multiple
words it would fail although it should
be easy enough to extend it to multiple
words brute-force but multiple words
right making it not root for us would be
another refinement that would be pretty
easy to do um you know the spell
checking is probably a little extra here
but that's okay um but anyway it gives
you an idea of yeah you know this is
actually a pretty simple solution it's
not easy right you know it requires some
thought to make sure but it's pretty
straightforward once you solve the
problem and then we're going to take
that simple solution and make it into
the more complex more interesting
solutions that we can talk about you
know afterwards okay some tips uh so
optimizing right it's always a mistake
in an interview and in engineering in
general to Optima
us to our Opie right especially if you
don't know what your constraints exactly
exactly
I've seen a lot of people make that
mistake and then you end up kind of
going down the rat hole or going you
know spent wasting a lot of time on a
solution that won't work because there's
some some mistake there or some
misunderstanding and that's bad right
you don't want to waste your time on on
things like that you want to actually be
making progress towards solving the
problem um now that said you know if you
understand that there's a log n solution
versus an n solution then you can do the
first you know the former do that right
if you know using a hash map is good
using you know efficient algorithms
binary search that's all good right yeah
you don't have to come up with a
brute-force right even though I always
did but that's ok it worked for me right
I'm here so it's all good um time-space
trade-offs this is another interesting
one that a lot of people won't think of
off the top of your head but um
understand that those can be made right
if you're going to optimize you often
can optimize by trading time for space
or you know pre computing things maybe
that's a valid thing it's it's at least
worth talking through your interviewer
right like oh we can actually do the
first and number of these and keep them
in memory is that a reasonable idea you
know a lot of times we'll be like yeah
that is let's let's let's do that um and
then the final bullet is assumptions
right this is the big or small right
in some cases say if you're comparing
two parts or whatever um the optimal
solution changes if the number of you
know things is large or small and that's
something that you will go over whenever
a lot of times when they refine the
question a common refinement is well
what happens if your input is
significantly bigger right like in the
previous example what happens if it
doesn't fit in memory right so or in for
example the string you have to split one
of those let's say for example if you
know that the maximum dictionary word
you have is 16 characters and you have a
string that's 59 - you actually have to
check
the dictionary if it's a word you don't
have to exact cause you know it's not
gonna be there right
exactly exactly a little too this like
that you know yeah little things like
that that help you um you know when
you're doing make you more efficient in
answering the question right which is
good because then you can actually be
doing more you know more meat kind of
more more interesting problem-solving
and kind of less side you know side side
calculations API if you can't remember
the name of the method or how it behaves
ask you know I said it before I'm never
gonna hold it against you just ask in
general just ask just ask right I'll
either give you the answer or make
something or you know we'll make
something up and move on cuz it's you
know it's not interesting to know
whether you know all the methods for the
set class in Java okay that's what the
Internet's for right
testing saying what cases you're gonna
test right you know walk through your
code make sure that it does what what
you think it does and like I said a lot
of times your interviewer will give you
examples specifically like the peanut
butter one is actually one right like
there's a reason why they might give you
some of these examples because they they
illustrate different parts of the
problem but you should also give
yourself a hard time by clicking test
cases that you would expect to fail
exactly under different circumstances
exactly off by one you know things like
that um and then you know try to reserve
some time to work a small case which is
basically the testing right like all the
time when I give an interview there'll
be small these small things that either
pass whatever we're doing or fail
whatever we're doing or and also keep in
mind there might be some degenerate
cases that completely break your problem
so those are things to keep in mind when
you're you're testing that awesome so
that's the mean of our presentation we
have a few questions that would like to
go over yes we do okay are you ready for
this all right let's do it okay
let's hope we're not gonna there I'm
going to give us a cart of a time okay
first question does Google account for
cultural differences in language
barriers during the interview
yes as you can tell not everyone was
born in the US exactly yeah
so that's something that every ruler has
learned to work with and I think we're
pretty good at yeah I think you're
pretty good at it's generally not an
issue no but at all so that means the
game which is probably a plus speaking
English applause right speaking the same
language as everybody we are certainly
applause okay um the stubble trained or
interviewers how does it make sure that
the interviewers are not showing off
more than trying to learn about the
interviewing skills and abilities
because we nice people differently
exactly okay
um I just went through my training
actually yeah we do get trained you
don't just throw us into a room with a
poor interviewee to you know test our
skills and they'll get formal training
we have very strict rules about what
we're supposed to do how we're supposed
to do it what the scoring is what we're
looking for in a candidate yeah we don't
all show up and ask the same question
we're looking for you know we try to
coordinate and the interesting part is
that your first couple of interviews you
don't do a loan you do with someone else
initially you observe them and then they
observe you and for those initial
interviews I think your feedback is
actually not accounted right all right
so with the senior person that has the
final say you're just learning how to do
this and you're calibrating yourself
exactly and so and that's the only time
that there'll be two people in the
interview with you so if you do you know
you are in an interview and two people
show up that's why basically someone is
observing someone is doing the
interviewing and it's all part of the
interview training it's natural don't
you know they're not gonna shot gun
questions to you or anything weird like
no that's just to make it as sound exact
friendly as fossum exact one it's gonna
be quiet in the corner exactly
awesome okay oh there you go does Google
take into account that a combination of
general interview fear and specific
Google order fear can make candidates
underperform I thought were nice people
to come in all right any effort how does
go make sure that final decision doesn't
exclude shy / insecure but smart people
what do you think so this is I think a
lot of this goes to the ask questions
part right if I see a candidate at the
board you know you kind of break the ice
with the initial you know here's what I
am here's what we do here in Pittsburgh
little blah you tried to smile
exactly exactly right should try to make
them feel a little bit more relaxed
right then you go into the question and
that's where it becomes a conversation
right if I see a candidate kind of stuck
or not say anything I'll try to help
them out be like oh so what are you
thinking we know what what what angle
are you looking at here or something
like that and and try to kind of look
aside break the ice try to get them more
engaged really yeah and as long as
you're talking about technical things I
think that for the most part that works
itself out write the initial nervousness
goes away and then you just start
talking about the problem and there's
also a lot of interviews over the day so
you should be feeling more and more
comfortable with the whole process right
um that being said it is important to
people to communicate your idea so
having someone that doesn't say a single
word is past shyness yeah it's tough
yeah exactly and that's why we say make
sure you just talk out loud think but we
do understand that it's really sometimes
it can be intimidating but on the other
hand I was more scared than the
candidate on my right for sure I was
like oh my god what am I gonna do now I
don't want to do this exactly push me
didn't really it worked out fine by the
way so I think yeah okay which which
path can an individual follow to get
into Google the lobbies on the second
floor please mention what languages
certifications or any other important
factors maximize the chances of
selection of refresher um ok languages
any mainstream method we already covered
you add your cheese Java that's it you
don't have JavaScript for you on yeah
Python may be kind of tricky but I don't
think you're gonna be turned on if you
see like I'm really awesome at Python or
just buck your case up right um I don't
know about rectifications and yeah for
the software engineer roles yeah it
doesn't really matter
I don't know anything the security teams
that care but I really right I don't
that would be yeah that would be
surprising if there's like a oh my god
this guy has no certifications we're not
gonna interview him right now that's
that's not the case
yeah um just you know good coding skills
practice algorithms that's all you need
and be able to showcase that in five
interviews right exactly
good okay yeah this is relevant in the
tech interviews is the is the way the
interviewee approaching the problem more
important than skills and experiences
yes yes yes yes yes yes exactly we want
to see you working through the problem
right the code is part of the you know
is the tool that you have that's your
hammer or nail or saw or whatever you
know whatever cheesy analogy you want to
use that's right that's you know we want
to see how you solve these problems how
do you think exactly how do you think
and even if you have the most awesome
skillset in the world you're gonna come
at Google and then the first few mods
are gonna be oh my god I've no idea
what's happening around me so you'll
have to relearn everything you know
anyways right so it's kind of like
subjective but skills are exactly yeah
everything's exactly and everything here
right there's a ramp up here everyone
expects like everyone understands it and
that's just part of we're not talking
week we're talking months so right
exactly yeah not just you know it's just
part of the deal so don't let it
everybody's been there before
everybody's done it and we have survived
yes exactly okay um how does the
interviewer choose questions does he
have his own set of questions or do you
have a pool of questions we Google
Google interview questions right and
then pick the top now we gotta go we're
in course to pick our own questions um
that being said it's probably wise when
you do that to run depression exactly
senior engineers that have to yeah what
we usually you know when you come up
with a question it's very common for you
to come up with a question and talk with
other engineers on it I've often done
mock interviews the basically said okay
here's this new question I want to use
I'm gonna try it out on you let me know
um and we try to keep you know I'll have
a set of questions that I use I try to
use kind of a consistent set of
questions because it helps me help you
how's that sound actually but it does
right it is cheesy but it's true because
I understand the question and understand
how it like the problem space and so I
can usually you know if someone's kind
of going off the rails I don't you know
I can bring them back to say like well
you know what that solution I understand
what you're trying to do it's cool but
it's we're not going to do that today
for that that's not you know that's not
an optimal solution and here's why let's
talk about something else and it's it's
really just to kind of guide you right
it helps you analyze and understand what
the interviewee is doing and that's why
interviewers generally try to have
they're like couple questions and use
them often because then they have seen a
lot of solutions they have seen what
works they have seen what candidates
struggle with right so they are able to
identify where this is going fast and
try to fix it before it goes haywire
exactly exactly and that's all good
right like that's actually okay that's a
responsibility of the interviewer you
don't go down a rabbit hole but you
cannot get yourself out exactly because
we don't want to do that right now it's
wasting everybody's time and you don't
want to do exactly exactly
yep cool awesome is having a degree
mandatory so the answer is no uh if you
have no technical degrees and you wanted
to become a software engineer it's
probably going to be challenging but
it's not a requirement like as long as
you have the skill set that it takes and
you can understand the problem to write
the code and there's also people with
substantial uh field experience that
might not have a degree right from and
the computer science degree is also not
necessary you know yeah because neither
I well I'm sort of by the way my own
limitations right we have a
mathematicians we have a mechanical
engineer an electrical engineer
statisticians is write your name you
name it a strong name is drunk yeah yeah
so generally everything that deals with
math and large datasets kind of whatever
Google exactly exactly so I yeah okay so
would you advise to prepare for the
interview or do the interview as a
natural as possible without reviewing
well if we didn't want you to prepare we
wouldn't be here right now
so you get the hint yeah preparation is
a big deal a whiteboard right and why
more exactly it's a big deal um you know
preparing is the whiteboard part it's
the accepting the fact that this is you
know multiple interviews in a day's
gonna you know there's a little tiring
make sure you get a night's sleep make
sure that you understand these different
algorithms and different data structures
because those are the kind of questions
are going to be asked and we're not
talking crazy PhD level questions here
right no one's going to tell you about
this data structure that you've never
heard before but they will expect you to
know what a binary tree is right so if
you don't remember you need to go back
to you al gore-ism send data structure a
book and freshen your memory a little
bit right and it'll be very helpful on
the day of the interview because you
know again you can have just the
conversation right it's not it's a
conversation between peers and not uh
not anything uncomfortable right and
nothing we want we want that
conversation between peers exactly and
last but not least oh boy I do not want
to answer this one what is a delay of
reply between each interview yeah
that depends right um it depends really
on the interview load some times a year
are really bad and so it's like
knowledge right exactly
so you know and as interviewers we
interview everyone from college grads to
industry experience and so if there's a
lot of interviews going on like there is
now it'll probably take some time yeah
right exactly how much that is is hard
to say your recruiter will give you an
idea of what the turnaround is you know
so they don't feel free to ask them
they'll let you know like hey we're
really busy there's a lot going on so it
might take stem at your time or you know
though at least set your expectations as
to what what that's going to be that's
the only thing we didn't specifically
mention it doesn't exactly tie it just
thought of it that during the interview
um the interviewer will actually be
taking notes of what you're saying
because he has to go back and write
feedback and that has to go to the
coming
that Kevin mentioned in the beginning so
that's a very natural process don't
freak out it's almost like has a
notebook I start scribbling down like
really but what that means is that then
they have to take this notes you know
tide them off polish them explain what
they feel about the interview and all
that take times now multiply that with
ten people per day add your typical
workload and then you can see how this
can go back right if there's like a
crazy interviewing time right now
yes exactly look well I guess we're done
with the questions yeah I think that
wraps it up yes okay guys thanks so much
you know this is a lot of really good
information and yeah you know I I want
to thank both Kevin and Vicki for
participating and thank you all for
