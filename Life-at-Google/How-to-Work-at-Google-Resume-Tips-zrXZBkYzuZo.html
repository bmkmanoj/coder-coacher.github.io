recruiter here at Google and I'm Kendall
and I'm a software engineer here at
Google we're here today to talk about
resumes a cool thing about the Google
application process is that our rules
don't require cover letters and that for
the vast majority of our roles we simply
ask for a resume and a transcript so
while you can breathe a sigh of relief
about not having to write a cover letter
it's all the more important that you put
your best foot forward with that resume
and we're here to help to keep things
simple we're breaking this video into
chapters with links below
first we'll dive into general tips for
all resumes and then break off into tips
specifically for business roles and end
with insights into engineering and tech
resumes before we get started we want to
make it clear that everything we cover
today is just a guideline there's no
exact science when it comes down to what
Google is looking for and a resume
however we hope that these suggestions
can help you in creating a stronger
resume and help you on your path to a
successful career alright let's get
started
the person reviewing your resume should
be able to find pertinent information
easily and quickly PDF formatting is
always preferred the format should be
clean simple and consistent black text
is always a safe bet keep consistent
font inside and always check for typos
try to use bullet points whenever
possible focus on results and impact
list metrics and examples concisely
rather than writing overly long
descriptions be sure to include your
contact information and email address as
well try to keep your resume to one to
two pages including relevant information
only if you're applying for something
outside of engineering it should be a
priority to keep it on one page you
don't have to include references but can
add references upon request don't worry
about objective statements either and
cover letters are not really reviewed
unless the team needs more context our
team looks for this upcoming information
so please make sure that it's easily
accessible and formatted neatly
education should always be listed first
under your contact information work
experience includes internships or jobs
and any other experience you can list
personal projects or class projects this
is more applicable to tech oh you can
list awards or a leadership experience
and don't forget extracurriculars we
want to learn about you your education
should be front and center please
include your degree and major and
definitely make sure you include your
graduation date also include your grade
point average and don't be scared by
this although GPA is a factor we look at
the whole package and understand that
every school and student is different
experience is next on the list list your
experiences in reverse chronological
order starting with your most recent
experience always include the employer
position and dates that you are employed
keep descriptions concise and clear you
can use the format accomplished X as
measured by Y by doing Z make sure you
highlight your accomplishments versus a
long description of what you did
showcase results for internships jobs
academic research teaching and tutoring
Experian
you can also include experience from
student groups selected personal and
class projects just make sure they're
relevant to the job you're applying for
also we love hearing about
extracurriculars and what makes you you
outside of the classroom be sure to
include things like these student groups
especially if you have a leadership
position University honors awards or
scholarships publications papers are
patents you've worked on conference
presentations and any impressive
achievements or activities in other
areas now let's get into some specifics
or business resumes be concise and don't
be afraid to brag keep your resumes to
one page and be aware of how you're
using your space if your description
spills over by one to two words you've
wasted a whole line of space don't
forget to edit edit edit use
action-oriented language verbs like
negotiated developed managed here's a
hint read the Job Description and look
at the language that it uses write the
resume for the job description putting
in that extra effort is what's gonna put
you over the edge use data and examples
we really value data here at Google and
we want to see that you know how to
apply it when speaking to your
accomplishments use comparisons and
averages to provide context now let's
show you some quick examples how to take
your resume to the next level using
these tips instead of saying member of
leadership for tomorrow Society add
metrics by saying selected as one of 275
for this 12-month professional
development program for high achieving
diverse talent and then take it a step
further by adding more contacts selected
as one of two hundred and seventy five
participants nationwide for this
12-month professional development
program for high achieving diverse
talent based on leadership potential and
academic success you can find more
examples like this and lászló box
article my personal formula for a
winning resume linked below
now we are moving to the engineering
side of things to get started I want to
reiterate how important it is to list
your github profile at the top of your
resume and to include your programming
languages github or other prominent
open-source work shows us that you're
contributing to the open-source
community and that you're passionate
about the work that you're doing and
looking to improve your skills we also
look at the languages you are using we
really want to see Java Python C and C++
also make sure you're comfortable
interviewing in the languages you listed
and include any language you use in any
specific project descriptions on your
resume moving on to experience many
students don't realize that they're
actually getting experience from places
other than a job or an internship
make sure to showcase the results for
any of the following internships
relevant to computer science academic
research teaching and tutoring
experience open source experience mobile
app and web development student groups
hackathons or coding competitions
selected personal and class projects
it's good to see both independent
projects and group projects especially
open source projects to see that you can
work well with others include the
language used next year projects also
make sure to show your impact be concise
and don't be afraid to brag this is your
time to show off use action-oriented
language as well
words like debug created and designed
are great here's a hint read the Job
Description and look at the language
that it uses write the resume for the
job description use data and examples as
well things like adding new hardware
algorithmic improvements caching answers
implementing machine learning use
comparisons and averages to provide
context as well again follow the formula
accomplished X as measured by Y by doing
Z for crafting bullets in your resume
for example I increased server query
response time by 15% by restructuring
our API or won second place out of 50
teams at a hackathon clarifies just how
impressive the win actually is vs. won
second place in a hackathon which could
be out of three teams and if possible
always include a coding language to
describe your impact
