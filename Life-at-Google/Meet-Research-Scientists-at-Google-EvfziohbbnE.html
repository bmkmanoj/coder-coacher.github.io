like being at the driver seat of the
revolution that is happening right now
in computer science my name is Emily
pitler my name is Devon jaundice I am
David Weiss and I'm a research scientist
research scientists at Google try to
work on problems where we don't
necessarily even know how to pose these
problems yet so what are the things that
Google is going to be trying to do two
or three years from now so for an
average research scientist they would
generally spend a mix of time reading
papers writing code running experiments
Google truly believes that making
progress in artificial intelligence and
all these other important areas of
computer science is really core to the
business being a research scientist
gives you the unique opportunity to work
with very very large scale problems
involving language processing and
machine learning and at the same time we
are doing cutting-edge research probably
better than a lot of academic research
that's being published
my team is very collaborative a lot of
people I work with are people whose
papers I grew up reading in graduate
school but yet everyone is really humble
I get to mentor junior engineers and
researchers who are just fresh out of
school we try to maintain a culture of
inclusion and diversity so I learn every
day and I go as a researcher every day
here I think research scientists at
Google compared to other companies have
a much broader scope of what they can do
the natural language technology that my
team works on runs on every single
mobile device that Google produces this
is exactly why I wanted to work at
Google was to see my code and my ideas
running on billions of web pages and
billions of queries every day it's
really exciting to feel like you're part
of a group that's really going to change
the way that everyone uses computers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
