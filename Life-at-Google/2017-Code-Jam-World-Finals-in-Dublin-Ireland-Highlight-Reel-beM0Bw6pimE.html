from 16 countries this is the top of the
top folks from more than 65 thousand
registered participants this year it was
in Dublin so it's definitely unique
experience
it's exciting to see people from all
over the world compete it's great to be
back for distributed to advance but
they're distributed programming held
some stupid computing is an important
topic now and it's really great
competitions on that topic I think it's
a really great place for people to kind
of get introduced to competitive
programming and also felt like an
algorithms kind of explore the whole
like more mathematical side of
programming that a lot of the time you
just don't see when you're doing it like
web development distributed code Jam has
problems you don't find anywhere else
even one mistake can be incredibly
costly I think the problems keep getting
tougher which is good
keeps our returning competitors
challenged and that allows the chance
for newcomers to shine as well
contestants not have previous years to
look at to train up on the competition
keeps growing which is great to see
that's just where this competitive
programming really should go the
excitement and the energy of the coach M
finals is something I look forward to
every year it's kind of a dream job for
me because I love puzzles different
powers of they might be that you need
are always the same we have to write the
problems knowing that there's more than
one way to solve them so we sort of
expect different approaches and it's not
here which way is best the action was
great it was a long years day of
competition and battling really exciting
too
new competitors on the scoreboard from
all over the world coming in it was
quite successful I don't think I really
could have gone better purposes during
my day competition becomes more polished
we hope that it's growing it's getting
bigger and bigger easier there's a lot
more audiences that it can reach and I
think it's doing some of that would kick
start as far as I can tell so I hope
that it reaches more people around the
world learn about it cover it fall in
love with it and I think the momentum is
really picking up which is really
exciting too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
