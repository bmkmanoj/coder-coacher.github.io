Program Manager my name is oh me oh Moo
my name is Sam Cowley
I am a TPM a technical program manager a
TPM figures out how to build a product
my name is Zuri Kemp I'm a program
manager I like to summarize my role as I
organize I anticipate and I mitigate
what I really do is work with so many
people towards one concrete goal
I am definitely mostly talking with
people yes I'm a big talker on a day to
day basis it means that I work with
software engineering teams also with
educational teams to create content to
educate Google's engineers being a TPM
you're always trying to bring teams
together and it gets a little bit tricky
at Google because people have their own
ideas and own opinions you need to be
eloquent you need to be nice secret
weapon the type of people who become
TPMS or the type and say okay tell me
more let's figure this out almost
everything we do is a collaboration and
I feel like that makes stronger products
and it helps us put ourselves in the
shoes of our users
everyone is hard-working driven very
very smart we cover the gamut
you know from optics to mechanics to
electronics to interfacing with cars to
human interactions just seeing the
impact that we have on people and how it
improves their lives this the best part
of my job so we can't afford to get
Finch wrong
and whenever we get it right it's
spectacular you feel like butterflies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
