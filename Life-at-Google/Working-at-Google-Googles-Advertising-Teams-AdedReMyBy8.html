live from Google in Mountain View
California my name is Matt I work on the
global business or staffing senior
mountain view my name is Kevin I work on
the sales stack exam as well with mat in
Mountain View we have a few members from
the SMB team here to answer some
questions so yeah today we're going to
be talking about working on Google's
advertising teams I mean if I invited
Kevin and I actually help recruit for
the SMB team so we've invited them to
come and tell us a little bit about what
they do so Meredith do when I start by
treating yourself sure so thank you for
the introduction again my name is
Meredith I am currently a manager with
our SMB a sales team out in California
and will recite ask you today at first I
just made a little bit more SMB is and
what our team does so we've got team
members here today who represent both
our sales and our services side but
ultimately the mission of our SMB team
is to help our small and medium business
guys customers grow whether that's
helping consult with their businesses to
achieve their marketing goals with their
online advertising platform spending
from search to display to YouTube to
beyond all letters providing world-class
customer service to help them you know
help educate and empower them and for a
future growth and I'd love to pass it
over to Chad who can explain a little
bit more about the differences between
our SMB sales and our SMB Services team
sure my name is Chad I've been with our
SMB Services team for about two years
and together with the sales team we both
service the same book of customers and
we're broken up into two organizations
one is called SMB sales and the other is
called SMB services and while we're
working with the same customers we do
have slightly different goals
so the SMB sales team works with our
customers to ensure that they're getting
the most out of their account
performance so they make sure that
advertisers is getting you know a strong
return on investment reach and
effectiveness with their accounts and
they do that throughout
own chats phones and emails whereas on
the services side we were to make sure
that our customers are happy and that
their accounts are working as they
should be so we work to ensure that
reliability through live phone supports
chat support and a little bit of email
and what we do on the phones is
troubleshoot issues with AdWords Google
Analytics sometimes Merchant Center or
any of our other products and all the
while we're making sure that all of our
customers are happy with Google but
that's most of us I would say sure I
think we can take this time to talk a
little bit more about our day to day as
- my name's AJ and I'm a part of the SMB
sales team - just to give you an insight
as to what we do at Google I'm on the
sales team my typical day I spend the
majority of it talking to clients so I'm
talking to them either on the phone or
in person and are basically sharing with
them my ideas about how we can improve
their advertising campaigns maybe I'll
have an idea for a new campaign to
target people in a specific state during
a specific time of year so you get a lot
of room to be creative I'm in between
talking to my clients and helping them
improve their campaigns I also do
marketing work on the side so currently
I'm marketing agencies and helping them
take better use of AdWords in order to
help them help their own clients and on
the services side of the business I
spend my day supporting AdWords
customers with troubleshooting issues so
also in a couple hours on the phone
answering their questions hoping that
I'm walking them through their account
I'll also spend a little bit of time
chatting with advertisers as we just
have a new chat platform where we can
talk to them online a lot of advertisers
love that and in my spare time outside
of the core work as we call it I work on
our systems so I make sure that the
phone line works as it should and I work
on projects to help get the right calls
to the right people
awesome and last but not least hi I'm
Jen for - Google for about seven years
and I know one of the topics that we
wanted to cover today was joining SMB as
a new grad so I was almost a new grad
when I joined Google I've been a teacher
with Teach for America for a little
while before coming here right now I'm a
man
are on the services team and actually
joined to the services associate role
the role that were going to be talking
about today and I spent about two years
there being the voice of Google with our
small and medium-sized businesses looked
over moved over and worked with some
engineers for a while
turned out I wasn't perhaps so awesome
with that so I came back and came back
to the sales team and worked in the
education vertical managed to sales team
over there and then move back to
services about two and a half three
years ago and of managing the Mountain
View side of the business um you know
which is about 50 of a second out of
your office another good job very
frequently so my days are awesome
um and super excited to talk to
everybody today about not only you know
the amazing stuff that we do in SMB but
the amazing career path you can have at
Google if you join in this team great
thanks so much
we have a couple of discussion questions
that we'll start with and actually I'll
start by asking Kevin and then maybe
move on to the rest of you could you
tell us if we could talk a little bit
about what we're looking for in terms of
skills in terms of hiring press the
bcl-2 services right so in terms of
Skittles and what we look for in
potential candidates we're really
looking for individuals that have great
communication skills so I know as you
already heard you're gonna be working
with a lot of customers on a day to day
basis so someone that can communicate
effectively with our customers but not
only you'll be working in team
environments so the ability to
communicate with your team and be able
to kind of be in that team environment
so you're great communication is you
know a big key to the role as well we
look around enthusiastic visuals so when
we're talking to customers we want you
know what seem to be you know really
enthusiastic really into the to the
products and as well into Google and I'd
also say something that is a big big
something we do look for individuals
that are self-starters so you know with
Google there is you know you know change
that happens so someone that can be able
to you know work you know work in a
great team environment and be able to
sell start on the ground are very
characteristics good Morin and
candidates you know anybody on Jenner
Meredith is there anything that you'd
like to add
I think flexibility is pretty key at the
Google so I'm really looking for folks
that are interested in a challenge every
day you know like I mentioned we do talk
a lot with advertisers and Chad talked
about this as well though you could be
getting a phone call from a smaller
movie of those desperate you know really
doesn't have a great understanding of
you have the search engine you know
landscape period and you could get a
question from an agency that's been
doing this for 10 years
ah so flexibility interest and problem
solving is something we really look for
on the services side of the business and
we definitely highlight communication
again we spend about five hours a day
talking to folks on the phone and then
the other three were not quite stuck in
a corner right we're talking to each
other a lot of the time to troubleshoot
all these problems so you're looking for
folks that are passionate about those
things and I'm second everything that's
been said so far but I would just add to
that or really emphasize a team
orientation because as Jen said you're
not just communicating with your
customers every day but you're also
communicating and working alongside your
fellow Googlers so it's something it's
pretty important to have that kind of
team spirit I think that's one of our
strongest suits here at SME and so it's
something that I think I definitely look
for and I think in addition to
everything else that was said before one
thing I've also learned in my couple
years at Google is the importance of
adaptability and that we were a lot of
different hats so it's one of my
favorite parts about the role is that I
have so many responsibilities but it's
also the biggest challenge as a new grad
because you can be able to transition
from you know maybe solving an AdWords
issue to running through meeting five
minutes later and explaining a technical
process to your manager and it's very
exciting but the ability to manage your
time effectively and be prepared for
your day while you go into it it's
pretty important
cool Before we jump into the questions
from the moderator forum we have one
last question for Chad and AJ think
you'd be great to answer this how often
do sales and services interact with each
other and what kind of interactions do
you have of each other I'd say we
interact with each other quite
frequently so on the sales side I've
interact with them maybe every other day
and that's because when we're trying to
build really awesome campaign for our
clients we need to have a deep
sophisticated understanding of the
product and luckily for us we sit
alongside people in the services team
who are masters and athletes without
them we wouldn't have the great great
campaigns we launch together awesome
thanks guys great so at this point we
want to go to some of the questions
people submitted so the first question
comes from Chris from the Bay Area what
do you think are some important trains
to have in order to succeed on the
advertising team Jen would you like to
take that question yeah so the the two
traits that I would highlight here the
first one I think you talked about you
know fair amount which is kind of
flexibility and adaptability I think
folks that are willing to accept any
challenge every day to accept new
problems every day I think are really
successful on the SMB team as well as
people in general and things move quite
faster so I think being ready for a
challenge is really the second thing
that I would say especially on the
services side of the business is empathy
you know we are dealing with small and
medium businesses and you know it's a
bit of a tough environment out there for
a lot of folks so really understanding
things from someone else's perspective
thinking time to ask the right questions
and walk them through all of the
solutions that people find I think that
that does take a bit of empathy and I
think that you really do try to put the
customer first in our organization and I
know that that's something that's true
on the sales side as well
thanks Jen our next question comes from
Miro in Wroclaw does one need experience
in sales to work in advertising the
advertising team here sure
and so I'm having to take that one again
I work as a sales manager currently and
because we are looking for a lot of
fresh scribes as well I think it's
pretty common when I'm talking to
different candidates that they might not
have explicit sales experience
especially if they've just graduated and
I think that's okay
tomorrow's point what I look for in
general is and what I think the team
looks for in addition to the trait
they've already been discussed are a
passion or a drive to do a sales type
job so to be able to proactively reach
out to our customers to tell them about
the latest products as well as to help
strategize what you think would be best
for their help our business using our
products here but also is gemston to
also have that empathy and be a good
listener and be able to understand how
Google can look for all segments so it's
all that but which may be demonstrated
in your experience so far I definitely
encourage you to have past internship
experience especially in media or ad
sales if you can create if not any what
you can demonstrate these other traits
that we've we've already discussed here
is another way to help showcase that
you're interested in passionate about a
job or animal I think you talked about
Google great thank you
the next question comes from Matt and
Irvine how would you define success for
the SMB physicians so I can go on top of
this one so I would define it or what it
looks like to me my guess is three
different buckets the first one is you
know Google is a data driven company and
as a really important growth engine for
Google were we're very data-driven and
metrics driven as well
so the first thing I would highlight is
a focus on metrics and doing well in
your core job that's that's what success
looks like especially in your first year
so whether that's a customer service
metric you know like Net Promoter Score
or whether that's a sales quota like you
find on unmerited steam the second thing
that I would highlight is especially in
that like Juan de tuléar kind of area
we're really looking for people to
impact the business and that's what
success looks like to us so one of the
examples that Chad gave earlier is has
worked on the systems
I mean basically I don't ever watch how
to go you know away ever because he has
such a huge impact on the business ray
he's really making sure that the right
call gets to the right person
and I would definitely describe him as a
successful SMB R and then the third
thing that I would say and I think this
fans all of Google not just SMB and what
success looks like for Google is
actually being really open to innovation
open to feedback and open to moving
forward we do have twice yearly cycles
where we sit down and get feedback
you're right we beverage so your peers
write feedback about you your manager
writes feedback about you and we really
want to have that kind of holistic
discussion so being open to feedback
open to changing over the growth I think
also looks like success for our
organization great thanks so much for
that insight our next question is a
two-part question that comes from Robert
in San Diego the first part is what are
the most common career moves Googlers
make from SMB sales are a bird from the
SME sales and advertising team sure so I
can take that one so as you know when
you work on our team you're able to
develop a lot of skills some of them are
data analysis because you track and
measure and monitor results for your
clients campaigns and you also do great
client management so you learn how to
manage their accounts creative skills
like writing the ads so when you think
about what people do on our team it's a
lot easier to figure out where they go I
mean there tend to be three popular
destinations one is our large customer
sales team so people move on from
managing accounts letters come from
small and medium businesses to those
that are larger nationally recognized
brands some people move over to our
internal customer support teams or
basically what they do is they analyze
the data and the feedback from Google
users so these are people who not only
use AdWords but any of our Google
products so their job is to understand
the user and see how we could improve
Google and a third pocket why people
tend to go to this marketing right so
when our job you're used to talking to
your clients getting to know them
writing emails launching webinars and
some people move over to marketing where
they do that
on an even greater scale so it's
fantastic as you know Google is a huge
company and there are a lot of
opportunities and this happen to be the
three directions people choose from snd
cool thanks AJ if I could ask you a
follow-up question to that also from
Robert in San Diego what is a typical
organizational structure of SMB sales
teams sure I would say for our team and
SMB the team tends to be structured
around the client as you know one of
Google's the philosophies is to focus on
the user so the way we organize our
teams for SMB sales is around the
clients and we segment them so we look
at clients that are either you know
based nationally or based locally
clients of different goals that they
want to grow or they just want to
optimize their own campaigns so we'll
come together and build groups of you
know five or six to manage these
different segments some of our books of
business and it's great because you have
the flexibility to learn about these
different segments and then you're able
to talk to your manager to see which
kind of clients we want to work with so
you get to Bro I mean you get to learn
as I have for the past two years some
thank you for that answer AJ the next
question comes from Dani in Paris it
does the 20% rule apply to s and B teams
and so the 20% rule for those don't know
is that 20% of Googlers time are spent
doing a special projects so Chad did you
want to take that question yeah sure and
I think it's hard to measure out 20% of
your time exactly and but the project
rule or allocation does apply to assets
as well so we absolutely welcome the
opportunity to take on additional work
outside of your core role so for me that
looks like doing the job I was hired for
and interacting with customers and
supporting them every day and then
finding additional time to take on more
projects and so I was like I said before
my projects focus around making sure our
phone system gets the right calls to the
right people some people choose to spend
their extra time working with the
marketing team and getting the word out
about some of our other great products
other people work with the product team
and make the products better
so people have fewer problems with them
and so there's there's no shortage of
opportunity here at Google and I think
one of my favorite parts about the
entire project idea and process is that
if you can't find
right away you can also make one and and
the best projects from SM beers and see
boys on our team tend to be ones that
interact with other organizations at
Google but ultimately come back with a
benefit for our awesome D customers as
well as s monthly that's reason to just
you know I think you know a lot of us
years ago that we definitely try to
drive our own career development to so
further than not an existing project we
don't have to create one with our own
initiatives our next question comes from
contra of the tune in san francisco are
the sales teams leveraging any of
Google's technologies like hangouts to
search businesses how much of the
selling process is done face-to-face
versus phone or email
I can also answer a little bit of that
from the servicer side recently with the
evolution of Google Hangouts and some
other technologies we have been able to
implement some new ways that we interact
with our customers so as I mentioned at
the beginning of the Hangout today we
started chatting with our customers
online so people don't always have the
time to give us a call and talk over the
phone or maybe they're somewhere else in
the world and they still want to get in
touch with us so they can chat in and we
just type away with them that's pretty
exciting and the other thing that we
recently launched was the ability to
screen share so personally I've worked
with a lot of advertisers that are new
to our products and sometimes they don't
know where a button is or they just want
to walk through in the literal sense so
now thanks to Google Hangouts and some
other cool products were able to do that
pretty easily and to chime in a little
bit on the sales side we definitely do
use some technology too in order to
reach out to more than one client so as
I pointed out before the majority of my
day is speaking to clients many many of
them on a one-on-one basis but what
we're doing recently is using webinars
so that we're able to talk to more than
one client at a time so to give you an
example
I manage a book of business on my own
and a large number of them may be
interested in advertising on YouTube so
that might be an opportunity for me to
host my own webinar I just take charge
and do it on my own with my managers
support of course and in one discussion
talk about how we can leverage
advertising on YouTube for all of my
clients who are interested so it's
wonderful and in the sense I'd
able to save time but talk about an
important issue too many people at once
it's great Thank You Chad and AJ so the
next question is what are some of the
qualities and characteristics of a prior
successful team leads of prior
successful team leads
sure so I think I'm gonna I'm gonna
tackle this one um so in Chado keep me
honest because well team lead keep me
honest too so I would say folks that
I've either worked with or I've worked
for I think we we try to focus in on
Career Development and that's just not
career progression but skill development
so you know I think a successful team
lead takes the time to figure out what
are your goals what do you want to do
with your life what do you want to learn
approval you know what are the things
that you've been passionate about before
that you really want to bring to this
new job and then I would say the other
part of being a team lead is is
operational excellence so I spend about
half my day
chocolate folks about you know their
lives and their goals and how they're
performing and then the other half of my
day is actually spent making sure that
there are fewer roadblocks for my team
so how do we make sure the word
proprietary staff then we have the right
resources that we're not facing with
other team all of that stuff
but I think especially because we're you
know we're talking to a group of
individuals today that are interested
will associate role for the most part I
would say we really try to be people
focused and we really want to do the
right thing so setting up personal
development plans making sure every part
of the people have okay ours that's
objectives and key results and then
touching in frequently and being really
open and really available with your time
so that we can help everybody figure out
what they want to do next week you know
but also next year and the years after
I'm gonna soon the silence means I was
right so I'm gonna go with it yeah Jen's
a great manager um so yeah actually some
of the things that I love about working
at Google um as a recent grad I did have
some internships at other companies and
coming here there was much more emphasis
placed on period of
on it so when I talk to gem show
challenged me and asked me why I like
things about my job or why I don't like
certain things about my job when we
figure out what that means for my skills
figure out what that means for the world
on a go and where I want to grow and so
I think those are also things that a lot
of teammates do here at Google
and aside from Jenna nerd awesome it
sounds like you guys have a great team
we're very lucky yeah so I think we will
you know that that's all the questions
that we have in the moderator for thanks
so much for helping to answer those it
would be definitely hope everyone
watching was able to get some more
insight into SMB what we do here at
Google and hope to get you excited about
applying for these positions Kevin could
you remind me I'm with the titles of the
job is the roles are also PJ and find
them online so both of these jobs can be
found a go-to google.com/jobs and in the
