single streamlined version ok let's say
you're happy with your resume but you
really want to make it more you let's
open the sample resume again and then
click the magic tool icon you'll see

whose last names and an SK I sometimes
see this effect too we are working out
these bugs to make sure your resume is
perfect but let's say you have a
particular feature in mind that you
would like to showcase instead of
