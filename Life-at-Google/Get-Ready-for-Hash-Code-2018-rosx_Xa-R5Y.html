ready for hashcode 2018 i'm Nirali from
the hashcode team and i'm david from
your husband team and we're here to walk
you through how to get ready so first
we're gonna start off with a little bit
more about hash code then we're gonna
give you a walkthrough of our judge
system David will take some time to walk
us through a practice problem and then
we'll see just a couple minutes at the
end for a live question the answer
thanks for being with us today
live and please be kind if there's any
niche technical games at the end we'll
do a question and answer session so if
you have any question please write down
and we'll also be referencing some links
throughout this chat so be sure to check
out the description box below on YouTube
so get those links but before we get too
far ahead we're gonna take stuff take a
step back and look at what is hash code
hash what is the team programming
competition organized by Google the
competition started in 2014 and is now
in its fifth year it's open to
developers across Europe the Middle East
and Africa in hash code participants are
tasked to solve a Google engineering
problem in the past we've seen hash
cutters work on problems ranging from
routing Google Street View cars through
Harris to scheduling drone deliveries to
customers with hash code you get the
chance to put your programming skills to
the test in a fun and exciting
environment you'll also get a glimpse
into what software engineering looks
like at Google you only need a few
things to participate in hash tag first
the only new computer and internet
connection you will also need to find
the team which can be anywhere from two
to four people this is required as
nearly mentioned before hash code is a
cheap programming competition lastly you
should feel comfortable coding in at
least one language
you can pick whichever language you like
Ashford problems are based on heuristic
and optimization rather than finding the
perfect solution so even with just
introductory level computer science you
can participate in Haskell
there are two rounds of hashcode the
first round is an online qualification
round which takes place next week on
Thursday March 1st we'll kick off the
online qualification round at 18:30
Central European time with the live
stream the link for this live stream
will be shared with participants via
email the morning of March 1st after the
live stream the Palme statement will be
released to the judge system at 1845
Central European Time so you and your
team can get to work coding you can see
how you stack up against other teams
from around the world on the live
scoreboard in our judge system your team
can submit solutions until 20 to 30
Central European Time and this is a hard
stop the judge system won't accept any
more submissions after this time a few a
few minutes after the submission
deadline will join you again over
YouTube livestream to announce the
results
after the online qualification round top
scoring teams will be invited to the
final round on Saturday April the 28th
in Google Dublin and the winners will
receive little prizes illustration is
open now until February the 26th which
is one week from now so if you haven't
already sign up on our website and if
you don't have a team tell your friends
to register branch code or find a
teammate through our Google+ or Facebook
pages linked in the video description
box below for the online qualification
round your team can compete from
anywhere so for even more hashcode fun
we recommend participating from a hub
location near you
what's the hub great question hubs our
meetups where teams in your area can
participate in the competition side by
side and are a great way to meet new
people and add some excitement to the
online qualification round
here are some photos of hops from last
year's competition you can even see
participants tuning into our livestream
at the start of the competition so far
we have over five hundred and
seventy-five hubs across 70 countries
check out the link in the description
box for the full list to find a hub near
you
we'll walk you through how to register
for hub in just a minute but here you
can see a map of hubs across Europe the
Middle East and Africa that have already
registered hub registration is also open
now through February 25th alright sounds
like fun
I'm ready to get started can you show me
how absolutely let's start from the very
beginning first you'll want to head over
to our website and register for Hofstra
2018 you can click either sign up or
sign up for hashcode 2018 to be taken to
our signup page here you can read more
relevant information about the event and
click register for hashcode 2018 to be
taken to the registration form the form
looks like this go ahead and fill it out
do note you'll need a Google account to
register for hash code and to use the
judge system once you've submitted the
registration form you will receive an
email within 24 hours the intern you
access to our judge system if you're
having trouble finding the email try
searching judge system or hash club
judge system in your inbox to access the
judge system follow the link that is
sent in the email which we've also
included in the video description box
below the judge system looks like this
We strongly suggest taking some time to
walk through the tool before March 1st
so that you're ready to go come the
online qualification round if the Dutch
system shows a continuous loading
message when you try to log in check
that you've enabled third party cookies
in your browser or try logging in to the
judges
using an incognito window now since
hashcode is a team competition you must
form a team before the start of the
online qualification round so by 1830
Central European Time on Thursday March
1st although we'd recommend forming a
team as soon as you can
David what do you like to join my team I
will love to great let's do it when
you're ready to form a team one person
from your team let's call them the team
captain we'll need to go to the my team
section of the judge system in this case
let's pretend that I'm the team captain
it's important to know that each
individual must register for hashcode
before joining team so even though David
is joining my team
he has already registered on his own on
our website and he has received the
email granting them access to the judge
system now I'll post create a team David
what do you think we should name our
team in the next week great idea looks
like we're already on the same page if
the team name already exists you'll be
prompted to select a different team name
but in this case we're good to go
now here at the top you can see that I
am a member of the team however in the
second section you see a red exclamation
point next to two members since nobody
has joined my team yet I'm unable to
participate in the competition as each
team needs to to four people tell me
David to join my team so that we can
compete in hashcode in a team of two
people to invite David to join my team
all I have to do is copy the invitation
link and message it over to David to
join the team once David has followed
the link he is able to join our team
immediately and now you can see a green
checkmark next to team members meaning
we are eligible to participate and we
can see who else is on the team
you'll also notice in the left hand menu
an option for submissions and score has
now appeared this only pops up once you
have joined a team of two three or four
people we also talked a bit before about
joining the hashcode home hubs are
optional but there are way to make the
competition even more fun there's a hub
list an interactive map of hubs on our
site so you can find the hub here's to
you we've linked this in the description
box below some hubs may have
restrictions so check the website to see
if there's a new you can find the
contact details for the hub's
organizer in case you have any questions
to join a hub click select a hub in the
judge system you can select the country
you're competing from and then the hub
you but to compete from from here you
are prompted prior to joining the hub
hub organizers will receive your contact
details after you've registered for
their hub so they might email you with
confirmation details for the day of and
invite you to their hubs Facebook page
so you can find other hash cutters for
your team you can register for hub both
up until March 1st at 1830 Central
European ten but we recommend
registering for hub early as they can
fill up now I can see that David and I
are both members of Team Google hash
code and which have we are participating
from now that David and I are eligible
to compete of hash code we want to start
practicing and make sure that we know
how to submit our solutions we highly
recommend that you do the same if you
look at the problem statement section of
the judge system you'll see your
practice problem and instructions which
David will give us tips on in just a few
minutes if you click on problem
statement you'll see PDFs like this with
the prompt David and I started working
through the problem so we will go to
submissions and score through the
left-hand menu
and then click create a new submission
when submitting a solution here you can
see it tells you that you must submit a
sources file however you only need to
submit at least one dataset file for
this Pizza practice problem this means
that we can choose to submit something
for either example small medium or big
or any combination of these we can
submit as many times as we would like
for any of these output files as you can
see here I'm choosing to only submit for
example but not for anything else at
this time the score will update
automatically it's important to know
that you can create multiple submissions
and that it is highly encouraged as
these are optimization problems you
should continue to iterate and submit
continuously our biggest tip is do not
wait until the end to submit instead you
should be submitting very often since
there's no perfect answer here it's
really about the iterations now that you
know how to get signed up for hash code
let's up David share tips and tricks
when it comes to the actual problems
thank you
let's not talk about the practice
problem about the prerequisite on the
algorithm inside please review from
Dement all data types sorting algorithms
and data structures on the programming
side please remember that you can put in
any language you want as we go there is
not only one language use you can choose
any language and even in multiple if you
do so just please make sure to create an
archive with all the source files and
send it through the turf system from the
tooling side before we begin we advise
you to prepare your development
environment make sure that everything is
ready on your computer so that you don't
waste time downloading or installing
softwares
moreover please note that
use Eddie to available online and
finally on this testing side be ready to
launch some tests in order to improve
your code and find some bugs so the
first part is very important you must
read the problem statement before
jumping into coding for the practice
from you can find in the judge it's all
about pizza slices here you can see me
and some of my hash code fellow
colleagues slashing your pizza at the
online qualification round last year
look at the input format here the pizza
is a rectangular shape specified by a
number of rows or a number of columns
see a minimum of each ingredient per
slice L and maximum size H those four
variables can be found on the first line
of the Inc data the other lines so the
ingredient distribution after reading
that you should know that all C al and H
will be the input of the program then
look at the example with every problem
statement we show a short example of
what the input and output will be and
also try to illustrate the example with
an image it should give you another way
to understand the problem hash code is
all about input and output we give you
an input file you submit an output file
look at how we want you to structure the
output file second part is to read the
problem again in order to not miss any
detail very good the third part which is
for me the most important one is to
visualize and share once again avoid
jumping into Connie that's a team
exercise take a few minutes to share
what you understood with your team and
try to solve it visually
don't hesitate to write things down on
paper it can't help we also advise you
to split the work to do if you have
different parts in your plume intentions
or if you come up with different
approaches make it clear with your team
so that everyone knows who works on what
on this part
the idea is to step back and see the big
pictures and then translate it into code
then and only then you can go now
I will explain to you one dream solution
to this problem
but first let's begin with the
disclaimer the solution that I will show
you is not the solution
at Google we tackle real-life problems
and often there is not one solution but
a set of different solutions you have to
try different solutions in order to
determine which one works best my
solution is only one dimension I will
use only one phone checking horizontal
angles as a result this is not optimal
at all for each type I need to check if
there is a possibility to add value
slices the drawback here is that my
slices will be horizontal and finally it
will be quick and learn as you have only
four hours to come up with the solution
we don't require you to write good code
that's the only difference with working
at email here timing is important so
first part of my illusion the input
parser and I told you it's all about
input and output so it's important to be
able to quickly ingest the input file
and get all variables set up that's
exactly what I do here I read the file
initialize all variables that's on the
first line and also create the peace
agreed on mission will each rate as I
told you I'm going to analyze this visa
line for life so only one phone back
the index of the first part of the slice
and is the last ball then the mushroom
count and tomato count you have meat
counting ingredients as my analysis is
only on one line
I must reset the counters at every one
so abroad every line sell per cell and
increment the ingredient countries we
must not forget about another constraint
the max size of the size so I
continuously checked it in case it's too
big I will need to move the beginning of
the slides from one set finally at the
end I check if I have a valid slice if
so I'm writing the coordinates of that
slide of last slice into the out
enviable results and resetting the
counters except the bag one because I
will continue to search for valid slice
in the same room as the row is not
finished let's have a look now on what
my algorithm does taking the first line
line zero I will iterate on every piece
and check if I have valid sizes as they
don't have any mushroom there is no
valid slice from non zero then I'm gonna
go on line one
doing the same I will find the first
lives giving me two points as the line
is not finished I will continue my quest
and find another one giving me three
points this time on line - no but it's
lives as once again they are only
Tomatoes so let's wrap up on that and
give you some advices my score here five
points is less than optimal but once
again is very to have one solution once
a mission unknown there is no right or
wrong answer the most important thing is
that you come up with one answer don't
wait until the end to
mint and the best advice you can give
you is to follow that model submits
iterate and repeat that was an awesome
walkthrough David I'm sure that everyone
watching has some questions for our Q&amp;amp;A
at the end but before we jump into that
let's take a few minutes to just recap
how you can make the most out of hash
code first if you haven't already
registered for hash code on our website
g-code slash hashtag registration is
open for one more week
only until February 26 at 1800 Central
European Time so be sure to sign up now
also if you haven't already found
teammates you can request teammates and
posts in our G+ and facebook communities
so you can meet someone through there
and you can also check if there is a hub
near you so that you can meet and
participate with passionate participants
and finally we also advise you to look
at our previous program statement on our
website available on our website so that
you get familiar with the problem type
and with the way of submitting the exact
system and if you haven't already be
sure to share us on social we put some
links in the description box below and I
know that David and I are excited about
hash code as is the entire hash code
team we can't wait for this competition
but we want to hear from you tell us why
you're excited about hash code and share
photos of how you're preparing for the
competition using hash tag ready for
hash code we'll be sharing the most
creative posts that we see using the
hash tag on social media and during the
online qualification round livestream
you might even find yourself with some
people goodies now let's switch it over
to your questions so let's begin with
one question that we received by email
nearly can you explain how the
scoreboard works for the practice round
versus the onion clarification roll yeah
that's a great question so during the
practice round you
only see your teens own score and how
you're doing in your own sort of
practice space in our Dutch system
during the online qualification round
however
we do post a global scoreboard through
the judge system here you can see how
you stack up against other teams that
are competing in hashcode and you note
that we freeze the judge system or
excuse me we freeze the scoreboard one
hour before the submission deadline just
to create a little bit more excitement
and suspense before we wrap up however
during this last hour you can continue
to submit in our judge system until
twenty to thirty several European time
but remember that is a hard deadline so
our next question is I would like to
know if the team members are able to use
more than one programming language to
solve the problem and if yes how do you
submit the final solution in this case
so yeah as I told you before it's
totally fine to use community phone
language perhaps in your team there are
four people each of whom can language
the important part here is that we
create an archive with all the source
file that we will that you will submit
into the reject system that's it
another question that you see what tools
can I use during their competition so
you can use any tool that you would like
as long as you're submitting your own
original code when you generate a
station so the next question that we
received via email is how will I know if
I'm moving forward to the final round so
don't worry you will receive an email on
March 6 so on Tuesday multi six telling
you to be news awesome and it seems like
we have time for just one more question
one more okay let's pick this one how do
I organize I have remote community great
question so if you're interested in
organizing the hub you can apply through
our website on the hub's page and the
deadline to apply is every 26 at 1800
essentially
taking time and we'll get back to you
within 48 hours and that is it so thanks
everyone for joining us again if we
didn't get to your question be sure to
check out our FAQ on our website judo /
hashcode and you can also keep asking
questions on our G+ and facebook
communities and regarding this video
don't worry it will be made available on
our personal life at Google channel this
week so that in case you want to
rehearse a little bit and train before
the unconstitutional you will be able to
rewatch this video thanks for joining us
we look forward having you complete your
studying
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
