Sean Hurley Kyle Mullenix and I'm a
technical lead mileage if I am an
engineering manager technical recruiter
ethnical program manager at Google this
is my first full-time adult job the
reason that I chose Google over other
companies had a lot to do with Google's
culture so one thing that Google does
differently is we hire people not
position as high as somebody who is a
music teacher into software engineering
and then of course me being a military
paralegal going into core HR not only
does Google embrace diversity but it
allows you to create and drive your
career in whatever way that you want to
Google is a company that cares not only
about its employees to its benefit
programs but also Google has excluded
orgs and all these campaigns helping the
world achieve something better that's a
really big factor as to why I chose
Google I knew I would be working with my
skill set but I would also be able to
use that skill set to help other people
actually work whereas the LGBT community
here
whatever it is I'm passionate about I've
been able to drive change around it
I personally wanted to Seattle office
more than Mountain View's office dadelus
more planes and it's just a more homey
environment to VM I can say safely that
everything's great about you hundred K
five years ago and completely fell in
love with the place I moved here in 91
as soon as I got here I was completely
happy and never wanted to leave about
you get such ebikes but we get the G try
X infinity pool it's so gorgeous out
here I think this was like my favorite
part I do all of my life one-on-one the
ingress looking over Lake Union it's
amazing there's mountains nearby for
skiing you can go scuba diving there's
everything that I could ever want right
here so I start my day at the gym we
could go to gym on then you have the
mind I've actually never really worked
out but I think the difference here is
that they actively promote physical
health well spot over here is actually
our nap pods I have a one-year-old and
when I was working and pregnant you get
so tired in the first trimester I go
crash for 20 minutes and then feel
better the thing I really like about
Google in general is how empowered you
are to go and make a difference rather
than being told what to do you're
expected to kind of like identify the
problems and tackle them in whichever
order you want to do that there's a lot
of exciting things going on from cloud
to building self-driving cars this is
the Unity game engine as I move this guy
around I can make changes immediately in
and see them happen it's like the Wild
West for this kind of technology we
could do anything but we can't do
everything so most of my job is just
making sure that we're doing the right
things at the right time Google has such
a wide reach so anything that I work on
I know is impacting hundreds of
thousands probably millions so this is
every child per platform that our team
helps create and we just launched this
last March three months ago we were
sitting in a meeting saying like what if
we did this and then we actually did it
and we actually saw people like touching
it and playing with it and everything as
you grow and learn about new interests
there's always something for you here at
Google
somewhere in Google will be someone
working on something
you'll be interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
