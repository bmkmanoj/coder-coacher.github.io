so we've got some more questions to
answer here from our moderator page ah
next question next question I've got it
right here on my G pad the question
comes again from mark art in Barcelona
Spain asks what is it I use a lot of
questions but his questions have been
rated very highly here - what can I do
to get an interview at Google send $20
Vidia is sort of it that's sort of a
tricky question because the it's sort of
like you know where do you start here
okay there's a number of different ways
you can do it mom one way is you can do
something incredible right there's a
here's an example yesterday was was the
five-year anniversary of the mat first
nappa mashup that Paul Rademacher write
with a the Craigslist housing stuff and
you know that was pretty incredible
Paul Rademacher now works at Google
right so that's one way of getting an
interview is doing something really
interesting and novel and innovative on
the web that gets our gets out of our
attentions pretty hard to do though for
a regular guy on the street to just do
something amazing well I mean well it's
one way I think that what I tell people
to do honestly is especially if you're
just coming out of school is to get
involved in an open-source project one
of the things I love about open source
projects is that it's basically a free
internship if you get involved right a
lot of folks come out of school they
don't have recommendations there maybe
they can get a recommendation from a
professor but they have no real world
job recommendations or colleague
recommendations but if they've been
working on an open source project
maybe while they're in the university
and they've made a real impact there it
is a completely transparent job
experience I can go look up their code I
can look at their emails that on the
project I can see their actual impact
and get so their accomplishment but it
also shows one of the things that you
talked about in the past which is that
it shows that this is somebody who
really likes to write soft there's a
passion there you know there's a passion
there if you don't love to write
software you're not going to spend your
spare time writing it right you're going
to do your classwork in school you're
going to go to your nine-to-five job
then you go do whatever it is you'd like
to do so I think I think working up
source is a great thing going to now if
you're if you're looking at colleges
going to a good school you know real a
top to your school is is one way of
getting great attention graduating good
grades and again doing something while
you're there so it's it's not just sort
of one thing it's a lot of different
things that sort of you want to make
your resume stand out not just because
you've listed everything under the Sun
but because you've actually accomplished
something we really do look at resumes I
think for people who have done something
well I mean the Prentice we get so many
resumes every single thousands a day
that look exactly the same it's like I
everybody has a computer science degree
everybody has 50,000 acronyms listed
with technologies that they've played
with at some point but that doesn't
distinguish it from one another right if
we see something like made this really
amazing product
my spare time for fun right I worked on
this really cool open-source project or
I you know something like that that's
going to make it not just look like a
list of acronyms it's really going to
get our attention and that's what's
going to get the recruiter calling you
for an initial interview and this sort
of comes back to the whole resume
writing thing right I mean when you
write your resume you really want it to
to focus on things you've done don't
just list a whole bunch of things you
know I was member of a team blah blah
blah yes if we don't let a team that
launched this that did that or focus on
on what you when you're sort of your
execution on the other hand do not lie
about what you did that would be bad
fluffing resumes is a very common thing
and I know a lot of books say to you
know pad your resume this way and that
Google engineers if you get into
interviews they will call you on every
bit of it they will ask you about every
little bit of thing on your resume in
and you will be embarrassed if you list
something that you actually don't know
anything about right or that you know
you saw you spent one hour thinking
about and then walk through and be
careful too because if you put on there
that you're you're an expert at
PostScript you might wind up being
interviewed by someone who has worked on
PostScript at the past we have people at
Google who were written parts of the C
language we have contributed to Java I
mean so yeah it's definitely I think
it's important it's an opportunity to
show what you've done and what you know
and you know it's definitely the chance
to toot your own horn but it's
definitely not a chance
to the home that's not your own I agree
back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
