about how Google hires I'm Shawn
engineering a technology recruiter I'm
Rachel I'm a business recruiter I was
she done also business recruiter so
today we're going to do two things one
we're going to talk about some common
google myths and bust them and two we're
actually going to talk about how Google
hires so let's get right into some
myth-busting so the first myth is about
us only hiring people from Ivy League
institutions that's not true
so we hire people from all sorts of
backgrounds colleges we hire people who
haven't even attended college so we
really are looking to hire a diverse set
of candidates from all sorts of
experiences and your GPA is only taken
into consideration if you graduated
recently from a school
the second big myth we hear a lot
actually is about brain teasers
so we won't be asking you crazy
questions about how many golf balls fit
into the Empire State Building we really
try to spend that time getting to know
you and really try to limit it to about
four interviews over the course of your
process so not a multitude of
conversations so it's not impossible to
get hired at Google and we'll talk a
little bit more about what that process
looks like throughout
let's talk a little bit more about how
we actually hire sure the first step in
getting hired is really to get us your
application our career site has some
great tips on putting together a
powerful compelling resume for example
your resume should be concise generally
less than two pages also you really want
to make sure that it has no errors or
mistakes read it top to bottom bottom to
top have a friend take a look at it for
you pay extra special attention to it
finally you want to make sure that your
bullet points on your resume convey
impact don't just list the things that
you did at your current job but really
how you impacted that role it's one of
the things that we really care about a
lot here at Google yeah perfect because
living breathing human beings just like
us actually look at your resume
thoughtful trained professionals who can
help connect you with some great
opportunities here at Google exactly and
so once your resume is review you may
hear back from a recruiter if you don't
after a couple months you can assume
that that role has likely been filled
but if you do the next step is a phone
conversation with a recruiter like one
of us so will what to learn more about
your experience your background your
potential fit with the role and then
from there you may have an additional
phone interview with another relevant
Googler for that team so on the
technical side that may include a coding
interview on the business side it may
include a conversation that's more
specific to the world
and comes the exciting and slightly
nerve-wracking on-site interviews where
you get a chance to come on site
interview with maybe between four to
five interviewers if you're interviewing
for a technical role typically those
interviews we revolve around data
structures coding algorithms and if
you're interviewing for a non-technical
position often more structured interview
questions in those interviews you often
will have a couple minutes to maybe chat
with the interviewer get to know them a
little bit talk a little bit about the
role also definitely have an opportunity
for some breaks in between grab a water
snack that sort of thing and sometimes
even an opportunity to have a slightly
informal lunch maybe with another member
of the team or even hiring manager if
you make it past that point in the
process your packet goes to our hiring
committees that's really just a team of
Googlers who take a look at your packet
your packet is nothing more than your
interviews your resume any work samples
you may have submitted to us if the
hiring committee signs off on it and
then goes to one of our senior level
Googlers for a final round of approval
it really just an extra set of objective
eyes if that senior level Googler signs
off on it that's when you get a call
from your recruiter saying
congratulations
here's your offer and that's a brief
synopsis of how we hire here at Google
so check us out at life at Google for
more information or on our career site
of course to learn even more thanks for
