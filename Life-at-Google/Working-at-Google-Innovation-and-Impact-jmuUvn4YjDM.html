Google is the idea that the entire
company is actively doing science and by
that I mean science the idea of taking
an idea testing it building it seeing if
it works and adapting it in a way
there's not that much of a distinction
between the research and the engineering
so that we're all trying to build a
better product for all trying to use
everything that we know and bring it to
bear to improve our existing products
and to end to invent new ones here you
will actually find a meaningful problem
to work on and you can work closely with
the product development people to get
the best possible product out there then
I'd also like you to take the time
afterwards or in-between to sit down and
think exactly but why was it you did
what you did write it up and get it out
there it's your responsibility to
yourself to Google and to the scientific
community to write it up and formalize
it and make sure that this was really a
good and sound implementation and
solution you came up with people often
ask me about publications
I view in the modern world of computer
science that publications are not only
the traditional journal and conference
proceedings but also open source
releases standards and also product
releases that change the state of the
art in many ways in an engineering
oriented discipline like computer
science I feel these other
non-traditional forms of publication may
be even more important the work that my
team does at Google is trying to solve a
very important problem which is making
the mobile web fast what we're trying to
do is make it possible to browse the web
from a mobile device so that each
webpage is instantaneous so obviously if
we solve this problem then we're going
to have a huge impact on how people use
the internet from
devices but of course here at Google we
do a lot of search and you can search by
voice on an Android device as well as
other mobile devices and so we work on
making that better and better and
available in more and more languages as
a as a research oriented engineer a
person who who is interested in
advancing the state of the art and doing
new things Google is really a great
place to be an engineer oh it's always
great to work for a company that that
shows that they care about us place
whether we're researchers on that and
they show it in so many various ways
whether it's the food it's the t-shirt
that it's the the package it's the
people with the buildings it creates a
unique place to work research at Google
is about solving real problems for real
people and using some of the most data
and the largest systems imaginable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
