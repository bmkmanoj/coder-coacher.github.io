you freedom to make choices once you
learn how to think like a technologist
you can go into any field that you want
so I grew up in India my parents were in
the business of building and it was
heavy-metal engineering so it was very
natural for us to grow up and want to
build things like our parents my mother
was a pretty special woman she was very
traditional she only wore saris but also
just incredibly powerful and steely she
pretty much built a company and kept it
going for almost five decades but at the
same time she should have the greatest
pleasure out of being a mother and now a
grandmother give me a hint to what you
could be as a woman you could be
different
I remember reading a National Geographic
article on keen rich hush up my eyes I
can still bring back that picture of the
Cambridge skyscape and I decided that's
what I was going to do so I must have
been at that point 13 or 14 I told my
teacher that I was going to Cambridge
and I was going to apply early and I got
a lot of encouragement they would nudge
me and they'd say this is great and I
think you'll do wonderful but what why
don't you try for Oxford instead and I
told my father they wanted me to try for
Oxford not Cambridge but Cambridge is
where I want to go and he said you know
do the things that you believe in so I
decided to do it and I got in and it was
sort of very reaffirming but it also
sort of set the imprint ah to my life
which is when people tell me I can't do
something that's when I'm so sure I'm
gonna go after it and I'm gonna do it so
when I was in Cambridge I was studying
Chemical Engineering but all my friends
were studying English or history it was
very stark to see how different our
lives were they took up rowing they were
into drama I would have classes in the
morning and five hours of chemistry lab
and so their lives just seemed so much
richer than mine but I'm really glad
that I stuck to it
because when it came to getting that
first job I was able to benefit and sort
of very quickly go to the next stage in
my life you know it taught me that hard
work is important to do but it also
taught me to do the thing you believe in
and not try to be the prototype I'd
spent close to ten years infla Delphia
and I'd established a career and in 2001
my husband had an opportunity to move to
Stanford Silicon Valley had been my
dream
so we uprooted our lives and and we
started afresh I decided I'd go back to
school and go into my MBA so and this
was an unusual decision here I was in my
early 30s with two children but I
applied to Stanford and I got in and I
did not appreciate how hard it was going
to be for me I had to go back and
reclaim my successes and I'd really sort
of extract from them the courage and the
confidence that was starting to win a
recruiter from PayPal contacted me and I
said well why not but I thought if I'm
gonna go in interview with PayPal why
don't I just throw in a resume to Google
and see if anything happens there and
they called me back and I got an offer
within three weeks of submitting my
resume so I leave the product team for
Google Offers we believe local is a next
frontier and with the innovations now
with mobile devices there is a fantastic
opportunity to really transform the
shopping experience in the real world
today five million businesses and a
billion users on Android phones use the
products that I've been working on every
day the thing that makes me really proud
as a woman technologist is that both my
girls are are planning to go into
computer science I'm proud of my
children I'm proud of some of the things
that I've done but I think what gets me
really excited and motivated is all the
things that are still left to come
