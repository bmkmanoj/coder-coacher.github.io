some more questions about working at
Google actually gonna answer one
question all right one question okay you
got it there on your GPA I've got it
it's ready in my G pad excellent freshly
charged so here's the question who
approves or rejects the innovative ideas
that you have and that's from ANCA EU
and Toulouse France it's interesting
because I think this question sort of
assumes a traditional corporate
structure where there's a very a chain
of command and you know orders come down
from one person to the other and if you
have an idea then you have to go through
some very formal process up through the
chain and down through the chain and
that kind of bureaucracy really doesn't
exist here it's a very would you say
somebody comes up to you you I want you
to have an idea right now
no but it's a very it's a very flat
organization it could write maybe there
is some hierarchy but very little
compared to what you would expect it's
most of the most of the time it's just
sort of as someone described it a lot of
mad scientists running around trying
crazy new things and sort of ideas
bubbling up from the bottom and then
you've got a very thin middle layer of
management and product management
through sort of our noticing the
innovations and say hey that's a great
idea let's turn that into a feature or a
product right right that's it's not a
top-down right but I want to I want to
sort it actually back up to the idea
part know that debunk the general a
general concept that ideas are something
that are approved or disapproved right
my personal view is that ideas are
worthless
99% of ideas that come out of anyone
myself included especially myself are
just garbage I have 20 different ideas
but walking to work in the morning right
the fact of the matter is that what what
really gets to a point where it's even
something to contemplate or put on quote
approve is when you have some something
that's fleshed out as an idea a
prototype perhaps a design document or
or the opportunity to bounce it off some
other people and get some more input on
this this goes back to the execution is
what matters not just having a thought
right right even the beginning of
execution matters way way more right
like having a design document having a
demo having something yeah right so so
yeah if you if you go up to a bunch of
folks and say hey I have this great idea
then red people might be oh yeah well
whatever you know is that
possible can do this once you start to
explore it whether it's do a quick
prototype which is probably the best way
to go or a design doc then you're
starting to start getting ideas of what
is this gonna work is this not gonna
work here are some of the hard parts
here's some of the easy parts so by the
time you're actually ready to show it to
somebody who really does have the power
to say yes you know we'll have some
people work on this we would spend more
time when this or commit something but
you you've already learned a lot about
the problem you've already got something
sort of working and so it's not just a
hypothetical ya throw a bunch of people
at this idea it comes back to that sort
of you never want to do something the
first time in front of other people
right so when I when I we went out to
interview right what do we we knew we
have to write code on a whiteboard so we
sat down with pencil and paper and tried
practice writing code on pencil and
paper makes a big difference it does the
first time I did it I felt like I'd had
a lobotomy right you know I was so used
to writing a code with my compiler right
there to help me out and so for a
prototype is a way of sort of getting
that first shot at it right and you can
work through some of the hard problems
or find out some of the catching points
before you go in front of someone else
and say you know this is my idea this is
my yeah I say that's the general process
is if you have an idea at Google and
something that you feel like you could
you want to really shop around or get
approval or get other people look at the
step the first thing I would do is I
guess I would use my 20% time right
right implement and maybe maybe convince
some co-workers around me hey you want
to work on this with me and your 20%
time let's band together and see if we
come up with a proof of concept but
getting them a little I into that right
really importance if you can create like
a small group of people who are all
doing 20% of something and then you get
something that is actually demo able
then you show that to somebody else and
then the idea will catch on that's
that's the hope and that's how a lot of
practice gets started here right but
it's not it's not just you know I have
an idea I'll go talk to the VP and he'll
say yes or no it's just it's not that
something and and I think a lot of it
depends is it is this that's a new
product or is this a feature for an
existing product right because if it's a
feature in an existing product
especially if it's a product that you're
working on currently I think it's a lot
easier to sort of get that ball rolling
because you you can bounce it off your
team your product manager and see okay
where can we fit this in and then if
it's something that you can't accomplish
in your 20% time it does make
easier to sort of get that into there
because a lot of the a lot of the issue
is in general is that is nice as it
would be engineering resources are
finite so you've got to pick and choose
what's more important is it more
important to fix this bug someone that's
affecting so many people it's more
important to write this new feature or
is it more important to implement this
idea I just came up with oh all right I
think we're set thanks a lot see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
