hangout on air with a life at Google on
the G+ page for the life of Google team
for the next 30 minutes are going to be
talking about the Google Cultural
Institute in Paris my name is Amy Gepard
I've worked for Google for almost 6
years now I'm currently the program
manager at the Google Cultural Institute
here in Paris and I'm pleased to welcome
you to this hangout with some of my
colleagues we have Steve and so mark and
al so how about you guys introduce
yourselves a little bit
Steve should we start with you sure
thanks Amy
I'm Steve Carson I've been with Google
for just over six years actually and I'm
with the cultural institute I'm the head
of the Cultural Institute we started up
about a year ago great mom
I'm Marco shiitake I'm the product
manager for the Cultural Institute I
basically looked after the consumer user
experience and product strategy and I'm
based in Paris been in bath been at
Google and YouTube for about eight years
and I'm super excited to be focused on
bringing the collective memories and
stories of humanity online through
beautiful user experiences now I'm
particularly interested in semantic
storytelling and the power of crowd
contributed media anthem
hey I'm a anthem I'm the tech lead of
the Cultural Institute and like any tech
leader at Google what I do is I really
have two hats my first my first hat is
about making sure the right technical
technical decisions are taken across the
team and then I also actually spend
myself a lot of time typing code which
is what I enjoy doing and it's actually
a real pleasure to be able to type code
that helps spread culture for an
engineering position for an engineer
it's it's like a dream job I should say
I mean I think I'm at Google for almost
five years
I'm based in Tel Aviv and I'm one of the
tech late
the VTEC lives in the culture Institute
and I've been working on culture for
quite a while in Google working on the
different other projects which are now
related and part of the culture
Institute great thanks guys
so I think we're gonna kick off given
them there we have a bunch of people
watching on this public hangout and
we're gonna kick off with a question
from our moderator she we we advertised
this hangout a couple of days ago and a
lot of you gave us great questions we're
going to start with a question from Tom
HTML from lean in hot in France and
Tom's question is what is the purpose of
the Google Cultural Institute do you
create things to preserve culture online
or do you promote cultural apps and
tools created by other Google teams only
so maybe Steve you could give us a bit
of background about the culture
Institute and help answer Tom's
questions
sure thing thanks for the question Tom
the short answer to your question is
it's the former rather than the latter
so we create things rather than simply
promoting things that other teams at
Google build so we have kind of a fancy
name the Google Cultural Institute what
does that mean but as you can tell from
this group here were basically a group
of engineers and product managers which
is an engineering group much like any
other engineering group at Google we
happen to be an engineering group that
it's focused on using technology to the
service of the cultural sector and that
particularly means preserving and
promoting culture online but as Mark
hinted earlier really we see our mission
as writing software and creating
products that help bring together the
collective stories of humanity online
and which bring together the people who
have the material of culture which
includes museums and archives and
institutions the experts the historians
the curators the archivists and who know
the material and most importantly the
users themselves who not only want to
experience the material but have their
own material and their own stories to
contribute our vision is
the history of everything held by
everyone great thanks Steve I think
maybe we could talk about a little bit
about people's backgrounds Mayall you
mentioned earlier that you've worked on
multiple cultural theme product project
at Google and perhaps you could give us
a little bit of insight into how you got
involved in the Cultural Institute and
sort of what things you worked on
beforehand and what's what segwayed into
your work on the cultural institute okay
so I actually started working in what we
call the 20% time it's a every Google
engineer can take 20% of his time and
work on something he's passionate about
so I actually started working with the
Yad Vashem which is the Israeli
Holocaust Museum and outside and when I
started it was just about let's see if
we can help them they probably have some
technical things that maybe Google can
help them with and we started with small
things like here YouTube channel
introduced you know basic Google
technologies and while walking with them
is so different problems that I figure
that okay these are big problems that
are not probably not just here on the
shams and started walking toward
launching stuff for them as well trying
to build the product and trying to build
it as a bigger with a bigger vision I
move though I started talking to more
tomorrow Institute organization and we
moved to the Dead Sea squad which also
online kind of great out of great
content should be online and now it is
online working together with the Israeli
museum on that and they Israeli on
psychotherapy mmm
and this is Google so we take that and
you keep thinking on bigger and bigger
mission and now after it is evolved
almost 20 percent into Israeli pod
project project with few people working
on that and few launches now we're
actually joining forces and with this
theme that you see here make it even
bigger and with even a bigger vision and
more partners great thanks al and Steve
do you want to maybe talk a little bit
about some of the other projects that
the Cultural Institute is involved in
I'm sure
well we were the Cultural Institute in
its new form was founded about a year
ago in April 2011 but as I always saying
we were really based on some
foundational work that was done
pioneered by il and also by Yossi Mateus
in the Tel Aviv office and with a with a
small team already there in Tel Aviv al
mentioned the project that we did with
the HM Museum in Jerusalem which is a
project around a large photo archive I'm
of the Holocaust helping to bring that
archive online and to do some work
around crowdsourcing the metadata for
that content and also some automatic
processing of the metadata of that
content one of the other precursors to
the existence of the Cultural Institute
was also the Google Art Project which
launched at the beginning of last year
which was a partnership between 17
museums and Google around allowing
people to give a virtual visit inside
museum that again was a project which
came out as a 20% project but eventually
was rolled in to the Cultural Institute
and we've done three or four other pilot
projects um since we launched last year
which is really all of these projects
really are about us getting to know how
to work with the cultural world what
what are the problems one of the issues
that people have what's the best what
are the best experiences to bring this
content online and what is what what
what is it that Google can bring to this
world because we're not historians and
when you're artists were technologists
how so we needed to work with some
partners to really understand their
world and what we can bring
and so you know from those pilot
projects we've really kind of distilled
a lot of the learning and we're now
working on a number of fronts on really
kind of broadening it and to reach a
larger set of modalities across culture
so I'm not just art or photo archives
but also document archives manuscripts
architecture you know really across the
board and to think about how we can
scale so that we can get a lot of
partners involved and also especially to
think about how we can bring in the
users as well to get users contributing
their own experiences of culture as well
as their own stories of history and
eyewitness accounts and so on
great thank you well that's a perfect
segue into my next question and I know
our focus at the Cultural Institute is
very much on users and making sure
people have access to for more of what
is available online in the cultural
world maybe mark you can help us answer
this next question there's been a lot of
questions on the moderator about how
users can interact with the dual
cultural institute maybe you could give
us some insight into how that's going to
happen
sure so today as ale and Steve were
mentioning most of the work that we've
done is in its empowering a lot of the
experiences on other web sites so
whether it's the Israel Museum of
Jerusalem and their website with the
Dead Sea Scrolls and bringing the oldest
versions of the Old Testament online
making it searchable etc or we're
working with yet Bush m and bringing all
the photo archives from the Holocaust
online it's essentially available on
those websites
so we basically power those those
websites and with the art project of
course we have something on a domain
Google Art Project comm which is the
first instance of us showcasing some
some of the museum content namely art in
an experience that's specifically around
being able to search and view that
content within a kind of a street view
life experience going forward you'll see
a lot of these projects
showcase on our website which will be
launched in the next few weeks in
addition we'll be working on some
consumer facing products that will bring
together a lot of these experiences by
showcasing exhibits and having a search
experience that will allow you to search
across media across all this types of
themed content great thank you
so III know working on this team that
we're not without our challenges but I I
wanted to ask and some a little bit
about the technical challenge and some
what's the what are the most exciting
challenges you face I'm working on the
Google Cultural Institute right nicely
enough we have a pile of exciting
challenges so it's really a matter of
picking up the ones that are the most
exciting and there are two things that
come to mind when we talk about the
challenges the first one is about the
user experience
you know as you know at Google we we're
really trying to put the user first and
I believe that there is no project all
on this one that is really taking that
to hurt we're really trying to innovate
on the visualization we're trying to
innovate on the way we actually present
the data we're trying to really bring
the story of history to our users and
it's extremely challenging in some cases
because the the meaning of those
artifacts is really bound with the
context they're coming from and so we're
always fighting to figure out how to
render the context on you know some
number of pixels and that that's that's
really what makes me up what make even
makes me wake up in the morning it's
it's really interesting problem to solve
the other saying and that one is quite
funny actually is I feel like some day I
come to work and I'm going to enter this
attic and I see piles and piles of
pictures photos letters and even the
partners we work with in some cases
don't even know what those are about
they're like you know we don't have any
metadata for that stuff
but sort of want to try to present it to
our users in a meaningful way and so
we're developing piles and piles of
Technology in fact we're actually
reusing a lot of our our our existing
technology to try to solve the mess like
as if we had some kind of a robot
crawling through the attic and you know
putting pictures into bins it's
unfortunately not as pretty chaotic as
that but it is it is it is certainly
very interesting can we get a robot and
an actor I think that's an awesome we
should definitely get one of those I
I've never thought of it in those terms
actually and now I realize it might
actually be a pretty cool 20% project in
the attic project that's true we should
meet up with those guys and get off get
the robot helping out in our attic okay
I wanted to mark maybe we could touch on
some of the other challenges because I
realized that obviously from a technical
point of view there are a lot of really
interesting problems to solve but I
realized you as a project - a product
manager you have to work on a lot of the
other bigger picture exciting challenges
and then you could tell us a little bit
about those sure I think what's exciting
about the opportunity is that with an
online space you have infinite space in
the sense that which is different from
sort of physical museums where you have
limited space and so with infinite space
we we think about the the problem of
being able to bring curated material
together in beautiful experiences to
users while being able to allow for very
powerful deep discovery experiences for
all the types of assets that we have and
so I think imagine you know a museum
with you know an infinite number of
floors with you know all these different
types of themes how do you how do you
create even a table of contents for that
you know how do you how do you get
curators to to be highlighted in that
context and so I think the the the the
vastness of the opportunity makes makes
the product decisions you know very very
challenging I think another piece of
this is
it's really around across media the fact
that fact is that we have documents
manuscripts you know we have video
content photos etc etc and so being able
to bring an experience that that we've
seen together all those types of media
in a single experience that makes sense
is something that definitely keeps me up
at night and yeah I think those are the
those are the key things great thank you
um so I'm gonna ask a slightly devil's
advocate question I guess it would be um
I think a lot of people on the moderator
and other people around you know in the
groups that we work with have asked why
is Google getting into culture why is
this an area of interest for us so I
don't know if Steve you maybe you want
to shed some light on that and then if
anyone else wants to dive in as well
sure I think um
I mean in one sense it's an easy answer
because you're the mission of Google is
to organize the world's information and
make it universally useful and
accessible and you know in that light
it's right in line with our mission um
you know everybody around the world
shares a huge amount of culture which is
both implicit the stories that you grew
up with as well as heritage you know the
actual different objects from the past
which is still with us and which are
often displayed to you in museums or
books but those objects are for many
people very hard to access and it's also
you know until the Internet age I'm very
hard to get an overview across know the
totality of of that material so at one
level it's it's simply you know an
extension of googles mission into this
into this new realm and makes total
sense
I'd also add that um for us I think
what's exciting about it and Mark
especially has touched on this a couple
of times and actually the vision really
comes from him is this idea of taking
culture to not only publishing it to a
very wide audience
but receiving culture from a very wide
audience and that also then speaks to
our product challenges because what we
want to achieve with this product is as
I said earlier you know the the stories
of everything told by everyone
so we don't just want to have a
beautiful experience around the starry
night by Van Gogh and you know in a
museum we also want to enable you to
create a really great experience around
your response to that particular that
particular object but even more than
that you know we don't just want to have
no an exhibition around the fall of the
Berlin wall we want your story about
when you were there in Leipzig Square in
1989 and what happened on that day or
your grandfather's story or the story of
the place where you grew up story of
your family
well the story of perhaps the place
where your family comes from so we need
to create a product experience which
invites you to to create those stories
and makes it very simple for you to tell
those stories in a vote beautiful and
engaging way in the same context of all
the rest of that material and that I
think for us is probably the most
exciting part of the challenge great if
I may add I mean of the question of why
is Google doing that so my experience is
that Google is us and why Google is
doing that because they are engineers
like us like me and like Mark and
actually that walking here and wants to
do that and we push it forward and then
things happen and now I took you know
these are these we all of us kind of
presented up the leather to you know
more and more senior people you know I
myself during the years I got lots of
feedback why doing it like that why this
or not that well I with them why you
right I never got the question why try
to do that how much it cost that I never
got this question everybody I presented
you know everybody hear about this
project inside Google it's clear what
why we need to do that humanity needed
need need to be done and Google team can
do that so Google should do that
well that's how to get people outside
kind of how to I didn't believe it at
first but I discovered it too
it's something that it's clearly need to
be done so if you do it thanks al does
anyone have anything to add Locke did
you want to comment on that why are we
doing it I think I mean Steve and Al
actually hit this pretty well but you
know it's about the passion about of the
people that are here and you know it's
it's that passion that brings to life a
lot of those products I also think from
from a technology perspective it's very
interesting to work in the cultural
sector because there's a lot of
technology like crowd-sourced
metadata or OCR technology or sort of
the faceted semantic search technologies
that can be applied to the cultural
sector and it has a ton of rich metadata
rich rich information and so I think
it's a big opportunity for us to also
learn how these kind of leading as
technologies can be applied to something
that's that's real and and very
important for for people at large I'm
doing that echoing that I would say that
it's very much now is very much the
moment for a project like this because
all kinds of interesting developments
are taking place in the technology which
are really coming to bear on the
cultural sector I mean there are you
could they're across the whole range but
one that particularly excites me is the
massive drop in the price of actually
digitizing and capturing material the
drop in the price of doing it at a basic
level but also the really amazing things
that you know we can now do with our
with our smartphones in terms of not
only being able to you know capture a
High Definition image but to use
software to process that image the
things like HDR photography and so on
that trend which I think we're only at
the beginning of and is really going to
accelerate over the next two to five
years is really going to have a massive
step change in the amount of material
that comes online
from the cultural world both from the
institutions and from individuals their
own material and you know that makes it
really the perfect time to be working in
the space I think great thanks so let's
go to another question from one of our
viewers users I'm not sure how I refer
to them this question actually was in
the comment section on the Google+ page
of the life at Google Plus page it's
from someone called Alex Shelley man I
just want to say it's actually only part
of Alex's question his question was
longer he's all how question was longer
so the question we're going to answer is
how does online culture differ from the
culture promoted by old media ie TV
radio and newspapers I don't know mark
do you want to take a stab at answering
that sure so it's I think it's been
echoed in a lot of what we've been
talking about in this hangout but online
culture is obviously not only it's not a
one way publishing mechanism I think old
media today a lot of it has been
publishing content pushing it out to to
either books or newspapers magazines etc
I think online is very multifaceted it's
many it's a many way dialogue it's a
social dialogue its its democratic in
the sense that people can contribute to
culture and shape culture by adding
their unique perspectives to build a new
record in the sense of the narrative of
history of mankind I think it's it's a
new kind of publishing and a new type of
interactive sort of living documentary
of life that is possible online that's
that's not as possible when it's sort of
paper and it's you know sort of
published once and it's it's there and
so I think a lot of that content that
old media is created is actually really
relevant though it's highly curated
high-quality and that content needs to
kind of be re re repurposed in a sense
we can really bring it to life by
creating more context around it more
dialogue more of a social content
so all in all I think online is more
interactive it's more diverse and it's
you know it's constantly evolving which
which which is makes it a completely
different game from from what we've seen
today great does anyone else get too new
yep and there are two to ourselves when
I when I see the the world on media the
first thing is being humble about what
old means and one of those things that
fascinated me when we started thinking
about again the user experience is there
is there is a thousands of people
throughout the ages have thought about
how to render history using the
different techniques they had you know
it's always crawls waiting back then and
it's very interesting to think that now
that we have the power and the
flexibility of those pixels that can
turn on and off in you know milliseconds
it's very easy to figure out what those
people would have done with that by
positioned to having the linearity of
the book and it goes back to what Marco
singles over about organizing the the
history the other thing that comes to
mind which i think is also very
interesting and that definitely mark
touched on is the the the poxy patria
aspect right thousands of years ago only
few people knew how to write only only
the history by the eyes of the few
people that knew how to write has
installed we live in a world where we
can do much better and that's why we
showed it it's very well said hey oh
yeah yeah and another aspect that really
interests me is what what we call here
the long tail so the media is about you
know you pick up the story with the
highest rating maybe you have a local
newspaper that would take something
that's interest again in what a big
local community and when you go into the
archives now every every document every
image is interesting very interesting to
someone and with the new technology we
can bring it all right so everyone if
there is a document that there are only
hundred people in the world would find
it interesting
we should make sure these hundred can
find it and something that would never
you know be on TV or find its place into
the into the newspaper it shouldn't be
the right newspapers for the masses and
you know we can bring everything to the
longtail everybody finds something
interesting great thank you all right
guys well I'm not sure if we have time
for another question I think maybe we
could just cover quickly I know a lot of
people on the moderator have asked where
they can find out more about the
Cultural Institute where they can see I
think we had a question where can we
find all the realizations done by the
Google Cultural Institute or the project
mark I know you mentioned earlier that
we have a website coming soon so I just
wanted to say to everybody keep your
keep your eyes peeled there will be some
stay tuned I guess there will be some
some more from the cultural institute
team in the coming months thank you so
much to our panelists for joining us and
shedding some light on the Google
Cultural Institute giving people some
insight into all of the cool exciting
stuff that we're working on and thank
you so much to the public for joining us
on this awesome hangout on life at
Google now you know a little bit more
what it's like to work at Google and and
how lucky we are to be working on such a
fun project and yeah you should remember
to take a look at google.com slash jobs
for a deeper look at opportunities at
Google and otherwise we'll see you again
sometime soon on another hangout thanks
so much
bye thanks a lot everybody bye Amy bye
