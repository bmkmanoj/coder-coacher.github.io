Fitz hey doing men
great not gonna introduce ourselves
again cuz we already did did we we did
okay let's do the next question under
your excellent g pad there G pad love
the G Bey don't leave home without it
okay so what are the qualities you look
for in a prospective employee
hmm well well literally dashing good
looks in a nice lab coat is a good start
and banjo banjo yes absolutely no uh so
what I always tell folks you know what
I'm doing interviews at least is that
you know people who do programming
computer science it's kind of there's a
long sliding scale of extreme practical
experience all the way to extreme
theoretical experience right and then on
one end of the extreme you might have
somebody who just got a PhD in computer
science to write essays on computational
complexity but you asked them to write
five lines of code on the whiteboard and
they can't write on the other extreme
you've got you know somebody who's maybe
been you know programming a
microprocessor in a cell phone for 20
years and is so incredibly specialized
in amazing at writing assembly language
but they forgotten all the theory
they've ever learned right and so Google
is looking for someone in the middle
right who's got theory at their
fingertips but also has some practical
experience and can write good code and
write that's what our interview process
well we often talk about generalists
right yeah and the example I use is that
we don't want somebody to sort of
describe what a Genesis we don't want
somebody who knows how to fix the model
400 XYZ of the Acme dishwasher right
right and then the model 500 XYZ comes
out and they're at a complete loss as to
what to do right we want somebody who
understands how to do squashers work and
can build a dishwasher fix a dishwasher
figure out new models figure out a new
models they come out and you know sort
of roll with the the dishwashing
innovation so so we're going to look on
your resume for for proof that some sign
of generalism right that you've got
practical experience you've got
theoretical experience and that you're
able to learn new things and adapt and
then theory then is that you know if
Google hires you they're hiring you as a
generalist and the theories that they
could put you on any project and that
you would do pretty well right right and
that you could move between
projects and people do in fact move
between projects but but beyond that we
look for someone who's a good fit for
Google in the long haul okay someone so
skills and experience are important but
you got to be a good fit for the company
for the culture are sort of I mean we
work in the internet right the internet
world is a very disruptive world a lot
of change a lot of new stuffs constantly
coming up you should have to be able to
learn new things and and roll with the
punches so to speak and play well with
others
which is not always a given right well
that's important but the other thing is
that we look for something that's going
to make you stand out right that's what
we look for in a perspective candy
whether it's it's an interesting hobby
or an accomplishment or some leadership
thing right you've done because we see a
lot of resumes just you know are just
full of millions of generic acronyms and
they all kind of look the same after a
while so write figure out some way to
distinguish yourself that says you know
I not only know what I'm doing but
here's something interesting that proves
I have a passion for computer science
right that's another thing I always see
we're not even just computer science
ignore any it could be any engineering
job yeah right near you general so you
know I always tell people or else I was
thinking myself when I'm interviewing
somebody you know if if this person were
a millionaire and did not have to work
at all yeah would they still be playing
around on the computer would they still
be writing code or doing engineering
things for fun and if so that's the kind
of person I want to work with right is
it their patch is it their passion right
they're not just doing it because they
have to you know pay the rent so well
and we come from the open source world
so that's something that we are
particularly looking out for in people
we find that people who write an open
source code are often a good fit for
Google they're passionate because if
you're not going to spend your spare
time writing software if you're not good
at write what's not passionate if you're
not passionate about it so those are two
qualities that tend to fall in to people
that write caught software in their in
their spare time I'd say so it's not a
requirement that you work on open source
rights just that's an example of
something that might stand out on a
resume right so so good fit solid skills
and experience good fit for the long
haul especially and you typically done
something outstanding yeah great
all right see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
