to work on the hardest problems but
problems where the solutions are going
to actually have an impact on how people
use the Internet
we're working hand in hand written
researchers and engineers to try to get
products built as fast as we can we
start with ideas but there's focus on
execution focus on actually building
things that work it's like moving a
scientific process all the way through
to testing an idea the right way
figuring out if the initial idea was
there in the first place and working
with people who have the skills and who
are dynamic and inquisitive enough to
want to work with ideas in that fashion
is stimulating in computer science I
think there are sort of a number of
avenues of publications right so you can
write papers publish it at conferences
and journals you could another way of
having impact is you release your code
for example through open sourcing and
and that way a lot of people use it and
yet another Avenue is where you build a
product that that's used by by by many
people we have research grants we do all
sorts of internships we have lots of
sponsorships for people who are doing
interesting stuff to help innovate in
those areas to you know an entire set of
systems and open-source platforms that
allow people to take our stuff and build
new stuff on top of it instead of just
being closed and saying well here's our
product they get to use it it's you know
here's an API take it and build
something cool with it I've worked
closely with the machine translation
team where the goal is to build a system
that can translate between languages at
the level of a human and if you do this
just on a word level the translations
come out very grammatical and so we've
been working on incorporating syntax
into the translation process and thereby
making small steps towards human level
translation
for my whole professional career I've
been interested in how to make computers
musically intelligent make music help
people find music do other things that
have to do a sound an audio at Google
we're able to have an impact in a way
that's impossible outside of a company
like this so not only can we work with
cutting-edge models cutting-edge ideas
but we can take those ideas and push
them into product so that people enjoy
these are making a true but they having
the ability to see the results of your
research is one of the unique
opportunities you can get the industry
research at Google is an opportunity to
take your best ideas or new technology
and build them into products that impact
millions and millions of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
