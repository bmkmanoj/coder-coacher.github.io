with stuff to kind of dip in the way of
the fun part of the problem with code
Jam we mainly do it for fun just because
we love programming so dam is Google's
online coding competition happens every
year we have thousands of people
register from around the world very
excited to be you it challenges anybody
who wants to get involved in the coding
community to solve really difficult
programming problems that most people
might not be able to solve in a week
code Jam provides access to people
around the world to engage with our
engineers at Google and also each other
we try to extract the most fun thing
about programming into small bite-sized
problems the problems are so tough like
you might not come across problems just
like this in everyday work it can be fun
to sort of find a really elegant
creative solution we get to look at the
poses and try totally it's very
interesting point challenging they use
many languages in cojac tower it's a
flat Python some of them have never even
heard of one that uses Shakespearean
language this one does clearly based on
white space there's one that fits unlock
at speak my advice for newcomers would
be just to practice practice is the most
important thing these most important
than knowing algorithms or knowing math
I'm really excited that we're going
international this year for Dublin
Ireland for the world final if you
haven't signed up for coach a mysterious
head CDOT co / code Jam and register
