here with a Swedish delegation to check
out like the hardware startups and and
the robotics companies that they have
here this hotel is actually pretty weird
the sink is like in the bedroom so you
can fall asleep to the sound of water
dripping maybe so yeah I just wanted to
check in and also I have 16 things you
might not know about me I know that a
lot of you know this but there were a
lot of you who don't know this maybe I
should just do this in a Swedish accent
it was kind of practical sometimes when
I was living in Cid's because when I was
talking to customer service so I wanted
to pick up a guy then the Swedish accent
was very handy my mom is a Ghostbuster
she's to host a TV show in Sweden we're
going to go home to people who
experience that they have problems with
ghosts and to take a leak clear boring
person there and help it move on to the
other side yeah my mom is pretty badass
my last name is pronounced yes it
doesn't make sense in Swedish either
everybody just puts their own Flair on
it
Oh way down to 100 Cal so you could
avoid Sancho taiko fake Swedish or dying
heart will tell car Shawn aho what was i
for Shan Zhai quando video director puta
puta papi
hey Jake today I'm sipping on sin on
Maricopa beyond when I look and try and
Evan I was 16 I was in Chinese sitcom
and played some buddies Canadian pipe
and it's one of the worst experiences
I've ever had
I'm saving that for a separate video
because that story really eats its own
stage after I move in China the first
time I moved to Kenya for six months and
went to a Swedish boarding school there
it was really colonial the straw that
broke my seventeen-year-old back was
when some of the students at the school
thought it was fine to a range of
good eating contest and the principal of
the school even gave them money for it I
just don't know what was going on in
their heads I hate getting flowers you
get this thing that you expect to enjoy
watching die just give me something I
can eat instead I used to work as an
editor for a Swedish official website
but I lost the job after a year because
a guy who'd also applied for the job
final lawsuit because he thought he was
better qualified for it I'm not too
upset about it I used to work as an MMA
reporter as in like mixed martial arts
as unlike cage fighting John Jones once
said I had a great butt yeah it
functions well as a but I'm a FEMINIST
vegetarian and to be honest it blows my
mind that a lot of people find that
controversial doesn't matter what I
build people are still going to ask me
to put a dildo on it even when it really
doesn't make sense I've actually set up
a spam filter for the word dildo on my
youtube channel maybe I shouldn't tell
you that I said one year of physics in
college because I want to become an
astronaut and then I kind of realized
that I might not be cut out for the work
and also I hate airplane food and rocket
food can't be that much better Christmas
2013 I'm done are doing a starter kit
and I got a shield for my Arduino Uno
and I couldn't get it to work I tried
everything and then a good friend of
mine who's really good at electronics
came over and she takes one look at it
and she's like Simone you do know that
you have to solder the headers onto this
shield right because basically what I've
done is I put the male headers into the
female headers on the Arduino Uno and
then I just placed the shield on top of
it and I was like you know perkier
what's broken I was so embarrassed I
have what I think might be my best
product thus far coming out next week or
the week after that and I'm pumped about
publishing it yeah
you will just have to stay tuned now I'm
going to go to a cocktail party on a
boat in Hong Kong talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
