the last Q&amp;amp;A video I did I had a tense
unit attached to my face I thought it
would be fun to do something similar
today so I hacked a tense unit and now
it goes off at random times full
intensity yeah I get a new version of it
and this one was actually way trickier
to hack because before I just had to
really turn on and off the power to the
tens unit but this one had so sort of
like safety safety is
No safety is a good thing where bike
helmets when you bike so instead I
opened it and I hacked the switch
basically these two passages connect and
disconnect whenever it turns on and off
so I just put that through a relay and
to the Arduino so that it can control it
going on and off and there are probably
better ways to do this but hey it works
okay so yeah basically the Arduino is
gonna turn on the times at random time
and I'm gonna be in pain what aren't you
do for likes I've been thinking which
body part I should put this on but I
want to try shoulders through those a
you don't know tens units are basically
these machines that put electrical
impulses through your muscles and they
make them contract and if you have a
used one you probably don't want to I'm
just gonna have lunch and and answer
away
this
ah now Eric wants to know why I call
cilantro coriander it's because I'm
Swedish
Oh God wants to know how he can help me
out with my ultimate life goal I'm I'm
gonna build a human centipede so you can
sign up for that in the comments mad pop
RAM damn did ya wants to know what my
stands on holes and socks is holes and
socks suck their Darryl but at the same
time I can't really blame my feet
because if somebody put a sock over me I
probably also try to claw my way out of
it kind of like the Shawshank Redemption
of feet oh these are not sticking
to my arm as well as they should
I'll just duct tape it a little bit
taking this off is gonna hurt like a
bitch too late now auntie em wants to
know if I would rather fight one hundred
duck-sized horses or one horse-sized
duck definitely a worse I stuck because
then I would tame it out fire boom boom
who doesn't want to write it duck uh
weird role of the left ox go they go to
the store where they also sell plastic
left hands because for all of my
projects I've only managed to find the
right hands but that does not make the
applause machine up high five machines
not this is not what if we put it on the
bicep oh just like that and he wants to
know what my favorite dinosaur is Simona
sword do her have a lot of friends in
real life yes but I share 50% of my DNA
with most of them but I have friends
outside in my family - my brother his
name is so now and she used to be the
Swedish gymnastics champion so she's way
cooler than I am and also we went
through puberty together so I'm going
back to the shoulder
do you work myself out to be so chipper
for each video I think I'm pretty
chipper in real life - but my videos are
just a very condensed version of that in
real life I'm like a watered down
version of this add four parts water and
you got me tell us why his dog steals
his socks he's here socks we think
they're not meant for Paul that was all
of the questions for now and also if you
haven't watched it I'm gonna take this
off I need to find another concept for
my cutie a couple of weeks ago I was in
Schengen and I filmed an episode for
tested on one of the world's biggest
electronics markets
fast petals and everything these petals
passes the fish right see leave me one
check that out yet you should definitely
do that it was a mad place I've also
become way better Instagram so if you
want to follow me there you can do that
up to you there
the parts for my next project are coming
next week so hopefully I can I can build
a film that within the next two weeks I
have very high hopes for that project I
think it's gonna be hilarious so stay
tuned see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
