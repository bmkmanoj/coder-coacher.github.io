rumination queen here and today I'm
going to talk about my morning routine
because zero people have requested that
and morning routine videos are what
youtubers do right
maybe yeah this might not be the first
morning routine video that you ever see
but it's probably the first one that's
filmed in an engine room so there's that
okay let's get to it
cheerful music please Simone its editing
this man Schubert I wake up every
morning and I really like to get up just
refreshed you so already know how this
videos gonna cook down bear with me I
really like to wake up refreshed in the
morning so I use the wake up machine I
don't know how you woke up but I woke up
like this as soon as I've gotten out I
just take that plastic hand with me into
the shower because let's get feet as
ahead a little bit more as a busy person
I try to minimize the amount of
decisions I have to make in a day and
that's one of the main benefits of using
the breakfast machine because it decides
for you when you've had enough like okay
you're done that's enough of spoons full
of air for you bitch
did you hear that by the way I've got a
lot of emails from parents who were like
Simone do you really need to cuss so
much in your videos I really want to
share them to my kids so this work for
you suck my but in my opinion which
you think are essential parts of being a
human so kids maybe try synonyms like
excrements and consensual intercourse
okay I can't say no to that or maybe
they can but at least they'll be
impressed by your vocabulary back to the
point after my breakfast I first
teeth using the toothbrush always
recommended by a zero out of ten
dentists
what I like about the toothbrush helmet
is that it gives me this like roughed up
look of having made out with a guy for a
couple of days and he shade like right
in the painting of it but day two he
starts getting this like and it kind of
really hurts but you don't want to say
something because you're worried it
would ruin the moment ish yeah that's
the look I'm going for it very chic
also it brushes your nose a little bit
and just to accentuate that look I use
lips
maybe she's born with it maybe she had
an accident the terrible joke it's just
like that makeup slogan maybe she's
worried with it maybe it's Maybelline
but instead it's maybe she's born with
it maybe she had an accident
isn't that just hilarious even if it was
I feel like I just killed it stabbed in
the back shoved it down clip see you
later Joe I really hope you liked this
video because you've just watched it
yeah don't forget to Like subscribe and
comment I put it in videos every
Wednesday ish talk to you later this
tube of wires a little bit distracting
create probably I found it oh hey there
you are this joke I'm sorry okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
