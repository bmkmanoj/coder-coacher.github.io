I am super sorry for the radio silence I
haven't uploaded a video in the longest
time but that doesn't mean I've been
sitting on my big ass normally sighs dad
I'm Mike I'm my adequately sized ass
yeah last week it was in Madrid to be on
the live talk show alone McGriddle and I
hadn't heard about it before but it's
actually pretty big it's not guest like
Jennifer Lawrence Justin Bieber Miley
Cyrus and moi
that's not Spanish I brought all of my
machines there and it was actually a
pretty weird bag to bring through here
for security they were like ma'am are
those two big knives in your suitcase it
is that an alarm clock attached to a
metal box filled with electronics and is
that a cut of arm and I was like I
promise that I can explain and then I
got to pitch my youtube channel and I
think I got at least two new subscribers
the talk show was obviously in Spanish
and I don't speak Spanish or anyway
though increase our port get me gustan
last longer grich's una mezcla
the Spanish Google Translate lady just
really cracks me up she sounds like
she's had a little bit too much of a
little bit of a little something but
even though I don't speak Spanish I
still thought that I would get to talk I
mean I saw Will Smith on the show and he
got to talk a lot so I could at least
talk a little bit and now I didn't get
to talk at all
all I got to do was to stand there and
look and try to tag along in this
Spanish conversation I'm laughs in the
right places
nagura de lo que vamos a ver ahora del
caso que vamos ahora y también el
despertar Doria huzzah - table oh it
wasn't just that I didn't get to talk
but I couldn't even demo my own stuff
there was even this girl he used my
toothbrush helmet
I didn't tell her that I've never washed
that toothbrush felt like small win also
the breakfast machine just got total
stage fright
yeah awfully endo tanguay lament a
entonces amigo whatever not very
disappointed about it because I have
some really exciting projects coming up
and for the project I'm building right
now I'm getting help from this super
mind-blowing Lee awesome person
unfortunately I can't tell you who this
awesome person is but I think that
they're gonna go public with it this
week at least I really hope so because
otherwise I think I'm just gonna explode
out of pure excitement just braiding
confetti everywhere let's reply to some
comments those Underpants actually
belong to Chad he needs your support for
anger that's so cracked me up so much
the pair of underwear that you found in
your husband's car all right you were
plot twist
why do you have lots of fake hands lying
around in your house what makes you
think they're fake you look like Amanda
from revenge Amy Schumer willow in Buffy
Vampire Slayer melanne Laura I don't
even know where that is I look like a 30
year old 20 year old I mean I am 25 so
I'm practically as close to 30 as I am
to 20 with one short voice moniz
nullified every marriage proposal if
you're still hanging in there
I'm on tinder in Stockholm so just swipe
away but I didn't know what to say when
I but still just cracks me up
you sound like a working I'm assuming
this one is to the zoo it's the symphony
Lee I love you and
 I think that's enough comments for
today see you later
