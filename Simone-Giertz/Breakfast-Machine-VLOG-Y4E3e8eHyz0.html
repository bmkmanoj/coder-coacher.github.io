all I just wanted an excuse to buy a
really nice earlier so I started off
with like trying to program it to do
like my breakfast sequence right
basically pours Cheerios and hemp milk
into a bowl and feeds it to me with a
spoon
but yeah it was pretty boring and then I
read the manual as one never
does
he's on a grown-up grownups read manuals
and I found that it has like this really
neat learning mode so basically you like
move it around and then it copies you so
it does it again yeah let's do it dry
round because I just poured tremendous
amounts of hemp milk into my lap and
onto myself
yeah
so good that I'm spending my time and my
brainpower into making this world a
better place you're welcome world so the
thing is I actually don't want to eat
things Cheerios because they've been on
my floor and they're kind of soggy now
this spoon has also been places I don't
know didn't know that well if I would do
this project a second time I would
probably have it make me sandwiches
instead most of all because you could
make it voice-activated and I could be
like make me a sandwich and also because
it doesn't contain any like the process
of making a sandwich doesn't contain any
fluids which is preferable because milk
is kind of gross when it's in the wrong
place what else um I'm moving back to
Sweden so that's really exciting for for
the people of Sweden anyway check out
the full article and the video on Vice
the link is in the description and
subscribe to my channel and I'll talk to
you later please um like me know still
not going on in my mouth oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
