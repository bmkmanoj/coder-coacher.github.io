for Christmas and nothing gives me that
warm and fuzzy Christmas feeling like a
cold and dark engine room holiday spirit
AF 2016 has sucked something much worse
than dick but to me personally it's been
a pretty great year yeah I've gotten to
do a lot of fun and weird stuff but
something that's been a little bit less
fun and that you guys don't know about
is that I've gotten into a lot of
trouble so the way I keep this nation
running the shitty robot nation I
realize a lot of people miss hearing
that the other day somebody commented
and was like what is sugar daddy you
nation mean it would have to become a
little bit more lucrative before I could
call it sugar daddy nation either way
the way I keep the shitty robot nation
running is that I have sponsors so I
have sponsors on my youtube channel and
I also do sponsor projects and some of
these collaborations have worked out
great
companies like Ericsson and Google have
been awesome to work with they've been
super hands off and kind of let me do
whatever I want but on some occasions
it's been a little bit trickier and one
of my sponsors pulled out completely
because I said fuck four times at a
video pulled out heyyo they'd probably
be upset about that too for example I
appeared on an event for a marketing
company and they asked me on stage why
it's important to be creative in
marketing and I said that advertisement
is a little bit like a dog taking a shit
on your floor but it doesn't do it on
the carpet where it's really hard to
clean up but it does it in the bathroom
and you're like I still don't like it I
prefer for it to not be there but at
least you put it in a decent spot which
I admit is an okay joke not my finest
work but they got so upset like really
really upset like they called my manager
and we're screaming over the phone upset
and what I learned from that is that
apparently people have very strong
feelings about dog poop so stupid so
I've decided to start a patreon for
those of you who don't know patreon is a
platform where you can donate monthly to
support independent creators
and I've been thinking about it for some
time but I've been a little bit
reluctant because I'd rather have
companies pay for what I do than you
guys but it's obviously not working out
that great so if you want to support me
in what I'm doing and you want me to
keep saying stuff like shit and
mispronouncing popcorn as cock porn and
great job
go fuck yourself you've deserved it then
please consider supporting me there it
would really mean the world to me and
merry Christmas to you on the other side
of this whole cussing business is kid
friendly content and as much as I think
the kids can handle a fair amount of
crudeness I understand that parents
don't want to have to explain to their
kids that the word shit is okay in some
context and not in others I'm obviously
not an authority in this matter
considering my dog poop joke so I'm
starting a collaboration with Goldie
Blox
where they are going to make
kid-friendly versions of my videos both
the old and the new ones and put them up
on their YouTube channel so let's foster
our youngsters to become engineers and
build a rocket and take me to space this
is my master plan it's just all ulterior
motives up here anyway check out my
patreon there will be a bunch of
exclusive content there and giveaways
and yeah I really hope to see you there
it's going to be fun and if you're a
company and after seeing this you still
want to collaborate that's freaking
great here's my sizzle reel
dickhead face sparked Venus everything
feels awkward which is also an accurate
description of my sex life oh fuck you
looks like the nastiest dog poop liner
yeah it's like on the light meter poop
why the fuck is it yeah fuck this robot
take me to the hospital you're not so
tough now are you
anyway I'll talk to you later I made an
earring from a brass bolt so now I have
a safety pin and a bolt because the
apocalypse is coming for all of us and
it's going to be run by robots mm-hmm if
you join my patreon I'll I'll spare you
guaranteed it's quite the deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
