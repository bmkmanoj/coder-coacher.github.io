touch it all the time probably not great
for my computer today I'm gonna rate
other people's inventions I've been
building shitty robots for like three
years now which means I've become quite
the connoisseur of you shitty
robots thank Squarespace for sponsoring
this video people have sent me these
inventions using the hashtag please rate
my invention Simone so I'm not stealing
random people's content it's all very
consensual internetting think of it like
shark tank but tank the Sharks have
no money and very sensitive digestive
systems okay let's watch the first video
a creeping hand I don't know how we
would do it but I feel like this thing
would kill me it's like a soothing
machine that puts people to sleep but it
would sleep it's like I give it a $20
investment with a check that bounces an
mm color sorting robot they call it an
anti entropy machine
oh wow
does this look JIT Ethan knows this
can I sleep my socks for me can it fix
my life for me I give this 240 likes and
a creepy comment about how you'd be such
a great mother a beverage serving
machine I don't know what's going on
here but there's some sort of glass and
a yellowish liquid so I'm just gonna
stop watching right now this is how I
stay sane on the Internet
I give this invention a disapproving
look from your cat a coffee stirrer and
robot no Elliot this is too good to be a
sh a robot you're disqualified for being
too good which is also what they tell me
if I try to apply for a beauty contest
a DIY Roomba okay this is on the verge
of being disqualified - it just works so
well but the chinchilla is cute I give
this three hundred views from Russian
BOTS and a cease and desist from Roomba
a knife game I mean I always love games
when winning is not getting stabbed it's
like that pie in the face game but
instead of whip cream it's with blood I
give this the square root of 49 minus
the amount of pets I've had that have
died so minus 50 - don't bite the hand
that feeds you bite the thing that's
feeding out of your hand a middle finger
robot
that's my rating right there a fidget
spinner spinner ooh
vicious spinners I don't like him today
I'm gonna do uninspired by the Queen
itself Simone yet I like you I'm cheap
this isn't don't reason to deny it so in
all fairness it's taken me over seven
months to review these videos so when he
posted it fidget spinners were still hot
I never got one cuz I'm old
I give this invention a call from
America's Funniest Home Videos but then
they never decide to air it a machine
that sets up dominos Domino wearing like
dummy yes trademark that I can't
even disqualify it for working too well
I give this front page on reddit but
like post number 6 and most of the
comments are an argument about how
planet earth is flat because if planet
Earth wasn't flat and how could you set
up Domino's on it it's a good rating you
should be proud of yourself a can
crusher girl you crushed it my rating
comes in the form of a tongue twister
how many cans can you can crush or crush
because your can crusher can crush cans
Oh
nobody could twist my tongue minecraft
player okay so it's a device but a dad
built for his kids so that he could play
Minecraft even though it broke in his
hand
I don't play minecraft but this makes me
wanna play minecraft it also makes me
want to break my hand and be your child
I give this the cry emoji and two heart
emojis because all the feels the heart
with the sparkles on it not just the
plain one that's all from tank for
today if you want me to rate your
