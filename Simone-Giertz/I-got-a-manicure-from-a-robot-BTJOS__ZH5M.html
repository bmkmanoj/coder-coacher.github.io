uprising started you can't just do it
overnight
you have to like phase into us so
starting from all we're starting from
nails I freaking suck at nails like oh
my got it I need help
technology I summon you to help me so
this is the robot I used to serve me
beer and it also blew my nose at some
point but it's a really versatile
machine it's night time jobs at a bar
day time confidence at this nail so log
I mean what would you rather have paint
your nails and a drunk robot covered in
snot I'll do a good job
ahh I think Vic will be fine
Scott has the remote control Scott
what's your experience and manicures the
closest I've gotten is I feel like I use
emoji oh wow well like a lot pretty okay
is it you know what it's supposed to
look like need to use protection like
frickin Dexter chill room who's gonna
die Scott alright maybe we should like
remove the nail polish I already have
totally forgotten
I swapped out the controls of it right
so shop oh okay
you got you got the condom Oh what about
that okay so I'm going to do it done
let's try the first color happy orange
now when I was a kid I thought that
acetone was like makeup remover and I
put it all over my face so stupid at the
robot salami need to help out a little
bit can't just expect to be trained
properly Oh Simone who's editing that
key you put a little counter uh how many
times we say nailed it during this video
most sinful anyway I want to be sinful
about it
you got the river you have some work
this one is let's talk like the union
baby bird I don't want to go by
stereotypes but I suspect that like 90%
of my audience has never had a manicure
so it only works in our favor because
you'll just be like ah that seems like
the way it should be done yellow yellow
basically glasses on that you want me to
pour some out for you
as far as I can tell it robot manicure
is clearly superior it's something some
plastic nails are you feeling like love
heart glitter or some like mm you feel
South Beach okay I feel South Beach to
where it's a beach
thank you oh you get a little nail file
I've never had plastic nails first you
need to file it oh yeah done glue now
you just need to put the nail on open up
okay nailed it nail bit please sit down
what I don't understand is when people
have fake nails
how the fuck do you scratch your butt
that's the kicker for me
let's get this thumb two and then we're
done
now that it just feels wrong it feels so
wrong we're actually about to hit half a
million subscribers and that's freaking
wild I don't know if we're going to be
there when this video goes up but I'm
going to celebrate prematurely thank you
so much to all of you for being here and
supporting me and not only just me but
like the overall idea of not being
scared of failure when you're inventing
and building things because failure can
be Glamis luck take these up oh wow
that won't look strong oh oh sorry I
give me a lot ah nail technicians look
out I'm coming for your job I think we
need a little bit of iteration but we're
getting there next week we're doing
shaving it was to be a volunteer
leave a comment please don't let all of
this glamour fool you bills insufficient
