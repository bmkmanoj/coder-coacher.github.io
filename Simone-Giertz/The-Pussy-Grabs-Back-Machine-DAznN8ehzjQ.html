Bernie people are actually not that much
of a hurting because what the fuck is
going on in the world as you probably
figured I'm not a news Donald Trump fan
I use it really destructive person I was
pretty outspoken about it on Twitter
anymore all like stick to building
shitty robots like unsubscribing and
like love the business of your own
country and for one I live and work in
the States so I ought to be allowed to
have an opinion but also this doesn't
only affect the states this affects the
whole world so yeah I've been really sad
as a lot of people have but then I
really is the Donald Trump is probably
the kind of dude who gets a kick out of
him and crying and the only King I want
to give it its to the balls so enough
tears no more tears cueing them inside
no tears are so dry so I was thinking
about this whole pussy grabbing business
and jennamarbles in a really great video
on how to protect yourself from Donald
Trump trying to grab your pussy and then
I sold the hashtag cuz he grabs back and
that just cracked me up so bad and I
really wanted to build a testing ground
machine but I'm probably yeah I'm
filming this in a freaking hotel
bathroom so I don't have access to your
workshop and I don't have access to
tools but then I just randomly met this
super cool girl named Laura come she is
a maker youtuber and she's based here in
Cologne and she might meet her workshop
and today we built this the pussy grabs
back machine victim again
grab them by the pussy it'll slap you in
the sack pussy grab my best pussy grass
bar
the ground
this pussy grows back
oh Jesus hey so it's actually
spring-loaded so you just go like boom I
think this is the closest I've ever been
dabbing a penis I feel like I just want
to put it on stuff here have some the
things I'm offering you time to grow
your team mm-hmm this is purely
mechanical and we built it using a
mousetrap and some l-brackets and make
it stuff in the right position and a
belt that you strap it to your waist
with and don't ask where every got a
plastic hand I'm sure it notice don't
ask
Laura's friend justice as the guy who's
getting his fall slapped he was a
freaking champ he went through a lot of
heat to make that happen and the girl
named Jennifer do the graphics would
like cause he grabs back in who knew
that business what the world would need
one day for some reason it started
getting like old purple gross like even
grosser
just looks like a dead hand Laura and I
actually built another thing together
and she's gonna publish that on Sunday
she'd definitely check it out cuz she
builds like really neat stuff so before
Donald Trump came and shoved this world
at his ass this video was just gonna be
about my travels I've been traveling
through Europe for the last two or three
weeks but then also I realize like who
the fuck cares I'm not even sure I care
but if you do care keep on watching if
you don't pause the video have a great
day
pussy crap back this video is all about
pussies last one was all about dicks I'm
just going through all the body parts
you're not allowed to talk about next
week armpits either way this is what I
did traveling I walked up a mountain in
Scotland and looked at seals I did a
campaign for a telecom company and
telecom company till telephone company I
did a campaign for telecom company in
Sweden it was like this virtual reality
experience I were a camera on my head so
you can see from my point of view you
measured my poles how much I was
sweating they measured my brain grease
and they did in 30 minutes my broadcast
of what it was like to be me when I
finish a robot I still have rooted my
birthday I got still my birthday wishes
from citizens of the shitty robot nation
