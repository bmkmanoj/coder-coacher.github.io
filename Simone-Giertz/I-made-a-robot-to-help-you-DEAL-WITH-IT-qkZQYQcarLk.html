it's got a little bit a bit bigger since
then oh crap
hey sugar Venetian Queen Here I am at
the tastic office and I am now an
official member of the tested family
we're going to live together and share
the same genetic disorders and argue on
Christmas and it's gonna be fun
I just wanted to show you a gift that I
got it it was from an honorary member of
the shady robot nation his name is Stu
and this just blew my mind for a lot of
the products I do i use this rivet
article the you are my views at the
breakfast machine the lipstick robot the
argue on the internet robot do can made
a replica of it and it works as a remote
control for it so if we move this one
around the other one moves around - how
crazy is this it even has a manual the
fucking manual not the fucking manual so
that people can use one of those - this
is mad and I am going to use it for the
first time so I have a lot of people who
are like really upset with me because I
only build shitty robots and don't spend
my time tooling useful things and I just
wanted to address their concerns and
yeah that's pretty much it oh you wanted
to marry me you said so you're upset
with me because they only build use the
same
so easy I just move this controller
around and voila deal with it I do not
think that this was house to intended me
to use his present but what happens
Stern face activated is three to one
great look Josh I just don't understand
how people do not think this is a great
thing to spend your time
right here
ah
sighs not going so great yeah what do
you say now
you're not so tough now are you I
obviously don't learn from my mistakes
because I just keep on putting motors
close to my hair I have no good
explanations this happened if I ever win
a Darwin work I want this to be the
photo they use so for most of my videos
I tend to like DFO for a magazine or
said with an iPad and the only reason
for that is just because staring into
the camera is super awkward it's kind of
like keeping eye contact with somebody
taking a shit
yep need to get a book first book I find
the gift of failure I did not read this
book but why can I get behind the title
I'm like failing takes the pressure off
of things okay I think we got it good
job everyone
most of all is ready to take this
fucking death trap off of my head I
really hope you like this project and
that you like yourself because I like
you yeah you're the shit you're my shit
9 you know what I mean I have something
really exciting here we got next month
and I can't wait to share it with you
it's the first for me and it's gonna be
a big cherry poppin fest
no not what you just pictured it'll be
fun
we pictured was probably fun too but
yeah big news coming out next month so
stay tuned and I'll talk to you later
whoo I have like 40 minutes of footage I
don't know how this escalated like this
end of the video
