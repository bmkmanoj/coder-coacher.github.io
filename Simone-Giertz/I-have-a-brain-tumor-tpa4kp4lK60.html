get pretty ugly not because I'm gonna
show you scans of a gnarly-looking tumor
but because I'm an ugly crier and I'm
most probably gonna cry so you've been
warned
you've seen the title you click the
video you know what's up we're about a
year I've had a swollen eyelid on my
right eye some of you even commented on
it and I always thought it was just
allergies but these last couple of weeks
I started having some pain in my eye and
in the eye socket and my doctor sent me
to have an MRI scan and yeah last week I
found out that I have a pretty
substantial boring tumor plot-twist good
news is that I'm probably not dying and
it seems like the tumor is non cancerous
and benign but it's pretty big it's like
the size of a golf ball I don't even
like golf but I do like my brain a lie
so I'm gonna have to have pretty
extensive brain surgery and I'm probably
gonna be out for a while and there's all
kinds of bad stuff that can happen I can
become blind on my right eye or lose all
muscular function around it I might also
become paralyzed on the left side of my
face I might start getting seizures I
might have a stroke
I might have spinal fluid leaking out
through my nose I know you don't think
this video is gonna get sexy but all of
those things are out of my control and
I'm trying to see all of this as like a
perfect opportunity to practice not
worrying about stuff because they're
gonna cut my skull open and we won't
really know how it went until I wake up
being faced with something like this
really helps put a lot of things into
perspective I found out last week and I
know the things I was worrying about
then feels so small right now even
though this last week has been really
really tough and I've been very sad
what's crazy is that I also feel so
freakin lucky because I have this
amazing family I
all these really really great friends
and an amazing team and I feel so
supportive and so freakin loved so I'm
like we should really do this more often
Kibby oh man I'm sorry that I'm joking
about stuff but it's really the only way
I know how to deal with this but beside
my family and my friends and my team I
also have you and this is not a goodbye
like I'm planning on becoming super
healthy and being able to keep on
building shitty robots and making videos
for you but I do really want to say
thank you because these last three years
since I started my youtube channel have
been the best three years of my life
and I've gotten to do things I never
thought I was gonna get to do and it's
all because of you so grateful to have
you and it means so much to me it really
does thank you for all of your sweet
messages and comments and if we're like
giving me high fives when you see me in
the streets effort supporting me on
patreon which is like gonna be the only
thing that keeps us afloat during all of
this and also for like sending gifts to
my p.o box and it's it just I appreciate
all of you so so much
although the day I'm not excited about
opening packages from you is the day I
should really start worrying about
myself so things are obviously gonna be
a bit weird on my channel for a while
the surgery is scheduled for end of May
and I'm gonna try and post updates on
Twitter and Instagram and also my TED
talk is coming out May 9th which feels
really surreal because it's like a whole
other world it feels like it was a very
long time ago in the very like different
life but I filmed a vlog around that and
hopefully we can we can publish that
when the talk goes up also if I lose my
right eye I really feel like I'd be a
pretty rad eyepatch where like I've
already started designing some eye
patches
oh man also can I send my turn
to space what if we cremate it is this
too weird
are these jokes too weird I have a
morbid sense of humor having a brain
tumor is like a comedic gold mine
hashtag tumor humor also having a brain
tumor is like the best raincheck of all
time if your friends like oh you want to
come over for dinner you're just like
sorry but I have a very Tambor can get
you out of anything
you came here for shitty robots but all
you get is shitty health and shitty
jokes about shitty health but it's all I
have for now
I'll see you in a while and everything's
gonna be fine and even if things aren't
fine I'm gonna find ways of making it
like I just want you to know that I love
and appreciate you so so much
