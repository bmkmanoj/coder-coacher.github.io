get thirty five million dollars or I
convince one of these people to send me
their to travel to Mars you need to stay
in a spaceship for six to eight months I
haven't even stayed in relationships
that long I could lock myself up in a
bunker for six to eight months to prove
that I'm mentally stable but I'm worried
that it would just prove the opposite so
I'm going to do 48 hours in my bathroom
I'm feeling that two days is like good
like she's dedicated but not like
batshit crazy kind of thing mom dad I'm
fine don't have to worry about me you're
ready for the celebrity bathroom this is
where I brush my teeth if we step over
here this is where I shower and if you
follow me all the way over here this is
where the magic happens the defecation
stasis but for now this is not just the
bathroom it's also a sham space

three trays in here I have this like
veggie burrito bowl Leonardo just
fettuccine was a dehydrated potato dices
10 plus $29 it's basically just potato
chips I mean I bought it I'm the one to
blame
last minute I chose to bring a kettle
because I realize that all the
freeze-dried food needs to be paired
with hot water
I don't want eat cold food I mean I show
up with any cold food either I'd be able
to heat it up and also they have friends
hanging out with them I mean you would
know this is the first time you've seen
me eat maybe this is just my eating face

times before I stopped laughing classic

could get back to bed and I'm not really
sure what to do with myself I should
