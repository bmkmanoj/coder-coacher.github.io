day of my life yeah when I was in a
Chinese sitcom when I was 16 I went to
China for a year as an exchange student
being from Sweden most people wanted to
go to the States or to Spain but I was
really obsessed with this idea of going
to China my main reason being that I
thought it would be like Crouching Tiger
Hidden Dragon thus began the most
miserable year of my life
I lived in a city called poofy and there
were hardly any foreigners there so when
this Chinese sitcom needed somebody to
play an American wife they were
basically like hey you're a white girl
do you want to play this guy's American
wife and I was like I'm 16 and can
barely speak Chinese they were like no
no worries you'll only have two lines
you'll be fine
so I agreed and the day before the shoot
I get the manuscript and I look at it
and I don't have two lines I have 52
rows of lines all in Chinese and I have
one day to learn them at this point I've
been in China for three months and I
hadn't studied Chinese before that so my
Chinese was terrible at best and as you
might know there's no way to figure out
how to pronounce a Chinese character by
just looking at it so the first thing I
had to do was to transcribe all of my
lines into peen
which basically is Chinese we're to use
in the Latin alphabet and then I had to
translate it all into English to know
what the heck I was saying so next day I
get to the side at like 7:00 a.m. and
this is like the biggest sitcom in the
province with millions of viewers so at
this point I'm pretty freaking nervous
but there's no backing out so they're
like some are go and the scene starts
and yeah let's just freakin watch it
I don't even know what the sitcom is
about every intro just as a bunch of
lobster in it I think they're running
some sort of like lobster restaurant
oh there I am okay this is seriously
having me shake I have hardly shown this
to anyone but it's it's time I'm just
gonna put it all out there
I need to move on okay here we go here's
my grand entrance - Tanya well for jello
Tyson hmm
well I - Mabel okay we used to pause
this it's line number one it's easiest
one I basically just say my name and
like can we just rerun sequence what is
that laughs I didn't I just said my name
funny joke John check it how long where
each is a father I did actually do that
pretty convincingly being cold just I
mean I leave me or Cinzia covered are
you videos about that
yeah oh my gosh invent a notion
matsuyoshi melody rule just to shame me
when the chinky oh we had to retake the
scene 14 times and out of those 14 times
this was still the best delivery that I
got just mid-sentence being like Shonda
shouldn't you know Chanel evil jeomsun
juicing Lehman the chin tear jooshin oh
so hard you can just see me radiate the
love I feel for this man
my dreams I see you some things you just
can't fake if I look clueless it is
because I am clueless but I'm just
covering up by either like really
shaking my head or just like smiling
around this is all defense mechanisms
this tape could be used as a study of
defense mechanisms in human beings
we're gonna go gave watch in William
Chan I'm like you don't have to give me
money I have money
I'm gonna start saying that and every
somebody tries to give something to me
I'll just be like I don't need this
thing I already have things
sassy American Simone Lucy fat side
homeboy after the first scene it's the
only time in my life that I've had a
blackout I could not remember my lines
even if my life depended on it
it felt like somebody taken my brain out
and put it in a food blender and then
just like poured it back in I got on set
at 7 a.m. and we were filming until 1:00
a.m. because that's how much I sucked as
the day went along people just got more
and more annoyed with me and eventually
like the Chinese actors would be like
mmm whenever I got it wrong and I
remember the producer just like studying
with with his face in his hands being
like God it basically made people
facepalm not a great feeling

ah this is the worst part of it all they
were like this foreign girl doesn't know
 can you do anything in Chinese I'm
like yes I can do this blend song in
Chinese and this song is basically like
the equivalent of twinkle little star is
that what's call in English the twinkle
twinkle little star who I think if I
would've been like I can turn my eyelids
inside out then just been like okay just
do it whatever you can do we have to
have something where this girl actually
does something Howie the mainly the
molle ha I'm a Comanche yeah oh she
can't sing we don't care we don't care
if every tone is off just have her do
something that actually works just do it

looking at the note me and even our loud
Chi make war shall we telephone my
minion it should she make one watching
cook I invite all of you to come to
America my treat
can we just take a moment and think
about this space because this is very
educational if anyone at any point does
this face get some help because this
person is in serious pain this is not a
face of consent just stop whatever
you're doing
how do you think I can do it anymore I
have to be in like true pain but I think
we're getting there
when I get that just so me oh and giving
everybody present at this point then
we're like we're not getting any good
Chinese out of this girl let's just have
her speak English so they fortunately
just let me improvise in English I just
made it up as I went along for a
handsome man like you I've got an
electronic watch we want I got it
electronic watch wow I think I'm hitting
on him there's a plot twist right here
boom electronic watch that's how you
pick guys up
beautiful like a flower I give you this
casually wpr a shiny the y-young I think
I'm coming on to her as well the sexual
tension is everywhere what she wants on
the wall when you seek want room with a
shrine good
I like China and I also like handsome
Chinese man I must have been ovulating
or something yeah you look cool yeah
it's done you just done words cannot
convey the things I feel for this tape
bad words might but they they're just
not enough I did not get it in front of
a camera for six years after doing this
just to deal with the trauma of this
experience so yeah there you go that is
the worst day of my life and I have it
on tape F that day so hard
do you have any similar stories please
share them in the comments and make me
feel better about this trainwreck talk

I think it's pretty safe to conclude
that I didn't peak during my teenage
years
