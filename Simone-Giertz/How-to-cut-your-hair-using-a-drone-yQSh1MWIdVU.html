our baffle that you don't know where
they come from I don't know what those
could be
it's like Illuminati confirmed hey sugar
ruination come here
I can't wait to hang out with this dude
hi I'm Sammy I'm a computer hacker
hacker hacker yeah and also a general
cruel person and he has a drone and
we're gonna try to cut some hair using
this drill duct tape a trimmer to the
bottom of it and this is a very bad idea
I think it's a great idea welcome to
America welcome to America I just went
to the States and I don't have a health
insurance yet people who work at
hospitals have so many weird stories of
injuries that people have I think this
one might take it's yeah like
putting stuff up your butt and not
getting it back out this it's not gonna
be the best circuit I would say abraded
like at 8.50 10 but the thing is like
haircuts are never good like you always
said no bidding and happy you haven't
had a haircut for me with a drone I
think we might be the survey people in
the world that the compass never seen
before
nobody time nothing's wrong
we have wine one strand of hair is that
it actually managed to cut off I know I
think the pretty underwhelming
performance by the brown hair code the
trimmer really needs to be like on the
hair I should just try it yeah like I
told you this is useless Turner it's a
volume of your hair I love the river by
ginger wigs so they would look a little
bit more real does the curtains match
the drapes or what's the expression I
think so yeah I think that's an
expression oh that is so we went to
Target and we bought a bunch of
because we really like the trimmer is
not gonna cut it
instead we got this I think at this
point we've abandoned the idea of me
having my hair cut and we're just gonna
do it on the styrofoam hat because this
is an increasingly stupid idea and it
was pretty stupid to put at the start do
we actually think that's gonna work of
course is gonna work sure not maybe not
the first time
maybe I don't first time yeah maybe not
this month I mean we're doing our best
here okay so we've attached the
servomotor to one of the handles on this
thing this monster right
haha I kind of love it it's so slow
because this is like waiting for you in
that okay - oh I'm stirs I press my
thumb in the handle head
stop power here shut up our dad let's
just attach it to the freaking drone and
try this thing right
oh yeah these bangs are a little bit
heavy if you can just make them a little
bit thinner
haha what rose okay actually the part oh
here try it again
be sure you want to get in there time I
think I got it down that's a great fun
show you do you think we can
Oh
I think we're pretty much done
I think that's throughout it we're not
getting anything outside of this drone
it is gonna be a thing in the future
they're coming drones I think so yeah
but in like a couple of years maybe the
world the world is not ready for you're
getting dream yet check out Sandy's
YouTube channel it's called applied
hacking and you do a lot of weird happy
yeah step hiking drones taking over
people's drones hacking locks yeah it's
a computer stuff in 3d printing and 3d
modeling and fun stuff like that don't
forget to subscribe like and comment and
I'll see you next week
talk to you later even though the result
is great a bit in me yeah I think we did
yeah I think I'm done yeah a lot of
airport people are not going to see
anything weird about this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
