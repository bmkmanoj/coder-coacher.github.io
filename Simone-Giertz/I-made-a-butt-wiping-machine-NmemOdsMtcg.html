man is on I put a unicorn mask on him
and I kind of thought it me too better
I'm not sure I've built something
potentially horrible I don't know why
even try to do it as a reveal you've
seen the title you know what I built you
still click the video I don't know what
that says about you but I like your
style
seriously though this project threw me
into like an existential crisis cuz I
had a bunch of friends who were at
Standing Rock and protesting and doing
really good stuff and I was like I'm
home building an ass wiping robot yeah
but maybe an ass wiping robot is exactly
what this world needs because a lot of
people are full of shit and maybe they
just need help wiping their buttocks
better
I've been dwelling out of that joke for
a long time anyway let's try it up I
don't know what this feels like but it
feels weird oh yeah so basically how
this works is I have an Arduino Nano and
it controls the servo motor whenever
right wow that was not supposed to
happen this is terrifying
let's reprogram this thing take two yeah
I told you I built something horrible do
you understand that I can't use my butt
for this I completely understand that
he's some duct tape it's a slogan of my
life
ah perfect take three this is an art I
don't know what is I'll check it out
not this is the flattest ass I've ever
seen no keep your legs in place how hard
can it be
this might be the weirdest thing I've
done today easy boy
surprisingly hard how do people do this
yeah
should I have a t-shirt as well I'm not
sure if I have anything his size well I
do have this one I got from it
I am TV yacht party done you're having a
rough day
go fuck yourself actually that doesn't
make sense cuz fucking yourself would be
masturbating and mastery rating is
healthy and good for you so go fuck
yourself is more like hey you've done
great you deserve a break go fuck
yourself I'm gonna start saying that to
my friends I think we're finally ready
let's tree this up
oh wow look at this the hot mess
No
so that's a knife a swiping for a
lifetime I really hope you liked this
project I had a ton of fun making it
also there's a link in the description
for my friend Marcus's GoFundMe to go to
Standing Rock again he's brought a bunch
of supplies and and winter gear and
tools to the people there and he's doing
really great work he's the guy who
helped me make school so if you like
school show him some spooly love and
consider donating to his GoFundMe I
really feel like I'm getting political
recently but it's political times and I
think it's really important to show your
support to the causes that you care for
so yeah
shitty robot nation unite for a better
world and a swiping robots yeah I'll
talk to you later you go fuck yourself
you've deserved it bye bye bye bye bye
bye bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
