requested videos and that is a tour of
my woman cave woman cave doesn't have
the same ring to it as man cave I'm not
gonna show you my vagina okay but I am
gonna show you my houseboat but before
we get started I just want to say that
this is situation where my English
vocabulary falls flat because I never
talk about boats in English so you'll
just have to bear with me when I throw
Swedish words into everything so the
main reason for me to live on a boat is
that when you live in an apartment you
have certain expectations on the
standard kitchen needs to be a certain
way the bathrooms to be a certain way
bah bah bah bah bah needs to be a
certain way but if you live on a boat
you can kind of just do whatever you
want it's ok to have your chimney come
out of your kitchen and through the
sewage drain and into your roof if it
wasn't an apartment that people would be
like that is weird as but if you're
on a boat it's like well that's a really
creative solution or maybe people are
just being nice to the heat this is
where the boat is driven and this also
works as my hallway this is the actual
steering wheel I have a hydraulic
control like hydraulic steering system
so when you turn this around there is
this control like oil that's pressed out
and that moves the rudder thing and this
is all the same room as my kitchen
here's a lamp that I made out of plastic
spoons
here's my fridge and freezer here's a
washing machine so I can wash my clothes
here's a u.s. mail mailbox so you can
put stuff in and this I actually read
this shelf by myself Spade with like
autumn and exams that I had left over
here's the stove and I even have a
dishwasher so on this upper floor we
have the kitchen the dining table and
the searing room all in one here's
another room here in the back but this
is kind of the room that God forgot God
being me I guess yeah this is the the
bathroom and this is where I look at
myself while I take showers I guess
let's go downstairs this is actually an
old like getting that I bought and made
this kind of this is a living room so I
have like a little desk for tiny people
because the ceiling is very low and
here's a stove and here's my couch and
in the same area is my bedroom here's my
bad and here is where I keep all my
clothes I mean these pretty cool shelves
under my staircase the books are just
kind of floating under the stairs this
kind of the living area but I also of
course have an engine room so I thought
we could check that out the engine room
is connected to the living room so you
can just go in here turn on the lights
boom and this is where I have the engine
Feltham what the six cylinder engine
from that's boat and it has like 430
horse powers I think and here is all my
junk here's the other side of the
a fan that's keeping it warm in here but
it's not keeping it warm and in here is
the last room so here is my friends bike
and water tank here's the infamous
sewage tank and I still haven't fixed
the check valve because I'm a bad
captain so yeah that's pretty much it
for my boat I hope I wasn't
disappointing that you kind of picture I
did I have a yacht or something he's an
ice breaker I've never thought about
that in English that's a pun
I live on a houseboat it's an ice
breaker oh here's my captain's hat it
just really makes me look like a
stripper doesn't it I'm not a stripper
I'm a captain all right you need to take
me seriously sailor you go wash
that deck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
