really nailed my photo pull me over I
know I'm a little bit late I'm 27 but in
American years I'm like 16 I'm buying
this really special electric car and
I've been waiting for it for a long time
I'm finally getting it today I don't
like it I don't like that one either
definitely not that one
oops
if you like this maybe be training at
over Alfred you know that's the best way
to get over a boat is to get under a car
the commuter car was built in the 80s as
a response to the oil crisis so it's all
electric and it kind of looks like a
cheese wedge I'm driving a piece of
cheese
I call her cheese Louise
I feel so grown-up I had no idea driving
a piece of cheese was what was required
to make me feel like a woman Nina Nina
Nina Nina Nina me actually have
awareness here on the side and it tends
to go off whenever I tried it indicate
it's Scott do you feel safe writing me I
just passed my test all my driving
skills I like fresh indicate look over
the shoulder there's a guy with a cane
don't hit people
it's so fuckin it doesn't take very
gently 25 miles-an-hour let me put it
this way it's an artist and driving
experience because you're like one with
the road oh my god I tweeted about this
car while back that was actually how I
found it it was such a random thing
because I'd uh I'd seen it on Craigslist
and I emailed the seller he didn't
respond and get back to me and then I
tweeted about it being like all I want
is this car it turns out that the guy
who was selling it was following me and
he saw that tweet and was like hey I
have one for sale and I was like dude
I've been trying to get ahold of you
forever and there'd been like a bug in
Craigslist so he hadn't gotten my emails
I had such a nice oh my god I love the
Internet moment where it kind of just
put me together with the guy who's
holding the cart and here we are
I just want to treat her nice sleep on
the way she deserves
if living this without you I can't live
I'm not allowed to do her right already
we live in America IES sorry people I'm
sorry I can't stop it I'm gonna want to
put it I think I just need to swap out
the spring it's like a little bit too
sensitive she's like a dog that's
barking at people outside of the window
she's like get out of my lane EW bitch
oh yeah I forgot the signal is there
road rage and smooth road rage Swedes
have emotions to Scott yes so it's
obviously not the safest car isn't least
safer than driving like a moped because
it's like driving a moped but you're in
a plastic cam thanks me Simone you
always need to stop at the stop sign
that's what my driver instructed my cut
and I told me Oh yo yo and also be
careful with people because they're very
soft but I already knew that
parking brake it like yeah it's a little
bit just to make sure that it's actually
stuck if you see me on the streets of
San Francisco just go like hey cheese
Louise and then you'll be like she just
ran a stop sign it happened
please subscribe okay bye
oh my god is the parking brake on
improperly
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
