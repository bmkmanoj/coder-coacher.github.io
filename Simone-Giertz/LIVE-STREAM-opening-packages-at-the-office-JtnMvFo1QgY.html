and I'm just filling this with my phone
so bear with the potentially shitty
quality so I've been traveling in Europe
for the last couple of weeks
or like two weeks so I got a bunch of
packages at the office and this is like
the best part of my job so I was gonna
open all of these and wanted to do a
livestream because I feel lonely and
it's more fun with other people so hey
so many people are gonna come it usually
I do live streams at my patreon save you
there you've seen some of these um but
yeah this is the first time I open it up
for the internet so it's feeling a
little bit scary if you have any
questions let me know and I'll try and
read them but there's a lot of comments
coming in so I might not see it okay but
we have the first package now let's
start with this one
this feels like Christmas I think that
this is a potato mmm sounds really
random but might not be so I there's
this service I promise I'm not sponsored
there's a service called potato parcel
and they send potatoes so like you can
go online and send people a message
written on a potato
ah freeze nips okay says lo lol it's a
potato best wishes from freeze nips
that's a good potatoes solid potato but
it's funny because it comes with a slip
I know I've got a lot of potatoes so it
comes with a slip that says like you
can't eat this potato so you can't it's
like not classified very classified it's
not um
set for food okay do you bake those
potatoes afterwards no I think um yeah
is probably not a good idea I mean you
could probably eat it it'd be safe but
they don't take responsibility for it
so yeah somebody asked what I did on the
trip so I was at um three different or
in three different cities in Norway I
spoke at three conferences one was in
Trondheim one was in Oslo and was in
haggis stood and then I went to Geneva
to visit CERN which was the wildest
thing I've ever done it was it was it
was super cool I got to see like go down
into the caverns of these with detectors
and yeah it was crazy oh were 2400
people that's the bizarre thing okay so
this is a flat package from Kari no see
I should also like you can send packages
to me this is a shameless plug but you
can send packages to me through the UM
let me see if I can like add the maybe
not but uh to the tested office so if
you just test it has APO box so you can
send packages and it's it's the best
thing it makes me so happy okay
asteroid hunters what the heck is says
in our cosmic backyard close to earth
discoveries await us I'm talking about
asteroids so small mysterious bodies
that travel between the planets as a
species we have the scientific
understanding that technol technological
prowess to actually do something about
the possibility of an asteroid impact
with earth Armageddon this is your book
oh it came with a note hi Simone I
saw in your reddit AMA that you're
getting love getting mail and I happen
to have all these books so I thought
you'd send a one
I love how hilarious and unpretentious
your robots are thank you so much Carrie
that's really sweet
 getting books that's educational
and good always a good gift gets to a
question what does your tattoo say oh
this is a gnarly one I've been thinking
about doing this as a story so I have
two tattoos one of them that doesn't
have that much of a story as is this one
it's it says sin among which is my
Chinese name it's the biggest cliche
ever don't judge but I got it when I was
16 and I was living in China and I got
it and this like really shitty tattoo
parlor it's tiny
like people usually just think I have
like a little bit of a smudge and the
other one I got when I was 18 like just
don't get tattoos when you were young
because you change your mind but at
least like both of them are pretty
discreet so you can't really see them
and I don't have one and like my lower
back no judgment to people who do okay
this one is from USPS ship it now I have
no idea this might be something that
I've worded
bah but um are you a shitty robot Vitor
asked me if I'm assure you everybody
not that I know of but I mean if you've
seen West rolled you know that none of
us you might not know what the heck is
this
Oh somebody has sent me a gift through
Yamaha what the heck it's the thing wait
you put this on your toothbrush and it's
like the dog throws up the toothpaste
right now you put it on the toothpaste
look at that
this is amazing I wish that this was my
product I wish that I invented this but
the dog like throws it first doesn't
bark hearts please put on the Lego
mask I'm not sure if Frank Ippolito
would be happy if I use it and I best it
I bet it's like really sweaty somebody
else if I met Jamie Hyneman
I actually I have I have so uh but not
recently so I was a I talked about this
on a tested podcast or a still entitled
podcast but I was a volunteer at
Mythbusters and before I started doing
shitty robots and it was a very
underwhelming experience but I did get
to take a photo with Jamie which is
really it was a really shitty photo but
I have met him but not like since I
started working with tested and Adam so
look at that you just like put it on the
toothpaste and who sent me this I wonder
if I can even know
you sent this to me oh it's from Evelyn
hey Simone I hope your Rocky situation
is better if not here's a dog that wants
to feel shitty with you in solidarity oh
that's so sweet this is that this is the
most amazing thing okay I can't wait to
brush my teeth now which is always a
good thing
okay am I related to David Gertz yet I
have no idea it's in Sweden there's only
one family that's called Yauch but I
think in other countries there might be
more okay this one is from Caroline and
so like once again if you want to send
the packages with stuff like there's
just little tested address and for the
PIO box for tested and you can find it
okay so these are sue seems like some
magazine oh I know what this is oh
this is such a long time ago well so I
did I gave an interview to YouTube
magazines like they have a magazine and
it was when I was still living on my
houseboat in Sweden and I haven't seen
the photos and this was like oh
this was like a long time ago I think
this is almost a year ago look at that
this is me at my old office and I have
really long hair
Oh bunch of my seat
popcorn helmet the toothbrush hell of it
and the applause machine this is
seriously like a year ago
so I thought I'm not getting that yeah
that's me laughing and drinking coffee
at my book we can recreate the sweater
right now
Felina no those files out whatever it's
a long time ago I might not look similar
oh cool that's actually me that's me in
the kitchen to my house bet I'm laughing
with some oat milk because oat milk is
 hilarious oh this is really nice
I just remembered that it all did it
bring that they took a bunch of photos
when I was like biking and around in
Stockholm this magazine is great I
wonder if you can buy this somewhere I
have no idea but YouTube magazine
cool let's do a question ah
don't show your feet no is the house but
still poo infested no it's it's the
houseboat is healthy it's it's doing
great but it did freeze like that the
sewage tank froze and a part of the hey
of the pump broke so the poor girl who's
renting it had to handle a lot of
different stuff okay cool we have two
packages left we have this big one I
know what that is but I don't know what
this is this is from Rachel nation to be
nice weenie busty oh yeah okay ah
somebody asked what is your next project
so I don't usually share what I'm gonna
do because I like being secretive but
I've actually started sharing it with
the people who are on my patreon so we
could go and support me there you can
see what it is it's a yeah it's actually
really fun I love hatre okay I got some
bubble wrap that's exciting
see if there's something in here perfect
Feenie vesti here a few mickey mickey's
oh wow i actually haven't used the makey
makey so it's from the MIT
you laugh and this is like a fun side
story I just notice they I don't know
they know this uh look at that so these
are super cool little kits where you can
just attach these like crocodile clamps
that was called somebody please correct
me in the comments but two different
things and just through capacitive touch
you to use it as a controller to your
computer so you can like play music
using bananas and we're like do with
Super Mario controller using whatever
and it's it's just this really fun
little thing like kids love it and
actually so like I before I started
building shitty robots alligator clips
cool thanks crocodile clips crocodile
clips wouldn't make sense though I mean
I like that it's like CC but um but yeah
so before I started doing shitty robots
I remember and like right when I was
starting with electronics because I
didn't I didn't really study it in
school but I just wanted to learn about
it and started googling around and I
found makey makey and I thought that it
was an amazing product and I remember
emailing one of the founders Eric and
sending this like really so like when
you're emailing shitty people it's good
to have a clear like question or like
something that's easy to answer like
just like send like okay this is a
specific thing I want help with but I
spent the most sent the most like vague
email just being like hey I wanna how do
I like reach your level of Awesomeness
because I want to be able to make
products like this as well be like
should I go to school or should I just
like build stuff or teach myself about
it and he gave me like the nicest
response I still haven't met him but he
really like took the time to answer and
was really sweet about it and now they
sent me a kid but that's a long that's
like three years ago he's probably
forgotten about it oh cool here are some
smaller kits as well I want expensive
lot
yeah I make really nice I think I should
I should send share some of these I
probably won't use all of them but I
yell send it to somebody share some of
the love okay this is the biggest
pockets in the last one let's do a
question before I answer do I even lift
not anymore
I just like I used to do a lot of weight
lifting this is very uninteresting
you're gonna be like cool story bruh
but I used to do a lot of weight lifted
like when I was doing martial arts and I
used to be really buff but now I'm not I
just do yoga San Francisco has made me
weak cuz I'm like I don't want to fight
anymore I just wanted to do yoga okay
can anyone guess what this is I think he
likes see here so I already have one of
these but I wanted one to have in Sweden
as well and they were kind enough to
send me - ah this is bum bum bum cool
story bro hi Chris what kind of martial
arts that I do I did a Thai boxing
mostly so I was in Thailand two times
and like was it Thai boxing camps but I
also do a lot in back in Stockholm but
then I was like that was when I studied
physics so I was like I need all the
brain cells I have so I can't like get
punched in the face more so I started
doing bristling introduce - I also did a
little bit of MMA but um I did Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu last time I lived in San
Francisco but now I quit all of it it's
like I mean I really like personally
digit so it's like a very intelligence
work in many ways it's like you're like
playing chess with your body playing
chess with your body but um it was also
kind of I don't know you just constantly
have like curly back hair with black
hair at the back of your tongue because
you're like eating somebody's chest hair
or like it's like very greasy
and yeah now I'm just like I just want
to relax and do yoga oh I'm so not
opening this for anyway oh yeah you can
see it here this is it down so duh oh I
already have one of these that I wanted
one in Sweden and yeah they sent me to
these I like I hate vacuum cleaning with
a passion it's like the household chore
chore household chore that I hate the
most
so this like revolutionized my life
because now I can have it clean that I
don't have to vacuum which is really
nice things that I robot for sending me
this that is very very very kind also
not sponsored but they did probably send
it for free anyway okay let's do one
last question and this is the first live
stream I do on YouTube so I'm not really
sure what like a good length is but
we're a fair amount of people watching
but let's do one more question and then
we wrap up and next time I do it this is
like the test run but next time we do it
I'll um yeah I'll like plug it a little
bit more and schedule it so you can
actually make time and enjoin it and
yeah hang out cool uh why are my hands
dirty they're not dirty they're just
like the way they are yeah ah when do we
meet your mom
well fun question I feel like I'm
plugging Pedro so much but that's like
where I do most stuff like most of the
stuff but I actually did a livestream
with my mom it's up on up there if you
want to watch it but we did like 45
minutes because she showed like
childhood photos of me and was prime mom
uh and yeah it's like funny she's not a
very embarrassing person like she rarely
embarrasses me she did it a little bit
during the livestream
but is it was fun it was like really few
people who watched it was like just 22
people so that's fine okay let's do
another question ah
will you be a Bay Area makerfaire so no
I won't be there this year I was there
two years ago I won't be either this
year because I'm doing a TV show in
Sweden so old May and June I'm gonna I'm
going to be um in in Stockholm but I am
going to Silicon Valley comic-con end of
April so you can see me there I think
during the Friday
um but yeah and I really hope to go to
Bay Area Maker for next year but I
missed it okay last question last
question ah II can i caress the Lego
head I can do that
Oh texture is really weird
okay well more this is fun uh well where
did I study and what did I study and
we're from alien I I studied physics at
kth Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm but I dropped out after a year
because I felt that it like stimulated
one part of my brain a lot but the rest
just kind of crumbled and died so yeah I
just I decided to quit and do other
stuff instead and I haven't really I
mean like I've regretted it at some
point because I really wanted to be a
scientist when I was younger and do
research but then I realized like that
is a thing for like I be a terrible
scientist and I'm not like disappointed
with where I've ended up so um yeah it
was it was a pretty like physics wasn't
right for me I should probably have done
like mechanical engineering or something
like that because I I liked like
constructing things via physics was not
it anyway
wow we're like 4000 people watching
thanks for joining in and on such short
notice
ever watching me open these packages and
thanks to the people who sent me stuff
this is like Christmas it's so much fun
to open these things and if you want to
send me stuff Tessa has a p.o box just
google it and you can find the address
yeah and I'll try and do more live
streams let me know if you have any
suggestions of live streams you'd want
to see
I know that people have requested like
doing when I'm building stuff which is a
tricky thing like I could definitely do
it but I can't talk and think at the
same time like I can't focus on building
when I'm when I'm like talking and doing
a live stream because like me building
is just like me sitting with and
frowning and like quietly thinking about
something but um yeah we can probably do
like a live stream when we're like
trying a project out or something like
that so like if I build something like
the chopping machine or whatever we
could do a live stream of just like
sewing random random vegetables into it
that would be fun
anyway how do I quit this thing okay has
a finish button thank you so much for
watching and by the way new video coming
up probably this weekend it'll be the
last episode of DIY astronaut so come
and check that out I'm sorry that's a
little bit late I've been
procrastinating hardcore okay take care
