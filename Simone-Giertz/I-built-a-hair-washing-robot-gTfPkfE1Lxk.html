calling I'm currently in my brother's
bathroom because this is my happy place
yay okay not really my happy place it's
because it's the perfect bathroom to
film the hair washing robot I just built
and yay for electronics in wet room who
knows I might be electrocuted by the end
of the day let's hope not I would say
that I'm an expert but that's the lie
I'm more the daredevil kind actually I'm
not too worried about it because suction
cup that's gonna keep it up on the wall
is made out of rubber and a hand which
essentially is the only part that's
going to touch me he's also made out of
rubber and rubber is great for
protection that makes sense in a
completely different context - Chad hey
Chad I got something for you you
somebody asked me why I burp in all of
my videos when I get nervous I just
start burping yeah so how am i both it's
horrible contraption basically there is
an Arduino that controls these two servo
motors and one squeezes at the shampoo
side of the bottle and one does the
washing let's try to put this thing up
tag along here good hmm
I should really get a cameraman or a
camera woman okay I feel very good about
this this is just potentially a terrible
idea right on brand this makes me so
nervous I don't need to see you've been
working on this robot and then you test
roommate and everything's fine and then
you
we try it out and everything just what's
up are you right yeah Rudy are here
right yeah we - everybody's ready step
one plug it in step two
grab toothbrush step 3 open the shampoo
bottle
step 4 profit I was standing too far up
okay you just squat I'm just gonna stand
like here does this make sense you
believe this
I do
I like the story it's telling can do
about it
take three to check it the campuses and
what's the freaking dramatic checker
moment
ah I'm dying I'm throwing in the towel
now like I don't work my hair is so
clean also my scalp I really hope you
like this project I do it all for you
shitty robot nation and for the
progression of the world don't forget to
Like and subscribe and eat your vitamins
and to visit your grandfather and tell
him you love him
this is a stranger and tell him you love
him and to leave a comment a later this
is actually the same hand as a snowmaker
key that's a pretty exciting life from a
plastic hands perspective Oh
perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
