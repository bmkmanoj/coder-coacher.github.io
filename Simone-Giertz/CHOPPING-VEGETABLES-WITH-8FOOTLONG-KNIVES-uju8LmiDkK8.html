ass-tastic I'm even making up words
that's how good it is no I'm not
exaggerating this cussing is all called
for it because megabots has built a big
version of the chopping machine for one
of their fighting robots so for those
who you don't know Megabus make these
huge fighting robots and they've made a
copy machine extension for it so I'm
going to have eight feet long knives at
my disposal so just a great thing okay
we'll try it out alright so we've built
up your chocolate routine a little bit
larger than the original you ready I
don't know if I am I guess I hate God
yep we use science by using the best
what can it tell us pretty much anything
you fit on that board
mortal enemies can I drop that mortal
enemy I think we might have a few though
yeah so we're going to put you inside
this bunker with bulletproof glass on it
and you will get to drive it
kicking some tires there
this is super sharp they said that I can
cut paper that's freaking sharp for an
8-foot knife it's the sharpest 8 foot
knife I've ever heard of so the main
joint you're going to control it
elbow pitch and shoulder yaw which is
going to spin the arm so basically elbow
pitch gives you the chopping motion and
then shoulder yaw is going to move the
knife along the pedalboard so we're
going to start the hydraulic power unit
up which is our track planes over there
give ourselves hydraulic power will
unlock the valve and then you should be
able to should be able to chop all right
our holiday you're having disposal first
round vegetables with chopping I am left
elbow pits
perfectly I'm surprised how sharp those
blades are that's ridiculous it was
going to be so good so it's actually
pretty tricky to control because you're
not controlling the position of the arm
but the speed you got like roll and yaw
and pitch and it's all a little bit of a
mindfuck I have to focus very hard super
complicated stuff but whatever I mean
I'm just controlling 500 pounds knives
that no salt it's all fine nothing can
go wrong everybody's safe everything is
under control I got this next up for for
any good meal we're going to need to get
the oven ready go ahead and gently turn
this oven on for us yes and put it right
there and I'm going down
Oh God a beautiful distraction look at
all of this rubble shut up
smells like pineapple hints of
watermelon onion did that why must get
perfectly cut I think you did really
good job
yeah a lot of combination of game and if
somebody walked up to this and like
discovered this theme here old
appliances just look like we had a
really great party right now there you
go dad last night yeah amazing job at
the first day of robot pilot Academy
today we are awarding you than megabots
pilot bag battle master oh look joy I'm
a real no thank-you pie on the leg that
wait what else I do though we bring it
home absolutely
oh that's so the robot I know you're
talking about the path Oh God
yeah today is a great day what a
fricking great day there are two other
videos and we filmed today one for
testbeds and one for mega boss so I'll
put links in description so you can
check that out
and also like I know leave a comment
post like whatever you do you I like you
anyway I'm working awesome and I'm just
like sitting here casually next to a
terrifying chain saw his life as it
happened good life I seriously can't
think of a single person whose life I'd
rather have right now Chad you're lucky
you escaped this time next time Meg
about Scott yet megabucks going to come
and get your real heart like about going
to chop you up in little pieces and then
we're going to scoop you out the table
like you were just a tiki hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
