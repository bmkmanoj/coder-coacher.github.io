to think that I'm joking but I'm dead
serious
I even made these t-shirts so why won't
math I answer my tweet as I start wiping
their smart asses with my application I
hope they get paper cuts it's going to
let that image sit for a bit but I'm not
going to let that break my stride
because I'm going to make my own
astronaut training program because this
girl needs some freaking space
first things first I don't want to throw
up
nobody has ever thrown up in a space
suit during a spacewalk and I don't want
to be the first person to do it so I got
to put in some freaking practice it NASA
said they have a 20g centrifuge so
basically this huge machine that
sleazier rounds they can practice not
getting G induce loss of consciousness I
might not have that but I got some
tricks up my sleeve to
I mean it might just look like an office
chair and it might be because it just is
an office chair but a human centrifuges
basically just like a huge office chair
so let's get some D induced loss of
consciousness up in here okay
let's try it okay get a little kicks
part
do it again no no stop I need to go to
Spain okay I guess I start by um for
attending work
now there yet it's all under control
this is not enough need something more
so Google's making a science team has
given us a budget for this project
he's got how much money do we have left
we bought lunch okay we're going on a
road trip so we're headed towards
Manteca California because we've decided
to rent an orbit Ron yeah pretty legit
this town is needs a large so you think
I wouldn't stop for a burrito
what's like the worst thing that's
happened in it I've had a few people
throw that this is a bad thing that I
might have had a whole burrito probably
yeah yeah
I feel hi I'm so bid yeah let's go grab
there you can grab the pink part up
there whatever comfortable okay scratch
my butt is it all the preparations okay
ah oh whoa okay let's just say that for
a second Oh doesn't need a second lowers
and ton that's just the average ride
really okay get back at it give me the
real stuff Nicole give me some freakin
space okay let's take a break
 I'm feeling great I mean I could go
for so much longer but I don't want to
waste Nicole's time
oh there's a little bit and boys we
always been
I'm feeling great like I'll even tell
you I'm really perfect
nailed it
it's like they want me to do it off I
can see what I'm Bill's I can jump from
one to one you jump in circles I'm now
certified in pew prevention in Samoa X's
astronaut school of space past of flying
colors all shades of brown and green
next up is isolation training and I
really hate being by myself so that's
going to be pretty rough but I'll do
anything to get some freaking great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
