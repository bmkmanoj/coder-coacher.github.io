scares the crap out of me
I don't mean that literally I can still
keep my crap inside I mean I do let it
out but then it's in a planned matter
ambassador four years since the last
accident and Counting but it was in
Mexico so that was kind of expected in
its own way
to the point introducing the chopping
machine it started off pretty innocent
I've been a vegetarian almost my entire
life and I Trump a lot of vegetables in
my solution to almost every problem that
I have is to build a machine that can do
it for me and cut up this thing is
actually pretty strong it has two knives
and I've test run it a little bit and
it's actually pumping its way through
the cutting board there's like wood
splinters everywhere only that is
terrifying in itself so basically how
this works is that I have these
continuous servo motors they lift the
knife and and then in the bottom of the
night there's a spring that just pulls
it back down and I'm having an arduino
nano controls everything but it's
actually embedded into the metal
structure and I got all the parts for
the chopping machine including the
continuous servo motors from servo city
so big thanks to that for sending me all
these parts this evidence falls for me
as scared as I am I'm also so ready to
try this thing out and I bought a bunch
of vegetables fresh to chop first out we
have lettuce and since I'm not that
stupid I have these tongs that I'm gonna
feed it with
hey let's try carrot
so good
don't I mean I'm just working on that
Darwin Award nomination of mine I am
officially out of vegetables and I still
have all ten fingers left what a bonus
I'm pretty impressed with myself but I
must admit using this thing baby sweat a
lot it's good that people can't smell
you over the internet it's kind of like
nobody can hear you scream in space but
nobody can smell your sweat on the World
Wide Web if you're interested in knowing
more about how the dropping machine is
built there's a blog post about it in
the description and if you like this
video I suggest you press the like
button or subscribe to my channel or
convince somebody else to subscribe to
my channel or write me an email
yeah I work like almost all to almost
all emails I get and not just
philosophically I have a few projects on
the way so see you soon
it's totally coming up and I have a
family to attend to not like a family of
my own production any not for my own
uterus but a family as in like a mom and
dad and a brother and a sister if I
don't see you before that happy holidays
see you on the other side that does not
mean what I wanted to meet nobody's
gonna die okay bye bye oh I just dropped
that one on the floor well again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
