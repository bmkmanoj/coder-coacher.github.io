my own astronaut training program
because nobody else would have me I'm
like a pet up for adoption and I just
decided to adopt myself I've already
made sure that I won't throw up and I
won't go crazy in confined spaces but
there's still this thing weighing me
down the biggest downer on planet Earth
freaking gravity
so we've rented a sensory deprivation
tank basically it's this pod filled with
a thousand pounds of Epsom salts you can
float in it and experience what it's
like to be weightless you ready for this
my jumper gears like an onion this is
like layers upon layers the closest I've
ever to climbing back into my mouth last
word
Donald trum the president opting out
hashtag space will I mean has excess
amount of it
I usually more so we went to San Jose
because I could stick it to the vomit
collet I had to get up at 6 a.m. so I
was fucking excited as the originated is
an airplane that this parabola so it
goes up really fast and then down really
fast to get your experience which is
like to be weightless I was really
freaking nervous about it because a lot
of people do throw up and if you throw
up you have to get back in your seat for
the rest of the flight so basically it'd
be the most expensive vomit of your life
unless you like threw up into somebody's
Gucci bag for each parabola you get
about 30 seconds of weightlessness and
we did 15 of them so I got about 7 and a
half minutes of glorious weightlessness
so without further ado here's some
footage for me having the freakin time
of my life
so I was supposed to marry those as it
went but I can get no intelligent
commentary out of myself I know I know
that's about it as the airplane is going
up you're laying down and your back end
first you're getting heavier and heavier
and heavier but then you're getting
lighter and lighter and lighter until
you just float up it was really like
flying and your body doesn't really know
what to do like your instinct is to just
pedal which is terribly ineffective we
threw up some water and we have to catch
some candy like fucking pac-man
so yeah here we are
also I cut my hair because I felt that I
wanted to look even more like one of the
Hanson brothers bought motherfucker so
going on the zero-g flight was huge like
I wanted to do it for such a long time
and it was the wildest thing I've ever
done like it was it was like nothing
I've ever experienced before and also
this is the last episode of DIY
astronaut thank you so much to Google's
making in science team for giving me a
budget for this project but now I've run
out of money so curve X is building on
my iPhone Alice's level of production
value for you yeah you see what guy used
to also huge thanks to a device that
could help film and edit see our
astronaut and Scott Laurie who produced
it and did production coordination they
were the best paid friends a woman could
have by the way I set up a store and now
you can buy the astronaut t-shirt so if
you feel do you want to look both
offensive and stupid at the same time
just click on the link in the
description and get one of these
beauties it's so solid t-shirt and I
don't know about you but I feel fully
ready to go to space
so Richard Branson I'm just waiting for
you to call me it might go faster if we
all tweet him shameless plug
I have no shame in my face game sense to
not his face not Simone biles
I mean she seems nice and all but Simone
yogurt whatever
Simone dry heat Simone queef on a yoga
ball Simone can't pronounce yah that
girl me I mean otherwise I'll just have
to build myself a rocket and I don't
think any of us wants me to do that it
makes for an interesting mm so that's
something anyway check out the DIY
affinity shake and I'll talk to you soon
thanks for watching VI I asked her that
I had the hot rod oh gosh you're gonna
hate me
hahahahahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
