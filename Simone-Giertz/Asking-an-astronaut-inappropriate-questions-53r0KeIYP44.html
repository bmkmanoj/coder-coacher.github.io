set it up if you alright sorry can you
fly there in the background it's good
this week's video is gonna be really
special because I'm is Ottawa and I'm
also here with a real-life astronaut
congratulations on going to space that's
crazy
thank you you know actually I'm not
quite going to space yet you have about
two and a half years of training ahead
of me but it still you have it on your
schedule I have it on my schedule that's
more than I have what's the most common
question you get about your work there's
a lot of misconceptions about the life
of an astronaut because it's so abstract
most people we only see science fiction
movies maybe nobody knows we really do
people think we're always in space
that's not true we spend most of our
career on the ground working in Mission
Control helping out other astronauts get
a successful and safe mission do you
look at yourself in the mirror and
you're like David you're a goddamn
astronaut or does the effects kind of
wear off I never feel like that oh
really no no no no no gosh everything my
life is a lie the training is so hard
and the expectations are so high that
you're never really have a chance to
feel all that excellence because they
really push you to your limit yeah and I
guess keeping us kind of humble is the
best way of keeping us on on our Coast
so it's easy to stay grounded as an
astronaut what if you're not grounded
you're on your way to an accident yeah
is there something potentially
embarrassing that you're nervous about
like throwing up during launch or maybe
stuttering during a speech oh really
yeah diarrhea and space or like food
poisoning that would be bad that would
be worse maybe the worst thing that
could happen to you is to be sick in
your spacesuit oh really does that has
that happens that unfortunately has
never happened but you could be the skin
I can't even imagine that because you're
stuck in there it's not like you can go
back inside I win Jen we we take great
care making sure we're feeling great
we're
are you ever naked in space or do you
always have to wear clothes of course
I'm going to change because I'm thinking
that you would always be in some sort of
protective gear outfit inside the
protection of the space station you wear
t-shirts and shorts you're just like
inside your home yeah part of its look
like your home owner you wouldn't that
words no you don't really use your feet
now that mine you use your hands to move
around your feet must get really soft
you're not interesting so bland of your
feet that gets rid of soft but that
piece gets calluses because you're
crossing wedging your feet under
handrails keep yourself in position
because it's the opposite and also you
use your feet to carry objects around so
is there anything I mean you're a hero
to so many people is there anything you
feel you can't do being an astronaut
like biking without a bike helmet or I
don't know getting a 16 year old
girlfriend I'm just a regular guy yeah
did you yeah I'm like the superpower
feeling David were you like doesn't that
happen no really I think if that starts
to sneak up on you you're on your way to
problems wow it's good that I'm not an
astronaut there I have that every day
that's what's great about me good maybe
I'm not sure what do you wish that
people ask more about other people are
curious about daily life in space and
the quicksand quirks oh you know going
through the bathroom sleep being heating
one thing that a lot of people don't
really know about is what we do what's
our work why are we up there are we up
there for I'm always enthusiastic to
explain a the science we do up there and
be all the maintenance we do all the
technology that we're trying to develop
that's gonna help us all on earth it's
basically a life of research and
adventure it's a good life thank you so
much for being on my youtube channel I
now have an astronaut subscriber just
say yes yeah you should subscribe to I
post new videos every week see you later
thank you so much right that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
