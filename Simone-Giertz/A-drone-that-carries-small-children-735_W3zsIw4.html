don't have kids but I'm a woman so
people assume that I know how to handle
them one thing I do know is that they're
really heavy and people carry them
around everywhere but parents we live in
the future
we have drones to carry stuff for us now
including babies I think this child is
the appropriate weight and size I mean
it's a little bit on the chubby side
this video is gonna be so offensive but
you know what sometimes the future is
offensive anyone who's ever watched a
black mirror episode and hosts that we
have a drone we have a hardness we have
a child it's like a baby bjorn but with
the more sharp propellers every since
they're cutting drought I'm terrified of
drones and I'm scared of babies too so
it'll be a great thing it's warning zone
Class B what does that mean why is it
out story
we'll be fun so we're heading to a park
where I think it's not gonna be a lot of
people and also patreon is here to film
an interview with me today hey we all
share the burden of this if somebody
gets hurt
are we taking off let's just put it on
the floor like that baby
I think that counts as a success
the baby is just too fat there's nothing
wrong with the invention it's the baby's
fault I have a smaller one where do you
get your children I get mine from Amazon
there's a child in there okay let's go
for a walk
I think it was a successful thing
parents around the world they're gonna
want it
that's all look how happy they are I
mean this one's like not so happy it
seems some shit I'll post the patreon
interview once it's out and also I'm
back from vacation I'm here for you
again solving the problems you didn't
know you had
you're welcome parents anyway I'll see
you soon again so take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
