Francisco and I had a quick workbench I
actually put up all this pegboard myself
very proud of myself
it requires all my smarty nuts to get it
up hey um so last week I had this thing
blow my nose but it was actually meant
for another project and this week I'm
going to have it blow my the Tomatoes
flex joke
I just want to clarify I am never ever
going to build a sex robot so you can
safely stop requesting that now just
pack up your tent go home move on with
your life because I'm not bringing sexy
bot back I'm not bringing sexy bought
back if I ever release an album that's
going to be the title but I am going to
how to pour me a beer because I hardly
ever drink alcohol but when I do drink
alcohol I prefer to have it served by
poorly functioning robot and this is my
friend Scott and he is going to help me
control it he's also very tall press
some buttons practice is over let's go
downstairs and try it out again no no
this is a test that sometimes the past
is real thing I ordered the stunt beer
glasses for the project so basically
glosses the shatter really easily they
never record of them but when I got the
package I realized that I fucked up and
only ordered one so yeah we're gonna
have one take to get it right so I got
these like generic red plastic cups so
we can practice whoo I'm just going to
put a scroll on my phone and ignore
whatever is happening and then it's old
Scott okay okay there's a lot of no
reaction then okay
deadpan face activated Bob gateway
now bitch okay let's pour some beer into
this thing
Oh first take whiz beer let's try it up
god damnit oh my god okay well sooner
God just wash these pants it's not very
smart of me
I think we got it
I think we got it that was perfect okay
I think we're ready for the Sun class
because Scott is freaking nailing this
oh my god I'm like so scared to break
this thing
I mean we're obviously going to break it
you just want to break it at the right
moment let's finish it II was just like
Oh way Bo stuff but okay okay not going
to flinch
oh I'm not sure group work let's try it
I don't have a vacuum cleaner
I realize that dust now I'm a robot
but between our drawers boys love
everywhere well if you like the beer
robot and you want to get a beer buddy
the beer robot leave a like or comment

support you no matter what need to clean
up this freakin mess because this is hot
this mess was hot

project that I'm working on that I'm
going to work on for the next month I'm
