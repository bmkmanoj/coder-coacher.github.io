been viewed around 80 million times mad
there is a chance that I am the person
in the entire world that most people
have seen getting slapped in the face
with a rubber arm since I've got a lot
of new subscribers I thought it would be
fun to do a video where I reply to some
of your comments and some of your
questions and that we get to like hang
out you are a bunch of really cool
people and I've enjoyed reading your
comments a lot like not all of them but
most of them so I need oh gosh and I
have replied to all of the comments just
that most of my replies have been
telepathically telepathic that's about
right to spice things up a little bit
and since this is a YouTube channel
electronics I have one of these what
this thing does is that it can spend
these electrical impulses to your
muscles and make them contract so I'm
going to put two of these electrodes in
my face and I have this microphone so if
I at any point turn quiet its gonna put
on the power to the 10 3000 and it's
gonna make my face go oh like to the
setup is I have an Arduino Uno and it's
reading the values off of this
microphone and if the audio level goes
under a certain threshold it switches
this relay and turns on the power to the
10 3000 and the it's actually pretty
cool because this is more or less the
same circuit as I used in the wake up
machine my mom was like Simone are you
really sure about this aren't people
gonna think you're like two BDSM or
something I'm like no mom this is
science okay I'm just gonna plug this in
and start talking right now key Wow
ah that was way more intense that I
anticipated let's give this another go
John doom writes Percy he use an Arduino
when you don't need one so I've
got a lot of comments on people
that I didn't need an Arduino when I did
the wake of machine and that is
completely correct I could just have
wire the relay directly to the alarm
clock you're looking at a future Darwin
Award nominee but out is Colin
Furze your brother for those of you who
don't know Colin Furze is like this
crazy inventor I kind of wish she was my
brother maybe we believe friends oh my
god oh okay I need a break
I will marry one of your clones contact
me in the future that is like some weird
fetish right there I I don't even know I
just subscribe to your channel because
your creations make me feel like I'm not
a total loser with my grant projects
that's like a compliment in an insult
Oh Adam Savage's tweet I almost peed my
pants a little bit when I saw this one I
mean oh gosh
huge fan marry me from ton of people oh
don't scrape your spoon with your teeth
what Scandinavian language is this so I
used to post a lot of videos in Swedish
I am Swedish for those who don't know
and there were more people asking me why
you have an American accent I used to
watch a lot of friends as a kid and also
I just pick up languages really easily
actually last year I was living in San
Francisco so I did speak a lot of
English there obviously I thought when I
was living in the States that it would
be a good thing that I had an American
accent but actually it just made me seem
really stupid because people tended to
assume that I was American and then I
said something like oh you're from
Michigan how interesting
where's that and they were like oh uh
and also and there's a lot of like stuff
I didn't learn in school I thought that
blue balling meant lying for the longest
time billion comments about that I
should have tattooed illu instead this
is why you can't have nice things
internet somebody get the scroll to show
on Discovery Channel plus one on that
one why were you in the u.s. yeah I was
working at a company that's called
punch-through
they make an Arduino board that's called
the light blue beam now I'm going to
take questions for my Twitter I'm
actually pretty active on Twitter I'm at
Simone yeah you've been getting a boost
and visibility of popularity with your
cereal
hasn't been a positive experience any
creeps of course there are always creeps
this too errant but mostly a very
positive experience what's next for you
is Sweden yeah I just swing out with you
and do fun stuff have you considered
combining your alarm Hanna robot theater
into a spinning feeder arm I haven't I
wish I had because that's frickin genius
what aspire you to bleed your maker of
awesome junk lifestyle I I don't know I
just don't like working with three
serious things ah I can't do more of
this I can kind of taste my teeth I was
thinking since there were a lot of you
who asked about houseboat stuff I would
give you a little bit of a tour I'm
currently not on my own boat I am on my
mom's boat but hearse is pretty cool too
and it's actually bigger than mine we
should go and take out the machine room
because that is probably the most
awesome place on this entire ship the
machine room is obviously below deck so
we have to climb down this ladder to get
down there so let's go how cool is this
it's kind of funny because we don't
really come from a boat family I mean my
mom bought this boat eight years ago and
I brought mine like three years ago but
before that I had hardly been on a boat
what the heck is this I don't even know
but now we both have skipper's degrees
and I think we've got the situation
under control as always I hope you liked
this video if you did I suggest you
press the like button or the dislike
button it doesn't really matter anyway
Oh
talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
