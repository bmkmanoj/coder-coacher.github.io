can you do me a favor and just lower
them a little bit and then lower them a
little bit more okay that's good this
video is like the pop-tart ingredients
list bunch of stuff you don't need and
it's not even that good
filling it why should you move up nation
Queen here I'm not sure I'm sold on this
whole shitty or what nation thing but I
don't know how to address you
peeps guys enablers of my life
everything feels awkward which is also
an accurate description of my sex life
everything feels awkward I'm oversharing
again Am I maybe the shitty robot nation
just needs a little bit more substance
like some facts capital cogwheel city
official language C++ binary assembly
interpretive dance national dish soup
that's too odd to eat if you're not
playing cards against humanity' you're
missing out on life and you would have
understood that reference but I wish if
they would do a new cards against
humanity' game that was actionable and
you actually had to do the things that
the card said like call your parents and
tell them you're pregnant from blank a
disappointing birthday party launched a
new toothpaste brand where the active
ingredient is blank
Ascenta and then you actually have to do
it very long game placenta dental smile
like an infant be to the point I was at
Comic Con this weekend and I discovered
my inner fangirl
I didn't think I had one but I most
definitely do i mixer dava's i got
photobombed by neil degrasse tyson i got
to verb add in spacesuit and walk around
at Comic Con as an astronaut I finally
got to hang out with my internet friend
physics girl you should definitely check
out our channel if you want a cool lady
who communicates science without using
words like and butt plug and
placenta to mention a more recent
example
speaking of youtubers i also met Hank
green from vlogbrothers
and I was like hey I'm fangirling right
now and he was like oh because of me
group kisses all these other people and
I was like you know because of you know
when he was like yeah
 all these other people and I was
like yeah I'd all these other
people but not you and he was kind of
cool about it and and laughs but all I
could think it was like snow can't you
just stop being you even for just the
tiniest moment just stop ah sorry I
didn't mean it that way
I really think no matter what I say
about it I would just be digging the
hole of my social grave even deeper it's
a little bit like when I was running a
startup back in 2013 and I I did my
first pitch and it was at this event
with like 100 investors this woman comes
up to me afterwards and she's like oh
that was a really great pitch and it was
like thanks it was actually my first
pitch ever so it was my virginity pitch
I'm just really happy went better than
when I lost my real virginity and she
doesn't say anything she just turns
around and walks away
and my friend comes up to me afterwards
and he's like wow no that was the woman
who just invested like a hundred million
euros into Angry Birds what did he talk
to her about and I was like yeah you
know things ah I just wanted to show you
some of the random stuff I've gotten
recently so I get a lot of random things
sent to me and also just from going to
events and listening offices and from
comic-con and I promise I'm not going to
be to say any of this stuff it's all my
own free voice yeah my own free voice
first of all I got these YouTube socks
from when I was visiting the YouTube
office
and I wear them their socks and I'm
wearing my build outfit today not
because it's build day
because it's laundry day I got this dark
hot glass from the Neil deGrasse Tyson
party whoa hmm cougar robotics sent me
these really nice models of their robot
arms
the name cuca is pretty unfortunate in
Swedish though because q k UK means
so cuca is basically like a coffee but
as a verb and it looks like this I don't
know my mom laughs pretty hard about it
I got this giant killer robot t-shirt
which is an augmented reality tabletop
game I think from what our workshop I
was interviewed by word UK and they sent
me a copy hey I like mysteries of
malfunction I might add that to my royal
title I got this spaceship from going
and I was like what is this a rocket for
ants can't use that how many of them do
I have to like to get it into space and
this was actually super nice arrow sent
me this electronics garnet day and it's
a bunch of capacitors and transistors
and LEDs and soldering iron and a bunch
of boards neopixels and yeah this is
super useful actually because I didn't
bring any of my stuff to San Francisco
so thank you so much for that I got a
new build coming out next week so please
stay tuned for that it's gonna be a lot
of fun I think I mean I haven't built it
yet I got the parts right right here
I'll draw slowloris to anyone who can
guess what it is
talk to you later bye
hey how'd she fit just like rallying the
troops not doing that yet okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
