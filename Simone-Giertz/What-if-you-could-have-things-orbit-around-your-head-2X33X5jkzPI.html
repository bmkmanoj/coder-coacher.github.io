traveling a bunch and also after posting
the last video the episode about vegan
hunting
I just haven't known what to like poster
say it feels like I just fed you a
really fancy meal and now we're back to
microwave dinners anyway I have a new
project idea picture this you have a
head picture that you have a head what
if you could have things orbit around
your head like a personal delivery
system you could like have it deliver
food or you could have a book on it
there's so many possibilities if you
just had a way of putting objects into
rotation around your head cue a poorly
executed sketch cue and adequately film
the montage of me building it
I'm so happy with this project
doesn't it look fucking fierce so it's
remote-controlled it's just running on
like a lazy susan for like family-style
food and then it has a little motor with
a tire here in the back and then we have
the tiny hand action that just has like
gets tough the last little bit into your
face dananananana
you're out do have a lot of baby here do
you want to pin it my arse can reach our
craving that were you okay are there any
songs that would apply to the situation
I think is like when you're innovating
you don't always know what your product
like what fields your product can be
applied to we're just gonna try it out
with a bunch of different things are you
3d printed a little phone stand does it
look like the future can we get more
technology
oh this is such a bad idea
beep me oh he's a fucking gross is I'd
like something you get at the den tip I
got some glass on my finger bleeding
thanks for watching I hope you like this
video actually I'm taking this thing to
Vancouver because I'm giving a TED talk
and this is the project I'm bringing
onstage we're gonna vlog from there also
my mom's coming it'll be fun okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
