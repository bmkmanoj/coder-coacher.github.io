we're not filming today but we do have a
press cute I need to get some free
coffee to kick-start this face I do like
this hairstyle combination between bed
head and insane asylum a schlub I
pronounced asked to asylum this hair is
like the mix between bed head and insane
asylum I feel that I drove just fell
flat better like next time a lot better
I built shitty robots but there's a lot
of different shades of shitty so I'm
going to rate how shitty my own
inventions are from zero to oh my god my
dog just found something in a bush and
ate it and now it's all over
the carpet that's the scale we're
working with here so I built this
project before I started this YouTube
channel because why the not this
actually has a music world go bananas
like there were all these different
venues that wanted me to come and play
all these musicians wanted to buy it it
crowd went wild for it it's obviously a
joke
nobody gave a I love when you have
to explain that a joke is a joke that's
how you know it's really good this was
actually the first popcorn catechol
table then I built a second one but I
had to retract it because a saucer got
upset that I joked about what was it
I probably some body fluid but it's
before that I built another popcorn
catapult for the company that I worked
for punched through this is really
shitty I also gave even use pepper for
it I just used like tissue paper the
lesson learned from all popcorn
endeavors that I've had is that the
great for eating but they're terrible
for everything else everything gets kind
of soggy coat of popcorn goo on it I
ever started a clothing brand that would
see what's called good popcorn goods do
screen saver those also before I started
my youtube channel so it all started for
me mispronouncing screen saver is saying
screen saver instead so I bought the
domain screen shaver dotnet but
basically there was hair growing from
the browser window and your cursor
became a razor and you'd shave the
screen as if you don't have enough body
hair to keep track of already the wake
of machine it cracks me up that so many
people have seen this the looks like ur
life oh gosh
this project was terrible people tend to
think that the wake of machine is the
most painful machine that I've made but
actually it's the lipstick machine
because I did like ten different takes
on it in between takes I had to like
wipe off my face I got a weird rash or
I'm now if I started a punk rock band it
be called mouth rash so from a scale
from zero to shitty it's around the wake
of mouth rash so I bought a popcorn
helmet with Adam Savage that was the
first project that we built together I
had the worst impostor syndrome because
I'm just the hobbyist I don't know what
I'm doing sorry
make it work my part was definitely the
worst one Adams parts all work perfectly
they still do mine are kind of falling
apart
but this is me like demoing it and being
like I don't know what I was doing I
mean like it looks nice it's
aesthetically nice but it doesn't really
matter what I'm doing
the hair-washing robot oh my god the
shampoo dispensing is pretty great but
the rest of it is obviously pretty
shitty but it was a terrible project too
so first of all I was like I'm going to
be like half naked in a bathroom how do
I shoot this in a conservative way so I
was just constantly like I mean it's all
just like here enough I actually had to
shoot it for two days like first I shot
it and I finished it and then I watched
the footage and I was like no I had to
redo all of it because the shampoo I
used in the first day was kind of
translucent white and it was like all
over my hair and I was like this really
looks like sperm I can't put this on the
Internet
so for the second day what I had to redo
all of it I bought champions it was like
more glue just to get out I just did it
I scalar 0 to 10 is minus 2 does that
make sense giving my iPhone case arms I
don't really know
it's that pretty shitty you had to have
ginormous pocket drone haircutter up so
the original plan was actually that I
was going to use them myself and we're
thinking we're going to try and cut like
this like wigs hair on me but then we
quickly abandoned that kids were like
this is a killing machine we're
quite nice
poop emojis deal with it glasses I mean
they do the job pretty well it's the
contraption that's on your head that
kind of kills it you have to have a lot
of needs to be able to pull it off
like I wouldn't know I would wear it in
public from the scale of 0 to 10 it's
probably might poke your eyes out it's a
solid might poke your eyes out the
gross back machine not shitty at all
it's useful the fact that it is
useful though is pretty shitty this
would actually be way more fun if I
rated other people's inventions because
I'm Way too biased when it come
in my own tweet me your invention using
the hashtags please rate my invention
Simone and we'll make another video
where I can't write all of your shitty
or non shitty invention also if you want
more videos of me check out my patreon
page I post like two to three short
videos they're weak just like updates of
what I'm doing or where we're who I'm
hang out with so if you remember the
space go there thanks for being a part
of the robot uprising we're doing
important work over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
