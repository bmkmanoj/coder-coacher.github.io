Earth I'm dressed the nurse pubes hey my
name is Simone welcome to my new show
I've been a vegetarian as I was eight
years old
took me three seconds to tell you that
I've made a lot of questionable choices
in my life like tattooing my Chinese
name when I was 16 or getting a bowl cut
I lost my virginity in that haircut
might be the biggest accomplishment of
my life kind of impressive like wow I
salute you way too old for though you
get that bull cut and watch the streets
it did not lose my virginity in the
street so in the light of that becoming
a vegetarian might be one of the better
decisions I made in life but plot twist
I'm not here to preach vegetarianism I
want to become a hunter every year
millions of Americans go hunting and I
want to understand what so many people
get out of it I just don't wanna have to
kill any animals but robots I'm fine
with killing some robots but before I go
for big game and I am an irresponsible
robot hunter I'm starting with fishing
yeah yeah it's still hunting but people
don't feel as bad for fish because
they're ugly
oh sorry fish everybody knows that
fishing is the gateway drug into hunting
I'm heading to this company called open
ROV and they have an underwater drone
and I want to try and fish that drone
out of the water this is me casting
fishes for my fishes with the glory lure
fish I'm like a fish talent scout right
now
it's really the right place you guys are
all with me if this is how I die I'm
still alive don't worry that's forward
and backward and then this is like
flying an airplane so to go down you
push forward on the stick some of the
best pilots are under 10 years old
I fucking hate when kids are better than
me it's tough this will make the perfect
underwater prey I'm gonna fish the shit
out of you right let's fish a little ROV
I think you got it again it's this old
fishing rods work cuz it sucks
I'll design my own fishing rod wait no
sorry I got it I feel like this is still
just not real enough like when people
talk about fishing they talk about the
nature experience from the call
I think we need to take this to a real
lake
I haven't been up this early since I was
born
let's do some fishing crawling deeper
[Laughter]
yeah it was just the likes of a
fisherwoman
cow shit filled with insects and ripping
your pants I just need to fix my pants
this is what they call a fashion
emergency you just take this little flap
all the way around into the back and it
really accentuates the waist of the hips
enough fashion now time for fish
I have some seaweed in my pocket to snip
it a little bit
I just learned where the jockstrap is so
like a sports bra before tradition you
learn something new every day how do you
call fish come here a little fishy
why you something happening I'm seeing
it it's like still alive how do I kill
it no I did actually turn the lights off
oh yeah I don't I don't really know what
to do with it if I'm gonna get up at
4:30 a.m. and wear rubber pants I need a
bigger payoff than this at least
something I can eat yeah fishing the
drone was a little bit of a letdown and
I'm not just saying that because I broke
the rod and ripped my pants I need to
make some things that can roam in the
forest and that I can track and that I
can kill and that I can finally eat this
is what I want to build with the help of
model maker Mark Anderson he's worked on
movies like Jurassic world in Star Wars
so I think he can handle this project I
just want to make like a a being that I
think it's like covered in food my plan
is to get some sort of digger and then
just like hatching on tofu to it so
we're gonna have to have some kind of
motorized base for this a good place to
start would be using mobility chairs
like electric wheel
and things of that nature so mark is
gonna work on the remote control base
and meanwhile I need to learn how to
hunt because I freakin sect at fishing
okay and I think I found the perfect
woman to teach me Jen Cordero was a
vegetarian for ten years but then she
was like no and became a hunter she's
also a certified archery instructor and
just reading about her I'm like a tiny
bit terrified so how long does it
usually take to go out hunting and with
a compound bow I mean it depends on
personal skill level but essentially
you're trying to learn six months or a
year of training in three hours
I like all shaky well you're shooting a
weapon it's serious perfect and when
you're ready let the arrow go how'd it
feel your first shot going from
vegetarian to a hunter is like that's
like not something you do just every day
how did you become a hunter I think that
initially people think it's like this
huge change and transformation I really
don't think it is that I don't want my
life to contribute to some huge carbon
footprint we grow our own food but we
also hunt in our local mountains how was
it like first time you killed an animal
what were the emotions you were going
through it's like this rush of emotion
between feeling responsible and a sense
of duty and ethics but then there's also
like you worked your ass off for what
you just did and there's a sense of
pride and accomplishment you know I
should be emotional it's a weird
navigation of emotions when you take
something's life perfect
I'm like conflicted with my feelings
around it as well but at the same time
like I think it's so much better to do
that and you actually know what the
process of killing an animal is and like
going to the supermarket and buying a
beef
that was a bull's-eye pretty much I was
thinking that I need as much help as
possible to hit stuff and I figured that
it'd be easier to hit things that I
really dislike I brought some airplane
food
I bought a pickle never got it I brought
some surprise period when you're like I
think today's gonna be clear for your
uterus is like fuck you no girl here's
some surprise blood first let's try some
period blood got it on the tip just
that's the kill point for pickles we're
gonna get off my target I throw
something on it no yes all the animals
now airplane food I hate you with my
entire being this was like a good
release it is our cheese amazing and you
don't have to hunt to be an archer just
know I'm just hunting pickles and period
but I have so many conflicting emotions
inside a wiener I remember like checking
her Instagram before which is like so
many photos of hers with dead animals
simply oh but when you meet her
everything is really well thought
through I mean it's the same if you meet
somebody who has like really different
political or religious beliefs from you
you really should have this like
reluctance to it it's like coming on
this prejudice or this lake this is what
I want like I want to think that killing
animals is wrong
no no we'll see what it feels like when
it's actually in the field and I'm like
actually hunting a robot
this is uh this is Cody the coyote
she's our HR department okay
back to building the robot I'm using a
plastic deer as a base because I'm not
getting into taxidermy anytime soon
first off I want to make the head move
and I'm using some old windshield wiper
motors I want a budget and I spent most
of that budget on tofu so junkyard
windshield wiper motors it is so I'm
just trying to actuate the head so we
have a windshield wiper motor coming out
of here and this is one of the biggest
pains in my life turning that circular
motion into a linear or just any other
form of motion it just never gets easier
thankfully I have friends who can help
and by friends I mean Adam Savage from
Mythbusters yeah I think I might need a
longer bolt through the side as well
because a bungee cord like the way it's
not like a crazy sound it makes me yeah
I think so dude yeah why is it stopping
oh yes so clearly you're right I think
we do need a longer bolt on the bungee
cord now can you say that again clearly
you're right I think
I am gonna do something I've never done
before just cut up animal legs all right
mark modified the windshield wiper
motors so that they power all four legs
simultaneously there's one side done
this will enable the deer to gallop
exactly the way a real one would you
probably won't even be able to tell the
difference that was like oh it's gonna
be like the uncanny valley of a deer
this is nothing you can't alley this is
me way off to simulate hunting as close
as possible I'm cutting out a kill zone
that's about the same size as it would
be on a real deer I don't think that
this is very kill zone on a regular
nearest but this is where it is
maybe we have like a bladder of some
sort like filled with sauce please I
have these warm water bottles that I'm
gonna fill with hot sauce mark just
finished outfitting the mobility cart
with all-terrain tires so the deer can
roam through the woods put the tofu up
on the deer cuz maybe if we just use
like really big walkers and screws that
might be enough to hold it it looks like
an old person who spent two weeks in the
bathtub this is what we're covering up
all the patches I'm gonna just try and
wrap it and see how that works whether
you're using materials and ways that
they're not supposed to be used there's
nobody you can ask there's like no tofu
store where you can be like how do I
attach this to a decoy plastic animal
nobody knows you just have to figure it
out the best you can
under Frankie what do you think Cody it
really just looked like I wrapped stuff
to a thing it just doesn't blend into
the rest of the deer I'm just gonna get
food like tofu and the old people skin
and only use the brace tofu it just
looks better I think this is the worthy
opponent kinda looks like he wants to
die so that's a good thing
I think that this might be the only
hunting experience in my entire life so
I'm gonna savor it
this thing is hot I'm with hot I mean
huh this is a lot better
this is Darrell he's a daredevil
it has tofu it has hot sauce that's
carrots
it's like peptide that delivers itself
I'm ready for you are you ready for me
so Jen taught me that hunt an animal I
need to think like an animal but I'm
gonna hunt a robot so I guess I need to
think like a robot I hope my compound
both skills are good enough for this
challenge so what are we doing looking
for poop looking for poop okay that's
the game I can play what does it look
like it's brown
that's definitely poop that is deer poop
oh you know what is this a thing I have
to do there okay does it feel light or
heavy why does it crunch in your fingers
yeah it's really hard welcome to
outdoors oh you don't know if it's
liberating but it's something look at
your poop I freaking ready Darrell I'm
coming for you this is a threatening
hand movement I can think of
so what we have right here is some very
fresh Darryl poop they're about 20%
charge its batteries guys so joke
what is he where is Darryl Darryl's
playing the waiting game needs a robot
so he wins that game
I can see him you sleep crossing this
field
my friend run over he's going to be able
to see me and try and get away
fuck
he's having a hard time with the terrine
for me to be able to shoot him he needs
to be kind of still even though this
isn't how an ethical hunter would do it
I can see that he's like struggling with
the terrain so what if I use logs to my
benefit
I got him the kill zone third shot
I'm just really scared and excited this
feels really good I feel so bad for
shooting him and missing the kill zone
good game Darryl
you know hot sauce is fine but I just
felt like I squeezed pus out of a cyst
he's a toughie
hey this the hunt was exciting
snacks are disappointing
even though I was just hunting a robot
my perspective on hunting has has
changed like hunting is not ideal you're
still killing a creature but also like
nothing's ideal being a vegetarian is
not ideal either especially not like a
supermarket vegetarian like myself will
I go hunting or eat meat I see I'll
probably still passed but I really
appreciate the conversation I'm getting
all my mouth sounds I crawled up on my
sister's desk and took a book out of her
bookshelf open it and took a shit in it
I have no recollection of this but my
parents told me about it that's because
you're left to think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
