got a new camera and I don't know where
the lens is I want to look into your
eyes okay
well I need a piece of tape to know
where I'm supposed to look hey sugar
ruination Queen here being the queen of
a fictional nation is the best
I haven't had to cut a single ribbon and
there's no law to be upheld or anything
maybe we should have some balls though
at least one don't be a dick mmm
thou shalt not be a dick actually that
doesn't make sense
cuz it dick so great like they're
essential in reproduction none of us
would be here if it wasn't for dick big
fan of your work
Dex doing great next time somebody calls
you good dick you should just be like oh
you mean because I can be both soft and
hard and because I stand up for myself
mic drop assholes on the other hand
stink in their uptight and full of shit
so be a dick but don't be an asshole
first love the shady rumination didn't
think thing thinking I'm kind of worried
about my mental health because I feel
three projects in a row that are useful
like they're not shitty at all I don't
know like do I have a fever or am i
constipated or am I like
or something who knows I'm just like
built these useful things they don't
suck at all it's wrong with me no but
seriously building shitty of us used to
be my hobby and then it became my job
which meant that I had to make a new
hobby and recently I've felt all of this
furniture and I really want to show you
some of it because I'm really proud of
it and don't worry I'm still gonna build
shooting robots like I still really like
doing that but I think even I need to
take a break sometimes ok here we go
first project wait I need some safety
glasses not actually on my eyes I just
need them on my head I needed some sort
of hardware organizer so I made this out
of copper plumbing these big ones are
just end caps and then they're attached
to the smaller copper pipe using tube
clamps and they just like swivel around
and you can put random things in it it's
like works really well it's like fun to
move around it was actually really
simple to make it was just a lot of
bowls to drill but I think that that it
was easy easy like spending on my toes
cuz I'm trying to be in frame you're
gonna have like something I can depend
on yeah I really like when things change
proportions so like when big things
become small or small things become big
does this call for another dick joke or
is it too many dick jokes for a video
I'm just gonna keep it inside I needed a
place to hang my clothes and I thought
it would be fun to make a big coat
hanger where I could hang my smaller
coat hangers so I made this coating or
coat hanger coating or squared
I don't know big ass coat hanger I used
this really cool tool for it called the
Schaefer origin basically it's like a
handheld CNC mill so I designed this
coat hanger in Illustrator you just
upload it to the origin and you get like
plywood or whatever material you want to
cut it out of and you're just like hold
the CNC roughly over the pop and then it
like correct it for you and it's like
this really smooth edge there's a video
on tested of when I make this coat
hanger so check that out there's a link
in the description and you can have all
the coat hangers you want all the coat
hangers ok last project I finished this
just yesterday and yeah it's just like a
side table that looks like a school
so we made this out of 32 layers of 3/4
inch plywood I cut each layer
individually in three different steps
using a router and then I just like
screwed and glued them together and it
took me two days just to make like the
wooden part of it then I burnished this
top using a soldering iron and I
varnished the whole thing and the thread
that's wrapped around is actually this
fabric cable and in the end here we have
a little light bulb that we can turn on
weight so nice also I just want to point
out that the cable that's wrapped around
it doesn't actually Karianna current
because then this whole thing would be
like a huge magnetic coil yeah
studying physics in college for one year
at least taught me that right hand rule
this is like the gangster sign of
engineering also just this needle in
itself took two days to make my good
friend Marcus is a fabricator helped me
make it and like figure out how to do I
cuz I was like I need a giant needle and
he was like okay we'll figure it out
what we did was we got this like solid
aluminum rod and we lathe it and then we
flattened the facia and made the eyelet
itself using a milling machine and then
we just like polished the shit out of it
and got three layers of epoxy on it just
to protect the surface and also that it
like keeps its shine and just like that
you have a spool I liked so much I just
want to bring spool everywhere work into
the doctor's office and to to the
grocery store I just I just want to be
with school forever don't you dare to
say anything mean about spool cuz Bowl
is great I love spool it's funny because
when I posted these projects people have
been all upset and like wait this
doesn't suck at all why did you post
this Oh
oh gosh don't take it away take it away
little thanks for keeping me on brand I
guess either way tomorrow I'm traveling
to Europe and I'm gonna be on the road
