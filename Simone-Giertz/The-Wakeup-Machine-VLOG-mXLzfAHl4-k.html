because your bed is so comfortable so I
was thinking why not make an alarm clock
that makes your bed a little bit less
comfortable because it slaps you in the
face
for those who you have an attention to
detail this window is round and there's
actually water out there because I live
on a houseboat so that's not as cool as
you think it is but that's for another
video basically what I did was that I
got this rubber hand and I thought
wouldn't it be fun if I had it slapped
me in the face and let's hope it doesn't
look like a really weird porn shoot and
it kind of does but I guess that's okay
mom and dad this arm is just like a
Halloween profit this was what it looked
like before
I like cleaned it with nail polish I
don't know if you can see it but it's a
lot less bloody and I also cut off this
like terrible cut off bloom because I
thought just having like something slap
you in the face to wake you up is
terrifying enough without it having to
look like this so what I did was I
picked apart this alarm clock clocks are
not made for picking it part because
there are so many small parts they just
kind of flew all over the place and now
the clock isn't working anymore but it
did work and basically what I saw was
that whenever the alarm went off it had
like this little switch that went off
and grounded another connection so I
just put one of the wires goes to ground
and then I have one of those too that
little pad that got grounded whenever
the alarm went off and then I'm just
reading that signal with an Arduino Uno
and I'm having their do no control this
relay that starts this motor this is a
motor from servo city uh and they had
like these really nice parts and I try
to get servo city to sponsor me but they
were like no but I still want to put it
in there these parents are freaking
awesome cuz they have like this these
octobot ixora just aluminum and they're
really easy to just like put stuff
together and it's super sturdy way
sturdier than I normally build stuff and
this motor is like it's pretty strong
it's
sixty-five rounds per minute and it has
I think it's still current is like 20
amps so before I started using this
relay right here I burnt up a fair
amount of transistors there's nothing
that makes you feel as competent as the
smell of burning electronics you're like
good job Simone you got the situation
under control and you're burning up
I was kind of hoping to just find like a
normal transistor II that that could
provide enough current for this one and
it would still be able to be controlled
from a microcontroller like the Arduino
Uno but I think that was a fool's errand
because there is no such transistor or
maybe there is but then please share it
in the comments because I haven't been
able to find it this is just a box for
band-aids I mean it's a pity pretty
terrible construction these are just
like normal like what are you saying
English and yeah in Swedish I really
don't want to talk my projects down
because they're kind of like the
children I never had their their uterus
Simone you're 25 get a grip let's
transition into the wake of machine
working right now no question
Oh
this is such a mess oh this
robot
big-time well that's an improvement this
is serious
I'm I don't know how to get myself out
of this Oh
oh gosh getting slapped in the face with
a plastic arm to wake up was actually
not as painful as it might look probably
more humiliating than painful actually I
really hope you liked this video and
this project if you do I suggest you
press the like button and also that you
subscribe to my channel where I'm gonna
publish a lot more fun projects like
these and if you didn't like this video
and you're like ahhh my time back then
I'll just be like no you can't have your
time back because now it's mine and I
just snorted it
I can't do this I can't handle this
