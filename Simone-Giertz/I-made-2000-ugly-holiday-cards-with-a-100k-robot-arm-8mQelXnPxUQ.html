Simone you look really tired I'm not
tired I'm just not wearing any makeup
because I'm more important things to do
like build a contraption that feeds
paper to a robot arm so it can help me
right mm holiday cards oh I was gonna
say it'll be good I don't know if it's
gonna be good but it's gonna be
something have you ever thought about
what it would be like to live with an
industrial robot arm in your house
starting to sound like a really bad
dating app how do you ever consider
marrying her robot arm
I've not considered marrying a robot arm
but I have thought a lot about what it
would be like to have an industrial
robot arm in my house because cuca has
decided to lend me one uh yeah I think
it's a really good decision they're
delivering their lbr Eva to me tomorrow
and the holidays are coming up and I
want to send holiday cards to all of my
patreon supporters but there's almost
2,000 of you so why not use the robot
arm I'm getting too Haro
to help me right mm holiday cards I got
these paper rolls and I'm working on
making a contraption that just slowly
rolls it and then I'm thinking that the
robot arm will just hold a pen and
they'll like scribble on the paper as it
goes past and you know what I realized
this is the first time I've tried to
build a robotics project that actually
works it's it's weird but this is like
what people usually use robots for who
knows maybe it turns out I'm also the
queen of well-functioning robots I don't
think we have to worry about that
I might've harvested parts off of the
soup robot it always feels like grave
robbing oh sorry I'm just gonna have to
take this one motor so I'm thinking this
is like the platform it'll write on and
there's a servo motor here that pulls
the paper through and a controller there
you can adjust the speed with I don't
know if this is actually gonna work I
picture it working pristinely in my head
queen of robots that work really well
refined robots I'm the queen of refined
robots are you fucking kidding me Oh
incoming educational moment I use a lot
of servo motors in my project and
they're really good because you can tell
them what position to go to one thing
that's not great about server motors is
that they can turn all the way around
unless they're continuous and that means
you lose the position control but you
basically get like a fairly cheap DC
motor for this project I need one that
can spin around continuously and I was
convinced that the one I used in a super
robot was continuous but it turns out
that it's not
I do have continuous motor is on the
chopping machine okay we're gonna grave
Rob the Tropic machine as well oh my god
it's so weird for you to see this end of
the room it's all in the same room my
workshop is like 10 steps away from my
bed this is my robot travel bag this is
also the coffin of pretty much every
previous thing I built I think it should
work now
wait Simona wishes you happy holidays
Simone wishes you a happy holiday anyone
can see that
it'll be really long holiday cards for
people oh wow that's a problem for
tomorrow Simone because tonight Simone
I'm sick clean this mess up okay good
night bye I'll see you tomorrow bye I'm
getting when you pet today it really
feels like I'm getting a cat kinematic
kitty but a lot more expensive because
this four-alarm is like $100,000 and I
still can't believe that they're letting
me borrow one it's out here in the
garden it's such a weird thing I've
interacted with this robot arm a little
bit at the cuca office they like hide me
over there and train me on how to use it
and it really feels like this mythical
creature almost it moves like a Griffin
does it the great peanut Oh Scott I
might be one of the first people in the
world who is at least with this type of
robot arm in their house I don't know
what type of pioneer that is but I'll
take it also for all of you who are very
worried about my well-being for now this
is what's called a collaborative or a
water so it has forced torque sensors in
all of its axes so it like won't crush
humans I was hoping that it was gonna be
able to do some sort of like writing on
these cards
I have quickly abandoned that idea it's
gonna squiggle is that a word squiggle
scribble this is just gonna be one very
long signature if my patreon supporters
would wanna fame the signature they'd
all have to get together all 2,000 of
them and keep it all together
Squibbles quit kibble giggles a scribble
and scribble scribble it'll just be like
baby drawings then you have to be like
wow thank you I think we're ready to
start this let's plug the servo motor
feeder in
Happy Holidays here's a line this person
who gets this one right here is getting
a very special piece
someone's like I don't have to be her it
tells the story it's a very long story
it goes from long and straight to know
what's improvise a little bit
it's almost doing like a punk jug it is
it's like these sticks that look like
a.j and you eat them no I'm getting no
response from the Americans of this
return so actually every Friday and a
couple of weeks forward I'm gonna do a
live stream using this robot arm to
automate different top we're gonna have
different guests on and it would be fun
Friday at 11:00 a.m. PST come and hang
out and also let us know what you want
to see us automate in the comments or
thinking like I don't know I need ideas
give me your best ideas
I think that was at least another 100
holiday parts okay bye and happy
holidays and extra happy holidays to all
my patreon supporters come enjoying the
shitty robot nation if you're feeling
inclined just look this is the type of
value proposition we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
