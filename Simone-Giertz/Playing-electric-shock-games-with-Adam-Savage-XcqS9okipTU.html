and green socks you know it's coming to
my house today
Adam is coming to my house as an Adam
Savage and I have dirty socks on my
floor and I'm out of toilet paper but
none of that matters because we have an
important thing to tell you the second
part of this is that I got this like
weird electrocuting cattle prong
terrifying reaction game and I need
somebody to play it with have you played
this game before I have not played that
game I have some perhaps with being
shocked is this gonna bring out like
it's like PTSD I think so
welcome to my house out in it's not the
first time you've been here it's not the
first time I've been here we filmed here
before that we're gonna talk about it's
entirely possible we had a lot of people
in this tiny house we had so many people
the temperature would have like 10
degrees Evette right director forced me
to stand with this big fan between takes
because I was sweating it was brutal
should we do a test run
all right good what do we wait for that
hurt it's not like it was super painful
but it was shocking but we have an
announcement to read while we're doing
it it's taped right under the camera in
two days I will upload a 28 minute long
video on my youtube channel usually it's
just Scott and me filming videos
together in my visits god me building
videos together in my living room
between this we got a proper budget and
Adam you were the executive producer of
it yes you had a big crew and we put
together a bunch of my old mythbuster
colleagues to help make this 28 minute
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
you could conquer the worst possible way
to make an announcement we spent a
couple of weeks some famous mythbuster
locations but we did not I'm just gonna
stop talking until I win one I made me
screaming too loud I think your your
neighbors are actually call the cops
it seems like I'm being abused over here
which might actually be the case
deciding on the name of the show these
are some of the ones we discarded I
really like Beezus my show thisis my
shelf I like Simona's
that's the one that goes at the very end
of the list when you're really tired you
can't think of anything else we ended up
calling it practical difficulties I
would let's pause the game for a little
bit honestly it is the best content I've
ever made I am so proud of it and I am
really nervous to upload it because I
like it so much and I really hope that
you like it too
we had so much fun making it not a
single one of us wanted it to end it was
like a complete family that we built
over a few weeks to make technical
difficulties and it's freaking awesome
you guys are all with me if this is how
I die keep rolling
hey don't forget to hit the ball so you
get a notification when the video comes
out I I did not win one time move your
thumb so you can feel what it's like I
cannot wait till the public gets to see
ya what you made this is not fun being
on your channel I do not the subject she
offered me hot food or the shocking and
neither who sounded great but this was
terrible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
