turning the lights on
I will technology just really it friend
this video is paid for by Google home
yeah there are some crews here like any
moment but I just wanted to let you know
that I'm donating all of the money I get
from the sponsorship to help some of the
disaster relief and Puerto Rico as you
probably know the situation there is
still really dire after Hurricane Maria
so if you're somebody who doesn't like
it when youtubers do sponsored projects
bear with me it's for a good cause I
really dislike soup and especially
pumpkin soup I think it's because when I
was a kid I wanted to stop eating meat
and my parents were like you need to
prove that you can eat vegetables and
they made me eat a whole bowl of pumpkin
soup I feel like everybody has that
thing that they got forced to eat as a
kid and that they spend the rest of
their lives hating and mine is pumpkin
soup you know what it's Halloween which
is all about facing your fears so today
I'm gonna make pumpkin soup and have a
robot serve it to me
Wow Simonne impressive feat of bravery I
know it might not seem like a big thing
but to me it is hey Google let's get
spooky setting your home to paranormal
hi welcome to those cooking show I don't
know how to make pumpkin soup but I'm
just gonna do it the same way as I build
robots it's just to do it the way I
think it should be done if only there
was a device onions checked by a robot
when you make pumpkin soup g8 the peel
as well I'm just gonna have to do this
old-school hey Google when is my
birthday your birthday is November first
please some new stuff uh she's not
pumpkin soup I realize I'm kind of happy
that the robot is gonna be so bad at
serving me this cuz I probably won't
have to eat a lot of it I'll eat a
little bit for the sake of proving that
I'm a grown-up and that I can do it hey
Google are you ready for the super or
what hmm I'm not sure neither am i the
soup robot is as if the beer robot got
the breakfast machine really drunk and
I'm gonna have a child it's actually
pretty sweet
I have a servomotor recorder I'm gonna
control all the servo motors and then
you can like record a sequence and
replay it it sounds like this weird bug
where I have to slam it for it to
actually start a 3d printed all these
parts because you can't get a claw that
needs to pick up soup just like that
I'll need a little bit of fine tuning
just a little bit
mmm
I think it'll work things are gonna be
great thank you for your trust in me
this especially is gonna be so messy
which is nice because I have this little
crew here who can help me clean up
afterwards I'm just gonna sort screws
and ignore what this robot is doing I'm
like actually nervous hey Google turn on
the super robot you got it
turning the supe robot on but this
really it looks it looks like baby barf
my mom seems fun
sooo people should suit more often if I
could eat soup like this every time I
might like it hey - hey Google turn on
the super robot okay turning on the supe
robot
I just needed to show you the ground
here it looked like somebody made a kill
room for emojis feed me I'm feeling fine
I like pumpkin soup a lot more like this
thank you so much to the Google home
team for this paid sponsorship if you
get a Google home any it won't come with
a super robot but that's probably a good
thing check out some of the other videos
the creators have made with the Google
home many and please consider donating
money to support some of the disaster
relief work going on in Puerto Rico I'll
put links in the descriptions to some
smaller organizations who are doing
really important work on the ground
I mean if super wet can do good then so
can you
we're working on that slogan all day
okay bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
