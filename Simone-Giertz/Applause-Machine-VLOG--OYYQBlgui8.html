like a PowerPoint animation if you
bought popular science this week you
already know what my latest product is
because I wrote an article for them
about it and if you haven't you should
because I look really good in the
picture and that doesn't happen very
often if you have like a super pro
photographer coming you're shooting you
and you're all like I got the idea when
I was at a conference and I just had to
clap my hands a lot but my poor
developer hands just started hurting
after some time so we thought there must
be a better way I realize this is kind
of like the slogan of my channel because
finding a better way is all I do
you're welcome world this is probably
one of the most well polished projects
I've ever built
I even like itched its name into hearing
the front in silver how pretty is that
very pretty good job Simone thanks Mon
the trickiest part about building this
was probably just figuring out this
entire clapping mechanism these are
actually a pair of tongs from my kitchen
and I have this motor with an oval motor
head thing motormouth what is yeah it
had you kissed the ender and I put this
metal spring between the the grippers so
basically the motor just forces the
hands open and then they just like these
are just some hollow plastic hands that
I got they actually look really creepy
they're like an old person pans I
normally prefer young people hands uh
ooh so basically how this is set up is I
haven't already narrow narrow inside of
here and it's connected to a MOSFET so
we can control the speed of this motor
and I have a slider so the speed can go
from snarky slow clap to breakneck speed
let's give it a go
so as you can tell it has some work to
do on the audio quality I don't know
what it sounds like it sounds like
something that shouldn't sound like that
if you have an eye for detail you can
see that it's actually two right hands
that are clapping because there were no
left hands left but I really hope you
liked this project
anyway if you did I suggest you press
the like button and if you haven't Rudy
you should definitely subscribe to my
channel because and uh old person's
hands either way talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
