film the build process Marcel here's
what fucking build processes the reason
I don't want to do it is because kind of
a payment buys and also it gives me a
shitload of shit to edit for the B phase
I cuss a lot which is my English
vocabulary sub bars go ate a shit load
of shit we should build a claw machine
for the greater good that takes it up
every time everybody wasn't a fantastic
idea but I have a feeling that if you
tried to do this you me like really long
time vision like we would end up
beheading the toilet
I might have to build that I'm just just
remember that it's started right here so
I got those like a little desktop saw
machine and I just went to the store and
bought battery one and a half volt like
they're fucking huge and one half full I
don't know what's gonna happen I haven't
done anything with it I just bought this
I still haven't figured out how I'm
going to do this but I guess but what's
this all about why is nothing happening
fucking fog I think I ran that for about
20 seconds and they're already want to
kill it
so yeah let's take this thing apart ah
they're cute ain't here one that lowers
it in another key that opens and closes
the cloth yeah that's pretty cool but
it's not going to give us enough forests
actually the head stuff so what I'm
thinking is to take this claw out and
put a servo motor in it and have that be
what crushes it but I think oh 3d
printed quad it's a little bit dirtier
and stronger because I just got a new 3d
printer I'm very excited about it
so it's like day 110 of this project
this impulsively reverses I made of the
clock I'm doing this like a crazy person
I woke up at 6:00 a.m. this morning me
like this is how I need to do that for
it to work and I'm not sure if this is
actually gonna work but I have high
hopes for this iteration I had a good
feeling about it so what is that along
bitches in the beginning I had to
quadruped and I really said that might
make it a little bit weaker I'm not sure
if that was correct way of thinking
about it but now I have two quads that
are in the same place all the time and
then just one part to helmet I could try
out some promoters and I was really miss
you little I don't know as a sellable
permit servomotors try outer basically
just plug it in and throw a battery and
you can move it around without having to
do any programming which is really good
oh hey
no no it's chilling it's amazing the
blasting fuck my purpose was actually
gonna work during up my life
post iterate again so prior to setting
this haunting project I had hardly ever
done any CAD design now I feel like a
fucking tad wet you doubt that I'm a
professional I have this pad so I just
have this like metal server horse has
been off you see it's like chewing its
way through the plastic so I'm gonna use
this one that's bigger and I've actually
modeled it so I should just pop right in
no so good oh yeah oh that's a display
best version so far
it's lit a little bit of pain what is it
suffering
I'm just looking for cute stuff that I
can crush which is also what my online
dating profile says so we got a lot
bestir campy though thinking that that's
going to crush easily get some funny if
we get some frogs we get some chicks no
seriously
we've come this far and now you're not
going to start little dipshit
I mean the candy is good didn't even
come out this ear not as aggressive as I
wanted duty I wanted to do like eat
stuff up and it's barely injuring these
tiny little creatures do I need to do to
make those words the way I want to do
I'm stuck here you're gonna get picked
up
yeah tell me about our machine
you
drop the car Lizzy I'm so underwhelmed I
spent so much time on this birthday and
it's obviously not paying off fucking
claw machines man even when I rigged it
I still lost maybe they're just too
shitty from the start so it can't make
the shittier I don't know I feel
disappointed in myself failing at
feeling what does that make me really
bad or really good it's like - sex -
turn off fluff okay how do you like my
new manicure nail art that's my thing if
you have any ideas of how to improve it
we have any other design selection trial
please let me know maybe I should just
buy a bigger plumbing maybe you get one
of those really like like one that's a
fair company expense yeah we'll see Oh
oh I'm calling it a day by day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
