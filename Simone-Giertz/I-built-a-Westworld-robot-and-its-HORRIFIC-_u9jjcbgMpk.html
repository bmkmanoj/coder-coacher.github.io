this video is sponsored by HBO I know
life is good so I'm a really big fan of
West rolled I mean it has robots cowboy
boots and ever Rachel wood in no world
does those 3 things add up to something
that's not great and I made the scheme
to swoon a trio into letting me on the
show
I call it my saloon theme it sounds like
I'm mispronouncing another word game
here's my plan I'm gonna build an
animatronic robot version of myself that
looks like one of the hosts that they
have on the show and then I'm gonna send
the video of it to HBO and they're gonna
watch it and they're gonna be like
awesome oh we could like really use
someone like you on the show like you're
smart and cool want to hang out HBO I'm
gonna swing you with my skills I watched
all of season one a while back but I
need to binge watch it again just to
brush up on my Westworld knowledge I'm
doing very important work over here
they're like moving their arms talking
walking is there's a lot I think I'm
gonna choose like two of those things
that I can do not that I couldn't do it
but just we're in a tight schedule maybe
talking and moving arms I don't know
this is like a medical doll of some sort
I just feel like if I was a doctor I
wouldn't want my patients to have this
facial expression I don't know why they
decided to have this one thin one -
you're not gonna be able to tell the
difference at the end of this I also
brought my makeup kit hi welcome to the
most Beauty vlog just a little bit like
that it just gives you so you look a
little bit more alive which is great if
you're a dead plastic doll simple fast
fashion oh so when you cut hair you want
to make sure that you cut as much as
possible at the same time just to get it
all at the same length oh oh you look
great
I don't know what you what you're
talking about
prepare yourselves to be amazed we're
just gonna make the arms move and the
head I mean first of all we need to put
the head back on
[Laughter]
do you know where you are I got a dream
they say that the great bass wants
around this world biggest mountains the
newcomers are just looking for the same
thing we are a place to be free to stake
out our own dreams a place with
unlimited possibilities some people
choose to see the ugliness in this world
disagree I choose to see the beauty
it's a difficult thing realizing your
entire life is some hideous fiction
there are things in me things I was
designed to do that are just out of my
reach
someone wants to go me if there's a path
for everyone
my pack please go back to you life like
that
what alive
I mean always exists in the mind it's
always imagined so what's the difference
between my pain and yours between you
and me there are two versions of me
there's only one and I think when I
discover who I am I'll be pretty open up
close down may you rest in a deep and
dreamless slumber I think that went well
HBO would call me or tweet me I'll just
be here with binge watching season one
with my friend thank you so much for
watching this video and thanks HBO for
sponsoring it you upset that I used all
of the money to film an audition - for
you to hire me I'm not if you haven't
watched Westworld season one yet
watch it season two is just around the
corner and also season one is like
really good doesn't have some - in it
but it's still really good okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
