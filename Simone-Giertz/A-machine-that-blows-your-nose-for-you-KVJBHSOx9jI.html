fever and I'm just like a pile of
self-study I watched a movie last night
about a woman who died in cancer and it
made me feel so sorry for myself that
makes absolutely zero sentence but I
take all the pity points I can get at
this point by the way how crazy is it
that 1,400 people are supporting me on
my patreon when I saw that my jaw drop
like a teenage boys ball sack - ball
sacks actually dropped when boys go
through puberty can't wait to add this
on my search history no they don't
I've been living in a lie okay so when I
saw my patreon my jaw did not drop like
a teenage boys ball sack because
apparently they dropped during infancy
and if they haven't dropped by the age
of five they have to do it surgically
and that just fucks up my metaphor but
what I'm trying to say is I got very
surprised I mean in part by the monetary
support which is obviously a huge deal
but one thing that I had anticipated is
also like the valuable input I'm getting
from the people there yeah there's a
bunch of stuff that I feel weird about
talking about on on Twitter but patreon
is like the inner circle so I feel that
I can be a lot more open there so yeah
it's been a lot of fun anyway I'm sick
and I don't have anyone to take care of
me
other than my eternal friend technology
so this is actually a part of a project
that I'm publishing next week if you're
on my patreon you'd know what it was
shameless plug but I'm gonna repurpose
it and have it blow my nose because I
don't know my brain is a being very
responsive right now let's just try it
out
hey it's not that strong I'll be fine
plays it about their out if I don't have
any teeth at the end of this just know
that I did it all for science and likes
probably more for the likes if I'm
completely honest with myself okay let's
get some toilet paper here something
like that stupid new surprise nobody's
surprised Oh robot ever isin happen to
know what is even happening here why do
I get good it's really paper in my mouth
oh why am I so clumsy it's not even
funny anymore
evolution why am I still a thing I'm
sorry that I'm not sorry it's this was
horribly gross if you liked it press the
like button button button I can't
pronounce but word button if you like to
press the like button if you didn't like
it just put your hand like this just
this is a chunk of time that I just
stole from you and that you're never
gonna get back I'm just gonna put in my
breast pocket right here for safekeeping
anyway take care don't get sick because
it's fucking boring and if you have any
movies about women dying cancer that you
think I should watch let me know in the
comments or if you're like the CEO the
company that delivers soup to people
yeah I could kill some soup right now I
promise it'll be more fun next week less
not and a more flaky face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
