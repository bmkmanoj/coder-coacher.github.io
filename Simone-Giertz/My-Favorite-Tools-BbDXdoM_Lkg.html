thought this week would do something
different I just wanted to show you some
of the tools that I've got in there's
nothing that makes me as happy as buying
tools it brings me tremendous joy and I
want to share that joy with you so here
we go
first thing that I've gotten and there
was such a game-changer for me is this
dremel tool I just want to travel
absolutely everything like don't want to
peel tomato tomato
it's an orange mmm
so this is model 4200 and what's really
cool about it is that you can just snap
on and off tools and another thing that
I got for this dremel tool is that I can
kind of recommend is this drill press
station you can just use it as good
press and you just get better position
in the holes you're making that's the
right way that's what so many people
said multimeter works great it's really
handy want any - when I'm traveling I
need to troubleshoot projects this is
seriously the best drill I've ever had I
married this drill if I just found a way
to do it
it's a Makita XP h10 it just makes this
really nice sound it just makes me feel
like such a pro and that's all I ever
want to feel nothing else I don't want
to feel any of the other feelings
other than being a pro am I getting
there anytime soon speaking of high
precision calipers this is what makes me
feel like a pro what's nice about this
one is that since I'm kind of between
metric and imperial I mean I'm grace on
metric race metric but I live in a
country where people use imperial it's
really nice because you can just switch
between Leitao and it also has fractions
which I realize people here use for some
reason that I don't know like just
because you hate yourself I'm not sure
Adam introduced me to pop rivets and I
just want to pop rivet all the things so
pop rivets are perfect if you just want
to put two pieces of things together I
made this big picker and I used pop
rivets to make this harness right here
so not explaining this in a good way but
I hope you're sold for soldering I have
two different setups this is my home
setup I actually just got this as a
Kendall soldering station also has a
hot-air gun which is really nice we use
heat shrink tubing because usually I
just use a lighter and then I melt other
class naked sad it's a sad story one
thing I have that when I travel is this
it's a battery driven portable cordless
soldering iron all those words explain
the exact same thing it just runs on
four double A batteries and it's perfect
when I'm traveling because I don't have
to mess around with converters and it's
just very compact and easy to bring
anywhere I use my Leatherman tool pretty
much every day and Adam helped me make
this a little belt holder for my
Leatherman this is made from just a
single sheet of aluminum that we bent
and polished I was really happy about it
and really proud of making this until I
realized hey I never wear a belt but
good intentions this is such a beautiful
so when I was in Germany in Cologne
Laura camp gave me this little wire
thing that she made basically there's
just a bunch of wires and here in the
back and you pull them out and there is
a little razor blade so you can just
like boom nifty I got sent a 3d printer
what's really impressive about this 3d
printer is the price point it's $300
which may sound like a lot of money but
for a 3d printer it's actually pretty
great but the problem I've had with this
is that it doesn't have a heated bed and
my apartment is really cold so whenever
I 3d print things they just curl up but
yeah I think that's on my door not the
3d printers this makes me feel so cool I
got a beta version of the shape or
origin they're going to start shipping
and
mid-2017 i think but they have like a
highly functional beta version and i
have what i i've talked about the shape
origin before because i've used it and i
think it's really awesome promise I'm
not getting paid to say any of that but
it's a really cool and exciting new tool
basically it's a handheld CNC mill so
this is the router here is the thing
itself for Christmas I'm just gonna give
people stuff I've made with this one
merry fucking Christmas here's some shit
I cut out so yeah those are some of the
tools I'm using to build shitty robots
the shittiness is not to blame on the
tools it's to blame on the person
holding them based on this if you have
any recommendations for tools you think
I should get please let me know in the
comments there is nothing that makes me
as happy as buying new tools I don't
know if that's a very sad thing but it's
the truth
I love tools so much make my life better
I'll talk to you later they cool they
tool to Cofer tool whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
