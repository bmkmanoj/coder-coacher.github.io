conference and I just swung by here to
clean up my houseboat because you know
what I'm sewing it don't be sad I'm sad
for the both of us for the both of us
about a year ago I posted it like a tour
of my boat and a lot of people who are
disappointed that I didn't show any
exterior shots North gave the name of
the boat you know that the Internet can
be a really creepy place so there were
good reasons for not wanting to do that
but now since I'm selling it you're just
gonna be creepy to whatever person
happens to buy it so time to tell all my
secrets yeah we're almost there
are you ready
here it is Alfred it's still my boat so
yeah his name is Alfred and yes he has
the man's name please respect his chosen
pronoun but he's in an ice-breaking
tugboat which means that he's
technically allowed to have a man's name
because breaking things and dragging
them behind you is such a male thing to
do what the do I know
I bought Alfred on my 22nd birthday
because I couldn't afford to buy an
apartment and a crew of builders and I
like remodeled pretty much the entire
but change the steering system the
heating system the sewage system
remodeled the whole kitchen built a new
staircase did a bunch of stuff I was
really perk at the time so it was at a
minimal budget but he tired at PD okay
the scar I have here in my hand is from
fiddling these cupboards here so I
shouldn't blood on this boat her blood
siblings now truth to be told it's
mostly period blood but still counts
Alfred is like this grumpy old man he
was born I say born not built because I
think of him as a person oh yeah he was
built in 1942 and he actually sunk in
the fifties so the sewage leak I had is
definitely not the worst thing that's
happened to him a lot of people ask if
I'd recommend buying a house but if
you're ready to put in the work that it
requires and sure go ahead I should
probably not tell you any of these
things because I'm trying to sell this
boat but during the first summer I had
three break-ins so three times I woke up
in the middle of the night because there
were people walking on the boat and two
of the times it was just like drunk
people and it was fine I just like shoes
in the way but once there was actually a
guy who tried to break in and I was on
lower deck and I could see he was
walking past
holding a knife and the way I reacted
was I gave this like guttural like
cavewoman scream you know like when you
you get power from the tail you no
longer have I just screamed and was like
get off of my boat bitch and for some
reason I did it in English as well I was
Sweden in I don't know my dreamers is
like when you're in an emergency
situation fall back on all the action
movies you've seen and speak English my
boyfriend at the time just started
laughing so hard and I actually got
really upset because I was like what the
 were you doing at least I scream
get off of my boat bitch after that i
redesigned the bridge so you can kind of
hoist it up and since then we've hardly
had any issues things are fine please
buy my boat please buy my boat please
buy my boat you say my bad please buy my
boat please buy my boat please buy my
boat I'm just kidding
don't buy it I mean do buy it but don't
buy it here's the techfoot hug this
right here
it's like hidden behind this bench but
still there still works the engine
totally works it's fine he's fine
everything is fine it's gonna be great
it's not things are gonna be crazy the
main reason I'm selling Alfred is
because I live in the States now I need
to be there for work and Alfred really
needs somebody to be here to take care
of him so I know that a lot of you have
asked about the boat and what's
happening with it and I just wanted to
let you know that I'm advocating as a
houseboat captain I can no longer have
that on my list of things that make me
cool which is fine I feel like I can't
fill it up with other stuff I always
like ridiculous this is captain pet
anyway so at least I won't have that
anymore but it does build that by Alfred
I think this might be one of the last
times I'm here I see which day you know
sometimes when you love somebody you
have to let them go or as my mom says if
you love a man sometimes you need to
find him a new owner yeah she does say
that
this morning thanks for watching please
don't forget to subscribe or goodbye my
boat
okay bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
