living on a boat isn't as cool as it
sounds like and this is what I meant
because right now it's 7:00 a.m. on a
fucking Sunday morning and I woke up
because my entire boat smells like shit
for some reason my septic tank hasn't
been emptying instead it's been leaking
out and my boat is essentially filled
with shit water oh it's too early in the
morning for this shit I'm not even
wearing pants yet so I take a little lid
off this tank and as you can see there
are these islands of moldy poop floating
around and I'm thinking the pump isn't
able to chop those up so I'm just gonna
put those in this plastic bag I don't
have one of those rubber gloves so it's
gonna duct tape this plastic bag to my
arm oh I'm sorry about what you're about
to witness this is not a pretty thing
what I really hope this fixes it because
I need to take a lot a long working
shower after this Hey yeah oh it's like
it on the light meter OOP
why the fuck is it you bet Wow I'm so
glad that I can share this moment
so it's obviously not the pump that's
not working because it just emptied
itself fine
but for some reason the water that it's
pumped out is just coming back in
because I could see it slowly filling up
again I need to deal with all the poop
water in the hole but I'm going to save
that for later future Simone's gonna
have to deal with that because current
Simone has done enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
