that I hate getting my nails done
actually I've blacklisted a bunch of
jokes for this project including its
hammer time let's get hammer nailed it
smashed it
shaft and I've also already built the
hammering a robot but I forgot to film
an intro so let's rewind to before I
knew how painful this project would be I
was so much younger back then
oh wait by the way this video is
sponsored by Squarespace
thank you back to rewinding
hi my name is Simone this is what I have
so far
so here's a servomotor that I hope is
gonna not buckle under the pressure of
all of this
oh poor servomotor oh why am i not a
mechanical engineer I feel like this
would be so much easier if I just knew
what I was doing this is not gonna hurt
Cal I went back to the drawing board and
made a bunch of sketches of it I really
need to make sure that this fully works
very soon because I'm taking it to LA
because it gonna be a guest on good
mythical morning I got a linear actuator
560 pounds of thrust oh my god so heavy
so the main thing I struggled with
mechanically for this project is that I
want only to use linear actuator but I
want the Hammers to be offset so that
they're not hammering at the same time
but they're going like this but then I
realized that if they have the same
pivot point but the the motor licks them
one from from this side and one from the
back side then we should get that effect
I've made so many assumptions of this
but I've also planned really carefully
so thank you oh my god this is some hard
wood it's like impenetrable if Scott is
laughing so they're both gonna pivot
right around here and I have like these
little D shafts that are coming into the
hole but you need to make sure that they
don't get stuck in the hole these
bushings that you push into the bush
really how like a bush we don't have an
HR department
I does this machine so much we're just
gonna try it this is a really big motor
and there's a lot of things that can go
wrong but okay but thanks for watching
the most of all you need to make sure
that it actually touches the table
because now it was like really politely
stopping you're not supposed to be
polite you're supposed to look like a
kid is throwing a tantrum in a shopping
mall okay it's also really late I need
to eat some food and not hang out with
this hammering robot more I will show
you how to be angry
okay this is where it's at it's just not
working out and I was really stubborn
trying to make it work for the linear
actuator and Marcos was helping me out
the guy's polishing a rod Marcus's is my
friend who helped me build spool I think
I should've briefly polishing the needle
as well well you just gotta embrace it
that's your brand on my youtube channel
I'm flying to LA tomorrow and we should
basically started building the hammering
robot from scratch but I like this so
much more I've scrapped the linear
actuator I might do like a DIY hydraulic
press or something basically it's just
gonna be here and the motor is gonna
have a cam and it's gonna push down on
the on the hammer and then it's gonna
hammer hammer stuff you'll see it's
gonna be glorious
[Laughter]
yeah I got you watch it it was worth it
I want to feel
I'm in LA hey good mythical morning I'm
nervous because markers and I finished
this robot 10 p.m. yesterday and there's
like 80 people here so if it doesn't
work I'm gonna be the one sweating yeah
this is Simone yecch and she has built a
hammering robot you're gonna build a
birdhouse by the way just like this
really hopeful so it's really great
about the stammering robot is you only
need three people to operate it what did
you think about the robot it does it
does its thing very well very dangerous
very edgy I feel like it might be better
as a smashing robot or as like a beat
robot yeah you get a good like that's
kind of what I was yeah that's what I
was considering its thing but I didn't
want to hurt your feelings
I'm gonna take it and smash some stuff
back to San Francisco no I got it bye
thanks
oh wow it's a it's now again
just like in the beginning of the video
I'm actually not looking at an imaginary
wristwatch I'm just seeing how much my
arm hair has grown the hammering robot
is definitely more destructive than
constructive I wanted to embrace its
true nature can we cue some triumphant
music is that is that all we can afford
yeah okay we'll featuring a fin on a
budget don't put the hammering a robot
in a mold because it will break it if
you put a glass ceiling over the
hammering robot it will shatter it you
can try and knock the hammering robot
down but it will knock you out there's
anyone else crying it's just me
I try and just push them back into the
eyeball should I be wearing shoes maybe
safety first but I don't call it safety
I call it sexy okay uh let yourself
three hammering robot mark I don't know
what the story behind making this car is
but the story is gonna end here I love
you apparently they didn't let me back
they give it to Goodwill we still have a
whole head are you okay Scott there's
very few contexts that sentence would
make sense
they put the switch that is not an
accident somebody had a good time making
that nope this is making me feel really
bad we cannot kill this dog I'm gonna
spare you I'm so sorry does anyone want
this dog we'll send it out to somebody
on patreon you're gonna get a second
chance in life I didn't kill the dog but
I did kill the mood
see you later calculator for anyone
who's wondering this is how I do my tax
returns oh no it's like it's bleeding
this is what I picture whenever anyone
writes me caps lock incoming sponsored
