I get to tell you about it yeah so the
big news is that I'm pregnant okay now
we got that joke out of the way I'm not
pregnant
mmm no definitely not pregnant but I am
gonna do something that probably will
make me gain as much weight as if I was
pregnant
because I'm moving back to the states
I'm gonna co-host a YouTube channel
called tested together with norm Chan
and Adam Savage because thing you
haven't watched tested it's all about
exploring technology and building
different cool things and adarand I just
finished our first built together and
got the idea when I was having breakfast
and I was thinking about pair helmets
because what else should you think about
when you're having breakfast and I
thought like beer helmets are cool and
all but why is there a popcorn helmet
cue the drums
ha-ah
ah sorry I'm sorry I think this might be
the best project I've ever built because
if you're watching a movie you still
have to like put your own hand into the
popcorn bowl and feed yourself and you
don't want to do that because we live in
the future and also if you're watching
the movie with your friends they're also
going to put their hands into the bowl
and and I prefer my popcorn like my anus
untouched by other people so I built
this popcorn helmet with Adam I feel
freaking awesome when I wear it it's
just it's like instant good day let's
find an extension cord up so we can
watch it working
it doesn't have any popcorn in it right
now because I'm really tired of cleaning
at popcorn I'm a stop building machines
are so messy because I'm tired of
cleaning after myself
I have nothing smart to say about this
whoo it just can't be a bad day during
that so this helmet actually used to be
a beer helmet but I replaced the beer
cans with these popcorn containers and
we have like a trapdoor in the bottom so
it dispenses pop card and then it feeds
it to you item to sign the hands and
this like twisting mechanism I mean you
don't want to have to eat the popcorn
from my hand that's like this it just
works freaking amazing
look at that and in between the helmet
and these popcorn containers I have this
aluminum frame it's called actor guadix
and I've talked about it before because
I've used it for almost every project
that I've built it's just like this
standard that makes it really easy to
connect motors and stuff like that and
it just works like a charm
the expression works like a charm is
really weird because charms don't tend
to work at all the act robotics doesn't
work like a charm clear communication
good job smell
can't see that Canyon carry this and
tough Wow I feel smart so this entire
joining tested thing is so huge for me
basically they had seen my videos and
they were like hey do you want to come
and build stuff with us and I was like
hey let me think about it okay I'm done
thinking about it let's do it the
Internet is a magical place it really is
and I've been wanting to tell you about
just how weird it's been to go viral in
the way that I have but I I don't know
how to tell the story because I feel
like I'm still just in the beginning of
it I would just really want to think ah
here's something I never thought I would
say I would just really want to thank
Reddit and especially the people at
slash are slash trading robots because
that's just kind of where it started
taking off for me oh gosh this is
getting cheesy but seriously like I
always thought he was so corny when
people were like I just really want to
thank my fans blah blah blah I don't
know how to say this the last six months
have just been crazy and I've gotten to
do things I never thought I would get to
do
and it's really all because of you thank
you so much for following me and for
supporting me and for all of it like
super sweet things you're writing me
seriously thank you from the bottom of
my heart okay I got it out oh I'm just
forgot uh I posted a photo on Facebook
and Twitter and Instagram and I asked
you to guess what it was and if somebody
guessed it correctly I would draw the
manatee and that was a very bad idea on
my behalf because I have drawn more
manatees than in my entire previous
lifetime the thing in the photo was a
popcorn hot air popper initial idea was
that we're gonna have one on each side
and the popcorn helmet was gonna pop the
popcorn to do we scrapped that I'm not
very good at drawing but here's a
manatee for mark slope and one for Tom
Harrington
Maxo and yamasaki Philip Albert sing you
get a manatee you get a manatee
everybody gets the manatee Simone has to
draw a ton of manatees I can't imagine
that anybody would want these but if you
actually do want these just email me
your address and I'll send them your way
if you want to see a video of the full
build process of the pop grunt helmet
head to test it there's a link in the
description I'm still waiting for my
visa but hopefully I can move to San
Francisco within the next one or two
months so there's gonna be a lot more of
me on tested after that and also I'm
still gonna post up to my own YouTube
channel I promise
and hopefully I can get you so really
cool like behind the scenes videos and
other fun stuff okay okay
that's addressed for those of you who
don't know I don't ah that's very late
at night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
