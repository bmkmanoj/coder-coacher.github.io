those paying us a go at each other
Danna aka physics girl usually you make
physics videos yes any physics videos
about like questions about the universal
DIY experiments and stuff it's really
educational a lot less heavy on the
pictures what we're doing yet is what I
think she has potential I'm hoping
there's a wholesome curd that don't have
anyone we have invented a game basically
I scroll through the comments on your
channel and I read out random comments
and you have to guess which video the
comment was posted on and then I suppose
do the comments on your channel and you
have to guess which videos the song it
was actually surprisingly fun but we're
thinking but the way we can make it even
more fun is to introduce this old friend
I have done videos Q&amp;amp;A videos with you
sport they're called tents even we put
these pads on our face on our face one
face we do look a little bit alike there
are times when a video of yours pops up
and for like a split second I think
that's me and then she opens and they're
like that's not me I never said that on
internet those two up until today
pussies on our faces and basically they
make your muscles contract and I'm
thinking that when you get a question
wrong you have to increase the intensity
of it and whoever gets into max
intensity first loses these are meant
for pain reduction but they are
surprisingly painful it what is your
problem I will go okay you should have
invited your dad to participate in this
man well if I just did a video in my dad
where he got shocked by lightning twice
I think that was from the the most
recent video that I did that's the
capacitor it's the capacitor one yeah
should get these to Salem that
is my first everybody swear my
editor says that it's like a unicorn and
passes through around I say that every
time I swear I kill Assam ah they are
all city thinks I built that aren't City
robots very good very good no because of
everything should be the point of our
channel but not the other thing is i
develop an orange Peru was like I'm
gonna take these off in time ready to
shop okay okay great way to hide signal
from the government I feel like gotta
have something to do in a Faraday cage
can you call cellphone in the microwave
yeah perfect so ridiculous
what my ideas are some of the common
some of your videos someone said and so
Skynet was born chopping machine did you
mean the topping vegetables with eight
foot long knife no Diana I know because
I know what it feels like I've been
through this before and I'm doing it to
me good I know it's not hasn't even
sorry had to see anticipation is it on

up one level put it on the arm yeah it
makes your teeth feel like like they're
gonna fall out let's do the bicep yeah
that might be fun mm-hmm common is no
all caps learn sometimes expressed I
love when people are like do you even
have even inverse study physics is that
one why is being a very flat I have no
clue that could be any of them it is
that our perpetual motion machines
possible they obviously didn't watch the
video because I don't they're not is
that you conclude that it's not possible
yeah lane why it's not possible I should
buy an awesomeness meter but it won't
handle this level
I made a row of obscure severe for you
know Amelie no it was the patreon
exclusive filming this physics girl you
may not have seen that video but if you
go and sit on patreon and you support it
you can see a video like that I have at
level three now okay I need this place
let's go to the other hand like I think
a little bit fascinated by this among
this is like a cult that I'm joining and
I happen to be weird rituals and art is
my part of it and once you're a part of
it you never get out
