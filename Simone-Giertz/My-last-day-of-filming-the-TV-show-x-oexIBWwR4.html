of the same Swedish so it's the last day
of filming the Swedish TV show I've
laughed so much during the shoot that I
realized that I need it incontinent
because I peed my pants like not a lot
there like a little bit but you're still
like well I'm 26 years old and I just
peed my pants just a little of it I'm
doing a lot of those like lunching
exercises yeah
too much information for everybody
including me this happy is here in five
minutes so I need to to pack up and get
ready and the last day of shooting is
almost here we just got to the studio
and we've had the morning meeting and
gone through the manuscript for the day
so we're just going to start reviewing
some testimonials so we talking about
things that we've done previously and
then we're shooting an episode where we
want it to be one trigger during summer
because if you visit is only winter
during winter we're going to write sled
down the summer hill and we're going to
have like a snow war snuggles Kittery
cam everybody's going to believe me for
having it's okay here's where we're
filming or they're packing everything
else oh cool we're going to go right
quick jump we sitting down the sill and
I'm like terrified because it's really
steep and there's like a bunch of stones
and I feel like I'm going to crack my
butt
also I'm wearing this like overall like
they have a personal grudge against my
crotch because it's like so tight
so this is the weapon has soap water
park under it pretty fair by
I love is over okay now we're going to
turn metal that was so bad didn't work
at all
winter during summer is definitely worse
than winter during winter I can say that
I've done some scientific research now
and it's very true very verified and
we're yeah we're done filming IR I some
the last thing for this TV show this is
Robert who developed the idea of it was
curated official title developer very
fancy
I am your former developers but now
we're going into post-production and
we're going to look at some of the clips
that they have there and you're going to
love it
I'm gonna love it gonna love it you have
to love it
so this is free to be part of the
post-production
it feels really scary which is usually
when I do videos I'm so in control of
like all the footage and everything and
of the Edit and here you just like
relinquishing control to a bunch of
people I haven't actually seen anything
so I don't know what it looks like okay
let's go c'mon the house
so I can't elderly going to Brooklyn I
think any seven okay I like the Sun that
opening an example walked up we used to
joke
oh yeah the blue my favorite this was my
favorite part so we got to ride them a
curator bucket is actually the most fun
thing we got to do on the show I think
that cool is the enemy comes along
oh yeah oh yeah it also carries out our
ability yeah
and then I tweeted about it and people
were like you know what's your insurance
have people thought this through and I'm
like oh no we just wanted to do it now
we're going to watch when we put things
into jelly and then Mesa almost died
you got electrocuted and smashed me in
the face
it's the last day of filming and I'm so
tired of the show but now I just want to
watch all of it can you edit everything
now Lola thanks for really watch it ah
look where I am I'm back home in San
Francisco it's so good to be home
I love you workshop so as much as it was
really fun to shoot the TV show it was
also a pretty tough to do that and
manage my own stuff at the same time and
that midway through this year I started
getting some serious burnout symptoms
and I actually want to sick leave for a
week so I'm really sorry for not having
uploaded any videos but it wasn't really
an option because yeah it was just not
feeling as well and it's important to
take care of yourself
but it's hard which is like I love my
job so much that I could work all the
time I'm feeling a lot better just like
being back home in San Francisco in my
own bed and not having to live out of a
suitcase
thanks for huge difference you've got to
let your body set the rules the ways
it's going to you up your body
comes and you up hard yeah my body
 me up I'll tuck you soon and take
care of yourself I am the voice of
experience 26 years old now I might
still pee my pants occasionally when
I'll act really really hard but I do
take good care of myself
charming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
