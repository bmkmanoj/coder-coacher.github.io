moved into you
I'll show you back it's always a 2 year
old artist and it's just filled with us
art there's this huge garage door that
opens up it to a garden and there's a
workshop where I can build all of my
robots there's even this giant killer
bunny I'm pretty sure it's gonna eat me
in my sleep and my family and then it
might come and drag you down too and my
friend watch out cue the sentimental
music simone who's editing this yeah
that works
i realized last week that it was a year
ago since I published my first shitty
robot and I just wanted to share a
little bit what this experience has been
like for me and yeah this is a very
sincere video zero jokes so bear with me
let's go back a year to 2015 I was
living in San Francisco and I was
 miserable
I had this job that on paper was great
but I was bored out of my mind and I
just remember being like yeah maybe this
is what life is like maybe my
expectations were just too high but at
the same time I was like no I want this
to be what life is like I try to trace
back when was the last time I was really
excited about something and there were
two things that got me excited
one was building things for myself so I
was building things for work but I
realized that wasn't the same thing as
when it was something that I felt
ownership for and the second one was
making videos and I had this dream for a
long time that I wanted to make a kids
show about electronics and I was like
yeah maybe I should start taking that
idea seriously
so I hunted down this producer in a
Swedish TV channel and I was like hey I
really want to make a kids show about
electronics but they were super slow at
replying so I was like okay I'll just
film this pilot episode so like a test
episode and that was when I built the
toothbrush Shalini okay that's good
this is links trampled over bottom on me
it's more screwed back
so the hey bitch guests at my new Pinay
so most of my list the person here you
know cleaning I know let's say up on hat
scare buckling sternum
please see if that stomach stuff so I
sent it to them and they didn't reply so
I waited and then I waited a little bit
longer and they still didn't reply and I
was like hey at least I gave it a shot
because it's all picked apart right now
it looks really miserable this
toothbrush has been in so many people's
mouths I never tell them I still had
this toothbrush Elmen I was like what am
I supposed to do with it I'm I supposed
to just throw it away
but instead I filmed the 7 second clip
of it working and I posted it on YouTube
and I put a gif of it on Reddit and I
didn't think much of it but then I
checked in a couple of hours later and
it had gotten like half a million views
and I was like super cocky and proud of
myself and this ridiculous project and I
remember just being like okay This Is It
this is life peaking there's so many
times during this area that I thought
that like okay this is life peaking and
then it's just kept going motherboard
asked me if I wanted to build another
project and write an article for them
about it and that was when I made the
breakfast machine
it's actually kind of funny story
because I filmed the video of the
breakfast machine and I wrote the
article and once again they were super
slow replying and I was like really
anxious I just wanted to get it out
there so he even sent the editor a
potato there is this great online
service it's called potato parcel and
you can send people potatoes so
basically they write a message in the
address and a post stamp and they get a
potato they posted it and it caught like
5 million views within the first day and
I was like ok this is the pink this is
it at this point I decided to quit my
job in San Francisco and not because of
all the shitty robots but just because I
felt that it didn't get me excited so my
game plan was to cut down on all
external costs so I moved back to Sweden
I lived off of half a gigabyte of data a
month it just didn't add up for me
because I cherished my time more than
the salary and I would much rather live
off the less money than having to spend
a lot of time on something that I didn't
like I was planning on just doing some
freelance work and give some workshops
but at the same time have a lot of hours
every week that I could spend on things
that I was enthusiastic about and that
was where the wake of machine was born
that was the project where people
started being like Oh argue that girl
who built shitty robots and also when I
realized that like ok maybe this can be
more than just a hobby for me maybe I
can turn this into a job so I just kept
on building all these projects I made
the chopping machine lipstick robot the
applause machine the argue on the
internet robot a lot of things started
happening at this point I was giving
around 8 interviews a week I was at all
these different TV shows and people
started recognizing me in the streets
and I was starting to feel really
miserable yeah this winter I was not
feeling very great and I think that
there were a lot of reasons for it one
being that this whole internet person
thing feeds off of my worst character
traits
I mean narcissism lack of humility etc
and it's something I still think a lot
about is this turning me into a better
or a worse person fortunately my mom has
worked in this industry for a long time
I mean she's
been a TV host for almost 20 years and
I've been so lucky to just able to fall
back on her experience it's kind of a
funny story but I remember asking mom
about it and I was like how do you deal
with people wanting to take photos with
you and people giving you a lot of
praise or guys who would never otherwise
hit on you suddenly being super keen and
she said the funniest thing she was like
Simone in situations like that I just
picture myself having the world's
biggest boobs I was like what and she
was like yeah being a public person is
as vain as having huge tits and it makes
some people want to take photos with you
it makes some people want to sleep with
you but it doesn't actually say anything
about who you are I love my mom
the second reason I was feeling
miserable was just because the workload
was so high and it got to this point
where like every time I opened my inbox
I would start crying and in January I
got a panic attack looking back at it
it's such a ridiculous thing because it
was like the most normal situation I was
just sitting and having food alone at
the boat and just looking at my phone
and all these notifications are rolling
in and I just started like breathing
really heavily and I mean it's it's it's
a super scary thing when it happens I've
gotten two of them before in my life but
looking back at it it's just such a
ridiculous thing that I got like a panic
attack from notifications I've turned
off all notifications for my phone since
the day after I had a panic attack I
just went through my inbox and I looked
if there was anyone who could actually
help me out and I found this random
email from this guy named Luke who lived
in Australia who was a music manager and
on paper it just seems like a horrible
idea because if you get a manager as an
artist or as a talent you basically
marry them for work but I was in such a
tight spot I was like okay I just need
help today
and I read my diary from that period the
other day and it's
dear future Simone I just signed with
Luke Girgis if you hate me for making
this decision I'm really sorry
like I can't believe how lucky I got
because Luke is this amazing person and
ever since we started working together I
can feel my well-being having just like
and to be honest I don't think I've ever
been as happy as I am now
ah this is such a rant but I'm just like
having this as a job and being able to
work with the people I work with and
getting to do so many fun things it's
just such a privilege and I never
thought that it could be this great as I
said in the last video you are
definitely the enablers of my life and
all of the fun things I've gotten to do
are all because of you
and I yeah I am forever grateful for all
of you making this happen for me
yeah life is good
okay I feel that I've taken myself way
too seriously in this video making me
uncomfortable did I tell you that I
tried to refer to test as audience's
testes and that my producer had to
explain to me why we couldn't do that
okay that feels better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
