progressive weapon it's at challenges
its new challenges I'm I work for
Microsoft at on the edge team and also
on the Visual Studio code team and the
JavaScript engine and I came from
Mozilla where I used to work on Firefox
OS and where I also used to work on
general interoperability between
browsers and that's a big thing for all
the browser makers out there so today
instead of talking to you about
progressive Web Apps and showing you
here is in five minutes how you can
build a progressive web app if you
download my piece of software I'd rather
talk about what progressive web nowadays
means and what progressive Web Apps mean
to our market and why it is important
for all of us to consider what's going
on there I'm going to give another talk
today about machine learning as well
which is another topic that I'm very
very excited about about us using in our
day to day systems but this is one of
the most important things that I think
the web needs right now to survive in an
environment where things become much
more closed and much more controlled by
different parties that we don't want to
control things so unless you've been
living under a rock you probably have
been hearing about progressive web apps
and there's a big hype about it and I'm
sorry if that was offensive to people
who live under a rock I don't know that
might be but progressive Web Apps is the
cool new thing and everybody jumps on
that one every five years in our market
and I've been doing this for 20 years
something new comes around that
everybody needs to be like was dhtml
then it was ajax then it's like now it's
virtual Dom's and now it's progressive
web apps and the all of these things are
great ideas but we actually hyped them
far too fast and turned him into
something that people you don't
understand or people try to sell
products with that are not related to
the thing at all but put progressive web
apps on that there's also a tip when you
start writing books the editor will
always want you to put every single cool
word of the month in the title that's
why my book that I said liked that I
wanted to call no javascript
was actually called beginning Dom
scripting with HX and javascript or
something like that because they put
every word in it so the hype is strong
about these things but I think it's
important to understand what progressive
web apps nowadays mean
and what they don't mean now something
that is progressive to me is most of all
something that's future facing is
looking into solving upcoming problems
and our upcoming problems right now is
that the next users of our products are
not going to be us they're going to be
on a mobile device in a country that is
badly connected they're going to be an a
on a mobile device that might be limited
because governments like to shut down
things at the moment I'm I live in
England I just came over with my two
British SIM cards feeling very smug
because one of them has a worldwide data
traffic of course in Canada it doesn't
have data traffic so I pay six pound per
megabyte which seeing that the average
website is 2.2 megabyte that would mean
it's the same as getting a ticket to see
Logan in the cinema and I'd rather do
debt and look at some website that is
15k of content and 2.2 Meg of ads and
trackers and stuff I really didn't want
to see so progressive alter means that
is something that's not set in stone it
improves over time it's not a technology
set that like this is a way to do it and
it will not be there so when somebody
tells you right now a progressive web
app is this they might be right for
their environment for their for their
implementation but there are lots of
nuances on that anything that is not set
in stone that becomes better over time
can be a progressive web app there are
certain things that every progressive
web app needs to have but think about
them as a mixture of what we used to do
on the web and what we do in native
technologies and native applications
it's also not relying on an environment
so if somebody says like yeah cool we
got a PWA but you need to download
browser so-and-so they've done nothing
good they've done the same things that
Microsoft did with Internet Explorer 6
or it's an ex-pro of five for lots of
implementers did back then because that
was the coolest browser on the planet
and the only one to use and it should
really die in a fire this browser is not
there anymore and we shouldn't have to
support it anymore but people relied on
one browser to do it so any progressive
solution starts to me with the most most
basic use case and interface look at
Google you turn off JavaScript
JavaScript might not be available
because of some proxy reason in a hotel
or something it's still a search box
you can type something in there you hit
a submit button you get results back USD
end user get the functionality Google St
provider gets their business model
because they show ads on every search
result page that's how Google gets money
so everybody is happy if JavaScript it
has loaded and is fully available then
you get your autocomplete you get your
image displays and all the cool stuff
but the main use case has always been to
be there and this was a lot of people
forget when you talk about progressive
web webs they just build an empty shell
that without JavaScript doesn't do
anything at all and that's not an app
that's basically solving your problem on
behalf of the user it's improved
experience in advanced environments if
you have two new coolest chromium on an
Android device that supports the newest
coolest Android you get some great great
functionality in a PWA
if you have it on an Internet Explorer 9
or 11 you still have something you still
have an information flow you still have
something to do there might even be
offline functionality that is not
available con serviceworker is not
supported in that old browser but it's
up to you to implement that in other
ways with like local storage solutions
or firebase or whatever you want to use
and it's improved experience with
subsequent visits the more I get back to
the thing the better it gets the first
time I go there I get an immediate load
the second time it's actually offline
already and I don't need to do anything
extra with that I don't need to say like
ok I now need to pay 15 dollars to get
it to get it offline the more we
actually get access to people's
computers and mobile phones the more we
should give them in remote as a reward
that they came to our products and to a
degree the web has always been a
progressive environment it has always
been like that I loaded something and
then later on I had it on my machine and
did something a lot of times that was
just accidental but I remember the first
time I used some the internet was with a
56k or even a fax modem or something
like that and it cost me by the minute
like it does in Canada still as far as I
know all the data traffic here and I was
just surfing the web clicking quickly
around and then I was went offline and
then I went through the cache of the
browser to get all the images that I
loaded because it was it took too long
on my old computer to right-click and
save them this is what I did in the
first time and this is what
a lot of people on a 2g connection in a
in a country that has a positive GDP
still have to do Bruce Lawson from Excel
Prague gives a lot of talks lately about
he travels the world right now seeing
more connectivity's like in other
countries and what people are using very
insightful stuff we have forgotten
though that the web is a progressive
environment and we just expect everybody
to have the same environments and the
same functionality as we have and we
expect the web to be high fidelity
really cool why is that not a 4k
background image these kind of things we
just expect everybody to work like us
and we have to understand that as a
market we're an elite market we're like
not many people out there and we have
we're very very lucky I'm gonna come
back to doing my other talk every time I
go back on Christmas and see my family I
feel almost embarrassed about how well
we do in IT and how well I do although I
don't know what people listen to me
we're building on great hardware fast
connections this thing is nuts my
surface book is nuts I mean I've got so
many old computers at home that other
people would would basically give an arm
for so they can do something I'd all
desktop machine at home that I hadn't
started in ages and I bet when I moved
from my one phone flat to another I
turned it on the other day and it was
like Phoenix was there as the browser
that the pre Firefox browser this is how
old that thing was and I was like okay
what I'll do with it I can't recycle it
nobody on eBay is gonna pay money for it
I put it on gumtree in England and I got
a hundred 50 emails from people in
London great my son needs to do his
homework he doesn't have any place to
write something with word can I pick
that computer up I didn't think in
London that exists but it does we are
not the people that use the web and use
our products developer convenience and
fast turnaround trumps often end user
experience we get super excited about
making ourselves more effective and
faster and if the end user needs to have
JavaScript enabled if the end needs a
news and needs to have a certain mobile
phone that's their problem and I think
that's not really what we should be
doing considering that if we need to
grow outside of our own egg echo chamber
and grow in markets where we're not yet
so when the mobile factor became the
main use of the web the web showed its
issues out of a sudden the web was not
the thing
that people want to use first of all
it's a pain to type in a URL on a mobile
phone it's not fun to go from a website
to website by typing things in then most
interfaces were too small indeed there
are links were so close together that
with the fat finger you always click
both of them unreliable browser support
for accessing mobile hardware was a
really big issue like at the beginning
it was only iOS stuff was only Safari
then Firefox mid Firefox OS wrote a lot
of specifications did a lot of testing
and we got more and more access to the
hardware but at the beginning we just
could not compete because it was
impossible to take a picture from a
browser for example and of course the
biggest problem was it doesn't work
offline every time I talked about html5
applications to people they're like well
it needs to work offline so does and
most of them worked offline with
terrible solutions like app cache and
other things but we were able to write
HTML and that worked
offline already but it had that stigma
people were just seeing it like I'm not
online I cannot use the thing then it's
useless to me and a lot of times people
then use native apps that also need to
be online but they don't complain about
it because they had a splash screen that
they waited for 20 seconds to see
something it feels like a burden to
support all the possible environments
users have when I as an old man of the
web I always I know people use all kinds
of browsers that I cannot control that I
cannot tell people to use a certain
browser but as an engineer that just
comes in a market it feels weird to have
to think about environments that you
can't even duplicate that you don't even
know or never seen but that's what the
web is like so native apps promised to
solve all the issues that we've had they
told us like ok that's not the issue
offline works and it's great because
everybody has an iPhone and everybody
everybody wants to have your
applications and these kind of things
that's why we started in html5 to mimic
the native applications they told us
they work offline they give you access
to the hardware and they give you
control of what the user can do and all
of them came packaged all of them came
it like you have to go to a store you
have to download install the whole thing
and then you have access to the hardware
and you do cool stuff and that's what we
did with html5 applications so we
mimicked what native applications did
and I think that was a massive mistake
we and we didn't
understand that the technology of the
web is not meant to be installed it's
not meant to come from a source that is
not a link it's not meant to actually be
hard to upgrade and be upgraded in a
whole piecemeal fashion rather than bit
by bit
native invited if apps are a bespoke
solution for a closed environment and
that will always in the first run be
better than anybody else a tailored suit
for me is great for me but my brother
can't wear it and and I can't afford it
most of the time but it's great that you
work something is like look it works in
all the environment that I control well
duh you control everything if it doesn't
work then you would have really failed
if a web application looks different
from applicant from browser to browser
yes this is what it's meant to do this
is not a failure this is actually what
the web is meant to do things should not
look the same everywhere if you've done
that you made a mistake or you send a
JPEG out and hope that people don't
realize it's not interactive
it's native applications have their own
issues though the app revolution to me
is not something worth mimicking and at
all I've talked about that for a long
time we talked about it at TEDx
conferences and all kind of stuff and
now I'm gonna give you lots and lots of
numbers how apps native apps are
actually failing and what we need to do
to work around that issue native apps as
a form factor to me have failed and are
only kept alive by VC injections and
hype everybody needs to have an app like
everybody needed to have a flash tunnel
like everybody needed to have a content
management system like everybody needed
to have whatever it was before when we
send floppy disks out to people if you
look at the numbers though users spend
80% of their time using just 5 apps and
I can see that myself I'm using Gmail
for emails I'm using Facebook I'm using
Instagram cause my partner likes
Instagram and people are there and I'm
maybe use a game that I discard after 2
weeks because I think it's too hard and
then I basic use whatsapp to talk to my
team this is where I spend 80 percent of
my time and it's all things about that
of sending messages to each other that
are not like going through the one app
there's apps that I like using my my
expense app on the desktop is much much
easier than the expense website I used
to have but that's because it was a 2003
SharePoint website which is basically
cruelty to people to use 80% of users
who download an app fail
to become active users they try it and
then they basically discard it and let
it rot and get deleted I challenge all
of you to take your phone out and look
at all the apps and I have a wall we
honor it actually shows me which apps I
have used for a long time
I think the icons should start rusting
and falling apart when you don't use
them and then just vanish that'd be
great
after 1.5 million apps in the Google
Play Store only a few thousand sustained
meaningful traffic and that's not even
money that is meaningful traffic which
means probably the people have to pay
for that traffic so you have to get that
money in somehow that's why we get very
brutal in our advertising and in our
upselling like oh you're really bad at
the game pay $5 then you're better at
that game kind of thing 94% of app
revenue comes from 1% of the publishers
so here is your business model if you
say like I'm gonna be the app that
actually kills whatsapp good luck with
that it's like and the publishers are
Google Facebook this is where people
actually use their stuff how many times
do you use maps a day how many times to
use MapQuest com nobody ever anymore or
Nokia Maps or whatever what else was out
there 60% of the apps in the Google Play
app store have never been downloaded
that is amazing but then again if you
look at the app store and you look for
something and you find 600 apps that are
not the thing that you were looking for
it's not surprising my brother my
brother is a budding comic artist and I
bought him a tablet so I wanted to find
him a painting app the only one I found
was Autodesk
everything else was like paint this cat
paint his dog paint his elephant
something I can ride in five minutes in
HTML in canvas but no it was a native
app with 50 Meg and probably malware or
whatever was in there so the average
user downloads less than three apps per
month and half to your smartphone users
download zero apps per month because
we're busy in Facebook talking to other
people about politics or whatever we are
actually excited about sports users try
out a lot of apps but decide which ones
they want to stop using within the first
three to seven days so you got three
days to get people excited about your
app and how do you get people excited
about your app constant updates changes
in the interface cool new stuff coming
in how hard it is in a native app to
update it really hard because you have
to download the new verse
the whole time unless you have just an
iframe in there and you load some web
content which is insecure and not really
a good idea so the average app loses the
entire user base within a few month so
you got a few months to make as much
money as possible and then you have to
go again and get the next one
remember Angry Birds remember where's my
water remember all these apps that we
all needed to do for Pokemon goal is
really dipping now as well
we always got these hype things and then
they're gone really quickly native app
install friction blocks 74 percent of
your potential customers and that is the
biggest problem of native apps hey you
want my thing go to the App Store log in
give me your credit card details a pint
of blood and your firstborn download
these 250 mechs so you can actually see
a cat dancing on it on the screen and
hopefully you're on a fast connection so
it didn't it didn't take ages to do that
there's there's numbers of like was it
like thousand uses 226 are the one at
the end of it that went through all
these different steps and you lost a lot
of them in between and even the money
isn't what we've been promised like
everybody's like oh you got to make
money with a native app you can't make
money with the web I agree we're really
bad at making money with the web we bred
a whole generation of people think
everything is free on the web and if you
show ads I blocked them and wonder why
things get more cruel and brutal but if
you look at the number that comes from
that there's a pricing race to the
bottom $0.99 nobody has an app on the
only or hardly anybody has an app
successful on the Play Store that's like
$20.00 where it's like $20.00 for a CD
game back then or for a CD even we're
totally okay to pay that but everything
needs to be 99 P and then out of a
sudden becomes expensive the more we use
it login into the store with its own
rules and restrictions is another
problem your app might be taken away
from Apple and they have all the right
to do that because it's their stored if
it doesn't play by their rules
I remember Amnesty International had a
game where you simulated a sweatshop and
Apple didn't like that so you basically
took it off and Amnesty International
was like hey this is a important
political issue no revenue share with
the store OS provider so you use their
it their infrastructure and you pay
money for it so the money that doesn't
come in you actually have to share with
others as well so you have to get a lot
of information in there as always when
people's like Oh B
she funds a hundred million dollars
before I start writing an app and I'm
like that's stupid I mean I can do it
for $300 but then you see this is where
all the money goes updates are hard and
may be delayed by Store rules of
sometimes you have to wake two to two to
three weeks for your app to get update
it and that's not fun for the end user
so it's time to rethink the concept of
apps and a distribution outside of
stores and this is what progressive web
apps are actually about it's
frictionless installs and updates that's
what we want to have just click
something and it's already installed by
using it why did I download this to make
of your website to have to download it
again next time that functionality
should be on my device and the browser
cache is not reliable that's why we
needed caches that are controllable
small initial payload make the thing as
fast as possible because there may be
people on a bad connectivity connection
I just want to see where it's like and
then get the functionality later on form
factor supporting content and interfaces
don't give people links that look like
buttons and are desperate this big give
them fat things people have fat fingers
people are under on the go or on a plane
and need to interface with these things
offline flaky connects your support do
not trust connections they may tell you
I'm fast but then you have to go through
another system to log in and using the
power of the device we've got good
devices even the smallest devices have
ok storage like storage space is not
that expensive so use the cache use what
the device has don't ask people to
actually give your eglee allow your app
access to the camera just call to the
operating system and get the camera from
there just to an image upload that will
get people to use the camera app they
already using to take the picture rod
and you implementing another one so
progressive web apps solved these issues
by by changing by merging the best of
the web and the best of native
environments and it was weird after I
just to put native environments but
there are things that the web could not
do that native environments could do the
distribution model is the link and how
cool is that I can send you a link in
email I can send your links in messaging
I can send you a link in the in an M
will open them in a mail if you want to
until you can type in but you don't need
to actually log into a marketplace you
don't need to give your
information you don't need to have a
credit card I just came back from New
York where I work with the team that
brings kids from from from poor
neighborhoods into IT and most of them
can't even use something like Udacity
because it asks you for a credit card
even if the causes are free people don't
have credit cards so you need to get
somehow them to download your stuff the
technology stack is web standards that
progressed we're not as bad as we used
to be when the first iPhone came out
almost every browser now supports all
the things that you need to do on a
mobile device and on desktop you've got
wonderful things like drag and drop
you've got like camera access you've got
access to a biometric data even there's
so many good things look at the news web
standards out there and use them don't
wait for them to be perfect because they
will never because the web is
progressive the first step is to harden
your service by moving away from HTTP to
more secure protocols
that's a generally good idea I mean
Xfinity in America injects JavaScript
into any website if it's HTTP and that's
every user in America make your stuff
HTTPS then we can give you as browsers
more access to the hardware that you had
before the second step is providing an
app manifest that tells me your website
is not a website but it's actually an
app it's a very simple JSON file that
tells me like what's the name of your
app what are the icons what are the work
what are the things that it needs to
access what is the splash screen and so
on and so forth the app manifest
describes the document as an app it
defines the look and feel if it's
fullscreen colors the screen orientation
it gives you access to platform specific
functionality before it we know what you
think is an app we cannot allow our
website to access the camera or the
location or these kind of things because
it might be some injected thing from a
website that you just looked at on the
web standardized version of older
similar approaches there's been lots of
manifests there's been the Firefox OS
manifest Samsung had something Apple had
something everybody came up with a
manifest this is the w3c a proof one now
that everybody works together on the big
breakthrough those service worker
service worker intercepts fetch events
and responds with a cache so you have
more or less an HTTP proxy in JavaScript
so you can you can do everything with
big with the with the in with the age
ctp before it shows up on the side you
can convert images you can package
things you can use offline functionality
you can do everything that an HTTP
request can do but in JavaScript without
leaving the page and that's pretty
amazing because you do it in a different
thread than the main thread as well so
it doesn't even slow down your interface
you intercept push events as well you
intercept sync and periodic events that
allows you to update your application
that allows to keep you update your
application up to date without asking
the user to redownload the whole thing
it allows you for offline functionality
by having named caches and defining all
the things that you want to cache and by
purging the things that you don't want
to have cached anymore so your full
control over the cache that you didn't
have before in the browser and push
notifications which is the biggest thing
for your user re-engagement so rather
than having to go to the website the
application restart it load something
again I just get like hey you got five
new messages do you want to answer them
you don't even need to open the app you
can do it directly in a notification bar
of your device and background syncing
for updating the application itself push
notifications are the biggest thing when
it comes to engagement of users and
people will abuse this so we have to
make a very very empower stand as
developers not to build just push
notifications for the sake of it we
don't want them to be the new pop-ups so
the great things are happening here it's
Google Mozilla Microsoft Apple Samsung
all take part in this in bigger or
larger roles and the the benefit of that
for you is you can take what you built
on the web right now and you can turn it
into a PWA not immediately think about
redesigning and slimming it down before
you actually turn it into a PWA there's
a great opportunity for you but there is
there is a great outlook of what you
think and do the web's coming back
big-time and that's because native is
not you saw the numbers it's really not
and these were not run resourced these
were several resources people realize I
myself don't want to download new apps
all the time when I'm you get home and
wireless it says man 50 apps want to get
updated I never used them so I just
delete them by now time to brush up what
you haven't slim it down those two point
two Meg's are too much make sure that
the first thing loads fast and then
subsequently you can download things and
put them on the machine so the user will
never have to load them again it means
you will reach lots of new users
on badly connected devices without
locking them out and you make your
current products work more reliably for
everybody everybody who turned their
product into a PWA made their original
users much happier as well forbes.com
twitter is now a PWA the washington post
there's lots and lots of cases on on
google site that shows you what what
benefits are there this is proper web
technology you don't need to build a PWA
you can take part of your current
website and turn that into installable
PWA
that's what weather.com did weather.com
the international site is a PWA the
American one isn't yet because it's
right I don't know traditional old
website but lot lots of people there
poking at moving parts they didn't want
to change it completely but they tried
it with the European part they're very
successful so they're gonna move it to
the other one as well
search engines can find your solutions
and index them Bing started doing that
where we're scouring the web for web
manifests and then show them in the
results as apps not as normal web sites
and say like testing will work offline
if you click it here and you actually
use it and that's a pretty pretty
powerful thing to do and Google will do
that as well because they want to ingest
it into their marketplaces as with any
web technology a lot can be automated as
PWA builder comm if you want to take a
look at that and allows you to just give
a URL and it creates the manifest for
you so that way you can learn to get
started but read about it manifest
yourself it's not that hard to do don't
wait don't waste more time on
duplicating efforts in closed
environments I'm done with saying like
oh you're an Android you have to wait
for half a year to get this thing the
web is here I don't want to wait anymore
I'm happy to give you money if I can use
the thing but I don't want to buy
another $900 phone before I can actually
reach it so when there's a web for you
out there that that keeps you in control
as developers as publishers and now we
have the benefits of having the
functionality that we can access the
hardware that we can create really
really exciting app experiences that
have a link as to distribution model so
take a look at that and that's all I had
so thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
