spend the next hour or so talking about
some of the newer threats when it comes
to cybersecurity and how some of the
things in in this case in Windows 10 and
Windows Server 2016 can help you some of
them even out of the box so the first
part is just talking a bit about what's
going on and then seeing how some
technology out there in this particular
case windows can help you even by just
installing it some of the things I will
be talking about is stuff that's there
from the very beginning before you came
in I had this website open which is
essentially a website showing attempted
attacks on Norse equipment anyone hear
of Norse the fact that you didn't hear
of them just proves the point that this
is a very small provider security
provider and what you're seeing is less
than I think 1% of the actual attacks
going on at the same time so this is a
very small subset of what's going on
right now real time all over the world
there's another website I think Jason
showed screenshot of it earlier in his
keynote and it just shows live some of
the most common botnets and let me get
this started
botnets and ransomware that is causing
issues all over the world right now and
once again you can see that every dot
out there is a person who's probably
going to be really unhappy today when
they discover that they have W crypt on
their computer and they have to pay if
they want to get all their files back
every one of those dots so just it's
just something to give you an eye
eeeh of the scale of things going on all
over the world every day every minute or
every second so there's a bunch of stuff
going on and this is just a little taste
of what's of what's out there I'm sure a
lot of you have heard about the the
latest stuff going on in the industry
and just like Jason mentioned this is a
most welcomed wake-up call in the
industry it's not fun it's not
interesting it's not good to talk about
hey this is good that it happened
because there are some companies and
people out there that have really been
hurt by this but for once it started a
discussion and even that discussion is
all about just patching your systems
it's still a good discussion to have and
it's a it's a discussion you can have
with management who are not not
technical people when it comes to
security the security of your systems is
usually as strong as its weakest link if
you have a hundred servers the attackers
just have to target one if you have a
hundred websites the attackers just need
to target one you have to protect all of
them and if you're doing a poor job at
that you're sitting target there's some
changes though in the in the industry as
a fleet for instance more and more
companies have been targeted by these
kinds of attacks social engineering just
sending out an email to somebody an
email which appears to be from somebody
else that you know and they tell you
something that you probably are
interested in so you just double-click
an attachment and you get your computer
infected and it's as easy as that it's
all about the human nature our innate
curiosity our innate desire to find out
more about that weird event that you
just got
- and it's that easy to do all that and
it's because we're not prepared to do
that
to protect ourselves from that as one of
the things that we usually tend to do is
we tend to trust people before they
betray us somehow an attacker just has
to betray you once now you'll know that
he is a bad guy after you click his link
but that might be too late
even more so data theft is beginning to
turn into data manipulation no longer do
hackers come in and wipe all your data
and delete everything it may be more
damaging to you or to your company for
them to spend time inside your
infrastructure on your servers with
access to your database and change the
data there instead of deleting them
because that's much harder to trace it's
much harder to tell whether your
application you know the code you've
written the code you've written the
business logic you know that this
application does data processing it gets
the data through a web interface which
you then validate and process and make
sure it gets into the database after a
specific flow and you make sure that
only the people who are supposed to be
doing that are doing that and nobody
else so you need to be authenticated you
need to have a user so you put that data
in the database if tomorrow you or
somebody else in your company opens up
the same application and goes and read
something from the database the
application simply assumes usually
that's in most cases it simply assumes
that the data hasn't been changed since
it was last accessed or if it has been
changed it has only been done so through
your business logic you didn't have
someone connect to the server to the
database server directly go to the table
and change a value in a column somewhere
you're not assuming that something that
might happen and your application is
usually not built to treat these types
of situations however a hacker that
spends days or weeks or months inside
your infrastructure without you even
knowing can make all those changes more
than once can copy all your data more
than once
beyond that attackers are starting to
target consumer and IOT devices and if
you're not familiar you just you can
just search the internet about the Mirai
botnet which essentially took down most
of the Internet in autumn of last year
by attacking the dine DNS servers and it
was just I or T devices just webcams and
DVRs and things that are connected to
the internet it was also a matter of I
know fridge devices I've smart fridges
that were sending out spam your Smart TV
at home might be sending out spam were
attacking other servers even when it's
you believe it's turned off but it's
actually on standby and it's usually
connected to the Internet even while on
standby Reed Samson here anyone here
with a Samsung Smart TV at home there
you go you can read about some of the
happy thoughts they've put out into the
world with their security ransomware is
of course on the rise breaches are
getting more complicated and much harder
to detect and IDC made a study and they
estimate that about 70% of companies
will experience some form of cyber
attack by next year and what's even
worse and this is from Gartner up until
2020 at least 99% of the vulnerabilities
which will be used by the hackers to
attack you will be stuff that's already
known for at least a year by your IT
guys so they know about it or they
should know about it or it is known but
they just didn't bother reading about it
because it works
we haven't been hacked last year we
won't be hacked this year so it won't be
about zero days it won't be about new
stuff that just showed up it will be
about things that are out there and have
been out there for a while but you just
didn't bother
protecting yourself against that this is
why cyber risk insurance is now becoming
a thing getting insured against the risk
of being the target or the victim of a
cyber attack now last year was quite a
fun year for security and if you're
looking at this slide and you might not
be familiar with half or most of these
but they're usually just one quick
search away their vulnerabilities
they're companies that got hacked their
names of botnets and worms and attacks
and these are just some of them some of
them are really quite interesting and
they each have a an interesting story
behind them which we could spend
probably an hour on each at least but
it's just to give you an idea there's a
lot of stuff going on if you're not
up-to-date you don't know about these
things
there's little you can do to protect
yourself and when it comes to protecting
yourself when it comes to building a
system when it comes to building a
network when it comes to building an
application your choice is usually quite
easy there's a magic triangle with three
things it's secure usable and cheap but
you only get to pick two of these and
most companies go for the secure and use
for the sorry for the cheap and usable I
want things to just work and I want them
as cheap as possible and I want them
done today I don't care if they're
secure or not I want it to work more
more and more we're seeing companies
move towards the secure and usable so
even if it costs me more I'm now
beginning to understand the value of
security so I will pay you more I
understand that will it will take you
more to build a system and it will cost
me more but I see the value in it we're
still not there
and nearly nobody goes for the secure
and cheap right if you want something to
be secure if you want this laptop to be
secure you put it in a cubic metre of
conch
drop it to the bottom of the ocean can
you hack it it's a bit harder can you
use it though probably not now when it
comes to attacks of the industry average
shows that an attack occurs in pretty
much a similar fashion and it varies
from industry to industry but it's
around the same thing usually it takes
attackers a few days a few weeks or a
few hours to do their research to get
ready to attack you think they try and
find out more about you about your
company about what are your assets what
the server's you own are and where
they're located and what os's and
websites you're running on them and once
they find out all that stuff they launch
their attack and by the time they get to
you and from that time up until they get
full control over everything in your
network
it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours
so if they're they've done their
research right they hack you and then in
less than 48 hours usually they own your
entire network
again that's the industry average that's
not just one random case of an attack
now what's even more worrisome and again
this is industry average the attackers
spend 200 days or more than 200 days in
your network before you can discover
them before we even know you've been
hacked six to nine months that's the
industry average now think of it you're
here today at IT camp you might have
been hacked last Christmas and you don't
know about it yet you will find about it
probably sometimes next month or over
the summer when you're on holiday so yeh
and it will also take you and this is
not on the graph it will take you around
three months to clean your systems after
you've found your viewer attack and you
will only be able to clean your system
and protect yourself from that one type
of attack not from any other types of
attacks that are out there but this is
the the world we live in and it's a sad
truth let's say you do pen tests yeah we
we know about security we do pen tests
every year we do it twice a year what
does that mean that means we've got one
guy who comes in and talks about
security and you're convinced that he
can probably do a good job you let him
scan your servers do whatever his
hacking stuff and he does that for two
weeks or like about around ten days and
he does that twice a year so it's twenty
days where you've got somebody actually
looking into the security of your
systems and they don't know much about
them and they won't be able to find all
of the problems that you might have
that's not a guarantee ever during any
pen test compare that to the time an
attacker has to attack you to try and
attack you that's 24/7 and he might be
doing it from multiple other servers or
computers that he's hacked and he
doesn't even have to do much he just
checks every half-hour how many servers
he's hacked since then because he's
probably using automated tools to do
that another problem is the lack of
security professionals we have in the
industry cisco did a study three years
ago and back then they concluded that
right now in the IT industry there's a
lack of about 1 million security
professionals this means that if we had
1 million extra IT people doing security
we would be ok as far as security goes
but we don't have those people so yes
security is a very interesting area of
IT and people are starting to get more
and more into it and more and more
people are getting hired and get to work
in the industry because it's challenging
it's well-paid it's interesting
however it's not enough another study by
is e squared one year later they
actually analyzed the trend and they saw
that yes more and more people were
getting hired in the IT industry working
in security but it's not getting to the
point where it covers the actual need
because there's also a growing need so
what they're saying is and what they're
estimating is that by 2020 the gap will
be 1.5 million so we're not in a point
where we can say yeah but we got this IT
guy he's doing security will be safe no
we're not there and we need quite a few
people to to be around for us to
actually say hey we're sort of doing an
okay job on security how many here have
heard about GDP are all right so it's
it's good I mean it does it means that
I'm not talking to three people GDP are
is an interesting change in the European
legislation when it comes to data
privacy a lot of people and a lot of
companies don't know about it proven
point I only saw about five or six hands
raised here in their room however it is
coming there's nothing we can do about
it because it's it's a directive so it
doesn't have to be passed as law into
any of the European countries it will
just come into effect it's one year from
now actually and what this does is it
changes the way data privacy is handled
within the European Union and when it
comes to dealing with the private
information of European Union citizens
so you don't have to be a company from
within the EU to have to abide to this
if you gather any data gathered or
process any data from users within the
EU you will have to abide to this and
one of the interesting things
about this is that it transfers some of
the burden when it comes to the
responsibility of keeping stuff secure
and preventing data breaches it
transfers it to the companies and to the
data processing entities and how that
translates to to the directive is if
you're a company and you've been
collecting data from your customers and
from your users and you go through a
hack and you get hacked and that data
gets stolen and gets made public you
could be fined and you could be fined up
to 20 million dollars or if that's too
little you can be fined up to 4 percent
of your global annual turnover it's not
your profit it's your turnover so
whichever is greater of the two is the
fine that you're liable to get if the
hack is smaller then you're only liable
to up to ten so half of that now
consider the companies you work with or
four or you probably own would that be
something worth maybe looking into
avoiding that kind of a fine because you
will end up in that legislation one year
from now and this is the problem is that
most companies don't actually even know
about this the nice stuff for us as EU
citizens though is that it gives us more
rights along with it and there's three
of the major ones the right to be
forgotten
you could starting from next year you
should be able to ask any data
controller to erase all your data from
their system and they will have to
comply now imagine doing that with any
of the companies or entities you
interact with and doing it now and see
how easy it is for them to actually do
that and confirm and prove to you that
that's been done you have the right to
data portability which is something
similar to what happens now when you
want to change mobile phone carrier
you want to move your phone number from
one carrier to another you can move the
phone number but this means you could
also ask them hey Vodafone please I want
to move to Orange please send them all
my data on my behalf I don't want to
have to sign anything or do anything you
already have all my data please do that
on my behalf and they they should find
ways to do that they're not ready to do
it
they're not ready to do a lot of things
so they should find ways to do that and
you also have the right to object to
profiling more and more of the data
analysis is done via automated means
when you go to the bank and want to take
a loan you give them some information
like what's your salary and things like
that they put it all into a system and
they tell you we can give you the money
or we can't give you the money and it's
all automated this means you will be
able to go to them and to tell them hey
I don't want a computer to decide this I
want somebody a human to look over this
data and tell me that I can or can't
take that money and why so there's
things that that will will change where
do you or where do the companies tour
this kind of data that's gonna be
sensitive and that has to be protected
pretty much everywhere you see a bunch
of places where that gets put into and
it could be your CRM or your ERP or
emails attachments documents contracts
everything that contains any sort of
personally identifiable information is
the subject of this directive and it
doesn't have to be your name and address
it could be this is a male age 37 who
lives in that place and has drives a
blue BMW that's it if that piece of
information leads to identifying you for
five it's it's something that it
consists it is it is treated as
personally identifiable information so
if that information gets out there
you're liable to the fine
so how to prevent this how to what to do
to change this the best thing anyone
could do right now is to assume what's
called to take what's called the assumed
breach mindset we have to stop thinking
of ways of preventing us from being
attacked or hacked and we have to start
thinking hey what if we we've already
been hacked and we don't even know about
it and I've talked about this last year
and I've talked on a couple of topics
and I'll have a link at the very end to
my session from last year but the
problem is we're so thinking along the
lines of how can we prevent instead of
how can we detect that we've already
been hacked how can we tell that this is
already going on and has been going on
for weeks or months as the studies show
and those are studies made on thousands
of companies it's not like I've asked
three companies and they've all been
naive enough not to even take notice
that they've been hacked half a year ago
so the the security approach that's
suggested here and this comes from
Gartner is to do continuous monitoring
and analytics to look at all the stuff
going on in your infrastructure on your
websites everywhere and to both respond
predict prevent and detect so it means
you you have to try and prevent yes
that's the classic stuff that we've all
been trying to do over the years but you
also need to find ways to detect that
you have been hacked it's not enough
just to put up firewall somewhere and
yeah I'm safe now you have to be able to
respond to have an incident response
plan what happens when you get hacked
and you discover you've been hacked
because usually the incident response
plan in a lot of companies is panic
that's it that's the incident response
we've been hacked what do we do and then
based on all the data that you're
collecting you might want to start
predicting
future attacks and the cycle continues
it's an ongoing thing it's not like I
hey I've done my job I've secured my
systems I can go for half a year and
enjoy my time in the Sun in some remote
tropical island no it's something that
you might have to do on a daily basis if
you find out about some of the current
attacks one day later then you could
have it might be too late so let's see
how things in Windows 10 and Windows
Server 2016 can help and this is sort of
the more technical part when it comes to
Windows 10 now I'm not a huge fan of the
changes they made in the interface with
Windows 8 and then Windows 10 and things
like that but when I'm looking under the
shell behind the scenes that what
changes they made to the actual OS it's
quite impressive and a lot of these
things people don't even know about and
I can tell you that as far as Windows
goes Windows 10 is by far the most
secure OS that Microsoft put out there
is it the most secure OS ever or
compared to anything other than Windows
I don't know but as far as Windows goes
if you want to be safe Windows 10 is
your best bet and that's because they've
done a number of improvements in a la in
a lot of area of protecting is it yeah
okay of protecting your device
protecting your identity protecting the
data on your device and trying to resist
to attacks but one thing that they've
started to do in Windows 10 because all
of these were the classical approach the
pre breach are trying to prevent stuff
they're moving more into the post breach
approach how can you tell you've been
hacked and how can you respond as
quickly as possible and I've had like I
said I had a session last year going
in-depth on just those two things
defender advanced threat protection and
ata will briefly touch and I'm not going
to go into too much detail but I
I'd like to mention them so we're gonna
briefly touch on some of the points here
and just by looking at at the slide how
many of you are familiar with half of
the things on the slide great so it's
once again not a complete waste of time
I hope so let's let's go through some of
them GE and JIT when a hacker
say for instance sends out that magical
email and compromises Ben's account Ben
is just a regular user he works in
marketing or sales or whatever he clicks
an email and his computer gets infected
from his computer the hacker can then
compromise a lot of other users in the
system and he gets admin and then domain
admin access and that usually happens
because when it comes to managing
systems what Howard usually happens and
how many of you are system
administrators or know a system
administrator and know what they are
sort of doing besides just watching
their favorite shows all day and doing
nothing when you ask them to so what
happens is as a system administrator you
come into a company and you're given
sort of the keys to the kingdom but you
just get a smaller set of keys at first
like you don't get all the keys you just
get access to this system and that
system and that server and that website
and that database server and that's it
but at some point one day you say hey I
need to add a new DNS entry on the DNS
server sure here here's the user and
password for the DNS server you go in
add the entry you've done your job do
you forget or do you erase or do you
wipe out the credentials that you've got
usually not your user at that point gets
access to a new system and is not
revoked access to that system after
you've stopped doing whatever you had to
do so in time
months or years for after working with
that company you end up with a user that
has a lot of access to a lot of things
so if your user gets hacked it's bad
right it's you you give the attacker
access to a lot of other stuff that you
probably haven't even touched yourself
in months so what what the just in time
and just enough administration which is
what Gea Ange it comes from what they
try to do is to limit your ability as a
sysadmin in both capability and time so
how it works is it will and that's not
looking good but you get the point it
kind of squeezes the time you have to
access a bunch of resources what what it
essentially does is you end up with a
regular user account you're not a domain
admin you're just a regular user when
you need to do something an automated
system somewhere based on predefined
rules can tell whether you can have that
access or not and when and under what
conditions and from which workstations
and all that stuff so when you do have
to make a change temporarily your user
gets access to that resource for a
limited time you do your job and then
your user gets revoked those gets those
permissions revoked so you can't do it
anymore
unless you're again approved to do it
what this means is if the hacker does
get access into your system they won't
be able to do much because they just get
access to a regular user account they
don't get the domain admin account which
has access to everything this is what
Microsoft have been using in Azure for a
number of years and have made this
technology public and it's usually
managed through PowerShell and group
policies and things like that
they've made it public in Windows Server
2016 and Windows 10
another thing that
they put their is called credential
guard essentially on the first slide in
this in this section I showed how Ben's
account was compromised and they got
access to all the other accounts and
that's based on a Windows feature that's
been there for over 20 years and it's
vulnerable to an attack hold pass the
hash I actually did a demo I think three
years ago we've got all our sessions
recorded on the website so if any of you
are interested I can give you a link to
that session talking about pass the hash
and how you can essentially get another
users credentials simply because they're
using Windows because it's a Windows
feature now the only point where this
this feature has been fixed is in
Windows 10 no version of Windows up
until Windows 10 is fixed and they fixed
it through that credential guard and
we'll touch on that in a minute there's
other things like Inbox
as your multi-factor authentication so
you know about multi-factor
authentication there's a number of
websites and banks and stuff that
require you to log in using both your
username and password and a token of
sorts or they send you a message on your
mobile phone or something like that you
can easily integrate now within Windows
by just using Azure as the thing that
asks the user for these are for
something else other than just the
password and this is available in
Windows Server 2016
you do need to install Active Directory
Federation services and then enable this
policy and then you'll be able to just
tick it and start using it when it comes
to virtual machines what usually
happened in the past any compromised
host meant that the virtual machines
running on that house were no longer
safe
they weren't safe from internal actors
like sysadmin storage administrators
network administrators and they weren't
safe from anyone from the outside who
would gain the same level of access if
somebody had access to the storage they
essentially had acts
to all the virtual machines which are
saved on that storage so they could do
whatever they've Microsoft has added
stuff that helps prevent attacks and
helps companies protect themselves from
their own internal staff or rogue sis
admins it's you don't want to piss off
your sysadmin I'm sure everyone assumes
that they can cause probably the most
harm there was a regional a recent case
in the US where a guy was fired but
before they fired him they forgot to cut
off all his access so he still had VPN
access so he connected from home and
within three weeks he managed to cause
losses of over a million dollars to that
company now he wasn't really good at
hacking and doing all the bad stuff
because he was caught but at least he
had access and he could do those things
so what this technology does is it helps
protect you from either a compromised
sysadmin account or just dude that
really got tired of your and
wants to do you harm before he leaves
your company and what what what this
means and how it's done is through a
feature called shielded VMs it
essentially adds an extra security layer
over the virtualization side of things
and it encrypts the VM both the storage
and everything that's in memory and it
doesn't store the keys anywhere where
any of the settings can get to them so
you could essentially run your VMs with
a hosting provider but you can still
hold the keys yourself and never give
the keys to that hosting provider you
and only you can get those VMs to start
or allow somebody to start the VMS and
make a key change that allows somebody
to start up that VM and to decrypt it
and to have it running without being
able to read it and this is this is huge
because it allows a lot of different
scenarios and I'm assuming we'll
probably see this soon in things like as
ER as well but right now you can do this
on Prem you can do this with a hosted
service provider or just protecting
yourself is what is important here what
this means is essentially when it comes
to classic hyper-v VM in this case and
with a shielded VM when it comes to the
server administrator does he have if he
has access to the building perimeter to
the computer room and to the physical
machine does he also have access to the
VM usually yes does he need to probably
not he might need access but when it
comes to the storage administrator he
doesn't have access to the building
perimeter of the computer room and
that's good
but he does have access to the hyper-v
VM if it runs on the storage that he
manages he won't have access if you're
using shielded VMs what about your
network administrator he doesn't have
access to the physical building the data
center but he does have access to your
VM because that VM might be live
migrated over the wire or it might send
stuff in and out so it can tell what's
going on in there
more easily the backup operator the guys
handling your backups maybe they
shouldn't have access to any of the data
inside the VM maybe they should just do
backups if you want to keep yourself
safe
they usually have access to that data
the virtualization host administrator
it's the same with him or the VM
administrator and this is where the only
person that needs to have that access
will have that access usually the guy
the developer the sysadmin the the
person who wanted that VM in the first
place or is paying for that should have
access and does have access but there's
a number of other people that have
access to that and they shouldn't what
this salu
is trying to do is to just make that guy
the only guy with access to the VM
itself and to the data on the VM and how
this works it's a bit more technical it
does thing called attestation it
essentially looks at ways to validate
that the host the VM is running on is a
safe host now for legacy purposes this
just can just be done by just creating a
group in AD and putting all your servers
that are considered safe in there in
there and anything that runs there can
be protected but it's not really okay
because somebody with enough access can
change that group and can do a lot of
bad stuff the best way the recommended
way to do it is through TPM so you need
hardware you need TPM on servers and the
attestation has to happen through that
TPM and you have to have UEFI and secure
boot to validate that the machine has
not changed since you last booted it up
the physical machine that is so that you
know it's safe so that you know you can
put stuff on it and nobody has access to
it that they shouldn't have access to it
and usually all the slides if you look
all the slides have a bunch of links at
the bottom you'll be able to get the
slides and check them out for more
details if you want VSM virtual secure
mode is the thing that does among other
things the credential guard how they
fixed past the hash in Windows 10 is by
using virtualization as a means to
isolate in memory stuff pass the hash
means that the hacker gets local admin
access and can read the memory of the
system and usually that's where Windows
stores the password hashes you can get
the hashes and you can authenticate
yourself against other services using
those hashes you don't even need the
password some services just ask for the
hash if you get the hash you cannot
authenticate and they've so far failed
to prevent that from happening up until
Windows 10 Windows 10 is the only point
where they did manage to get that
working because they're essentially
isolating the LSI SS the local security
authentication service which is the part
of the service that keeps
all those hashes in memory it puts them
in a separate virtual machine a much
more lighter virtual machine that just
has the kernel and a bunch of processes
but the way virtualization works is you
think that if you have two VMs you can't
read the memory of a VM from another VM
right you'd expect that to happen
that's how virtualization works and this
is what they're basing their technology
on on the hypervisor that isolates this
and even if you've got local system
access here you still can't read the
passwords because they're not on the
same machine they're on a different
virtual machine however what Microsoft
doesn't tell you so they're they're
gonna tell you hey we fix this in
Windows 10 but their marketing people
won't tell you that it's only Windows 10
enterprise so Windows 10 Professional
doesn't allow you to do this yeah it's
one of the magical things that end up
happening in the marketing section
device guard and credential guard back
in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 r2
they introduced a thing called app
Locker this essentially allowed people
and companies to instead of using an
anti-virus to detect a huge list of
signatures and block whatever is on that
list the way antivirus is work is on a
blacklist approach you have a huge list
if it's on the list you're you don't let
it through if it's not on the list you
let it run that's why no there's no
antivirus out there that has a hundred
percent protection and detection rate so
to change that a different approach
would be to whitelist the apps you want
to run and everything that's not on the
list gets blocked now it does makes
things a bit harder because you have to
manage that list and any new version for
an application or for a service needs to
be added to the list so you need to find
ways to automate that however if you
have a list of just things that you
allow to run if it's if a malware is not
on the list because you'd be dumped to
put it on the list
it's not allowed to run
and that's what AppLocker did in the
beginning and it could identify
executables by publisher by a path by a
file hash Windows 10 comes and extends
that with device guard which now relies
on digital signatures so you need to
have all your binaries digitally signed
and every time a new binary runs it gets
validated against a remote service and
it tells it hey this is okay because the
signature is okay or if it's not signed
by something that you've pre-approved
it's not allowed to run and this will
block any malware yes it does require
some work from your sis admin guy but it
does work
and it's also hardware based so it runs
in the virtual secure mode this is also
a Windows 10 enterprise only feature and
you can get your apps into that circle
of trust by signing them against a
publicly available service from
Microsoft where you can have that done
on Prem you can build your own service
to sign stuff then again you have to
manage that as well and that's another
security issue if you want to do it
yourself
credential guard as I mentioned just
uses some of the virtual secure mode to
store things into a different VM and
isolate that from from the rest of the
the rest of the OS and that's where
Kerberos tickets and ntlm and credential
manager secrets are stored when it comes
to requirements for credential guard
you've got again a bunch of hardware
requirements and you can tell that it's
not made to work on really really old
hardware it usually works on on newer
Hardware only Windows hello is yet
another thing and there's another video
let me go back
passwords there we go some of our
employees were having a hard time with
them use both upper and lowercase
letters uppercase s lowercase T u P the
passwords must be at least nine
characters law include at least one
numerical digit and include special
characters oh yeah yeah I believe the
correct term is exceptional characters
Thanks
do not use words found in a dictionary
yeah like B I te do not use your name
or a family members name just don't one
character short
and finally passwords must change every
90 days yeah what if I forget julu G
capital s exclamation points new - we
were having a lot of problems with
passwords but with iris scan and
thumbprint login and devices with
enterprise-grade security even our
employees can handle that
yes Oh Windows hello and they've
actually since integrated the windows
Password side side in Windows hello
under the windows hello brand is
something they've introduced in in
Windows 10 and it essentially allows you
to replace or extend the password on a
Windows system with either fingerprint
iris scans or facial recognition and it
does multi-factor authentication it goes
even beyond that you can write your own
code to extend to things like phones or
wearables if you've got I don't know a
Fitness band or something that you wear
with you at all times when you're in
range of your device of your PC it can
be unlocked and only then it can be
unlocked if you don't have that device
along with your password or just that
device it won't get unlocked but it
makes a lot of things easier because it
helps get rid of the really complex
passwords and those passwords can get as
complex as they need because you don't
need to memorize them you just need to
have your iris with you or your
fingerprint with you or your phone or
whatever
another more obscure thing is the group
managed service accounts this build on
this builds on the standalone managed
service accounts essentially when you
install say a database server it asks
you who here has installed has ever
installed MS sequel for instance alright
and you know it asks you for service
principle and for the username or a set
of credentials to run the services under
now usually you create a new username
because it's somewhat safer or you just
use an existing domain admin because it
will just work but you usually create a
new one and you set the password to
never expire because you know from last
time when you didn't set that at some
point on a Saturday at 2:00 a.m. the
website stopped working because the
password expired and it wouldn't connect
to the website anymore so now you said
it not to expire now what does that mean
if an attacker wants to
that password if that password hasn't
expired in two years he's essentially
got two years to try and crack the
password not that good so what they did
was they introduced managed service
accounts at first they were standalone
it was an account that somehow magically
changed its own password every I know
several days or several weeks however
you want to set it with group managed
service accounts that's that gets
extended over multiple servers like in a
web server farm and you can have one
service account that runs all those all
the processes on a bunch of servers and
have the same account change its
password regularly without you having to
manage it because you have to change it
and then you have to quickly run on ten
servers and change it manually in iis
and do all the magic stuff it does that
automatically and it leverages the
microsoft key distribution service
within the ad domain and it can help a
lot with managing all these service
accounts that usually have their
passwords that not expire for months or
years you don't need the password you
generate a new password you reset the
the password for that account and you
can usually do it through command-line
ad it's through ad so you need ad
because that's what handles the password
distribution device health at a station
usually when you work with a device you
think that hey this device is safe
because it's my laptop I paid for it
it's my company so it's good but then
then that employee gets it and leaves
somewhere goes to a customer spend some
time in restaurants spends some times in
hotels in airports get some malware gets
back guess what that laptop has the same
access it had before and that could have
been infected in the mean time so it
just hey I want to access that file
share or that file or whatever and yeah
sure it's I know you you're that laptop
I've seen you last week and you were
okay back then you're still okay now
what device health
station helps is to try and Quarantine
machines and try to do what's called a
health at a station to make sure that
they're healthy that they're secure that
the patches are up-to-date that they
haven't been since infected with malware
and things like that before they get
granted access to resources and that's
also hardware based so you need newer
hardware for this
also there's Windows Information
protection this is a feature in Windows
Server that allows you to do data
classification and data leakage control
you can essentially tag personal and
corporate data and mark this as secret
this is confidential this as just
personal data I don't care it's pictures
of your cat I don't I don't need that
and you can control which apps can
access that corporate data and which
can't and how how you can connect over a
VPN and what app you can use to do that
it prevents user from just copying any
data into a public location hey you want
to copy this into an attachment sorry
I'm not gonna let you so it prevents
data leakage it's easier for you to
share that with customers share that
offer by just putting it into your
Dropbox folder and sending them a link
company policy doesn't allow that so if
you want to do that you won't be allowed
to get the file off a share and put it
anywhere else you can just access it
there and it helps it also helps ensure
that the data is inaccessible when the
device is in a lock state and it helps
do remote wipes on devices like laptops
and phones that usually have both
personal and company information
especially with companies that have a
BYOD bring your own disaster policy
right if you are using your personal
phone but because the company phone is
really a cheap one if you've got the
latest Samsung or the latest iPhone and
you want to use that the company allows
you to do that and you can check your
email from your nice shiny new phone now
if that phone gets stolen and I want to
protect my company data I should be able
to do a remote wipe and in most cases
doing the remote wipe on a stolen device
is usually the best thing to do but what
happens if that person just leaves the
company do I go to him and tell him hey
can you please delete all the emails and
all the documents you've ever accessed
or downloaded on your phone it's not
gonna go that well nor can I do a remote
why because I'm gonna delete his
precious cat photos with this I can do
selectively wipes I can just wipe the
company data off of his device and just
leave his personal data alone so it's a
really cool technology and there's a few
others that we really didn't have time
to touch but I still like to leave you a
list of them there's been a lot of
improvements in hardening the way memory
works the way storage works the way the
system boots and you might want to read
about a few of these because most of
them are enabled by default they're
there by default you don't even know
they're there but they're protecting you
from a bunch of other stuff that the
Windows 7 you so love doesn't right so
that's that's the difference here and
there's a bunch of other stuff as well
so it's they didn't all fit in one slide
so you can you can find out more about a
few of these the last two I've covered
extensively in my session from last year
so if you want to really look more in
depth into ways to detect and find out
stuff going on in real time I've had a
session at IIT camp last year on that
very topic and with that I am done I
will be around for questions but we will
close this here so if you want you can
you can come to me and ask me questions
because we're already a bit over time
and it's just 15 minutes to the next
session thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
