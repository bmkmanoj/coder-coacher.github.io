2011 or 2012 right so this excited
engineer came to me and said hey check
this out did you check out Weiss actions
on Android phone he said what is that
and he said well you can speak to the
phone and it does things like send text
messages you know call people so sure
let me give it a try
so I said call my brother of course that
didn't work because it didn't know who
my brother was so I said call certain
are amatriciana program that's his real
name and you can imagine how that went
between my accent and his long name it
failed and somewhat hilariously actually
now fast-forward six years or so it
works and so does you know play bad
romance by lady gaga
or does linden bookstore in Los Altos
open on a Sunday so what changed ai
actually more precisely the algorithms
that do speech recognition suddenly drop
the error rate that is how many times
they get this wrong down to the floor so
here's like a quick chart of how the
error rate dropped over the years right
and that's because of machine learning
and it's not just speech we started to
see that in computer vision that is you
you look at it you tell the computer to
look at a picture and say understand
what's in a picture and again through
machine learning now what's the core
inside when we say machine learning the
core inside is this right we're trying
to teach computers how to learn instead
of programming them with a whole bunch
of if-then-else rules so if you're
saying hey understand if there's a cat
in the picture instead of saying oh look
for four whiskers in this shape and this
color you just teach it to learn to pick
up on a cat pattern so how do you teach
it well you train it how do you train it
by showing it a whole bunch of examples
and then let the let the algorithm
figure out the patterns and of course
when you train it you want to test it to
make sure that it's trained well and
this machine learning progress is
starting to show up so if you look at
this timeline here's just a small subset
of products that are starting to imbed
this kind of power when you know when
you look at features that are building
so Google photos is a good example where
you can search for photos you can search
for sunsets or you know your kids
pictures and the search works because
you're able to understand the content of
the pictures Google assistant starts to
understand what you speak and tries to
answer your question because the speech
recognition system uses machine learning
nai Google Translate has existed for a
while but we recently replaced the old
if-then-else heuristic system with an
end-to-end learning system it's much
better significantly better and also
fewer lines of code so there's a lot of
progress lots of excitement and frankly
some hype too so I started thinking well
as a product person what does this all
mean for me and you who are building
products trying to build services solve
real problems for users and businesses
and there are a few ideas that I started
thinking of and I want to share some of
them in the next few minutes and
hopefully that sparked some interesting
ideas in you guys by the way this is
yeah this is interesting too so it's not
just in the product side one of the
things you start to see is that the
infrastructure powering these products
is also getting better so a lot of the
libraries that you need to build tools
but also just like down to the metal
like processors and chips that are
highly optimized for these machine
learning algorithms one thing I want to
pause and say you know for those of you
actually are working on products machine
learning is not new in fact many of the
systems you use probably use machine
learning like Google ad system you have
has used it for a while probably Netflix
recommendation system uses is - but I
think what is new is this three-for-one
right you have the algorithms that are
getting better because they're more and
more model or how the brain works then
you combine that with a lot more data
than ever before thanks to mobile to
train these algorithms on and then the
third thing is just Rock compute power
which just didn't exist even a decade
ago so this combination of algorithms
data and compute is war is starting to
show up these kinds of results for us so
here's a few big ideas
on how this will changes as product
builders first big idea I think one of
the things we'll start to see is the
computers adapting to humans versus the
other way around so what do I mean by
that so if you take how we interacted
with the PC at the mouse and the
keyboard here and the screen was here
it's kind of a disconnected dismembered
experience mobile made it a little bit
better you know you could directly
manipulate the screen and you saw it was
a more direct experience nothing will
start to see that pushed a little bit
more where you can naturally interact
with computing right now with speech
with language with conversations maybe
down the lane with gestures and so on so
let me unpack that and say okay what
does that mean for specific things that
happen with it right so one thing I
think we'll start to see is that because
you've made it easy for users to
interact with your products it reduces
friction they'll use it more right if
using your product is as easy as asking
a question chances are they'll ask it a
lot actually I can vouch for it so I
have an eight-year-old son who uses
Google home he uses it for many things
but there's one question he keeps asking
about 20 to 25 times a day can you guess
what the question is that to but okay
Google what time is it right now it's a
simple question but he's able to ask it
so many times because it's so easy to
get that answer so one way to think
about it as product builders they say
water you know access to your product
for existing users may become easy but
to extend that I think access to your
product for new users may also become
easy so if you look at it there are
users today your product doesn't reach
take a student in Brazil or this woman
in Indonesia right they're not
proficient in English likely and they're
definitely not proficient in these three
levels of settings and menus that we all
shove into your products so but then if
you can again like if they can interact
with computing in their own language and
ask questions like is the weather good
for fishing or what's the news yesterday
chances are it'll open up those kinds of
use cases so one way to keep in one
thing to keep in mind is who which
segment of users are my not able to
reach today
and does this open up those segments
it's all not rosy failures can be more
frustrating and I don't mean just
Cavalier fans I'm sorry for you too but
sorry had to say it but I do mean this
is this is interesting one of the things
I observe is that failures when you have
a very natural interaction with
computing tend to frustrate you more now
tools fail all the time right I mean
cars fail dishwashers break down but the
thing the problem I see is not just the
failure that it does the way the
failures happen is unpredictable and it
doesn't map to your mental model so let
me give you a concrete example let's say
you're texting a NBA bot right it knows
every single detail about every game
that's been played all the details about
the finals every detail about the game
five and then you ask you a simple
question where can I get a basketball
hoop for my son stumped right and it's
just incomprehensible for you that it's
an idiot and a genius at the same time
to take another example a lot of
companies including Google are looking
at visual search that is can you point
to something and understand what it is
take action on it so you point to a
plant or a flower and say it tells you
what it is so let's say you have an app
that knows again every single wine label
in the whole world and then you point it
at a beer bottle it doesn't know what it
is right forget even the brand it just
doesn't know that it's a beer bottle so
again that the the meant the gap between
what you think it can do and what it
does can frustrate you as a user but as
so product builders what do we do about
that there's a couple things that I
found useful one is of course I mean if
you can do it smooth the curve in terms
of what you can do right smooth the
curve in terms of the functionality that
you can offer or the intelligence under
the hood but when you can't do it at
least provide some guardrails so that
you can say here I give enough cues in
the product and say here are things that
we can do here are things that the
product cannot be used for and that can
reduce the frustration so big idea
number one is I think it'll make our
products easier to interact with idea
number two
one way to think about well where do I
apply AI in our products is to start
thinking what superpowers do we want to
give our users right where can we
actually make things 10x better or
cheaper or faster Sarah let me give you
a few examples
let's take photography so in a few years
ago if you wanted to take an amazing
picture get to buy expensive equipment
learn how to use it
lug it along to that perfect lighting
condition wait for it and then take that
picture right now what do you do you
pull the phone out of your pocket
pretty much and the big difference of
course to be clear there's a big there's
a big progress in hardware and sensors
on the phone and the processing on the
phone but also the smarts the machine
learning and computational photography
that allows you to just take a picture
and make it that much better
so one superpower you can start to think
of as saying other ways that I can make
beginners beginner users get advanced
skills without much effort another way
you can think about what superpower to
give your users is can you help them
discover or curate things at scale so to
give you an example take music right if
you want to discover a new song new
artists new album or make that perfect
mixtape for the perfect occasion it used
to take a lot of effort factor I don't
know if many of you remember this Jack
Black character in high fidelity right
you had to be that obsessed to get the
right playlists etc but now you see
products like Spotify and Google Play
Music and what they do is they apply
machine learning they build these
recommendation engines that look at what
music you've listened to in the past
what do people are like you listen
listen to the time of the day the mood
and then provide these curated playlists
without you having to sweat the details
that much right so that's one superpower
to think about are there ways that I can
help users discover things at scale now
superpowers when you think about it it's
not just for everyday users you can also
say for those of you working on products
that address experts you know
environmental engineers or doctors etc
one way to think about it is what are
some power tools that I can give exports
right so let me give you an example if
you take breast cancer right so the
thing one of the things to watch out for
inbred cat breast cancer is has it
spread to the adjacent lymph nodes so
today how that happens is you have a
pathologist they're looking at the
images the images of the biological
tissue and then they look for patterns
right they process the information and
look for patterns and now these images
are super dense right they're equivalent
of gigapixel photo and so you can see
that it's limited by how much of a
processing of information they can do so
research team at Google worked with
these doctors they built this machine
learning tool and it's trained on a
whole bunch of these kinds of images
that we know belong to normal normal
people and like you know folks who have
who file have the disease and so once
you have the tool what we realized is it
predicted the abnormal patterns at
eighty nine percent accuracy so imagine
giving that kind of a power tool to the
pathologist now who can then really
focus on these high-risk cases before
it's too late
so that's a way to think about how do
you augment the workflow of an expert
and suddenly increase their throughput a
lot more with AI in all of these
examples that we talked about the thing
to remember is these systems are only as
smart as the training that they go
through the data that you feed to the
systems and how they learn from it an
example would be the speech recognition
case I was talking about if it's trained
on just young male American accents
chances are it won't get mine right or
in a self-driving car you want to make
sure that it's trained on all weather
conditions all terrains like not just
don't desert highways but busy street
corner sets as well to be able to react
to a whole bunch of new situations so
that's the that was the idea to think
about what smarts under the hood can you
give your users but what about how we
are organized as a product team does AI
impact that and I think it does in a few
ways but the common underlying theme is
we don't necessarily only have to think
about building a product I think we'll
have to start thinking about how to
train products because once you put a
learning system in place you want to
kind of say how do you train this
product to get smarter over time and I
think it affects all roles in a product
team so let's take the engineers on our
teams now on one hand as I said machine
learning is about teaching computers to
learn so hopefully you won't have as
many lines of code like it all sorts of
phineus scenarios a whole bunch of
if-then-else rules a few lines of code
great but you will need new things to do
as an engineer for example you will need
to figure out what data set do I first
of all gather what data set do you feed
and do you train the algorithm on how do
you tweak and you tune these algorithms
to make the right result that's era so
it's a whole new set of skills that
today like we don't think of when you
think about programmers so one way I
think about it is you don't not just
require programmers you require trainers
now let's talk about product designers
right as most of you and myself included
when we think about designing products I
think about the flows right what does
what does the user see what screens do
they see what buttons do they tap on
etcetera and we'll continue to do a lot
of it but I think it will also need to
factor in what goals you are trying to
achieve here right so for example let's
say if you're a new site maybe your goal
is optimized for the time spent reading
so in that case you're going to train
the AI system to achieve that goal or if
you have video recommendation app you
may say well my goal is to optimize the
maximize the watch time the time spent
on my I on my side watching videos but
one thing to be careful is that the
system's are really good at achieving
these goals once you set them so if
you're a new side and you said hey I
want to optimize for clicks you'll
likely get clickbait so be careful about
like what goals we actually give these
systems so engineers product designers
have to start thinking about their roles
differently but I think the other thing
I want to call out is that there's a
role and an increasing role for domain
experts so one way I think about this is
as technology gets hard
Anto the products need to be vertical
it's a bit of a nuanced point but the
way I think about this is look if all
the technologies we talked about so far
a lot of the lot of it will be open
source the infrastructure is getting
open source the algorithms themselves
are domain independent that is they work
across different problem areas so if
you're a product team you have access to
these tools but so do all the
competitors so do I so does everybody
else in the market so how do you think
about how do you differentiate this
yourself in the market and a couple
things really become important one is
your differentiation comes from whether
you're picking the right problem to
solve
right and that comes from domain
expertise what is the most important
problem to be solved but also what data
do you need to be able to build those
systems to solve the problem let me give
you an example so let's say you're
looking at energy efficient cooling in
datacenters the most exciting things
actually it is for if you talk to the
data center engineers in Google it's
really exciting for them but but if you
look at that example right you can't do
it by just throwing a plug-and-play
algorithm you can have to say okay how
what is the actual metric that we want
to optimize for and then how what data
is important is it the temperature is it
the power is it the pump speeds is it
Trump's tweets right like you have to
figure out like what are the what is the
what are the pieces of data that
actually influence the learning system
which brings me to the next point if you
want to do all of that
instrumentation becomes key to be honest
I think today for our many office
building products it's an afterthought
right we all do some a/b testing we make
sure some key things are measured etc
but it's not baked into the system
ground-up and the reason this is
important in a learning-based in AI base
tool is that the system gets that much
better the more training data you can
have and the more you can set these
feedback loops so in the previous
example I gave you about the data
centers it's great you can figure out
that this data matters but the important
thing is you have to get that data which
means you have to put probably thousands
of sensors in the data center get all of
the data or scrub it feed it to the
algorithm etc same from
datian becomes key and this is something
often overlooked because we don't plan
for it in terms of engineering or data
resources ahead of time so it does
change AI will impact I think how we
organize ourselves as a product team so
so far we've talked about how products
can get easier to use how you can put a
lot more smarts under the hood and then
we change our roles as a product team
but that's all to do with existing
products so one question that comes up
is what new product ideas can be built
and often new product ideas come from
new capabilities what do I mean by that
so you take mobile for example and if
you think about it camera and location
are two big powerful capabilities like
taking it take something like a
ride-sharing app it just couldn't have
happened without location or snapchat
and Instagram or interesting only
because you have a camera in your phone
so one question that's interesting think
about is what are the snapchats and the
instagrams and the uber of the world in
this with this AI shift I'll tell you
what if I knew that I'd be working on it
but but I think one thing we can kind of
chew on is what are these core capably
similar to camera and location are there
some fundamental capabilities that AI
gives us and then we can start to say
what are some applications up in so
here's a few one one thing that AI base
systems do really well is classification
what does that mean it's taking things
and putting them in categories right
cats or dogs recipe videos or car racing
videos regular heartbeat or abnormal
heartbeat right so you can easily
imagine the applications where you can
use it for you know understanding or
searching things in Google photos or
just diagnostics etcetera so
classification is a core capability that
you can think of applications for
another core capability that you'll
start to see with these systems is
prediction that is you look at a whole
bunch of historical data and these
algorithms can start to predict next
steps or outcomes
here's a couple examples of how that can
be put to use on the left you see this
is a feature in Google Gmail it's called
Smart reply what it does and it's a
machine learning feature based feature
it looks at the current email and your
historical patterns in terms of how you
respond to emails and then comes up with
these three potential responses that the
user can then choose to use which is
pretty handy and I think one of the
things to be too modulating the UI here
is that if you're very confident maybe
you have one response for them to just
like auto complete - but you modulate
the confidence of the prediction by
giving more choices to the users here's
another example on the right you see
this is a feature in Google Maps and
what it does is lets say you're going to
a place you give normally you get the
directions but in addition you start to
see whether the parking is easy or
difficult in the place that you're going
- and again it's based on machine
learning and what it does is looks at
the historical patterns in terms of
location that is how do people drive in
around a place when the parking is easy
turns out it's very different from how
people drive around a place when the
parking is difficult you can imagine
intuitively you probably do a whole
bunch of circles around the place and so
you can look at the historical data and
predict some outcomes here another
capability to think about is
understanding that is understanding why
is text images etc so on the Left I mean
this is this is an obvious one a lot of
lot of us hear about wise assistants and
chat BOTS etc and we all know their
limitations but the promise is real the
potential is real that is if we can
understand in a natural way
what the user is trying to say or ask
for then it's much easier for the for
the system to be smarter the agents to
work and do things on your behalf
to give you a completely far-fetched
example in a very different field if you
start to understand imaging which you're
starting to do what if you could
understand the aerial imaging over a
farm right and say okay this area
clearly needs fertilizer sources not
today it's a very very manual and
cumbersome process and very error-prone
so understanding text
images again can start to lead to many
applications I think this one's
interesting it's very early
turns out machine learning is great for
analyzing existing data but we're
starting to see that it actually can
generate data as well so here is the
tool that a couple of researchers at
Google built and so what the tool does
is very simple it looks at a whole bunch
of drawings from real people like you
and me
imperfect it looks at how people draw
and then it starts to learn the pattern
of how to draw well almost right so I
took a screenshot of the tool whatever I
was playing with it so here on the left
side you'll see my masterpiece I started
drawing a cat with a circle and an eye
and on the right you see the variations
that the tool generated based on what I
just did and you'll start to see well it
has learned friend picked up the
patterns are all you know a cat has two
eyes
it has whiskers etcetera so you'll start
to see how this can be applied to maybe
Auto completing my drawing for example
right and I admit it's a really goofy
but fun tool I spent many hours playing
with it but I think it's actually a
pretty powerful idea to tie like pull
pull on it can lead to a few different
applications again it's early days but
one application you'll start to see
already is you know can you take
something that that you and I have
created and help it and augment it right
so you take a picture can you match it
up with a style of a van Gogh painting
and just make create I generate a new
picture for example the other example
the other way that you can use something
like this where the machine learning
system can generate data is to see if we
can teach ourself skills now the skill
can be as simple as how to draw
dragonfly or a cat for example that's
less interesting but what if you could
teach yourself skill so for example
you're playing a game of go you want to
get better at it what if you could see
the moves that are generated by alphago
which is the system that's the world's
best player and you could suddenly up
your own game I think that gets pretty
exciting so for instead of thinking
about our what a I can like automate or
replace you can start to say well how
can it help us up our game and teach our
skills which would be pretty promising
so machine learning and AI in the last
few years has been the topic of a lot of
wide-ranging discussions right
as someone jogged this is the only topic
that both Maureen Dowd and Stephen
Hawking are talking about at the same
time it happens very rarely but I think
one thing I've been thinking is for us
on the ground we are trying to build
products we're trying to solve real
problems we address consumers and
businesses like what does this mean how
does it how do we factor that in and I
think this is these are a few ways it'll
impact one is will start to see
computers adapt more to humans making
our products easier to work with another
way to think about how to apply AI would
be which parts of your product can you
throw in and inject some super powers
for your users but for doing that I do
think we have to organize ourselves
slightly differently as a product team
we'll have to have new skills as
training these algorithms new ways of
thinking not just flows think about the
goals etcetera and domain expertise
becomes really important but also it can
probably open up new opportunities in
terms of what new product ideas can be
jam on and think about using some of
these fundamental capabilities are here
to stay classification prediction
etcetera know before I go I want to
leave you with a simple thought exercise
so you guys have all heard about digital
natives right people who grew up with
computing and internet or mobile natives
people who grew up with the expectation
of oh you should be able to you know
carry your computing device everywhere
you go you should be able to touch and
interact with it here's one of them take
a look
so you saw what happened she had these
x-kid hazards expectations that you know
it she grew up with a touch response a
device like iPad and said why the hell
doesn't them doesn't the magazine work
that way and I think we'll start to see
our products being used by AI natives
will probably expect to interact very
easily and naturally with our products
and expect them to be very smart or
under the hood like this one here
you get the idea on that note thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
