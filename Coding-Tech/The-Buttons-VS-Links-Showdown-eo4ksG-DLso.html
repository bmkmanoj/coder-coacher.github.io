as the Internet will pit two HTML
elements against each other in a crusade
of veteran worse right and possibly
wrong one element is triggered with the
spacebar the other the enter key who
will win in this all-out free-for-all
between links versus buttons
it's the link for the bun showdown I'm
your hostess Marcy Sutton so what what
qualifies me to be a referee today well
I did emcee a conference once wearing a
Mexican wrestler mask
that's me with Rebecca Murphy at
Cascadia jeaious but seriously I am in
the business of helping developers
create more accessible user interfaces
I'm a product owner and an engineer for
axe core which is a free open-source
JavaScript library that you can pull
into your projects it's available on NPM
and on github you can also use our free
acts Chrome and Firefox extensions to
diagnose accessibility issues in your
visible markup I like X because it can
help you catch the low-hanging
accessibility bugs that we might
overlook every day like spelling an
attribute wrong or maybe we misused an
element so I highly recommend checking
that out so what brought me here to talk
about this time old battle between links
and buttons well as I've consultant I've
been tasked with auditing accessibility
code bases or auditing and code bases
for accessibility to figure out for a
given scenario which element is more
accessible and at one point I audited
the code base of a really large
education up education company it was an
angular app and I came across a snippet
that looked just like this it was an
anchor with an href with a hash symbol
tabindex of 0 and an ng-click because
this is an angular app now when I looked
at this they asked me should that be a
link or a button I'll ask you does that
look like a link or a button which one
should it be well before we answer that
question you obviously need more
information right it's kind of hard to
tell just by looking at
this one code snippet so before we
answer this question we're going to look
closer at these two fierce competitors
the link and the button here's a basic
anchor link you know the most basic one
that it makes me wish that our tool
chain was simpler like it used to be
where your anchors are linking to an
HTML resource now if I had a page on
wrestling on my own website it would
definitely include the video for the
most illegal move in the history of
wrestling this kind of fish move and
then they start they start breakdancing
after that and that's definitely more my
speed so that would be on my wrestling
page but anchor links are the backbone
of the world wide web they allowed us to
link documents together for the first
time and create a global network of
content and web applications Tim
berners-lee would agree that links are a
fundamental part of the web platform so
why am I having to reel this all the way
back to the basics like we know this
right well turns out sometimes with
JavaScript apps because you can code
things up using JavaScript you might be
kind of sidestepping these basics so I
want to talk about these features so
that we can get back to this idea of the
web platform and linking these resources
together so what are some
characteristics of links this most basic
fundamental element of the Internet
well they navigate to pages and they
navigate to fragments of pages so if you
have an href attribute you can either
send it off to another page or another
domain entirely you could put a fragment
where that fragment identifier will
match an ID of an element on the page
and actually jump you there so you can
use them for internal links as well as
remote links by default anchor links
cause if they're not fragments they will
cause a browser refresh and you might
end up using a prevent default in
JavaScript to prevent this behavior that
might be something more in line with a
deep link client of rendered application
where you're using JavaScript to
actually bring up different parts of
your application you can open things in
new windows using the tar
attribute and if you have been coding
for very long I think I started in 98
maybe and framesets we're kind of on
their way out so links historically have
had more uses than we actually make make
use of now but the target is still
pretty useful I use it to open things
and new windows in a link you can you
can control click on it and open it in a
new tab or a new window which is a
powerful feature that if you don't use a
link you can't make use of it and then
most importantly for a link it's a big
accessibility feature to be able to
reach a link with the tab key and then
to activate it you use the Enter key
that's how you would use this if you
were relying on a keyboard or a screen
reader and then you can also if you
hover or focus on to a link you can show
its URL in the status bar so that's a
nice thing for a user to be able to see
where link is going to go before you
actually go there that motto of don't
make me think was a big pivotal thing
for me in my career so how do you get
the most out of your links well the most
basic obviously you can just link to an
HTML resource there's this other variety
that you might see in the wild of an
anchor link with the tab index of 0 and
an on-click now if you see this the hair
on the back of your neck should stand up
because this is a code pet or a code
smell this is an anti-pattern so the
problem with this is that there's no
href anymore we're using tabindex to
make it focusable and then relying on a
javascript click event so we're really
not using this element to its full
potential
it is perfectly legitimate that you
might use javascript to layer on top of
this HRF behavior so this third
variation has an HR f it has a route
that is indicative of a client rendered
application and then it has this onclick
which is perfectly fine given that you
have this foundation of links in your
application in terms of screen reader
support and accessibility you would tab
onto a link and activate it with the
inner key anchors have an implicit Aria
role of
you don't have to bolt that on it just
comes for free it's a link link object
and it gets announced as link wrestling
that's why it matters to put descriptive
text into a link because if you had a
page full of link click here link click
here link click here if you were a
screen reader user that would be a very
hard interface to use so if you use more
descriptive text to say where the link
is going to go you'll do your users a
big favor and furthermore the href
attribute depending on a screen reader
settings it might actually announce the
URL to the user so it's pretty important
to make use of this element because of
all these benefits that you get from it
so those are the basics of links and now
buttons are going to jump into the ring
so the mighty button element I think it
doesn't get the respect it deserves the
button element has features built in
that make it a fierce competitor in the
element selection process this search
button in the bottom right corner
actually comes from the WWE website WWE
standing for world wrestling
extravaganza so what are some
characteristics of buttons what are
these features that we get for free from
this mighty button element while they
submit and reset forms surprise that's
what buttons were for if they're in a
button element you can change the type
and then it will either submit a form or
reset a form there are button and input
type button flavors the advantage of the
button element is that you can put
children in it you can style pseudo
before and after selectors you could be
you can nest elements inside of this
button so it does have that advantage
over the input which I've heard
described as a box of spiders so big
characters have buttons on why we reach
for this element is that it can trigger
UI changes with JavaScript so if you're
not informed land you're in more of an
interactive JavaScript heavy site if you
aren't navigating someone somewhere this
is a key distinction here between links
and buttons if you're not navigating but
you are relying on JavaScript a button
element is a good candidate for
to use a button from a keyboard or a
screen reader it is reachable with the
tab key and then the space key is what
will activate a button so the link is
enter button is space that's a subtle
distinction that we often just toss out
the window because we we can do whatever
we want with CSS and JavaScript but a
keyboard user who is relying on the
keyboard to navigate an interface if
they might not get this activated on the
first try
based on the way the element looks
buttons and screen readers like links
with a trips buttons are focusable by
default which is awesome we should use
that more except rather than having an
implicit roll of link the button has a
roll of surprise button so the button
would get announced as search button for
icon buttons so I have a wrestling link
here and a search button and I have
included the actual text in the button
the benefit of that is that if you have
an icon button that maybe your audience
isn't familiar with your iconography
they might have cognitive accessibility
like they might have a cognitive
disability when they're using your
application if you put the text in the
icon button it removes any ambiguity
about what it's for so I would encourage
you if possible to include text in your
icon buttons and the placement can move
around but at the very least if you have
an icon button and it doesn't have
visible text in it you should use some
kind of a text alternative like an
aria-label
or an off-screen span that way someone
in a screenreader even if it's an icon
button the text will be read aloud to
them so that's really important feature
of an icon button with button elements
here's some things that you get for free
focus ability that is a really big one
but I think people chuck the button
element out the window or maybe they
don't know it exists or something but
this is something that you don't have to
manage you don't have to manage tabindex
you can just keyboard tab onto this
element and it will do things it has
built-in semantics so it has that button
roll that gets exposed which is actually
an object
in the accessibility tree it comes with
keyboard support for click event
listeners and this is a really big one
if you're doing things with JavaScript
say you're trying to shoehorn a div into
being a button it looks like a button
but it's not focusable
so you add tabindex of 0 under this div
and then you bind a click event and you
find that the click event doesn't
actually fire from the keyboard because
it's a development in contrast the
button element it's already focusable
and it responds to click events so this
is actually less work for you you don't
have to bind a click and a key press or
a key down you can just fire a click and
it will work on a button so that's
pretty cool and it has support for
disabled you can put the disabled
attribute on a button and it will remove
it from the tab order and make it so
that it won't submit a form or it will
prevent it from doing things links don't
have that you could remove an HR F from
a link but it's not exactly disabled so
there's some subtle distinctions here
between what links are intended for and
what buttons were made for and I think
buttons I really think back to forms
that's where they originated we do their
functionality onto them with JavaScript
so they both have their places some
legitimate button uses so why would you
reach for a button you might have a
drop-down menu and maybe it triggers off
of one button so you could use something
like Aria has pop-up or a full menu
pattern to have this button be the
trigger for your menu you might trigger
a modal dialog and I have an asterisk
here because depending on how your modal
dialog is built if it's deep linked you
might want to use a link for that
because then if you don't have
JavaScript and you can actually serve up
the content in your modal dialog as a
static page then you can have some
backwards compatibility so a link might
be that might win the battle in that
case but there are plenty of modal
windows that are not deep links that
rely on JavaScript and in that case you
could use a button to trigger a modal
dialog more commonly you will put a
button element in a modal dialog to
close it or some sort of layer where the
user needs to get out of this thing so
if you
use a real button element than a
keyboard or screen reader user can tab
onto it they can hit the spacebar and
close this item and while we're on that
subject if you are going into that
pattern I would be sure to look up modal
dialogues just to see how focus
management would work so that you're
sending focus back and forth and since
the button is focusable it's a great
candidate for that because it can catch
focus and things and then lastly meteor
player controls are a good candidate for
buttons things like play pause rewind
fast-forward those are really reliant on
JavaScript so it's okay to use buttons
for that you probably wouldn't use links
for a media player so win to the button
so you might be going okay yeah yeah I
get it links buttons whatever but why is
this why am i here talking to you about
this well for some reason I hear this a
lot but divs are easier to style and my
colleague called Paul Adam had this
tweet the other day and it said this is
new and he had seen in the wild they did
with a type of button and if you squint
you might think well what's wrong with
that it's just a divot got this
attribute on it that type doesn't do
anything to a div it does a div doesn't
have behavior so I think the person who
had created this got a bit confused
about how these attributes should be
applied so this div is just still a div
it's not a type of button so if you find
yourself falling into this but divs
they're easier to style thing start here
here's some free CSS for you to start
with because I have heard that is a
common reason why people should reach
for the div element is that they don't
have to zero out all these Styles I
think you are all smart and capable and
I want to give you a little bit of a
jump start so here is a code pen it's
bitly slash button - CSS and it has some
common I mean it's really not a lot of
code to override the basic styles of a
button you can put a background color
and a border and a box shadow you could
change it from the ugly default font
that I have going on and then to make it
interactive for someone with a keyboard
you could put your button focus style
button:hover styles right next to each
other because often those two styles are
okay they're synonymous if you really
wanted to get fancy you could have
different states for every single one of
those but it's up to you so here's a
good place to start so whatever you do
in CSS let this be the thing that you
remember from this talk I want you to
avoid putting a blanket wildcard
outline:none on everything that's really
hard to walk back from that because
you're zeroing out focus for everyone
for every element this is a really
dangerous thing to put in your code even
if it was in a reset stylesheet or
something trying to remove it because
then you can selectively apply focus to
various patterns if you're experimenting
with focus I would encourage you to
check out CSS outline and the outline
offset so outline offset is really
useful if you're doing focus management
in a layout where perhaps you're sending
focus to one region of a layout and it's
seamless with all the elements around it
if you use outline offset you can inset
the focus ring so that it's contained
inside of the element that one's pretty
cool and you can apply custom focus
Styles with focus so this is a really
valuable tool to have so that if you're
trying to use a design system and you
want to supply your custom focus Styles
you can use custom focus on anything
that's focusable I will tell you that
the default outline is more predictable
the custom focus Styles can be a bit
hard to work with but I'll give you a
strategy a little bit later on for how
to try and make everyone happy because
it's sort of a balancing act with focus
Styles can you take the heat maybe you
need a more detailed set of instructions
like a cookbook nothing wrong with that
but getting back to an important feature
of links
how many JavaScript developers do we
have in the room how about front-end
maybe you're not at the JavaScript level
yet how about design how about QA do we
mean in QA folks yeah
how about project managers everyone
anybody else you can raise your hand so
we're going to get into a bit of
JavaScript here this is talking about
you know what routing and navigation
you know why you might choose a link for
example over a button so I have two
variations of links here in HTML the
first one is the basic one that we've
already seen linking to an HTML resource
the second one is indicative of a client
rendered application where JavaScript is
taking that URL fragment and then
figuring out what part of your
application to show at that given point
in time this third version of the anchor
link is the entire reason why I'm up
here talking to you right now when I
audited a codebase I found this example
and my job was to say should this be a
link or a button and I couldn't answer I
had to go digging it's got an href of
hash it's got this tab index of 0 which
is actually redundant because it's
already focusable with the href but then
it had this ng-click
of user Picard user clicked and I had to
go and start digging to figure out does
that actually navigate the user
somewhere so what is navigation even
like now that we're in these JavaScript
apps where we can make JavaScript you
bend it to our will and have it do
whatever we want we have to kind of step
back for a second and go what is this
feature of a web page when I think of
navigation the example that immediately
comes to mind for me is when I would do
a leak at bike races in Seattle and they
would give you a manifest on paper with
locations out of order and you had to
pick the correct order using your mind
and body to arrive there as fast as you
could and the first person usually first
man first woman for sixth gear first
out-of-towner they usually have fun
prizes but you have to do this bit of a
puzzle and it's on a city scale and so
that act of putting them in the right
order and figuring out the best way to
get there immediately made me think of
navigation but what about routing I
think of a mail room where letters are
being routed you're scanning the
addresses and then sending them off to
various places in the globe
it's similar to routing in a web
application where you provide an address
and the application will load up the
appropriate context so where does the
confusion happen like what where's this
following down well if I go back to my
confusing angular example when I was
asked to decide if it should be a linker
button as I mentioned I had to go
digging I had to go into multiple layers
of controllers my clues were this ng
click of user Pickers so I went and
found the user picker directive it was a
component written in typescript and it
still after looking at this layer of the
controller I still didn't know I don't
have an answer if the user clicked
method redirecting the user someplace
and to give a bit of backstory this
application was a lot of layers and it
wasn't always obvious whether you were
really navigating somewhere just because
there were so many it was a very intense
user interface I actually had to ask the
team I had to ask a developer should
this be a link or a button and he said
it should be a link because it does
navigate the user somewhere but so what
did I take away from that is a teamwork
tip it's really confusing to debug these
situations and if you have to have your
website or application audited for
accessibility they're going to fall into
the same cycle of trying to answer this
question and you might fall into this
cycle of answering this question so
remember that if you have if you have
other people working in your codebase
it's super confusing to try and
determine if something's really routing
if it's relying heavily on JavaScript
click events but more importantly and
this animated gifs is guys getting a
head smashed a little bit it's pretty
spectacular but more importantly than
the teamwork tip of making things less
confusing is that links and server-side
routing are a progressive enhancement
strategy so you can instead of having
JavaScript control everything you can
actually make things a bit more
backwards compatible and have this
backbone of links you could have a site
map you could change out the way that
your website or application is built
under the hood and still have this link
structure so it's valuable and I ask you
to consider this
persona from Joe Watkins he says I
turned JavaScript off because it ensures
my browsing experience does not have too
much animation I'm a peptic I have low
vision and I'm very sensitive to
animation and flashing I'm also a
keyboard user and a mouse user because
of this I turn down the brightness on my
screen I have difficulty getting around
a site when they don't have focus dates
now I never expected to be in the know
JavaScript camp and I think it is a
decision that isn't going to work for
every single application or website but
there's little steps that we can take to
expose our web applications to people
who maybe do turn javascript off using
server-side rendering and isomorphic
JavaScript applications one example I
like a lot is a react router and Ryan
Florence this last week in a tweet he
said that he's had some arguments with
people because they react router link to
component here only renders two anchor
elements and people really wanted to
change that behavior but he cares a lot
about accessibility and so I love that
react router like they've made this a
standard for how you use their router
and that's something to be proud of
because that as a framework consumer
that means that they're removing that
confusion for you you just use their
router and that's how it works
it creates links with HF one more
example of a more traditional looking
JavaScript router is from Flatiron they
have this isomorphic router called
director that I found that's pretty cool
you can use it to render your
client-side routes with JavaScript and
then they have a node.js flavor of it I
guess that you can render the same
routes on the server so that might be a
good strategy to try and get that first
server-side render for someone like our
persona how he said he turned JavaScript
off you might not support every screen
or every feature of your application but
at least the the high stakes things and
the the really valuable first landing
pages that you want to give someone
something you could use an isomorphic
router like this one so really what I
want you to think about after this talk
is that it's all about choosing the
right element for the job or the best
element for the job sometimes it won't
be an easy decision to make you're
really trying to use these elements to
their full potential and make use of the
web platform because the the features of
both of these are inherently webby and
if we just use JavaScript on a div or a
list item we're bypassing all the
features that we could be using in these
elements it's really about craftsmanship
so taking pride in your craft and doing
the most informed job that you can like
these gentlemen who are working on
boxing title belts a lot of the
important work is done behind the scenes
to make a quality product that laughs
and having a good link structure is a
good way to make something survive past
your current application stack because
it's really a team effort as I'll talk
about in a minute design and development
are both responsible for the end product
so if you're more on the UX side of
things this is where we're going to talk
about how user experience and web
accessibility go together in this
decision-making process four elements I
want you to consider how a user might
interact with your application they
might be using a keyboard a touch device
their mouse or even their voice and so I
want you to sink past the way that
something looks and how it actually
functions so when a user interacts with
a web page Google Drive for example this
is more of an application it definitely
relies on JavaScript and that's okay
but if we look at this interface can you
guess which elements are links and
buttons it's a little hard to tell this
is a very client heavy application so
the shared with me link in the sidebar
it's actually not a link it's not coded
as either of those but when you click on
it it redirects you the URL changes so
it's navigating but they haven't used
either of those for this case but it
really should be a link because when you
hover focus on it it would show you the
link in the status bar which that's a
nice feature of the user you might not
click on it if you can't see where it
goes so if you're being a or if you're
developing a JavaScript application
that might be a good thing to reconsider
if you're developing it like this guy
here's another scenario a bank customer
who is blind calls tech support the tech
guys in through the interface saying
click on the phone button
except it's coded as a link which we can
see here in the developer tools the
little icon button looks like a button
but it's actually coded as a link and
then it has this href of JavaScript and
it has a tab index of 0 for some reason
and so if you were the tech support
trying to guide a blinded user through
an interface this would fall down
whereas if it was a button and they said
click the phone button it's like should
should tech support and share your users
know that intimately how something is
made or they should they just be able to
use it well my hope is that by thinking
about this you'll apply this to your
element decisions like when you're
making these decisions of which element
should I use think about you know what
is the function of it is it actually
navigating you somewhere or is it just
toggling things in an interface here's
one more example from github so they
have some interface buttons that all fit
seamlessly next to each other if we zero
in on this row over here the create new
file upload files find file and then the
little clone or download drop-down menu
thing are these links or buttons kind of
hard to tell because they're all
seamless and CSS makes it look like
they're all buttons but if we open the
developer tools you can see that it's a
mix of buttons and anchors so the button
is actually inside of a form so it's
making use of that form behavior but the
links next to it are not buttons so from
a user perspective although it was very
convenient to design these all next to
each other this is really separating the
design from the function and so I
encourage you to think harder about that
as a design person if there's any way to
you know group links together and group
buttons together so that they can retain
their original style in some way it
makes it a little less confusing to use
from a keyboard perspective because the
button will be activated with the space
and the link with the Enter key so if
you're having these seamless
interactions the keyboard experience
isn't quite as seamless as you would
expect so what do you do about this this
is like we have to make these decisions
all the time so how can how can design
set this up for success discuss your all
changes in your design reviews like if
you're handing off multiple screens talk
with your development team or whoever
you're handing it off to if you can
about how something will actually
navigate like is this a link or is this
a button it's okay to have those
conversations so that you know that
you're designing something with the way
it should be the function of it you can
weigh the design and the utility of
these elements so that you're trying to
get the most out of them and make it the
least confusing you can to users
this might be an unpopular thing to say
but I think that link should look like
links and buttons should look like
buttons and I know I'm going to get a
lot of disagreement about that because
we have CSS to smooth things over and
JavaScript to smooth things over but I
encourage you to really think hard about
that and if you still end up making your
links look like buttons have good
reasons when you're handing off your
designs and this sort of goes beyond the
scope of just links and buttons it's
really helpful when you're handing
things off to annotate semantics so that
you're not leaving so much of these
decisions just up to chance a developer
just went oh okay I'm just going to pick
a div because no one told me that this
should work a certain way it's something
is supposed to be a link you should
annotate that that can be really useful
for compound widgets like in Nathan's
talk he had a big screen of patterns if
you had something like a tab switcher
you could actually indicate that this
should be a tab panel and you can
indicate some of those semantics in your
wireframes and you can annotate
interaction modes so if you have
something that's supposed to be
focusable so that it doesn't get
forgotten in the development phase you
can you know look out for your fellow
developers and helping make things more
accessible just by indicating that
something is focusable and what it will
look like because often when wireframes
get handed off
they have hover states and active and
maybe disabled but they probably don't
have focus so that's a really important
takeaway too if you're designing
interactive you know user interfaces
consider how something would be usable
from the keyboard and then indicate that
in your wireframes
or your designs you're probably thinking
okay great that's easier to do when you
have this you know blue sky freedom to
recreate something from scratch but what
if you're in a legacy site designs get
entrenched and you might not have that
luxury of going back to fix all these
old patterns so in that case I've been
there before in my career I would use
you know refreshes and incremental agile
stories to make improvements as you go
along as you said in the last talk
you're not going to be able to overhaul
everything at once so if you use CSS
classes you can ease that transition a
little bit to get the proper code
committed and then you can apply it as
you touch different parts of the code
base and I think if you have a really
entrenched style guide maybe it's worth
a revision if focus styles weren't on
there and you realize it at some point
maybe it's worth it to go back and do a
revision so that you can then go and add
those it's never too late to make it
more accessible but maybe the thought of
going back to fix all that stuff your
face looks like this now girls like
grimacing and making her face because
this is not easy to do and these aren't
easy decisions you know I try to make it
sound exciting but you this might be you
right now that's ok what I want you to
think about is just making more educated
decisions more informed decisions about
what these elements do and how you make
those choices because I'm still learning
things about elements all the time and
you can help your teammates by as I
mentioned with the routing examples it
makes it less confusing if you're using
them the way they were intended so I
mentioned earlier that focus and outline
can be sort of tricky to make everyone
happy and I have this video that I'm
going to show of showing why that can be
sort of challenging so I have some
clicking on element
they're some of them are custom elements
some of them are links and buttons so
first I go through Chrome now I'm using
the keyboard to tab onto them and then I
switch over to Firefox so you can see
Firefox when you click it does not
persist that Focus style except on the
divs there's one that's a div or a
custom element now if we now this is the
keys keyboard focus for all of these so
the difference is on elements across
browsers you want and it kind of makes
sense to me why people end up hiding the
focus style for everyone even though
it's useful it's because everyone hates
these default styles and these
differences cross browser can be really
challenging the one that I really want
to key into is right now I've clicked on
a div and that Focus style is persistent
that is a very difficult thing to work
around when you're trying to create web
components or even custom controls when
you click on a button or link that focus
does not stay like that and so I've
written about this pretty extensively an
article called button focus health
because that's what it felt like at the
time but how do you mitigate this like
what are we how can we address this
moving forward well there's a tool that
I've started to use that I think is
definitely worth recommending it's
called what input and it's a really
small JavaScript library that you can
pull into your HTML file you can also
require it if you have a JavaScript
application or pull it in some other way
but then what it will do is give you the
CSS hooks so that you can style
depending on the user's input so you can
have your default focus style so that if
JavaScript doesn't load you're not
zeroing out focus for everyone you can
then you get these data attribute
selectors with values of mouse keyboard
touch and you can be more selective
about how you apply focus instead of
just killing it for everybody you can
apply really elegant focus styles and
this moves over this problem of how when
you're clicking versus the keyboard
there's some differences there and so I
really like this solution to try and
address this from the web standard side
of things I have a few friends who are
are very motivated developers and they
have crafted a problem statement a
prototype really even into this proposal
for a new level for CSS selector of the
focus ring pseudo-class now this is
really useful because it helps us solve
this problem of these differences with
focus and how this perceived bug but
being persistent when you click well to
try and fix this from the standards
level that's where focus ring comes in
so if you want to learn more about focus
ring Rob Dodson just did a really great
ally cast on this so I would recommend
checking that out just to sort of set
the scene of what this problem is and
why they made a focus ring he walked
through the the polyfill that they're
using which is a bit of a requirement
for now it's a new feature yes we have
to load a polyfill with JavaScript so
that we can try and move this forward
but it's a good time to provide feedback
if you have you know better way that you
think this could be done now is the time
so we'd love to hear your input if you
have ideas on how focus ring should work
or even if we can go back and fix the
original focus that would be cool too
but I think I'll tell you in a minute
why I think this is a good approach so
to use focus ring once you have that
polyfill included and you can go and
find the polyfill on github comm /wi CG
focus ring or slash focus ring and
that's the web incubator community group
so when you have this polyfill installed
you then are able to use this focus ring
pseudo-class and you can style it so
that it's there for keyboard users but
not there for Mouse users necessarily
and the trick that we've been kind of
playing around with with this polyfill
is that you don't just zero out outline
for everyone if you wait until this
polyfill is loaded then you can zero it
out and you're providing focus ring
instead so that's an interesting way to
handle it it has been pointed out
however that there are some Mouse users
who might like that focus style to
persist the problem as you saw in the
video is that it's not standard at all
it's all over the map depends on the
element it depends on the browser and so
those differences are what we're trying
to smooth out here ideally we could let
our users decide in Android there's a
setting for force enable
zooom so we want something like that but
for focus so that if a user does need
that focus tile to persist on click they
could go set it in their browser so the
user agent with something like focus
ring we might get another crack at this
so that we can actually expose a setting
like this so that's really a promising
thing to pursue from the web standard
side so to be honest the struggle is
going to continue this is not the end of
it there's lots of things pieces on
links versus buttons this is sort of a
time old challenge but instead of
battling each other I want to encourage
you to really read up on the elements
that you're using so that you know how
to use them to their full potential so
we can try and make more educated
decisions that benefit our users or our
final smackdowns because oh yeah we are
having a smackdown here's some takeaways
that you should consider
now that you've sat through my opinions
about links versus buttons use links for
navigation even though JavaScript can
technically make routing happen on any
element from a click event divs are not
focusable they don't have a link role by
default if you use links you can use
this built-in webby feature to navigate
people around you can utilize buttons
for toggling and submitting things those
are great elements for that trying to
echo the function with the visual style
so really push back if links look like
buttons maybe it's worth reconsidering
that they should look like links and
preserve the focus styles for keyboard
users this is really critical for
someone with a disability who relies on
a keyboard less so with the screen
reader because the screen reader will
possibly have an outline or it's at
least announcing things but it is very
important to preserve those focus styles
because it can be a lifeline to someone
with a disability on the web and really
it's just about making the most informed
choice as you can sometimes there's
there's trade-offs and we it's not
always an easy decision
so it's maybe a bit more gentle approach
is required but we want to make the most
informed choice as we can move
and forward so who wins this battle
we're all winners by promoting
craftsmanship in the design and
development process
choosing the right HTML element means
analyzing what features it can provide
and utilizing them to their full
potential rather than reinventing the
wheel with JavaScript because that is
tempting sometimes
so using routing with links for example
is a useful signifier to your teammates
reading through the codebase and it has
an impact on users with disabilities who
rely on keyboards and screen readers to
navigate the web so that's about as many
opinions that I can fit on links buttons
routing and navigation and JavaScript
into a 40-minute conference talk if you
have any questions that I didn't answer
maybe there's something like glaring
that you you want to talk about maybe I
didn't cover I would love to hear from
you on Twitter
I'm Marcy Sutton you can also find me on
github and Instagram if you're so
inclined thanks a lot to the smashing
comp team for having me it's been really
cool to get to come and talk to you
about links and buttons and an extra
special thanks to Sarah Dresner for
helping me with this awesome link and
button graphic so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
