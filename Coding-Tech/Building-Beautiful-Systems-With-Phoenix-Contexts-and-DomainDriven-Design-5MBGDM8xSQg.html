programmer at carbon 5 carbon 5 is a
software development consultancy we're a
friendly group of people that love to
work with you on your software systems
no matter how big or how small and I'm
going to bring together two self-evident
points this is an audience that's gonna
get it maintaining large systems is
really really difficult when systems get
to a certain size they just tend to be
difficult to work in you can't keep
everything in your head at once
additionally complex systems aren't
intentionally messy they're not
difficult to work with because we made
them that way for the most part I mean
no one's out there like writing code and
saying oh just wait till wall-e sees
this turret I leave in the code no for
the most part we're just accidentally
adding complexity to the system because
we got to ship things dr. Dre says we
got to build the business we got to make
some money we've got to secure our next
round of funding
otherwise we don't have jobs and
eventually you keep doing this enough
and enough and enough your system starts
to fall over when your system grows to
maybe 10 or 20 times its intended size
oops we should have refactored maybe
three years ago the system starts to
fall over and people get really sad and
a lot of the tools we have to deal with
this come from modularization systems of
abstraction well I turned and did some
looking into the body of work that's
been done into abstraction Dave Parnas
in the 70s wrote this paper while he was
at Carnegie Mellon called on the
criteria to be used in decomposing
systems into modules and in this text
I'm just gonna pull out the core
takeaway he says that there is a list of
difficult design decisions that every
module must then hide from the rest of
the world design decisions that are
likely to change should be hidden and
this thought this work eventually became
what are
what we consider the modern concepts of
high cohesion and low coupling let's go
through this high cohesion is the idea
that similar concepts in your code
belong together
they're localized at the same part of
the code base if one changes because
they're so related the others tend to
change as well and they also they all
tend to live together in the same part
of the code the idea of loose coupling
is that your code doesn't necessarily
need to know that much about the rest of
the world and vice versa you don't have
that many dependencies to other systems
to other api's or to other modules today
what we're gonna do is we're gonna look
at Phoenix context we're gonna
understand this tool that the core team
has given us to modularize and control
the complexity in our systems then we're
gonna turn to kind of the time-tested
wisdom of domain driven design and we're
gonna look at it through a exercise
called context mapping and finally we're
gonna get to the code so you're ready
let's get to it well in Phoenix 1.3 the
core team released an idea of a context
Sonne over here is at the core team
thank you very much I'm sure there's
somebody up else here that I may have
missed and contexts are simply elixir
modules they group system functionality
together by business domains but there's
nothing magical about them they're just
modules so let's take a look at a
scaffold when we run the scaffolding
command we'll be able to see what
happens on the other side and maybe from
there we're gonna learn a little bit
about the purpose and and the goals of
these contexts so let's start I'm gonna
create a user and I'm gonna put it into
a context called identity so here we go
we type it out identity then we talk
about the name of the resource to call
users followed by the name of the schema
the table name as well as descriptors
for the columns and when I hit enter
here's what comes out on the other side
first we get a schema that's generated
nothing here should be really surprising
to you the only thing interesting here
is that the user is nested in the
entity module second of all we get a
module file a context file in this
context module becomes our public
interface to the rest of the world now
everyone else that wants to create one
of these users it's gonna have a car
it's gonna call through one of these
crud actions into this module third
we're gonna get a Phoenix controller and
the interesting thing here is that the
controller lives in a different context
it lives in the web context and if you
look at the controller all it does is
delegate it calls through to the context
it doesn't need to know about
persistence it doesn't need to know
about ecto doesn't need to about know
about anything under the hood that
design decision was hidden and finally
we get a migration so what do we learn
the in Phoenix when we use context we
learned that web things belong in the
web context we learned that context
encapsulate persistence in domain logic
and finally we understand that the outer
context module is the public interface
to that module - from the rest of the
system well that's great and all but I
have a few questions number one what
should I name the context number two how
do I think about resources that are
needed in multiple contexts and number
three how do I know if it's too broad or
too specific what are some tools I can
use to help me understand those things
and that is a time old question that
engineers from before a time till now
have been asking ourselves how do we
design system boundaries and so we turn
to domain driven design the text and the
text was published by Eric Evans in 2003
and it is both a set of high-level
strategic design ideas and activities
and it's a bunch of concrete software
patterns and if you run on Google and
search the domain driven design or DDD
you're gonna get a lot of noise you're
gonna get a lot of Java and a lot of net
and a lot of F sharp maybe and you're
gonna get a lot of like coats
apples and a lot of like jargon that's
just not gonna make sense and I don't
want you to get tripped up because
there's a few core ideas that are really
golden they're gonna help you no matter
what language you turn to next and then
there's also a lot of noise so here we
go
oftentimes when we think about
abstractions we think in terms of
horizontal layers we're thinking in
terms of like we're gonna need a web
tier and then we're gonna need a domain
tier we're gonna need a persistence
layer we're gonna need a bunch of
adapters and that's actually a fine way
to split apart your system but what if
we had a bigger picture what if we
looked at things a little differently
and what if we third thought in terms of
vertically decomposed business use cases
now if you're working in your agile
framework of choice you're already used
to splitting things up in vertical
slices of functionality so let's take it
a little bit further and apply it to our
architecture well I made up a company
it's called automax today you and I are
all gonna get on boarded so here we are
we're a used car marketplace we have an
online presence we have a
brick-and-mortar presence sellers who
want to sell their vehicles come to our
brick-and-mortar locations we take their
cars into our garages and our mechanics
to take a look at it we we rate their
car based on the quality and then we
appraise them for a price we buy the car
if we like it and on the other hand
buyers come in they see the car on the
Internet they want to test-drive the car
and they buy it if they like it too well
speaking of things that are design
decisions or things that constantly
change the business is the place where I
think a lot of change happens marketing
just wanted us to change copy on the
website finance wants us to change how
tax calculations are done operations
wants us to build new features in the
vehicle inventory system product wants
us to do things in Bitcoin I don't know
why and customer support wants us to
build a better support dashboard this is
fine we got to listen to the business
and that's not just dr. Dre talking
that's Dumbledore talking
the right thing to do is to business so
hard it's both my apologies to Rob
Connery and so I'm gonna save you a lot
of money cuz you don't have to run out
and buy the book because I want to
summarize it right here in the slide and
the slide says we design our software
systems according to your business
domains by paying attention to the
language you speak in the business this
is important linguistics is actually a
key thing to take away from
domain-driven design and when I say we
listen to the business I mean we
literally listen to the business and the
way we do that is through an activity
called context mapping this is an IRL
get everyone in a room a big conference
room with a big blank wall and here
we're gonna discover the concepts that
live in our organization our business
and eventually our systems so get
everyone in the room invite your product
honor invite your business stakeholders
invite your on-site customer invite
random people if you want it's fine get
everyone in the room and what you're
gonna say here is hey everyone's here a
tech team not a non-technical product
business c-suite whatever everyone's
gonna get it sticky they're gonna put up
nouns and verbs up on the wall so from
their particular point of view in the
system what are the things that you
interact with or the system needs to do
to get your job done and it's gonna be a
little chaotic and it's give me a little
fun and there's gonna be a lot of
confusion but this might happen
you'll see the things in orange are the
nouns and the things in blue are the
verbs I mean it's never going to be this
clean but you know for the purposes of
illustration I've done it this way most
likely you're going to have duplicates
you're gonna have things that kind of
belong together but you're not really
sure but it's okay at this point we're
just being generative embrace the chaos
next what we're gonna do is we're gonna
group like concepts and actions together
there's probably a natural affinity of
some grouping of these things so over
here I took the blue stickies off the
slide because it's a little noisy and I
want us to look at this because there's
actually a few things that seem a little
bit more related than others so we just
kind of push them together more on that
in a bit so we see that there are some
natural clusters that emerge and I'm
going to step back and introduce the
first term from domain-driven design
this is the core domain the core domain
is the primary area of focus of our
business so in this case our company's
core domain is car sales if we were if
we were IKEA it would be furniture sales
if we were Ober it would be screaming
federal regulations if we were you get
the point
so you circle you don't draw this on the
wall but I'm drawing this out here
because that's part of the context map
the context map basically implies that
all these concepts would apply to the
core domain in some way or the other car
sales next we're going to talk about
supporting domains supporting domains
are also called sub domains and there
are areas of the business that make the
core domain happen but they're not the
actual core domain so for example we may
have an online listings sub domain it's
a website but it's not necessarily the
the part where we sell the car we might
do financial transactions
that's not exactly selling the car we
might optimize the funnel we want to do
SEO but that's not really selling the
car and finally we might keep people
happy if your customers support
but that's not selling a car and what I
want to say here here's the point where
the magic happens is that very likely
you're gonna already find some natural
groupings and those natural groupings
hint at your subdomains and of course
I'm not suggesting that it's actually
this clean very likely some of these
domains oftentimes overlap oftentimes
they're messy you'll have concepts that
actually belong in one and the other
once again embrace the chaos we'll take
a step back pat yourself on the back
because you've just discovered your
domains this context map pointed us to
our business domains in fact they might
actually point us to real organization
structures according to Conway's law and
going back to this these are the
beginnings of the modules that we may
want to build into our application well
and if you took it even further these
may be the microservices that you
eventually wanted to build well um
here's another term
it's a ubiquitous language the
ubiquitous language ubiquitous is a
little misleading but it's a SP
vocabulary that you speak within each
domain and within each domain I
encourage you to build a glossary what
this glossary is it's it's super simple
it's a list of terms and definitions for
the words that you speak and here the
business is leading always always if
your product owner or business
stakeholder uses one term you stop them
and say do you call it an automobile or
do you call it vehicle which one do you
use oh you call it a vehicle okay I'm
gonna write that down and you turn
around you you brief act with that thing
to vehicle in your code if they say is
it do you rate something or do you
inspect something you know like get that
straight be clear on those concepts and
speak about them consistently a nice
side effect is that if you have a
glossary onboarding people is really
easy you never have to like have
confusions as to what things mean when
you onboard someone so this term of a
bounded context as
I was referring to back in a few slides
these subdomains in an ideal world
should map clearly to a bounded context
so what am I mean by that a bounded
context is has two different ways of
looking at it one is it's a running
software system so it can be a module it
could be an app it could be as a service
it could be a ruby gem a Java package
blah blah blah it's essentially code
that belongs together that eventually
runs together but there's an even more
nuanced definition for this it's a
delineation in our domain where concepts
are bounded meaning I'm gonna go back a
bit
that a concept that lives in perhaps one
of these domains is only allowed to mean
that particular meaning within that like
that structure within that context and
that context could be overloaded in a
different part of the system but that's
okay because we bounded it inside of
another structure or context here's a
couple examples a rating might mean
something when we when our mechanics
assign a car rating it might mean
quality but our customer support team
might also assign a rating and that
might correspond with like a MPs score
or something those two concepts are have
the same name but they're wildly
different and because we put them or we
nest them in two different contexts
they're allowed to fully Express what
they mean imagine we didn't have any of
these bound any of these contexts we
would have had to awkwardly rename these
two concepts to mean something and then
you get into this weird awkward
ambiguous place where terms don't
actually mean the same thing so the same
thing happens with the user could also
be a mechanic could be a seller or a
buyer etc so a bounded context means
that we can use precise language and we
can model things as clearly and as
flexibly as we need to be a very
powerful modeling tool and our products
can now stay in sync with our business
stakeholders
according to the language that they use
so to round out this entire session I
want us all to be very zealous about the
language we use about the language we
speak be very careful about it listen to
the business we're not just gonna be our
dr. dre's and we're not gonna be
Dumbledore's we're gonna be both by the
way did you know that if you put dr. Dre
and Dumbledore together you get DD DD
uncanny okay so um it's time for some
elixir here we have a context context
can expose domain entities so here we
have the nouns that are being exposed
and they can also expose domain actions
so over here we have the verbs that are
being exposed here in our context a
couple things about about these two
slides is that this is using terminology
that we generated from our context Matt
this is terminology that our team
completely agrees on let's assume for
the sake of this next example that we're
looking at this screen in our
application a wali the mechanic is
logged in into our back-end admin panel
and he's he's giving his rating of a
certain vehicle well here's what it
looked like before we introduced
contexts it's a little messy there's a
lot of ecto there's this authorization
policy thingy and it's a little
confusing so why don't we just go
refactor it so here we're gonna start
out this refactoring exercise by first
plucking the user and pushing it into
the identity context we do the same
thing for the for for the action of
fetching that thing and so now we remove
the need for the controller to
understand the the database layer or the
persistence layer and we push that up to
the context responsibility we'll do the
same thing for the vehicle in the rating
and we'll do the same thing for the
action
in the inspection domain so all that
stuff around authorization policies and
active persistence get pushed back into
our context and now we turn around and
we replace that code that we just
refactor it out with calls to the
context it's way better what do we just
notice here we just saw once again that
context only expose public methods to
the rest of the world they hide internal
implementations internal implementations
that are likely to change and finally we
were very careful to use domain language
when we were naming our actions and our
concepts here's kind of a question I get
a lot is what if we need to use a
concept across multiple content context
if you're like me and you've built a lot
of big apps you'll know that your user
model oftentimes becomes like a god
object meaning that your systems
whenever you build any sorts of sort of
system and you have some sort of idea
identity or some authorization concept
you end up hooking a lot of things into
that concept and eventually the
dependencies to that concept began to
spider out and caused the system to
become kind of brittle so let's take a
look at what that might look like in our
system so in our system the user in the
identity context is concerned only with
authentication and authorization in my
store some Facebook tokens and my store
Google OAuth or sam'l whatever or
passwords but that's all it really cares
to know about but however this logged in
user Dan has to have some additional
information pushed on to it in a
different context for example like a
mechanic in the inspection domain might
have a certain like semantic meaning
about it and it needs some additional
information
additionally perhaps we discovered in
our context mapping exercise that our
marketing team actually refers to these
all as visitors not users they call them
visitors
so here's a few options one is we could
do nothing we could just choose to just
use users everywhere so here's what a
quick refactoring might have done for us
we we choose to in our inspection domain
do a rating with a user that's a login
user but really under the hood it's a
really to our product owner it's
actually a mechanic that's logged in but
you wouldn't know that from reading the
code obviously I wouldn't recommend this
but I understand why a first step
refactoring might lead you to this
solution well here's a better idea is we
could do a pure what I call a struct
conversion but really it's just a
mapping from an external concept into an
internal concept and this is really
useful for use cases where you're purely
read-only here's what I mean let's
assume in the marketing context our
visitors really have two relevant
attributes to handle which is really
like your email address or some some
like user name or Facebook user name I
don't know and then they have like an
internal UUID that we assigned to them
in their cookie or something that's
really all the marketing code cares
about now when we want to do something
in the marketing domain we need a
visitor we don't need a user so I'm
gonna make this mapping function from a
user to a visitor and over here it's um
I'm sure there's a better way to do this
but anyways what i'm doing here is i'm
basically remapping the email field from
the user struct into the handle field on
the visitor struck and then when we then
turn to use this in our marketing
context we then apply the mapping
function so here you can see that we get
the logged in user but we convert them
to the visitor and then we go ahead and
use whatever we have planned internally
in our domain over here we're
subscribing them to some email
newsletter and over here is where the
power of elixir really shines we're able
to do pattern matching perhaps
in force that we get a certain type of
struct even better we could write some
type specs to really enforce that we're
passing in the right types of objects
they're the right types of structs and
finally if you really do need to
introduce a internal concept that is
persistent to the database then you can
create what I call a collaborating
schema so if you need to write and so
let's see what that looks like for
example the inspection context might
have a a mechanic table and we might
need to persist a few other things like
a mechanic might we might also need to
know that a mechanic is a contractor or
has a certain type of certification and
over here you can see that we just
linked them to the user and so now we're
gonna create every time you enter this
context you're gonna go create a
mechanic from the user or you're gonna
go look up the mechanic from the user or
some combination thereof and what we've
done in these past two examples is
create what in domain driven design we
call an anti-corruption layer what that
means is that every context is very
concerned about the domain purity of
what's being passed around and talked
about it knows that what's coming in
from the outside world is not exactly
the perfect mapping to our internal
world and we're gonna take great pains
to actually map it one last thing you'll
see in that third example I directly
linked to the user but that's actually a
hidden coupling under the hood there's a
ecto sort of relationship that may be
difficult to refactor out in the future
should this grow so what if we
sacrificed Sal ittle bit of ease-of-use
a little bit made it a little bit more
awkward but what if we actually enforced
some sort of like separation between our
context in assets stored maybe UUID
blobs or restore our user IDs as strings
that way we signal to the user or to the
developer that this is actually a hard
break one concept i want to talk about
is an
is data aggregates are data that belong
together these data is naturally fall
into tree-like structures here's an
example in our inspection context we
have a rating for a vehicle we have a
list price on a vehicle and we have the
vehicle itself and really naturally they
really should look more like this now in
the past maybe our context we generated
all these things and we exposed all of
the nitty-gritty gory details out to the
outside world but remember that's that's
a that's a big surface area that we're
exposing to the outside world and that
also allows for more possibility of bugs
and sort of like state problems because
the outside roll is able to mess with
the internals of my inspection context
so what if I instead I just returned a
nested data structure the vehicle is
what I call the aggregate route that's
like the mother object for everything
else that just hangs off of it and then
everything else kind of dangles off of
it and be caller is left to parse that
tree structure the aggregate similarly
we don't allow operations to happen on
kind of the sub resources in the
aggregate and instead we enforce that
public in that public methods only take
aggregate routes the only like the only
way you can change something is to tell
me what your route is and then tell me
what you want to change on the route so
exposed aggregate routes only to the
outside world and pass around aggregates
if you're exposing an API if you're
sending events on the bus you're gonna
want to pass the entire route
additionally you get the benefit of when
you pass around routes you kind of get
the context you get a higher level view
on what's actually happening in the
system if you were just to make a change
on a line item really you want to see
what's gonna actually happen in context
of the order so try using aggregates and
finally I want to talk about
event-driven messaging and here we're
getting into some of the more
nitty-gritty or some of the more
concrete software patterns
in domain-driven design but there's a
simple thing we can do here so here we
have a identity context action create
user and it has some explicit couplings
to some downstream side effects so we're
gonna have to maybe create a mechanic
and the inspection domain when someone
signs up and we might subscribe this
person to an email list and then we
might then send Google Analytics or
Mixpanel a event well this kind of
couples are contacts what if we could
decoupled them somehow and we can we can
kind of invert this sort of data flow by
instead publishing an event over a bus
our interested context downstream can
subscribe to these domain events and in
fact when we together built our context
Maps and we also developed a glossary we
actually already talked about these
these were those blue stickies that had
the verbs that happen in our system and
so here's what I oftentimes like to do I
like to follow a three-part naming
convention for my events the first part
is the context it's the name of the
context that that where this event
originates from the second one is the
name of the resource or the aggregate
route that is being that in action is
being performed upon or this event is
being fired from and finally it's the
name of the verb in past tense on that
resource downstream subscribers can now
turn upstream and go subscribe to this
event one of the nice side effects of
doing this is now we get to
independently scale downstream side
effects should they be particularly slow
or need a lot of time or have some
difficult part about operationalizing
them and then there's also a down side
of this where you now introduce the
complexity of managing a bus now I'm
gonna show some code I'm gonna use this
library called event bus
it's a elixir OTP implementation of an
event bus but you can replace this with
your
with your queue or you can actually just
use straight-up like I think you can use
gen stage or something for this gen flow
well we're gonna go ahead and replace
all those calls downstream with simply a
the publishing of an event and the
details down here aren't that important
really the most important thing is that
we publish the event after the thing
happens and downstream here you see that
we send the aggregate route out over the
bus as well
and now subscribers downstream here the
marketing code is going to go listen for
that event and then it's going to
perform its own internal context side
effect on its own in fact this is
another place where we implement an
anti-corruption layer because this is
effectively outside data coming in and
this is the same implementation for a
different context okay every
architecture talk needs a caveat section
because your mileage may vary
I'll tell you right now your mileage
really will vary first of all I
encourage everyone here to start small
if you're inspired by any of these ideas
don't just go and try to refactor
everything to use these software
patterns we factor things little by
little take one context and build it see
how it feels
was it awkward did you run into pushback
from other teams those are all things
you got to think about also you have to
think about things like did I get the
concept right refactoring and renaming
things is surprisingly really really
difficult second of all don't get ahead
of yourselves without understanding the
core concepts of domain driven design
start with the context map make sure
you're in agreement on your teens that
what you're doing is kosher make sure
other teams know what you're doing make
sure that you're always updating your
glossary with the latest terminologies
and you're doing your best to keep
things consistent from your business
stakeholder all the way down to your
code and finally if your system if
you're not feeling the pain
don't do this okay I just told you to do
this and then at the end I told you not
to do it this is only for systems of
certain scale and for teams that feel
certain pains if you have a small scale
system if you have a credit app that's
honestly not doing that much you don't
need this so don't do it in conclusion
what I hope I've showed you is that it's
important to listen to the business you
got to build a context map which will
help you and it'll guide you toward
using the right the right boundaries in
your code you're gonna create a class or
you're gonna use the right words we're
gonna be very zealous about using
contexts to hide implementation details
we're gonna be we're gonna embrace the
nuances of language we're gonna use our
Phoenix context or just our modules to
specifically allow languages through it
to allow concepts and terms to run free
we developed a few architecture tools
and we are probably on the best most
robust system to build all of these
contexts if you ask me that's what make
really beautiful systems all right go on
everyone I've given you the power use
your powers for good and not evil
