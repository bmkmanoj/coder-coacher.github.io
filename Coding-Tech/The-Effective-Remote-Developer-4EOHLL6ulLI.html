name is Dave copeland or dave Tron 5000
on twitter and i'm gonna talk about how
to be an effective remote developer I
hope so I spent the last four and a half
years as a remote developer I was one of
the first engineers at stitch fix were a
personal styling service for men's and
women's clothes and when I started we
were very small
you know scrappy startup kind of thing
and you know I was just writing code as
one does in that situation but due to
the way we work at Citrix and over time
my role has also changed so I was a tech
lead of a small team and now I'm a
manager of several different teams and
so I've worked with a lot of different
people than just a developer certainly I
work with a lot of developers but I work
with people who use our software the
business people who run stitch fix
vendors that we rely on all remotes for
that entire time and that's pretty
typical of a developer at stitch fix we
now have over 70 engineers and most of
the engineering work at stitch fix is
done remotely over half the engineers
don't live in the Bay Area we're
headquartered in San Francisco but most
engineers don't live there those that do
live in the Bay Area certainly come to
the office but they don't necessarily
come in every day there's a lot of
remote work happening so what does that
mean remote though when I was thinking
about this it occurred to me that people
work remotely a lot more than you might
think
if you think about what that means so I
tried to describe it
bear with me you do not often interact
face-to-face with the people you work
with it's not a great sentence I tried
very hard to make a better one
but I think this gets the point across
right you go somewhere and do work maybe
that somewhere is a coffee shop maybe
that's your basement and you work with
people and those people aren't there
most of the time right so that's the
situation that I mean by remote and if
you think about it like that like
there's a lot of remote work happening
in the world not just not just with
developers so there's the lone wolf
right this is a hard mode of remote
where you are by yourself and everyone
else you work with there's at some other
office Turkey but what we're gonna talk
about in this honc applies to the lone
wolf you also have easy mode which is
everybody is distributed no one goes to
an office there is no office everyone
sort of works whenever wherever
that's a little easier but still the
same things apply that we'll talk about
but think about multiple offices like
you could go to an office everyday have
a commute go to a desk with a computer
and all that entails but the people you
work with aren't in that office
you're a remote developer because you're
working with people who aren't there so
that's what I mean by remotes so we also
talked about what is effective so
obviously producing some value right
your company's paying you to do a thing
and you need to do that thing so that's
part of it but for you you also want to
be working on something valuable all
right you want to make sure that you're
working on the right things the thing
those things are useful and that people
want them or get some sort of benefit
out of them you also want to have some
level of agency right you don't want
your job to just be closing JIRA tickets
all the time like you want to have some
broader effect on the team the people
you work with the company something like
that that's not just doing the task in
front of you but growing as a person and
you need agency and impacts in order to
do that you want to feel included you
want to feel like part of the team you
don't want to be again the person whose
job is just to closed your tickets you
want to be part of the group moving
forward on a collective goal and you
want the experience to be rewarding
right no one wants their job to not be
rewarding and to the extent that having
to have a job is a necessity you want it
to be as rewarding as it can be now I
don't want to imply that you get these
things for free just cuz you go to some
office but you get some of these things
for free just by going to an office like
there is this sort of implicit level of
effectiveness that you can just get for
free by being with everyone that you
work with so what it means is to achieve
these things when you're remote you have
to just work a little harder and you
have to be more intentional in your
behavior to make sure that stuff happens
and that's what we're gonna that's we're
gonna talk about there's not a week that
goes by that I don't think about the
remote experience that I have or that
the people I work with have and it does
require constant upkeep in it is not
what I would call easy it's not
impossible obviously but it does it is
it is a part of like my job to work on
this and make sure that the behavior
that I'm exhibiting is doing the best to
make the remote experience good of
course it's worth it who-who works
remote most of the time
okay all right so you know you know what
I'm talking about it's totally worth it
because you get this level of freedom
and flexibility that you don't get by
having to go to an office right I don't
have to commute anywhere at all
I can make lunch in my kitchen my
kitchen is in fact stock stocked and
with these snacks that I prefer and I
don't have to stock other people's
snacks I can work outside if it's nice I
don't have to use a public bathroom but
the best part about the best part about
working remote is I don't have to live
in San Francisco I love love not living
in San Francisco my favorite thing no
offense the San Francisco but I don't
want to live there now the company gets
a benefit from this to the company I'm
sure is very happy that I get to make
lunch at home but really the company
gets access to a wider pool of talent so
that's why they're also willing to spend
the time on this sort of thing so if
stitch fix had decided that every
engineer had to come to some office in
San Francisco it would have taken us
much longer to build the team that we
have would have harder to build the type
of team that we have and it would have
actually had a significant impact on the
company's growth and because we
committed early on to making the remote
thing work we're able to get people from
all over the place not sure if you are
aware of this but there are developers
who are really awesome and they don't
live in San Francisco it's a few of them
so we've got a lot of them on our team
and it's awesome
so this is how we do that so it's not
technical I'm not gonna talk about slack
or anything like that you have to spend
your energy building trust with people
that you don't know and maintaining
trust with people that you do know and
you have to be constantly doing this so
that's we're gonna talk about behaviors
that you can take in a very small way
that contribute to building trust with
other people and acknowledging that
trust anyone ever heard this phrase the
half-life of trust is six weeks so
there's a tiny link there that you
shouldn't bother with you can go to the
slides later it's a blog post by Steve
McConnell see McConnell's author of
software books he wrote code complete
and in the blog post he talks about his
frustration working with a team located
in India which is halfway across the
world from where he was and he he
recounts one of his managers saying this
phrase the half-life of trust is six
weeks which sort of implies that if you
take no action if you don't do things to
reinforce and replenish that trust it's
going to go away and when you're not
present
with people it goes away much more
quickly because you don't see them like
you get a lot of trust by default by
just being around people and as a remote
developer you're not around people and
so you have to work extra hard to make
sure that the trust that you've earned
continues and that you're building more
trust and just replenishing that
constantly so I've got four mindsets
that you can use to drive your behavior
that I believe will build and maintain
trust with other people we're going to
talk about those with respect to all the
different things that we do as
developers they are communicate
frequently and clearly be responsive but
set boundaries assume good intentions
and help others help you so the theme
here is that you have the power to make
your remote experience good and we're
gonna talk about things that you can do
to do that but we do have to have a
brief chat about technology so the
biggest problem with being remote in
terms of communication and building
trust is like I said you're not actually
there so you don't have the ability to
go over to someone's desk and talk to
them you you have to go through some
piece of technology to be able to just
communicate with them and so you're
gonna need a few set up you're going to
need some sort of chat system that
people can use and that they check and
that they're in and I said the word
people not developers right so it's
gotta be something that every person
that you interact with is gonna be able
to deal with IRC is not that thing I'm
sorry you're gonna need a video
conferencing system that accommodates
multiple people and that they can use
easily and again this is people not
developers they should be able to
include meetings and calendar invites
they should be able to connect them to
room systems or other things like that
they should be able to get in and out of
them very easily so WebEx anyone like
WebEx anyone love WebEx right No WebEx
meets this standard even though it is
terrible so again the bar is low you
just have to have it there and if you
don't have these things the entire thing
is very difficult it's also not very
interesting to talk about because you
just sort of need to pay money and get
them set up and I don't want to
trivialize that but that just needs to
happen you also need a non shitty
microphone so people huh people's
experience of you yes those of us who
have dealt with shitty microphones
people's experience of you in real time
is mostly going to be talking over a
video conferencing system which is
very terrible because all that that
entails it's not it's not the same as
talking to a person you know face to
face and you can't control the crappy
internet and terrible software that's
involved but you can control the input
to that which is your microphone so your
laptop mic is shitty I'm sorry if you
feel otherwise but it is Apple earbuds
are perfectly fine right you don't need
an amazing $4,000 ribbon microphone you
just need something that works and is
near your mouth and Apple earbuds work
so technology over back to the harder
parts which is building and maintaining
trust
so we Alan these kind of four mindsets
so I want to talk about the kinds of
behaviors that they could drive when
you're doing different things that are
part of your job
so we code right mostly hopefully you
were coding most of the time that's the
output of our work we communicate
asynchronously like with an email we
communicate synchronously like on a
video chat and we socialize so we'll
talk about each of those sports things
as we go
coding first right coding that's the
thing you're hired to do that is the
thing that makes you a developer and not
someone else this is probably what
you're spending most of your time doing
and this is your work product so how do
we communicate when we're coding so
think about what it what it's like to
walk into a room with a bunch of
developers like what do you see you see
people typing on a keyboard into a black
rectangle with white text on it and
maybe they're working maybe they're not
but they sure look like they're working
and just that visual image is actually
important and people will assume well
the developers look like they're
developing because they're typing into
rectangles when you're remote you don't
have that at all so you you know to
build trust you need to produce things
and so a way to do that which is also a
great way to write code in general is to
turn larger projects into smaller ones
find a way to take whatever your problem
is and get parts of it in front of other
people quickly whatever your process is
this lets people first of all a small
change is easy to understand a large
change is not and so when people see you
produce a small chains are gonna see
that frequently and they're gonna be
able to understand it and give you
feedback on it and that lets them
understand you better and that also
shows that you are producing stuff and
you're driving towards a result and that
builds trust because they can see that
you're actually doing something when
you're making changes think about what
is this
smallest viable change right because you
have to think about it not just am I
getting the code to work but can someone
understand what I've done so they can
give me the feedback that I need to know
if it's good so they can say yes this
can go to production you want to
optimize the way you work so that people
can understand that because you're not
necessarily gonna have another way to
talk to them they the only communication
you might have is the change request
whatever form that takes so if you're
thinking about redoing the test because
they're not r-spec enough don't do that
if you're thinking about refactoring
this ugly code you don't like don't do
that if you're thinking about fixing
some white space because it offends your
sensibilities don't do that
I've done all those things and it does
not help communication at all when you
are submitting your change request
however you do that so it's stitch fix
we make pull requests to github whatever
your process is you're presumably going
to have to write something to explain
what you've done
write more about it than you might think
you should because again you're
optimizing for people to understand what
you've produced and so you need to give
them some clue as to what they're
looking at and why they need to look at
it and what you want them to look at so
when I do this I try every time to write
the word problem hit return and I type a
sentence or two about like what I'm
trying to accomplish and hit return I
type solution and hit return again and I
write some couple of sentences about how
I approached it what I what I tried to
do to give somebody a chance at
understanding what I've done because
that might be the only chance they get
to understand what I've done more
practically speaking learn how to
screencast and diagram so early on it
stitch fix I was working on software and
there wasn't an easy way to share it
with anyone there wasn't really a
staging server that anyone could
feasibly use and I'm not there to bring
my laptop over to show it to someone so
I would just run the app on my on my
laptop and screencast and just talk over
using the app in my development
environment and that it's way easier to
explain what you're doing then typing a
bunch of stuff out I use this thing
called Jing it's free for five minutes
or less you can share the screencast
privately if you just get really good at
doing that quickly then this is a thing
you can just do without friction and
include diagrams the same way just by
OmniGraffle and learn the keyboard
shortcuts and then you will make
diagrams very quickly and easily and
then that is the thing you can bring to
better communicate with people being
responsive and setting boundaries so the
first boundary you need to set as you're
working on
especially when there's time zones right
I mean does anyone like time zone math
cuz talk to non-developers they don't
even know what it is they're not gonna
do it so you need to help them so
there's a lot of ways to do this and you
have to take a wide approach so I set in
my calendar what my working hours are I
include my time zone in my email
signature and then when people are
interacting with me I am try to be nice
about when my working hours are so if
someone schedules a meeting with me at
like 6 o'clock I say hey that's a little
bit late for me you don't know if you
know this I'm on the east coast can we
do this later right it's a very nice way
to kind of set some boundaries not being
a jerk or if someone's giving me
feedback or I'm chatting with someone I
might have to say hey it's the end of my
day I got to take off let's pick this up
in the morning right so but you do need
to set those boundaries because people
aren't gonna know and they need to know
so when you're asking for feedback when
you're writing your code you're like
this is done I'm ready what is the next
step someone has to like say yeah cool
or whatever the whatever the process is
you're kind of watching for feedback and
so the second you do that your job then
becomes to respond to that feedback why
first of all it shows that you're
engaged and that you're trying to drive
completion which builds trust because
people like people that drive to
completion but it also allows you to
capitalize on the context that people
develop by giving you feedback if
someone like reads your pull request and
gives you feedback and then you don't
respond to it for a couple of days well
they've forgotten whatever they looked
at and they have to go relearn it again
if they're gonna engage with you but if
you do it quickly and you engage with
them back and forth and you're making
everything better
and what I've learned is you need to
develop a workflow that does not put you
heads down away from all forms of
communication for hours at a time and
this is really hard because sometimes
the developers we need to do this but
the more you are not able to be
contacted right people can't walk over
to you so they have no way to contact
you except for the avenues that you have
set up and created and if you're not
responsive to them then they can't take
advantage of your expertise and that is
gonna drive you more towards the JIRA
ticket closer and and and not closer to
a full rounded developer who has agency
and impact and is growing the team and
growing themselves so I will happily
tell you my crazy workflow that I do for
this it might not work for you but the
gist of it is I have an SLA for all
forms of communication
and I tried to stick to that and I have
a way that while I'm working I can check
all the forms of communication to see if
I need to do anything without forgetting
my spot whatever works for you try to
find some way to do that and the more
you do build up trust though the more
you can kind of get away with being
offline for a little while so this could
be a thing where early on you need to
focus on being more responsive and as
you kind of build up trust with people
you can you can take more time to do
this stuff this is hard to do it's very
hard assume good intentions so code
review comments anyone likening their
code commented on is not as a fun
experience okay yeah it's very harsh we
as an industry aren't used to critiquing
each other we're not used to being
critiqued we're not good at it and
either ends and so it can be hard to
hard to accept and also people are bad
at it and it can often come off mean or
you can read a tone into it that is
unpleasant it's it's not it's not good
but you have to assume the only way to
deal with this is to assume that the
reviewer whoever's telling you stuff
about your code they're just trying to
help they're trying to help make your
code better make you better make the
company better whatever it is they're
trying to help where they wouldn't
bother commenting I'm not saying to
tolerate bad behavior but bad behavior
is a pattern that you can observe one
time thing you have to assume good
intentions otherwise you'll go crazy
a way to deal with this problem is leads
to helping others help you not everyone
is good at it like I said
but some people are exceptionally good
at just talking so if you're having an
interaction in text that is not working
then jump to video like god this is my
failure mode all the time is I never go
to video but if you go to where someone
communicates well then you will have a
good communication with them right it
kind of right stands to reason and
instead of making people come to you you
should also be specific in the feedback
that you want if you put up a pull
request and say thoughts you're not
likely to encourage good feedback so if
you actually specify like what what are
the areas of your code that you want
someone to like a look at like oh this
variable name I had a hard time coming
up with it I don't know it does this
make sense or does this this is method
like make any sense can someone sort of
like help me understand it just look
right
so that does it several things one it
lets people I quickly figure out what to
do and can more easily engage with you
which means that you will engage with
them and you know that kind of builds
trust but it also shows a little bit of
vulnerability which is huge for building
trust because it shows that you're
willing to acknowledge areas of your
code that aren't perfect and so then
when people interact with you they know
that they're getting an honest and
authentic experience because you're
willing to call out things that aren't
perfect okay code asynchronous
communication so all this coding stuff
is a form of asynchronous communication
it's very specific to our to our
profession but you're also going to
interact with people not about code
writing emails sharing documents texting
in slack or something like that there's
all kinds of asynchronous communication
and this is the primary way you're gonna
communicate with most people just by
nature of being remotes fortunately this
is a little easier to deal with so
communicating frequently and clearly you
have to provide more context so when
you're talking to somebody you can see
their eyes start to glaze over you can
see them get confused they can raise
their hand they can interrupt you if
you're if you're not like making a point
but in an email or a document like
you're not gonna get that you might
never know if someone understood an
email that you sent so you need to
provide a little bit more context to
increase the chance that they are going
to understand that so explicitly state
what problem you're trying to solve or
what information you want or what you
want them to do and why give some more
backstory so that there's a chance that
they get what you mean you should also
become a better writer because you're
gonna be writing a lot and this is how
to do that so you write something you
want someone to read the least you can
do is read it yourself first and when
you do that you find all kinds of
mistakes in your writing you find all
kinds of incorrect words and other
things so everything that I write I read
at least once and I revise at least once
because there's always a way to make it
better I just do this all the time and
as you do this more and more you make a
habit out of this then you will do it
frequently and the more important and
email might be or whoever you're sending
it to you will revise more and more and
it just makes you more effective at
communication when you're sort of at
least taking it for a dry run typography
matters a wall of text is impossible to
understand like hit return a few times
make some paragraphs at least
every few sentences there should be a
paragraph or something but bold italics
underline like those exist they have
meaning you should use those bullet
lists I mean it's stupid to say any of
this but I remember in my youth every
email was just nothing but courier text
rap to 80 characters and if people
wanted bold and that was their problem
right that is not the way to effectively
communicate again the diagramming thing
is really helpful especially when you're
communicating to outside developers or
people who are not good at processing
text which is lots of people make it and
learn how to make diagrams quickly and
efficiently and that's tool that you can
bring to bear and make things more clear
being responsive so a lot of the things
we talked about the code kind of apply
here the point is you want to engage
give feedback if you're being asked for
its ask for feedback if you want it like
engage so that you're interested in
helping someone solve their problem
because when you do this this is how you
get agency and this is how you have an
impact right and this is why being
responsive is so important you have an
opinion about things and if you'll share
that opinion with anyone then that
opinion is not going to affect anything
it's just an opinion that you have but
if you share your opinion with people
then that is a chance for you to affect
how things are and if your opinions are
good and they are helpful then you will
be seen as someone who is good and
helpful and that is that means people
will trust your opinion and trust you
and come to you and ask you for things
and give you more of an impact on what
you do and that makes a much better work
experience so being responsive and
helping people out is is good but don't
forget affirming feedback so all this
stuff we've been talking about about
feedback is like critiques this is wrong
fix this blah blah blah it's very easy
to get wrapped up in that and we do want
those that is the critique that we want
because we want to be better but it is
nice when someone tells you that the
thing you did is good and it's even
nicer when they say it in a very
detailed way so if you say oh that API
design looks good I mean that's nice
that's very nice but if you say the the
names you're using in the route map
exactly to the domain which makes it
really easy for me to understand it's
this whole thing is like really simple I
thanks for putting this together that is
really great to hear because it shows
that you've understood what they've done
and that you took the time to say
something nice and it's if you're a
person that says nice things to people
it makes them feel good that builds
trust
so I used to think of firming feedback
was pointless it is not pointless it is
very very point for assume good
intention so a lot of asynchronous
communication you have as a developer
will be with non developers and
sometimes they're people that use ask as
a noun or use solution as a verb and if
you're like me it drives you completely
insane
but the point is that's just a
communication style it's not an
indicator of ability so I choose and
this is hard but I choose to assume that
everyone I interact with is killing it
at their job that they're really good at
their job because that mindset is the
only way to deal with with other people
otherwise you get wrapped up in
communication style I mean the number of
power points that I have had to have a
conversation about in the last four
years it's kind of staggering but that's
how some people communicate and that's
cool because they're good at their job
and that's fine help others help you so
again kind of same deal ask for the
feedback that you want the other cool
thing about this is this is another what
a veneer context to help people
understand what you're doing if you're
telling them what you want that helps
them figure out what it is you're trying
to accomplish and is much more likely to
garner some back-and-forth so this is
hard for me anyway this is the hardest
part a synchronous communication which
basically means being on some sort of
videoconferencing system why I mean part
of it is I'm an introvert and so this
saps my energy to have conversations but
another part of it is that it's this
weird uncanny valley version of having a
conversation with a real person right
because you can see them you can hear
them but everything between you and them
is terrible software that barely works
and the whole thing is just awful and so
it's just more stressful to have to deal
with this but some conversations cannot
happen over text like you you have to
have synchronous conversations sometimes
so how do we deal with this be prepared
so I find if I'm expected to like say
words to people the more confident I am
in the in the subject matter the more
likely I am to say something that makes
sense so read the material before the
meeting see who's there what is the
meeting about do you have an opinion
about what we're going to discuss if so
formulate that opinion in your mind
in at some level of detail so if you
have to say something it will make sense
and people will get it you should also
try to speak with more nouns than
pronouns when you say stuff like
he/she/it they this that thing things
not a pronoun but you know what I mean
those words don't mean anything who
knows what that means the only way you
can know is if someone said a noun
before and you have to you can guess
that that noun is the thing that that
means and okay now I get what you're
saying and when you're talking to a
person like face-to-face you can see
them get confused and be like ah okay
sorry with this is what I meant blah
blah blah
when you're on a video you can't see
that also due to technology you will not
be heard everything you say is not going
to be heard someone coughs the award is
going to drop out to people start
talking there's crosstalk people are
gonna hear what you say the internet
drops for a microsecond and one word
goes I've I've been on video chats where
I missed the noun because of technology
and then for two minutes people were
discussing and they never used a noun
and I didn't I literally couldn't figure
what they were talking about and I had
to interrupt and say what is the now and
please I don't know what this means I'm
sorry you've got to tell me so when you
do that that means that the things that
people do here they're more likely to
know what you're talking about
a better way is to pause frequently and
ask for feedback right because people
can't interrupt interrupting on video is
very hard people aren't gonna serve we
going to do it so take a moment okay
this is my proposal for how we're gonna
do this JSON thing does that make sense
everybody and then you have this like
pause when we do our All Hands
engineering meetings at such fix like aw
you know I say like I said a lot of us a
remote and our CTO is really good at
doing this so she'll give us information
and then she will pause and say anybody
have any questions
and then if nobody in the office has
questions you will always say anybody on
the phone have any questions and then
pause for a very uncomfortable amount of
time because she knows that it takes a
while for us to oh do I have a question
I do have a question let me ask that
question like that takes a while and so
she puts those pauses in there so that
nobody has to interrupt and everyone has
a chance to participate so when you're
speaking you should do that being
responsive and setting boundaries this
is kind of the other end of this and
this is the for me this is the absolute
hardest part to not multitask so
if you are in a conference room with
people you're on your phone or you're on
your laptop like that's very rude and so
you wouldn't do that because social
norms say I got invited to a meeting I
should pay attention in the meeting I
shouldn't be on my phone but when you're
on a video conference you're literally
on your computer and stuff is popping up
and you can check email and slack and
you can do these things you can you can
tell yourself that you can multitask but
you're not really paying attention and
then either you miss things that are
important or you get called out I have
definitely been asked questions in
meetings where I have no idea what to
say and I just had to cop to it I'm
sorry I was multitasking please please
repeat the question and it's super
embarrassing when you do have something
to say
it is very awkward to jump in but
sometimes you're gonna have to and
because of all the delays that happen
you may have to ask the group to
backtrack and you know just be upfront
about it hey I'm sorry to jump in here
real quick but that can we go back for a
second I had this thing and this comment
like it's hard to do this some people
just can't I have a hard time not as
hard as others the pausing thing that I
talked about if others are doing that
that helps and when you do have the
floor that is your time to set an
example on explicitly calling on other
people especially people that you know
are not gonna be comfortable jumping in
but you know have an opinion that is a
really good technique Oh Chris you just
did this thing what's your thoughts
right or anyone on the phone else I have
something before we move on that's
that's how these meetings should be run
and so you have to set that example
whenever you can no one's gonna know
that the a/v is a problem but you this
is like when someone has something on
their teeth you just have to tell them
because no one's going they're not going
to know so you have to be comfortable
pointing it out it sucks but that it's a
fact of life and of course you have to
be self-aware these behaviors that I'm
describing that kind of have to exist on
some level are jerky behaviors if
they're done too much or too frequently
or too aggressively and so you need to
have a lot of self-awareness when you do
this sometimes you've been asking people
for feedback when you're offline to say
hey I'm sorry I kept interrupting you
I'm really not trying to talk over you
but maybe I was like give me your
feedback on how that went so I can I can
get better like yeah it's it's it's
definitely definitely hard and that sort
of follows on assuming good intentions
right because people are going to
interrupt you
it's gonna seem jerky and you have to
assume that they're just trying to deal
with the technology the other thing
though is that the people who are maybe
not remote who are part of this who are
in this mythical conference room they're
not having a great time with the video
chat either like it's not great for them
to have all of this stuff going on it is
friction for them and having some
empathy for them is really helpful
because it just kind of it's actually
something that you all can bond over I
complain about the technology all the
time and it's kind of can lighten the
mood sometimes right because computers
are terrible like you have to rely on
all of these servers and all these
pieces of technology and they all barely
work I'm amazed it works at all they
don't work consistently it's just all
just terrible and acknowledging that can
make everyone sort of like feel a little
bit better about getting through the
video conferences helping others help
you so I mentioned before about the the
AV system issues this will definitely
happen and you need to kind of channel
your inner wedding coordinator and just
tell people what they need to do because
they're not gonna know hey point the
laptop at Pat because Pat is the one
who's speaking right like just tell
people what to do they're happy to fix
it but they're not gonna know because
they're not experiencing the AV the same
way that you are if you can recruit an
ally or have a blessed back-channel that
is really helpful too so it's stitch
fixed we do company All Hands meetings
and as I mentioned you know a lot of
developers are rememb but there's a lot
of other remote people we have lots of
different offices our stylists are
remote people are travelling so remote
is a big part of our All Hands meetings
and there's a wonderful person on our
ops team who monitors the back channel
and she asked questions for us and she
fixes AV problems and we can handle this
all by chatting and not interrupting the
meetings so if you have an ally that is
super helpful okay socializing why are
we talking about socializing you go to
an office people know things about you
even if you're the most private person
in the world and you never say anything
to anyone
people know what kind of clothes you
wear or what your hair looks like how
tall you are what time of the day you
come into work how often you go to the
bathroom
these are banal silly things but people
will know them about you and if you are
not going to an office they will know
absolutely nothing about you I'm
is at the height of my co-workers when I
first meet them it's not what I expect
ever so what this means sadly for the
introverts is you're gonna have to make
small talk you have no other way to
interact with people and you know when
you're on these video conferences
especially with the West Coast people
gonna be late and so you have a lot of
time to kill while you're waiting for
one to find the conference room and get
there so make small talk it sucks but
you can talk about the weather and it's
the beginning of a conversation a
beginning of a personal connection right
for me it's easy because I live in DC
where we have weather San Francisco they
don't have weather so it's always an
evergreen topic yeah another thing that
we do is we do one-on-ones with people
that aren't our manager or aren't our
direct report or anything like that with
no particular agenda so I have a lot of
one-on-ones with people where yeah we'll
talk about work sometimes we'll also
just sort of chitchat and sometimes in
just five minutes but it's a time set
aside to interact as people as best as
we can and it feels awkward to schedule
these sorts of things but it's the only
way to make them happen and it feels
normal after a little while being
responsive and setting boundaries so
this is more about travel so getting
together with people helps replenish
this trust a lot it is really handy if
you can do it travel is a pain so you
want to make sure you understand like
what are the expectations hopefully
before you take the job and I guess I'm
saying this because you might not be
told what the expectations are because
it might not occur to someone that
travel is difficult for you or something
like that so be clear about what the
expectation is and try to do it when you
can I mean a lot of us work remotely
because travel is difficult or we want
the flexibility to run our lives in a
certain way and travel sort of disrupts
all that it's totally true and
definitely set boundaries but if you can
travel it is worth it to re-establish
those bonds with the people that you
work with every day because you do
refresh that trust by seeing people in
person assume good intentions right so
people gonna make a small talk with you
too because they're gonna want to know
who you are and they might ask things
that are uncomfortable and they're not
trying to be nosy they just want to get
to know who you are if you have things
about your personal life you don't want
to talk about that
totally normal and totally cool but
that's all the more reason to do that
whole Smalltalk thing if you were
driving the chit-chats
then you can drive it in the direction
that is safe for everyone and just you
know be okay missing social events like
happy hours my my respect and admiration
for my co-workers is not derived by the
number of beers I've shared with them it
is by the good work that we do that is
the mindset I take and so therefore I
don't care if I miss happy hours or
social events I enjoy them when I can
make them and it is nice to have a beer
with my co-workers with many of them
I've never socialized with at all and
and it's there's still great people that
I love to work with so you just have to
sort of sort of be cool with it but
doesn't mean you can't socialize at all
or you have to miss everything what it
kind of means is that it might not be
clear what those things are and if you
have ideas bring them up like you'd be
amazed at how successful you can be by
bringing your boss an idea that requires
your boss to do absolutely nothing but
say yes you do that you're good but it
does mean you've got to you know kind of
take the initiative there you could find
a way to have in-person meetups be
creative about it there's a couple of
developers live on either sides of our
Dallas warehouse and every once in a
while they will go to the Dallas
warehouse and work together they don't
work on the same project but you know
they get to see each other in person and
have a little social interaction so
beacon you know be creative and bring
them up and suggest them and often your
boss will be happy that you're helping
to figure this problem out because
they're not going to know how to how to
make the experience good for you right
so all of that are tiny little things
that all build little bits of trust
between you and others and when you're
trusted and you work with people that
you trust you are gonna be way more
effective at your job way happier you're
gonna have much more agency you're gonna
be producing much more value you're
gonna feel included and the whole
experience is gonna be much more
rewarding so that's it's these are the
four mindsets again communicate
frequently and clearly be responsive but
set boundaries assume good intentions
and help others help you I have just
kind of described how things are in my
company and so you should come work for
us or you can or just talk to us and
we'll tell you how this is and we can
give you all kinds of details on how
this stuff works for us and then that
other link is for these slides that you
can check out if you like so
