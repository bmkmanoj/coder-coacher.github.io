right and I don't kind of mean this kind
of graph although this is a cool graph
graphs are cool but they they show us
interesting things we're here to learn
about this kind of graph so throughout
this talk I'm actually going to use
github as an example it's something that
we're all quite familiar with we'll talk
about users will talk about repositories
but if we start to think about this as a
graph we have you as a central user and
then so we want to expand out we want to
look at the organizations you belong to
so I belong to Sam nose and symphony for
example now inside that organization
symphony we've got a whole bunch of
other users that might be fabian it
might be Nicolas it might be other core
contributors I also have a Sam nodes
organization for example and that
contains a bunch of repositories so some
of those are private some of those are
public and then we have a whole load of
commits now each one of these is an
object now object-oriented programming
I'm not kind of going to go into the
depths of but you can kind of begin to
represent this in the graph and when you
use something like graph QL the
relationships are first-class citizens
and how they all relate to each other so
first time she can talk very briefly
about rest api's who's used rest api s--
quite extensively ok basically the
entire room wonderful so with your sony
rest api you've got a number of
endpoints you've got gets you've got
posts and hopefully a whole bunch of
other HTTP verbs and that you're all
using correctly right so if you want to
get content and by the way by get I
don't mean post content and I want to
have a look at like a specific
repository I do get repos
ID it would return the correct status
code cuz you're using the right status
codes as well right yeah ok that's the
correct answer
it's the okay answer returns to 200 ok
might get some organizations we might
get a specific organization but then
here what we'd start to do is we start
to say actually I want to look
repositories for that organization and
if you think back to that graph that I
was showing you earlier that's sort of
like a child
in a graph in a rest context now always
assuming children actually can kind of
confuse sort of the way of thinking
about it and so if you think about them
as connections then you can traverse the
graph in any way that you choose and
rest isn't this is one of the things
that rest isn't quite so great at and
then finally down the bottom oh I've got
a post dog so creating an organization
and again 2:01 because you're using the
right response case a REST API might
look a little bit like this this is kind
of fake and it's also not a great REST
API
it's just something I grabbed off the
internet so you'll notice in here that
there are lots of links that was raw
grab this example there's lots of links
in it we've got a link to itself we've
got a limit so much stuff to do with
pagination we've and then we've got sort
of relationships and we say call this
other link this other URL and then we'll
send you through and you can essentially
traverse a REST API a little bit like a
wetter like human can browse the
Internet you go onto a search engine you
click on a thing you click on another
thing you click on another thing it's
very rare actually now for you to type
in a complete URL to a specific page on
a website how when was the last time you
did that like probably a week ago or
when you were testing something but the
common user doesn't type a full URL now
that's a good REST API if you can follow
all the links but not all of them have
that if you don't have links in your
REST API it's not really a REST API
graph cue up so moving on from rest
we'll come back to sort of like the
differences later so what is graph cue
up graphically odds tooth of two things
it's a query language for your API and
it's also a server-side runtime for
executing queries using a type system
you define what what does that mean
so essentially there are two different
portions to it you have the actual
language that you query with it is a
query language just like sequel is for
example when you're querying on a
database and then it's the other side
it's the actual system of managing
oops so in the our github example we
have users we have repositories we have
commits we have more users and we have a
whole bunch of other different types
types of entity so let's have a look at
like starting to query this right this
is something in graphic you are this is
a request and what I'm saying is on the
me object I want to get the property
name I want to get my name it is just as
simple like this is this is this is the
most bare-bones sort of thing you can do
getting a property off of an object and
this is what it returns it returns my
name Michael column and it returns it in
exactly the same format that I requested
it in and it only returns me in the
fields that I specifically asked for so
again we've got me here which is the
object and then inside of that we've got
the property name which has the value
Michael column so it's given me that
data it's given me the name of the me
object now I can add others I can add
company in here because I let's say I
want to know what my company is I run
that and again I get that extra property
back I find out what that property value
is and that property value is some notes
and again you'll see that like company
the exact words I've used here is
exactly the same it's the the require a
response will always mirror the request
unless you assets specifically not to
which I'll go into later now this is
great for scalar values but I was
talking all about graphs and stuff like
that earlier which means that we're
gonna have to like nest objects at some
point right so let's lesson object now
I'm talking about github so let's have a
look at some repositories so I want to
get the name of a couple of repositories
so I specify an object here repos which
is a property but it's not a scalar
property it's a it's a list so therefore
I say for each of these repos I want to
get the name so that's exactly what I
have I have repos and then I have a list
of repose there might be there would be
more on there and then I just get the
name of the repo which is that property
and again it's an exactly the same
format
I said I'm gonna use github as an
example quite a lot throughout this talk
so I'm also going to use the so there's
a tool called Graham graph iql which is
interactive essentially it allows you to
customize your requests in one side it
will do auto completion etc for you and
then it will tell you the results so
let's have a look at some stuff to do
with all right can you see that at the
back oh that's a bit can you see that at
the back yeah cool so here what I'm
doing
pretend that this word query doesn't
exist yeah so here we are I'm looking at
a viewer object viewer in github context
kind of means me the person who is
viewing the API I've signed in as myself
this is actually touching on github
production data I'm just going to have
to try very hard in this live demo not
to accidentally show you any private
repos so log in is the property on here
that essentially gives you my username
and my user name is Michael Cullen so
that's really simple right now like we
can do something a bit we can look at
other things other types of object so on
the on the github API one of the things
that lets you get is a series of codes
of conduct so a code of conduct is an
object and it has a name field so when I
was saying about all your completion is
what I mean and it also tells me the
type which is really useful because my
memory isn't that great it's also why I
feel brave enough to do a live demo so
here I can just see is it's saying that
there are two code of conduct objects
that it's finding and in each of these
code of conduct objects I'm getting the
name property now I can add some more I
can get a description I think
no I can't I can get the body I can get
I can get a Europe so there we go
so now I'm actually getting the full
body of all of these codes of conduct
now that's great but realistically like
I don't actually want to get the full
body of every single code of conduct so
let's say I just want to look at one so
one of the fields that I grabbed here
was key now
reason I know I didn't grab you so I can
see here contribute to covenant that's a
key now I'll show you exactly how this
works in a moment but essentially what I
want to do is I want to only look at one
hopeful didn't lock my screen and there
we go I'm just and
just look at one thanks there you go so
I can just look at one as well
and that really depends on the kind of
object that I'm querying whether or not
I'm looking at an array or whether or
not I'm looking at a single object so
it's coming back here so what you just
saw me do is I was passing in an
argument so essentially what this
actually is is it's kind of it's
essentially a function if you consider
that in in sort of PHP terminology so
I'm passing in an argument and all
arguments are named this is not
something we really have in PHP you
can't say which arguments you're which
you're giving you can only sort of pass
in all of the arguments or just the
required ones so I'm saying login so
that's the variable name that's the key
and then I'm saying that the value of
that equals my column and I want to look
at the name for that and then I get back
exactly the same thing that we were
looking at earlier this means I can look
at all of the users I can say I actually
just care about this one because I
generally don't care about I don't want
to get every single user on github I
want to get this one user and I want to
specify which user so I can also use
arguments on scalar properties so now
github I couldn't find examples of where
they do this and so I can't give you a
live demo of this with the github part
but essentially what you could do is say
I want name and height now who prefers
metric who prefers feet one guy okay
it's it's it's fine who measures the
height in feet though
exactly so most of you yeah you're not
you're not alone but we are but so we
can specify the specific unit that we
want so we can say I want my height in
foot because whilst I might normally
default to metric my prefer metric I
prefer my height in feet so it would
then come up with Michael and six foot
four and essentially what I can do
I can just use that for a manipulation
of a scalar field so arguments can kind
of go wherever which is an odd concept
that we might not be used to so
something I've talked about a lot is
that the request and the response match
each other now if they always match each
other like this we've got me company
name company and then again here we've
got user name repos again all the
structure matches what happens when I
want to get more than one user because
here I've got user and then I've got
myself like I'm coming up but well let's
say I want to get the date on two users
I want to get the data on the two most
common the two most popular users on get
up or a height with highest number of
contributions now that's Fabian and
Andrew I don't know who this Andrew guy
is but Fabian I expect most of you do
know we use something called aliases so
aliases allow us to actually change the
response and use different keys if I had
two users it would throw an error you
saw what an error look like earlier
accidentally I was going to show it to
you properly out later but you've
already seen it so what I can say is I
want this object to be called Andrew I
know what this one's we call Fabian and
what I want you to do is get me a user
and part in this argument and that looks
like this so we've got Fabian here
Fabian Andrew Andrew and then with still
throwing through that name because the
name is property that we're getting now
that's great when you're only looking at
one field but let's say that you want to
have multiple different fields in there
you want to have like name email company
now as a developer this makes me hurt
this makes me want to cry because I'm
seeing I'm repeating the same thing
right which we all know is bad practice
but craft graph QL can handle this for
us using signed code fragments so what
we do is we say fragment user details on
user so what we're saying is I want to
create a fragment the name of that
fragment is user details and we want to
create it on a user type so I haven't
really talked too much about types I'm
going talk about a bit more depth later
but essentially what we're doing is
we're looking at a you
type here and then what I do is I
include user details and then it
essentially repeats this the name email
company in both Michael and Fabian on
that so if I jump back across to get up
and have a play with this so let's go
what I'm doing areas I'm just
duplicating what I was kind of just
talking about so we've got that behavior
that I was saying and you can see the
alias is working so we've got Fabian
here we've got Michael and Fabian and
Michael can you see at the bottom of the
screen at the back is it does it what
does it cut off like sort of there with
heads or can you see the whole thing oh
you've got screens back there fantastic
okay so now I want to add a couple of
extra fields so let's add email please
don't spam me oh no that's not what I
wanted and that's grab company as well
this uses a funky editor just like all
of github stuff and therefore it tries
to do right there we go so I can run
that and I've got those extra fields now
I'll extract this out into a fragment
and I'm not going to try retyping it
because it won't let me
now the fragments sits outside of the
query that we're doing here and then I
just paste the exact fields in here
almost as if it is actually in here
itself
now what if I actually just did name
here and I ran this it would actually
error if you define a fragment and don't
use it it will error at you so you can't
just simply load every single one of
your fragments or transformers I suppose
you could kind of liken them to you
can't just load every single one on
every single query you have to only load
the ones that you need so then I use the
ellipse operator to say essentially
expand user details here
and then we'll see that that's exactly
the same response this makes life so
much easier in terms of how to instead
of having to duplicate things a hundred
times you can just specify exactly what
you need so we've looked a lot of
properties and that kind of thing let's
not have a look at operations because we
want to do things a little bit more
dynamically now when we're having a look
at all of the previous ones that we've
been doing I've said I've just submitted
that query keyword the query keyword is
unnecessary but recommended so all of
the previous examples that you've seen
just add query at the beginning and
you'll be following best practices now
just like in PHP we can have anonymous
functions or particularly in JavaScript
JavaScript owes us a lot it's a lot
better to name them
it makes debugging easier it makes it a
lot easier to find things particularly
when you get one of those errors and
you've got a long query so what you can
do is you can also name your functions
or your operations so here I want to get
user and company now the advantage of
this is that you can start to pass in
variables that aren't part of your
specific graphic URL request body so
it's not part of your query now why
might you want to do this why can't I
just like insert it into the query as I
build it if you try to do string
manipulation to generate your graph QL
query then you're not going to enjoy
your life it's gonna be an absolute pain
in the arse it's gonna be horrible to
unit test it's going to be horrible to
develop on how many people's like stills
spend a lot of time using string
manipulating queries together instead of
using a some kind of query builder it's
a similar kind of situation so what you
want to do is you want to say hi I'm
just going to pass in this variable and
you can specify types so I'm gonna talk
a lot more about types but for here I'm
just going to say it's a string we all
know what a string is this exclamation
point what this does is it says that
it's required
an X
Colome ssin point means that an argument
is required you can't it will just
simply error if it's not if I excluded
this and it would mean that null is
possible now the way that graph QR
handles null is that there is one null
everything is that same null it's not
like each individual type has its own
null version so it's not like the null
of a integer would be zero
it's just null so I grab the log in here
as I say I want a string and then I say
I want the user for this particular
login and I want to the name I want
company and I want is hireable and then
separately I give it as another body of
text which is the variables so for
example let's say this was a car request
I might say here is the body which is
essentially the query and here are the
variables they're two completely
separate things that you send in your
request now we can do more things with
this as well we can do if statements so
let's say that I only want I want to be
able to have this this method and its
operation but I want to use it for two
things it's not exactly the best
practice in this example but it's simple
enough that it kind of makes sense so
what I say is is hireable I've actually
missed out the argument here for
hireable that's my mistake it should be
a boolean in there and then it's exactly
the same name company is horrible but
then I have this particular thing here
now what that says is only include it if
horrible is true this should be a
boolean now you can also have the
opposite of this and you can say if it's
not that essentially so let's have
another quick look
let's grab only you want to look at one
I'll just get rid of this fragment
now I've kind of hidden this down here
query variables so this is where in the
UI it allows me to insert those
variables so I want to grab login and
here as I said I'm inserting the query
text just to make it M so it works and I
want to get
cool so if I run this it will fail and
the reason being is because I've said
that this login here is required and
that's what that exclamation point is
for I'm just gonna get rid of all of
that comment text just getting in the
way so yeah so here we can see the
string I was provided with an invalid
value now what I can do down here is
that's actually so if I go down here I
can specify what that login variable
should be so oh it's all to compute that
for me so I can say that this one I want
Fabian I can complete that run this
essentially it just auto fills that data
kind of like code right kind of like a
you know query language now if I decide
that I want to add another one on here
so I can add is hireable include yeah I
don't know and I can specify another
thing up here
it's home and then I can specify you see
this code complete it's like nice but
not there we go so now because I've
passed in true it will tell me that
Fabian is horrible apparently great
however if I put false then will not
like me very much there we go
and it will then hide that field so you
can use one particular thing of query
language send it multiple times and just
customize the variables which can help
you when you're actually crafting these
queries it can make your life a lot
easier so I've talked a lot about
fetching data now fetching data core of
QL is very very good at fetching data I
prefer it for fetching data using it to
write data feels a bit odd particularly
sing as you use a get all the time all
of graph QL is on a single endpoint you
send it your query you send your
variables it returns a response to you
it's slash graph QL normally is kind of
the standard and it's a get but you can
modify data now let's have a look at how
we do that so what we do is we first of
all and this isn't actually strictly
required but it's good practice to do it
instead of saying query I say it's a
mutation it's a different type of
operation that I'm doing I'm doing a
mutation I'm changing something then
what I do is I specify what this
operation is called now again this is
completely unnecessary it's just simply
useful to have it there for debugging
purposes I specify the user and then I
specify the input repo input now I'll
have a look at that and on the next
slide and then what I do is I run this
operation essentially because all of
these are operations when I'm talking
about user and grabbing that what I'm
actually doing is I'm running an
operation to get that user it then
turns to me an object and that's what
I'm manipulating so I'm saying create
repo for this user and this repo and it
will automatically stop and then it will
return to me what it's created in the
form that format that I've asked it to
which is name and description not name
repo sorry about that now the way that I
define like a repo an input format is
that you say for your in your schema
which we'll come on to in a moment we
say input we say repo input and then you
can specify all of your different fields
you can say their types you can say if
they're nullable you can even specify
that they'd be another type so for
example I could say repo name
description and then I could have
organization and I expect either that be
of the type organization and this allows
you to create an entire object when
you're putting it in there so schemas
how does this work on the other side so
that was all about how we can query
graph queue up but how do we actually
define the schema of our own graph QR
and the thing is is that even if you're
only querying a graph QL ever it's still
use very useful to understand like how
this type system works and the type
system primarily belongs on the server
but using tools like graph iql allows
you to validate essentially your graph
quit your call your queries before you
actually ever send them which you can't
do in languages like PHP in quite the
same way unless you use strict types you
strict types so I'm gonna create a type
here I'm gonna create a conference talk
and then I specified the different
properties on this I'm just using an
arbitrary syntax on here but essentially
you would define this in your code so
first of all I'm gonna have a title
which is a string it's not nullable I'm
gonna have a speaker also not nullable
you can't have a talk without a speaker
that would be odd it's going to be an
attract now you can see here is that I
have defined a custom type here called
track I'll show you what that looks like
in a minute now I've also known I've got
ratings and what I'm using is I'm using
this list syntax so that allows me to
essentially have an array
of different rating so by this I mean he
kind of joined in kind of that kind of
thing now you'll notice I've got an
exclamation mark on the inside here what
that means is I can't give it a null
review so I couldn't I would have liked
if I had an array and I had two reviews
in it and one element that was null it
wouldn't allow that null element however
there isn't an exclamation mark after
the list which means that it's having no
reviews is absolutely fine
it just prevents a review from being
null it doesn't prevent the list from
being not if I wanted to say that there
must be reviews on this talk remembered
joined in there must be then add an
exclamation mark here and that would
essentially require that and you can use
these lists and you can nest them etc
etc so at the root of all the schema you
have something called query so we were
talking about query earlier and that
thing that I was talking about adding at
the beginning mutation essentially what
this does is it defines the highest
level of functions that you're kind of
running the things that you're doing
so I'm saying hi I want to look at this
talk I wanna look at the talk ID I want
to look at the speaker oh and look at
this review so that's where you're
defining all of those like upper level
operations to go and get like a specific
one or to get a series of them I won't
cover pagination in much detail in this
talk I might bring up in a github demo
just to show you if we've got time so
what I'm doing here is I'm saying talk I
want to throw in the argument ID and
it's of the type ID so ID is a special
type in graph QL and I want to return a
conference talk if it's a review or a
review if it's a speaker or turn the
speaker object and these are special
objects and types that I've defined
almost like a class now it comes with a
series of inbuilt types those are string
integer float boolean and ID ID it will
default to if you're sort of doings
doing a lookup and you haven't like
specified exactly what field it is now
you can also have your custom types
which look a bit like this conference
talk here this is a type
some type so you would add this on to
the series of the others and you can
also have enums who knows what any num
is most of you that's fantastic
Derrick we should definitely get this in
PHP core sorry
seriously though Tuesday so enums are
fantastic they allow us to have a series
of different values and only one of
these values can be specified so at this
conference we have three tracks we have
the red shifts at the I don't actually
had know how to pronounce this which is
awkward because there's a triply
speaking mark I
Macari Macario Macario track and the
bite-mark track and that means that when
I'm specifying here the track it means
it has to be one of those three values I
can't specify anything else it's almost
like having an array on a string for
those of you that not use you know
before but better like much better
because it's a type right and the final
thing kind of on this before I go into
how to do some PHP is introspection and
I'm just gonna jump straight into github
and show you this so with a REST API
what you commonly need to do is you need
to define it in a format like swagger
need to put it on an awful tool like API
re tool in order to be able to document
it or that kind of thing
now with graph QL you can actually ask
the API to give you its documentation
itself because the schema documents the
API you can see all the fields you can
see the types of those fields you can
bless you you can see the description of
all the fields and and you can actually
just ask graph QL to give that to you so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
one of these special types so they have
a whole bunch of inbuilt types that are
special that I'm not going to talk about
but one of these is schema and what
schema will do bless you that was to in
in perfect harmony
so from schema I can get a list of tire
and array of types so I'm actually just
using plain ol graph QL here I am I'm
looking at types and it's the reason
it's erroring at me is because that's
actually an array and then under types I
can say I want the name of the type I
want the fields of the type I want the
kind of the type and then under fields
again this is another array so you're
starting to see like how we can miss
things here and all I'm doing is
querying graph qaul itself so again I
can say name description I can see if
it's deprecated I'll talk about about
deprecations in a moment and I can get
also its type of the field so this will
be huge by the way so what we see here
is it's showing me all of the different
different types that it can give you
so under query so that top-level that
we're looking at we can see code of
conduct we can see codes of conduct we
can see which is what we were looking at
earlier we can see the the plural and
the singular there if I actually ask for
arguments over here it will tell me the
under code of conduct there is one
argument which is the idea of the code
of conduct or the key I can see licenses
if I scroll down a bit more
I can see organizations that's something
we're all familiar with
I can see users and down here somewhere
will be repositories as well so
essentially what this is doing is it's
telling me things like the description
economy authenticated user is the field
deprecated yes or no and I can see the
type now if I use sign called kind of
then it will kind of show me the type
okay that yeah fair enough
worth the try right we can also get the
name of a type which will often return
as null it's just kind of a quirk of
graph QL in terms of when you're looking
at objects versus scalar types what
seems you get down scalar types these
fields will like say
String etc um this is really cool like I
can look at all the different I can
actually look at graphic ul itself and I
don't need to document my API right now
with deprecations it's really cool the
reason that deprecations are cool in
graph QL is because what you can do on a
field is you can just specify a
deprecation reason and as one of the
properties of a field and what it will
then say to you is it will give you when
you're querying this it will say is
deprecated true it does that magically
for you and it will then also give you a
deprecated reason and this allows you to
deprecated parts of your API in ways
that you you can't really do in a REST
API you can't query it about itself
pretty so server-side this is probably
the most popular library for graph QL
and PHP it will essentially give you all
of the bootstrapping you need
it's the dependency of like most common
graphic you are other graphic you are
libraries that you'll see now this runs
on a single endpoint file I'm not going
to show it to you because it's boring
honestly essentially what it does it
will grab some input it will register
all of your object types so like query
it will and that kind of thing and then
it allows you to just execute that it
will return a response to you now when
we're defining a type what does a live
like so I mentioned that we want to
always have something like called query
at the top level I'm kind of ignoring
that for now so I just want to define a
user type I give it a description I say
it's our blog visitor I specify some
fields I specify first-name I have a
description on each of those fields I
have the type of those fields this is
the most important thing here right I'm
essentially doing a check to make sure
it's a tight it's a string I've also got
an email field which is also a string
and I don't bother to specify other
fields like the description so I just
let free say the type that's a shorthand
syntax
and then I've got this function here
called resolve now what this allows me
to do is for this very specific type I
can choose what I want it to be able to
return to me how I want it to get that
result do I want it to run a query do I
want it to return some kind of scalar
value do I want it to look up from like
a map array now this is great when
unlike a smaller scale but you don't
want to have to do that for every single
one of your entities so what you can use
is you can use a default field resolver
and you can say hey if it's on take this
type pass it into like this this
particular type of object and then run
this through my RM for example if you're
using an arm and it can then resolve all
the fields for you and do that magically
essentially without you having specify
what would end up being quite a lot of
complex logic every single time now
that's great but if you want to do it
all this automatically you can use API
platform API platform is great I really
like it for this kind of thing when you
want to just sort of rapid application
development if you can just spin it up
you define your entities insane like
doctor now or I'm if you're just in
cried and then it will automatically
generate a graph QL thing for it the
only step you have to do is requiring
that other graph to our library and it
will automatically enable itself it's
really cool I will very quickly show you
this because I'm beginning to run out of
time essentially what I've got on here
is I've just got an example of that
graph QL script you can't see that at
the back wanted so here I'm specifying a
field I'm under query Michael's name I'm
specifying a type and I want it towards
that we're always resolved the string
true then I've got all of this
bootstrapping which basically says like
do craft graph QL stuff and when I
execute this then it returns a JSON blob
which you can't see down here which just
says the data
Michael's named foo so that's like a
working graphic you are on my laptop
like in like 40 lines of code so rest of
us is graph QR now Phil put this really
well in it so you need a blog article
when graphic you all came out because
everyone was like hey graph do all this
thing's amazing I'm gonna replace all
the rest api's I've got with it now then
that caused the backlash of graph QL is
rubbish don't use it for everything and
then you ended up with kind of like this
this this conflict wrestling graph QL
are totally different they're completely
different they do different things they
do it in a different way
graph QL isn't a magic bullet nor is it
better it's it doesn't solve all of your
problems it's not a replacement for rest
it's an alternative to rest you can use
both of them at the same time some for
and some companies do
graph QL is great for if you're working
very closely with your mobile developers
for example and you just want to give
them access to everything but you don't
want to have any information visibility
it's really great if you use it right if
you use it for the right things but
don't just think oh hey I'm just gonna
jump over and use graph QL because it's
better than rest it's not better than
rice it's an alternative to rest rest is
a sin it's very built on HTTP it has no
specification it has no set of tools
whereas graph QL is very specific it's a
query language it has a specification it
has these tools available to you I can
jump on github Singh and I can run
queries and it can autocomplete it with
complete rubbish like why would you not
want that but it can also optimize for
like flexibility and performance you are
always specifying the fields you want
you don't have to have this like mega
include at the end of your graph queue
many of your REST API you link
versioning is great because so
versioning your API is is bad in general
right if you've got v1 v2 v3 please stop
a much better way to version your API is
to deprecated fields and very simply
just come up with a new name for a name
for the end point so for example you
might change
like users to people or something like
that if you really need to make a
breaking change but it's much better to
just not make a breaking change it's and
we've graphically well because you're
always specifying the exact fields that
you want it's very easy to know exactly
who is using which fields and you can
reach out to them saying hey you're
using this deprecated field and you have
been for like two years
please start we're gonna get rid of it
next month and you can automate that
process you can automate informing your
users that they're using a deprecated
part of your API that's cool
deprecations are much much better and it
doesn't have any kind of version you
can't do v1 slash graphic you are what
are the issues of graph QL I've kind of
talked some about something already
caching it's all on one endpoint
it's all on slash graphic you are you
can't use HTTP varnish and that kind of
thing in quite the same way
it also because lots of people are going
to be requesting different fields
it makes caching a complete nightmare
because instead of having one endpoint
that everyone is always hitting they're
always requesting a completely different
version of even requesting that
particular resource so basically the
answer to caching is be very good at it
at lower levels your authentication your
caching etc should all be at levels
below graph QL it should be just above
your persistence layer in your business
logic layer essentially use Redis
basically don't rely on HTTP caching it
in quite the same way but you do have
the performance benefit of the fact
you're only giving what you need and
find it information hiding the whole
point of graph QL is you don't hide
information point is you give them exact
access whatever they want front-end
developers love graph QL
because it means that they can just
develop without having to constantly ask
the back-end team for extra changes to
be made it can help speed up development
of your back-end team because suddenly
you're no longer having to constantly
respond to the front-end team and you
haven't got that that dependency in
quite the same way you just give them
the API and they can do all this stuff
but if you want to do information hiding
that's not really what it's designed for
I think that's all I've got time for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
