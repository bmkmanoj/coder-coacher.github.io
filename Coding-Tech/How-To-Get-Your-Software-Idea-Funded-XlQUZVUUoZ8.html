super familiar with us we fund startups
since 2005 we funded about 1500
companies and 3000 founders and in the
last batch about 40% of the companies
that we funded were from outside the US
so I'm excited to meet a lot of you here
today who are pitching your startups and
I hope you'll apply - I see so these are
some of our alumni we have Dropbox
Airbnb reddit crews we have funded our
companies now have a combined valuation
of about 85 billion dollars and actually
read it is the reason why I am here
today and why I am at Y Combinator so to
give you a little bit of background on
myself before YC I worked at Wired
magazine and then after that I was a
chief of staff to Alexis Ohanian the
founder of reddit reddit was in the very
first batch of YC it was the very first
company to get acquired out of Y
Combinator and essentially I learned I
worked with Alexis on his fund and
nonprofit and what we ended up doing is
we helped a lot of his portfolio
companies pitch and figure out how to
build their communication strategy how
to launch we worked with hundreds of
companies and I learned not only about
you know community building from Alexis
and he's one of the best in the world
reddit is now one of the top five sites
in the US but is also a great startup
storyteller so that's what I'm gonna
talk to you a little bit about today I'm
gonna talk to you about how we advise
our companies at YC to pitch to pitch B
C's to pitch you know press to pitch
people who get pitch tens if not
hundreds of times a day how do you pitch
a company in a way that is going to be
viral that is gonna be compelling
that'll stick and investors heads so I
just got out of reading you know YC gets
about 7,000 applications per batch so we
read hundreds and hundreds of
applications every six months and so I'm
just coming off of reading a lot of
pitches so this is all very fresh
and so let's give you a little bit of
background on what I do at YC today
part of it is outreach and that means
outreach to potential applicants or of
the best people from around the world to
apply and join the program then while
the companies are in YC I help them a
lot with with this sort of stuff with
figuring out how to tell your story how
to tell your story to press pitching
them getting them launched and so let's
talk about how to get your pitch and how
to make it viral so in Silicon Valley we
often obsess over this number we we
often think about how do you get to a
billion dollars a billion you know
customers how do you impact a billion
lives well more often than not uh you
know the truth is at the beginning no
one cares except your mom and maybe my
mom that's my mom and so at YC we often
focus on this number we focus on a
hundred how do you get your first
hundred users and one of our partners
Paul Buchheit is the creator of Gmail
likes to say you should focus on
building something that a hundred people
love versus a thousand people just kind
of like because those hundred first
people who love you will become your
evangelists they'll they'll kind of talk
about what you're building they'll talk
about it they'll become your viral sales
force for you and so let's talk a little
bit about how to what you have to do to
get those first hundred people that
absolutely love you and I'll just go
over two things since we only have a
little bit of time I'll go over one
clarity of vision and how to communicate
that and then to I'll tell you the real
key to making something that people love
and so first let's talk about clarity of
vision so clarity of vision is really
important because a clear idea is the
foundation for growth so we believe a
person who has thought deeply about an
idea can explain it clearly and
succinctly they can explain it in a way
that a five-year-old can understand in a
way that a five-year-old can
describe what you're doing and so they
use less words they can explain these
concepts concepts in a simple way and so
basically this is so important because
you're going to have to communicate as a
CEO or founder of a company this vision
in order to recruit co-founders and
investors users employees and
shareholders you're gonna be having to
do this for the vast majority for the
entire you know life of the company and
it's also really important it's
necessary to make it really really easy
for people to sorry I'm gonna go back
for people to talk about what you're
doing because when people sit at a few
think about some of the best companies
or the companies that use every day
think about how you learned about
snapchat or Facebook more likely than
not you learned about those products
through friends through hearing them
from friends or family or people that
you came across talking about something
they were excited about using so when
people sit around their dining table it
should be you and your company and your
app that they're talking about they
should be able to deliver your short
pitch for you and and so you you don't
naturally have to be good at pitching
your company the vast majority of the
founders that we talk to it takes them
months to really hone the messaging and
to get it down to just one sentence that
can compel someone to invest in them or
to write a story about them so here's
how we think about starting to craft
that memorable pitch so first we
recommend men that you lead with what
not with why and this might seem
counterintuitive because if you think
about storytelling we like to tell
stories chronologically so you you you
know a lot of people like to start with
how they came across the problem that
they're solving and why the problem is
so big and the reason that many of you
do this is that because you're all very
ambitious people you want to solve these
big problems that are you know plaguing
the world and and you're really excited
about why but but here's the problem if
you've already gotten you know 30
seconds into a pitch and you're talking
about the problem
I still don't know what you or your
company does I've zoned out so for
example someone will say my mother was a
small business owner and I saw her
spending you know 30 hours per week like
blah blah blah and and like you've
already zoned out like yeah I have no
idea what this company does and and so I
would recommend starting with one
sentence that tells you what it is tells
your audience what it is you're doing
and then you can give them more
backstory once you have them hooked so
here's a second problem that I come
across pretty much every day is
meaningless jargon so this is a tweet
from a former partner Gary tan who used
to work with that and he's expressing a
pain that I feel acutely he said
meaningless jargon is the number one
issue I spend time trying to fight when
helping startups we've read so many
pitches that have zero informational
content in them so for example here's an
actual startup pitch indie cloud is a
know-how and synergy platform don't say
 like that
this says zero informational content you
have no idea what indie cloud does so
indie cloud one way that you can tell
whether your pitch is good is if someone
in the audience has some idea of how
they might replicate the idea that
you're trying to communicate so indie
cloud as a know-how synergy platform
could be something like slack it could
be something like you know some asana it
could be it could be one of like
thousands if not you know millions of
products out there and so what you want
to do again is to try to communicate an
idea that your audience or even your
audience of one can can figure out how
to replicate in their head and so this
is another thing that I recommend you
not do ramble if you make it you know 30
seconds and you you know there's a long
preamble you've already zoned out so
here is the actual pitch that Airbnb
used on their YC application we built
the first online marketplace that lets
travelers book rooms with locals instead
of hotels
that's pretty straightforward it's
descriptive there's no jargon it's you
know there's no long preamble you can
tell what they do you can you have a
sense of what you need to build to
replicate this I mean it's I think it's
a really tight description and so for us
when we're reading applications we're
reading hundreds if not thousands of
applications we have to understand in
that first sentence what it is you do or
you know we we sort of lose focus and so
here's an example of a company that went
through Y Combinator last year kowler is
the Fitbit for dairy cows so uh I found
this one when I was looking through
applications super compelling and so one
of the things that I would say is it's
it's pithy it's short and one of the
things that you want to do is when your
picture your company's someone you want
to look them in the eye and you want
them to follow up with a question so
when I saw this I was like I have so
many questions I was like why do you
dairy cows need to track their health
and why did does anyone need to moderate
monitor it and how big of a market is
this how big of a problem and so that's
what you want to do with your short
pitch you want to hook someone you want
to compel them you want it to be short
enough for them to say to follow-up you
don't need to give them all the answers
upfront you want them to come at you
with the questions and so here you can
sort of understand what is you know the
problem they're trying to solve and who
they're trying to solve it for which is
the main thing you want to get across in
this pitch and so some people ask me
whether this x4y construction works and
by that I mean x4y being uber for X or
Airbnb for X some people say should I
not use sort of this analogy because
it's it's cliched or overused and let's
be honest like we've all heard too many
pitches for uber for X right everybody's
heard like everyone's like doing I knew
before X or you know you know it's
tinder for X and and so it is oftentimes
or maybe perhaps most times overuse but
there are some good reasons to use this
X
why convention and so here for example
is in YC alum that went through last
year right electric is Boeing for
electric airplanes they described
themselves as Boeing for electric
airplanes that I feel like that paints a
pretty clear picture of what they do and
it uses very few words and so I think
that it's it works like the x4y analogy
if it is the best way to paint a clear
picture of what you're building really
quickly I think it makes sense to use it
but he you know and here are some rules
if you're thinking about calling
yourself the X for Y V Boeing for
electric airplanes if you're using this
construction here are some of the rules
you should follow X should be a
household name something that is
universally recognized so you know
whether it's Facebook or Boeing or you
know a large major ideally
billion-dollar company it should be
fairly obvious secondly why why would
want X so for example another company
that went through YC last year was
Salesforce for churches like that you
know churches to me that seems like a
really you know huge market which is
number three and it also seems fairly
reasonably obvious why churches would
want to track all of their you know all
the people the constituents essentially
so it should be fairly obvious why why
would want X and it should be clear that
Y is a huge market so here's one that I
didn't love that went through YC last
year originally they call themselves
buffer for snapchat so buffer is a
company that's doing reasonably well but
I you know most people it's not a
household name so if you have to Google
buffer if you've to Google the you know
X then that's I don't think a clear
enough picture that you're painting and
it's not a good reason to use this
construction and so to review the best
short pitches are descriptive their
conversational you don't use any jargon
there's no long winded preamble to get
to the point and it's concise
and so now that you sort of know how to
build a great short pitch I'll talk to
you about the real secret to building
something that people really want to
talk about and are excited about and
that's essentially making something
people want uh that's why C's motto and
so that's one of the things that we
really focus on it YC is are you
actually making something people want
and and basically the way that you know
that you're building something people
want is actually building a product even
the very first early version of it and
getting it out to users that's those are
the two things that we say you should be
doing during the YC program the only two
things building products and talking to
users and so what you'll want to do is
get that early product into people's
hands and watch people actually use it
sit down with them offer people in a
random coffee shop offer to buy them
coffee if they'll look at your product
do anything you can to get some actual
real strangers using your product rather
than you know your your parents or your
you know your friends because they're
probably not going to be that honest
with you and so this is gonna be
obviously manual at first talking to
users but as a start-up as a start-up
founder you have that's one of your
superpowers you can do a lot of things
manually that big companies don't have
time to do and so let's see where we're
at
so to recap really quickly as I was
saying a clear idea is the foundation
for growth and communicating that as
simply as possible so that anyone can
understand it and pitch it for you pitch
it back to you is is the way to like
lodge yourself into people's brains and
then second of course is you should make
something people want
and so now I'm happy to take any
questions and I'm Pat man you're like
I'm a partner at YC and if you have any
questions that I don't have time to get
to today my email is here and you're
welcome to email or tweet at me thank
you so much Pat thanks so just for the
process we have slide oh and you can
choose the questions in front of
if we run out of questions we have a
catch box which we will throw at you if
you have a question and we get to it you
can raise your hat but only after that
oh okay what is the best pitch I've seen
and why there's so many I'm like cycling
through hundreds in my head right now
and so I'm going to tell you a few that
just jumped out at me it might not be
the best of all time but the ones that
jump out at me so color I think about
which is the Fitbit for cows is one that
I loved in an application just because I
had so many questions I didn't realize
that was a market one I saw that also
went through YC called themselves the
Palantir for potatoes basically they
were building a you know a tool that
helped farmers track all their analytics
and data and one one that I love is a
company that pivoted they were
originally in YC building a blood
pressure monitoring app and then they
during the batch they launched something
and their short pitch was if you text
this number will make anything happen
like magic and they were called magic
and overnight somewhat their friend they
just gave this number to friends and
family and one of their friends posted
it on Reddit one of their friends posted
on a hacker news and overnight 40,000
people signed up for their service and
started texting that number and so it
was a short pitch it was clear what they
did it was uh and it was obviously
tapping into something that people
really really want it because overnight
40,000 people signed up so that to me
those are sort of the three that
randomly occurred to me right now and so
what is the future of pitching so any
new tools so who tools in terms of
building pitches I don't have anything
for you but one thing that I will
recommend is that why see when we have
companies launch we a lot of times we'll
have them launch on product hunt as one
of their very first times or launching
to a community online and product hunt
honestly it's it's basically a reddit
for product so every day you can go on
product hunt comm and see some of the
top products in them from around the
world that are launching and people
upload the question
people upload the products and you can
kind of talk to the founders and doing a
Q&amp;amp;A and so they sometimes the founders
will sort of test their pitch out on
that community and and iterate based on
their feedback and what's interesting is
that if you have a product that people
can sign up for if it's if you have
something that is self-serve it converts
product cont has converted better for
many of our startups than TechCrunch or
any like any press so it's a friendly
community I'm it's it's a way to sort of
test out your messaging on a friendly
community of other founders and makers
and some investors are in there too
let's see so sometimes good speakers are
not good pictures what's the difference
oh yes we get a lot of founders who come
in and they are like reasonably good
speakers but they are and they're you
know compelling presences but they're
not always good pictures because you
have to sometimes you know as I said
sometimes they're very ambitious people
wanting to solve big problems sometimes
they ramble sometimes they'll go on and
on about you know the particular problem
they're solving especially if they're
deeply technical they'll get into a lot
of really deep technical jargon or a lot
of folks that we work with who are in
the hard sciences biotech will use a lot
of very you know scientific or technical
jargon that the vast majority of the
world can't understand so even if
they're compelling speakers you still
have to sort of work on a pitch that
anyone can kind of repeat and and work
with you and anyone can understand and
alright very much that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
