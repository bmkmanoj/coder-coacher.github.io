email and I know you'll love working
with email so just quick show of hands
who has at some point built an HTML
email at some point okay so that's us
for the most you okay and who out of you
really enjoyed that and think it's much
better than building websites yeah it's
a tough crowd
okay so I am Mike Robbins I build email
I haven't professionally worked on a web
site for probably coming up for three
years
and I specialize in interactive email so
I'm going to go and to sort of explain
what interactive emote is and what you
can do with it I work for a company
called rebel mail and we are just we
just do interactive email and I think
with the only company who is just doing
interactive email we don't do anything
else at the moment and yeah so follow
along with give me a shout on online and
on Twitter em underscore John school
Robbins and also at go rebel mail I'm on
the the slack group smashing comp so
send me stuff on there and tweeting your
questions and come find me afterwards
and ask me stuff and it all will be good
so what is interactive email this is a
definition I came up with myself
it's an action taking an email that
triggers an event within the same email
so traditionally with email is you sends
something out you've got some images in
it got some text you got some links you
click on a link you go through the
website and you do stuff with
interactive email what we're trying to
get is we get that do stuff and we put
it directly into the inbox so you're
getting instant things happening
directly in the email so I'm going to
show you oh yes
there's different types of interaction
so how we don't have JavaScript in email
so we have to do everything with CSS and
HTML so I group these interactions into
sort of two
two styles of interaction there's the
fleeting interaction and sort of a more
static interaction so fleeting
interactions are things like hover focus
and active things we've probably all
used the reason I call it fleeting
interaction is because the hover there
that code is applied for as long as I'm
hovering as soon as I stop hovering that
code is no longer applied same with
focus as long as it's in focus so you
tap onto it or click onto it and then
active is just as long as the mouse
button is down that's active
what's interesting which I think it's
interesting you can combine focus and
hover if you do it in that order but
otherwise you can't combine much but
that that little trick can give you a
few extra things you can do there so the
other type is these static interactions
commonly known as checkbox hack some of
you may have used this come across it
before the idea here is I've got a
checkbox over here
check box over there it's a bit small
they don't scale up very very well on
the big screen so I'm sorry about that
and then next to that input there is
this block of code so if that checkbox
is checked then style is applied onto
the block of code next to it so if input
is checks or using this check selector
add in the plus which is a sibling
selector and then the code so we can
apply styles onto the code from the
checked value of this checkbox and the
reason I say this is static rather than
the fleeting interactions is because
this is a user has chosen to click on
this to trigger these stylings and to
remove it they have to choose to click
on it again and I can go back a page and
look these won't last and then go
forward again and I'm back into this and
it's still holding that check value so
although it's commonly called the check
box hack I use it more for radio buttons
works exactly the same way with the
radio buttons so here we've got three if
I check that one the styles are applied
there but what's cool with radio buttons
is you have your radio buttons you group
them in
can array which grouped with the name
attributes so all through these radio
buttons have got the same name on them
and if I check the second radio button
the check value is lost from the first
one and it's moved on to the second one
so you can only have one radio button in
this array checks at a time so that
leads into quite a few possibilities and
then same again with the third one I was
just messing around with the animation
but just change it up a little so this
can take me on to my first example this
one oops
there's my mouse con so this email we
built for Airbnb I'll just stretch that
down a bit so you can see a bit better
so here oh no it's there cool we've got
this photo gallery inside of an email so
when it loaded up you can see this is
just going through the photos there's a
bit of CSS animation on there just to go
through and sort of show what the
gallery kit does and then when you click
on it to interact with it that
animations pause and now you've got
manual control so if you think about
this with the radio buttons we've got
four radio buttons here one for each of
the four images so if I check the first
radio button this is the first radio
button is checked and then this image is
shown second one checked third one so on
so these are coming becoming more and
more common in email now we're seeing
these these galleries and it's probably
one of the most common things is
galleries the other one which you
probably see a little bit more of is
hamburger menus we just click and then
you get your navigation expand out
that's just simply a checkbox expanding
out to show the content so that you
start to see them a bit more still like
you know a bit on the edge but you
hopefully will be seeing more of this in
your inbox soon just another thing we've
got in this email which I quite like is
good
search box at the top here so where do
you want to go let's go to Brighton
that's where I live and it loads up if
we've got Internet yes and then you go
straight into Airbnb results for
Brighton so that's just the simple form
right
okay back to my slides okay so that's
just the simple form submit with a text
text input so you can you can submit
anything in a form but the support isn't
quite right widespread enough but I'll
go into the support later and how to
target the support but we've had quite a
bit of success doing things with forms
with reviews we did very well with some
campaigns with reviews in email so
instead of saying click here go to our
website and then leave a review it's
just straight away what do you think and
then that engages people much earlier
and actually that one of the campaigns
we did with that doubled the conversion
of the reviews so talk a bit about
progressive enhancement with this as I
say this isn't supported everywhere
email is a tricky tricky environment to
work in there are so many different
email clients if you're building
something for the way of you checking it
in Firefox Chrome Safari Opera iOS
Android Blackberry Windows Phone if you
want to do all that and for email we
check check Gmail make sure this works
in Gmail in on Chrome and Gmail and
Firefox then on Safari
then you know all the way through on
mobile and they're not actually checking
the mobile apps like the Android app and
the IRAs are quite different and then
you're checking inbox by Gmail which is
a completely different thing it renders
slightly differently so check that
across everything and then if you've got
an at gmail address that will render
differently to if you've got something
for a pop or IMAP if you've got images
turned on by default that renders
slightly differently so if you've got
the images turned off by default even
after you turn the images on it still
renders slightly differently so it's
quite tricky and that's just looking at
Gmail then we've got start looking at
yahoo then AOL then everything else so
sort of simplify things a little bit in
in my head we group all these email
clients into sort of three three buckets
I guess of static limited and
interactive so static is what everybody
said
the moment pretty much it's just text
and images you can't do anything that
exciting with her
so here I've just got an image limited
it's got some limited interactivity so I
can just click through this gallery and
see some nice pictures so for limited we
need this checked selector and we need
the sibling selector to work and then we
can we can start building stuff like
that and we use a coding technique which
I'll call nested labels I'll get into
that a bit more in a minute interactive
we've just add a few more little
features to this here you can see I've
just got a transition between the slides
whereas on the limited version it just
jumps sharply the interactive it's got a
nice soft transition also I've got these
buttons on the side so I can just
continually scroll all the way through
the images so to get that extra those
extra features we use the we need
support for the general sibling selector
which is this they're all sort of tilde
or tied or squiggly line whatever you
want to call it and also there for
attributes
on labels which is stripped out and a
few email points so if we've got that
then we've got full interactive support
and actually also there that coincides
with the WebKit based email clients and
the WebKit based email clients are
basically like a modern browser without
position fixed or position sticky
otherwise it's pretty much just like a
modern browser and they account for
quite a significant market share and for
this way to get the interactivity into
the fully interactive fancy email
clients we use a technique which I call
punch card coding and I'll go into that
a bit more in a moment so the way these
sort of nested labels work for our
limited email clients without the four
attributes on the label we can't check
or uncheck the radio button or checkbox
but if you nest if you put the radio
button directly inside a label then
clicking anywhere inside
that label is going to check that radio
button however there is a label nested
inside that label so then checking
anywhere inside that label is going to
check that radio button and then inside
that is another one so this is the code
from the gallery it's slightly
simplified slightly stripped back but
it's basically the same code so here we
have a radio button and then an image
given the image in it so if that input
is checked and it has a sibling of the
div then we're going to display that
block otherwise just imagine they're all
display:none so if that top input is
checked then that top image is shown
then if I check the second input that
check value is lost from the top input
and applied to the second radio button
and then that image will be shown and so
on also we have here the thumbnails at
the bottom just down here I can reach
these ones then we've got the thumbnails
down here so you can see what's selected
we have we use this border color red
around outside of the thumbnail so if
the inputs checked so let's imagine this
top inputs checked that's a sibling of a
div which is for the image so I'm just
losing my microphone there we go it's a
sibling of the div which is the image
then it's the sibling of a label and
that label comes all the way down here
so closes off here and then Isis Ibelin
of this thumbnail which will then apply
the border color red when that's checked
so all adds up like that so we can then
expand on that and build something a bit
more complicated so here I've got some
example of some filters so we've used
these filters for a number of different
brands we've worked with filtering
everything's off you know you can filter
products by customer rating by you know
genre by color by size whatever you want
so I thought I'll build something a
little bit different for the conference
and I've built this smashing conference
San Francisco game of guess who so guess
who great game you have
a series of faces sawed off used all the
speakers here and then you ask a few
questions and try and guess who I'm
thinking of
so I'm just going to pick one of these
at random go on and then I'm going to go
through the questions and see if we can
work out who it's I'm thinking of so
first of all we go for gender and I'm
thinking of a fella so click on that and
you've just filtered out all the female
speaks and just have the male speakers
there again for us to click there you
can see as well the female speakers and
in the reset so here it's three radio
buttons grouped together with the name
of gender and then you've got male
female and reset the reset one is just
there to take the checked value away
from either of the other two so I'm
thinking of thinking of a guy and then
does he wear glasses there's a couple of
people with glasses there so I'm gonna
say no to the glasses and that's them
gone and then you think how long has his
hair this says long there is
so you just filter down each one so it's
like having three galleries inside each
other
nested inside each other so this is
nesting the nesting approach so the code
gets pretty crazy also another thing
we've got here if I was just to say
somebody with glasses and that matches
that it doesn't match so you filtered
out all the speakers so you can add in
custom messages for that and at the
bottom here we've got a reset all button
so the reset all works differently to
the other resets the other resets of
radio buttons this one is a form reset
button so B button type equals reset and
what that will do is just reset the form
to the default value when you open the
webpage or email rather oops so if I was
just to click that everybody's back
again so oops get rid of this one so
here's a little bit of a bit of code
from that it's so as you can see if if
you've got gender males checks then
anything then that's the sibling of
something which is slipping or something
which so they've got a wrapper around
all the speakers and then inside that if
they've got the class of filter female
then all the way down the bottom here
it's set to max height max weight zero
so it just gives that little transition
between rather than displaying on so you
can layer all that up I was going to
show the nested labels but I couldn't
quite get it to fit on a slide nicely
it's a bit too big so this takes the
sort of the next sort of bit more
advanced interactivity that we can do
and this is the technique that I call
punch-card coding so the reason I call
it punch-card coding is I was working on
this email while ago and it was getting
quite complicated and I have all these
radio buttons
and I decided okay I'm gonna click to
display them so I can see what's going
on and understand the functionality a
bit better so did that and it looked a
little something like that and I saw
that and straightway I thought it looks
like a punch card so next the picture on
the right there next to it is an old IBM
punch card and the way these punch card
computers work is you have a card of a
defined shape and size like that with a
number of places where you could
potentially punch a hole in it or not
and leave it as a default value of
unpunched so the same with the radio
buttons you can either have it checked
or its default value which is unchecked
so then also you can think of that as
it's like a true or false value or you
could think of it as ones and zeroes and
then you start stringing that together
as ones and zeros and you've got binary
and when you got binary you can build
anything
almost yeah so then I know and that made
cleared everything up for me in my head
because I was already using this
technique but I couldn't quite
understand what it was I was doing which
happens a lot so once I understood that
then it made a lot more sense that I
could put all these radio buttons
together and then string together logic
based on their values so they all need
to be siblings so we need to have
everything as a sibling of each other so
what we have here is we have all the
radio buttons in this big group at the
very top of the email and then below
that we have this wrapper around
everything else so we hide the radio
buttons and then everything you see is
inside the wrapper so then you can
change any of the radio buttons and then
which would affect anything inside the
wrapper then in the wrapper you just dot
around the load of labels with the four
attributes to correspond to the radio
buttons and then when you string it
together this is just a little an
example of how you're stirring it
together at the bottom here so if you
imagine you've got a few groups of radio
buttons item ABCD efg
in item a the third radio button is
checked
that's a sibling of b6 which is checked
which is sipping a CT which is checked
with your sibling of D 11 which is
checked which is a sibling of a 5 which
is not checked so any other value of
this item 5 could be checked or none of
them at all have checked just as long as
5 isn't checked that's the sipping of F
2 which is checked which is a sibling of
G 5 which is checked which is sibling of
the wrapper which is wrapping out all
our content and inside that wrapper have
a class of food set it's playing on so
it's quite sort of a complicated set of
rules just to hide something but as just
sort of to explain how it works a little
bit so I'm going to show you an example
of this in action all right so where is
that one
so this is a concept email I built a
little while ago so this isn't something
that's actually being sent out but it's
yeah it does work and this has all the
full-backs in it appropriately so here
this is a abandoned car email so I've
been on this website I've looked at
these products and I wanted to buy a
pair of trousers and two identical
hoodies and a pair of socks and then I
decided not to check out and I've gone
away so a few days later get an email
with all the products in it it's sort of
common practice in email marketing this
abandoned car thing so there's a few
cool features in this email first one is
the quantity so I've changed minds
I don't want to identical hoodies I just
want one of them so I can change the
quantity there they can go all the way
up to five and get five of them and
adjust it like that so this is again
it's just radio buttons so I've got the
possible quantity of up to five and also
got as possible quantity of zero so that
gives us six radio buttons so for each
of these three items there are six radio
buttons I shall just tell you now
quickly there are 117 radio buttons in
this email there's also four checkboxes
and a couple of other things also I
should point out with email just before
I show you the rest of this you have a
file size limit of 102 kilobytes so you
have to keep all your HTML and CSS below
that so that's not including your image
sizes otherwise it would be different
tricky but so you 102 kilobytes to fit
everything in
so as I'm thinking through this price or
this price here you can see it's
changing the total price at the end here
it's also chasing that down the bottom
changing the subtotal the tax discounts
and the total price so there's two ways
we can do this the first way which we
worked on was working out every possible
combination of prices so if you've got
six possible combination for each for
each product and then that's three
products
and then you can it got complicated but
the idea would be to list out all the
possible combinations and then show and
hide those prices depending on what
selected that's too complicated and it
takes up and that itself would take up
102 kilobytes so instead we use CSS
counters so CSS counters normally are
used for things like ordered lists
possibly page numbers paragraph numbers
but most people use CSS counters with a
default value which is increasing as one
every time but actually you can set
custom value on it so if you look at
those socks there there's one pair of
one pair of socks and that's $12 so we
have a counter increment of the line
title of the socks to be 12 it's
actually 1,200 because you can't have
decimal places in encounters so we've
got 12 and if I increase that to a
quantity 2 then we changed that counter
increment to 24 and I've changed it up 3
we could change that to 36 that's also
reflected we're changing increase in the
counter increments on the subtotal
counter the tax counter the discount
counter and the total price counter so
actually that reduces the code a lot
more than the other option but still
quite quite a bit so not the cool thing
with this email so I'm not looking at
this hoodie and then I'm getting five of
them so I've got make sure I like it so
I'm not sure I'm keen on the color so
I'm just going to click through and load
a new page although it's not loading a
new page because we can't do that an
email that will be loading loading a
website and as I said at the beginning
we don't want to be loading a website
we're trying to keep everything in the
email so what we have here this
particular email has got six pages on it
or pages each one is basically a div
with an ID with an idea of page one two
three four five six which is related to
a radio button so when the radio button
for page two is checked check page two
is shown so then in here as well for
each of the products we have a image
gallery so I can look through it we've
got some other options as well we've got
color so quite like the red one and I
can change the size and put up to a
large and just go back to the shopping
cart and then also in here you see the
thumbnail image has updated because all
the radio buttons at the very top of
email I can update any page with as long
as I go so thumbnail image has changed
the text has changed here for the name
of the color and the size has changed
there also we've got a couple of extra
products at the bottom here which you
can add in just a little option to add
this one in there we go if we go back
then you can see that's a different
extra products so if just it's not just
the three we've actually got five
products in this email so now I'm happy
with my order and I want to want to buy
it so I'll go to the website and I'll
buy it but I don't have to go to the
website to it to do it I'm just gonna do
all in an email server just scroll down
here and I've built the concept here is
I've already shopped with this brand
before I've already bought things with
them so they already have my credit card
details and file they already have my
shipping address on file so I just click
buy now obviously I haven't selected
things so it's not going to submit yet
so I'm gonna go for a shipping address
and select Mountain View it's not for
credit cards I'll use my Amex and then
that is reflected through here so these
drop-down menus they're not select menus
these are done with radio buttons and
CSS because select menus you can't track
what's happening in there but with the
radio buttons you can and you can edit
what's displayed because of the radio
buttons as well and then I just want to
click here as well just to check to
confirm I'm absolutely happy I know what
I'm doing I know I'm going to make a
purchase just to and then you click the
Buy Now and you'll submit the order it's
just a form submit just like we used for
the search box in the Airbnb email and
or submit all this information to the
server goes off to the warehouse they
fill the order and send off to the
delivery company charge the card and it
all go through but what we're submitting
here we're not submitting your your card
details we're saying okay you've
selected shipping address number one and
card number two so it's not submitting
any personal or private details
it's just yet the product one quantity -
and it's all encoded like that so this
port fir for all of this is varied if
you look at Outlook on the end there
it's all red nothing works in Outlook
they still use Microsoft Word as their
rendering engine but that's okay you
know each their own and I've got a
market share up there as well which you
can see so the market share is taken
from a website called email client
market share com it's quite descriptive
title and that is a website put together
by litmus and litmus if you don't know
them great company they do email testing
software and they do analytics and part
of their analytics is they share all
this information so this is based on one
point three four billion opens in March
of this year and although one point
three four billion opens 42 percent of
those were on an iOS device and iOS is
brilliant because everything works and
now it's all green another seven percent
were on Apple Mail or possibly Outlook
on the Mac because the tracking can't
quite differentiate the two and that's
all good as well so we've got quite good
support actually when you when you start
adding these up it's actually really
good support iOS Apple Mail and Android
are all WebKit based email clients and
they
basically have everything you have in
WebKit apart from yeah part from
position fixed position sticky you've
even got grid
we've got grid CSS grid in email and it
works it's a bit tricky with the
full-backs but it works a couple other
things to look at here is Gmail there
it's grayed out in the the limited
support Gmail used to have really good
support for all those of limited
interactivity until I think it's in
September last year they announced
they're gonna start supporting media
queries which is good they were already
supporting media queries but only on web
mail and not on mobile so then they
started supporting it on mobile which is
good but with that they stripped out a
load of other stuff which is a bit
annoying so Gmail you still got hover
but you haven't got any of the cool
stuff another one to mention is Android
with the form submit the form submit
works fine you can submit the form but
if you've got using text inputs androids
got this bug where you click on the text
input in the keyboard doesn't show so
you can copy and paste text into an
input but the keyboard doesn't show so
you can't yeah so you have to hide the
form the whole form on Android if you
have one text input in it which is
frustrating so with all these different
email clients and that's varying support
we need to be able to target some of
them to get these little hacks to make
them work make them more cooperate so
it's just a few of my favorite ones
there's hundreds and hundreds of hacks
hundreds of different email clients each
one of them can probably be targeted
somehow if you put enough time into it
so first off outlook on the desktop this
is on my windows this is not on Mac cuz
on Mac it's good and it's WebKit and
Windows it's not in its word rendering
but you can use conditional comments
like just like you used to use for ie so
this is if MSO so if Microsoft Office
and then anything you put in there will
render on outlooking you can do the
reverse of that so it'll won't render on
outlook will render on everything else
it's a
outlook.com which is this up the webmail
version of Outlook if you put this
attribute selector in front of it this
OWA attribute sector it just stands for
Outlook Web App and it doesn't matter
what put text you put in there it makes
it clearer when you're reading through
the codes that you know this is the hack
for Outlook
there is no attribute of OWA so that's
not valid code but outlook.com will
strip that out boot out and still render
the rest of the code so actually little
strips out that o w18 just left with dot
foo and then apply your class next
through all pretty easy thunderbird
wraps the whole of your code with a
class or Moz text HTML samsung s4 s wrap
with a idea of sect 'iv and the S five
six and seven wrap with an idea of
message webview I haven't got an s8 yet
but hopefully I'll get one soon and my
favorite one AOL did you know you can
use unicode characters as classes and
ID's that's cool right some email
clients support that some don't no
that's okay AOL is the only email client
that supports an Unicode on a class but
not on an ID so if you put on an
element's you add class star ID star
then you can use this a selector to say
okay we're looking for something with a
class of star but not an ID so that will
only apply to AOL Gmail changes the
doctype to a empty.you tag so and then
that will be a sibling of the body so
you had a class of body onto the body or
doesn't have to be that so then that
would target Gmail if you want to there
are ways to split up the different
versions of Gmail a bit as well and
Yahoo's similar to the way the Apple
accom hack works Yahoo will strip
unknown names out of media queries and
then just render it as is but everything
else will look at and say media screen'
Yahoo means nothing but Yahoo will strip
out the word Yahoo and it will render it
so again that doesn't need to be the
word Yahoo it's just there to make it a
bit easier to read
cool so I've got some fun examples now
this is the fun stuff so I've been
playing around recently with 3d CSS and
so there's a website I don't know if you
know it but definitely worth checking
out called Tridev comm trid IV calm when
it's like a 3d drawing package the
exports as CSS and this x-wing is one of
their examples so I didn't I didn't draw
this I wish I had it it's really cool
and so I just took the code of the
example and I thought I wonder if I work
in an email I put it in sent it and it
works that's cool but the thing with 3d
is you need to be able to see around it
because otherwise that could just be an
image for it to be 3d I want to be able
to look around it so I built this sort
3d viewer so I can rotate the 3d on sort
of x axis on the y axis and on a Zed
axis you also I boost off into the
distance if you want so the way this
works if I just put these these grids on
there to reset it as well so I've added
these grids so you can sort of see
what's happening a bit so I've wrapped
this 3d code in three dips one of them
has animation to rotate X 1 has
animation to rotate Y 1 has an animation
to rotate said all those animations are
set to paused until I click on the
button and then I'm using that active
selector which we had right at the
beginning of the talk was talking about
that active selector when you click on
active if the button is active then the
play state is set to running so then
that will rotate and then this is
rotating that outer div which contains
everything so this will rotate all of it
then inside that I have another another
div so this is only going to rotate this
middle bit of content and then rotate a
bit more it's a little bit jump
sometimes and then here I can rotate
that separately and then the boost is
another div on the inside which just
translate Zed and pushes it off into the
distance the reset the reset button on
this is another type of reset I've
worked on the reset button is when the
reset button is active it changes the
animation name of the three containing
elements to none animation none isn't
really a valid thing but doesn't matter
what you put in there all I'm doing is
taking their animation States the
original animation off it and then when
you release the button
an original animation is replaced onto
it but at the very start of the
animation so it'll reset it back to its
default position so I like I like this
idea of this sort of 3d CSS and I was
wondering if I could take it a little
bit further and do something a bit a bit
more cool in it so do you guys like
nineties computer games yeah did anybody
remember the first ever first-person
shooter game of Wolfenstein 3d so I
thought right can I build Wolfenstein in
email I thought this come to all of us
one time or another so here you can just
walk forward walk back
shimmy left and then rotate a bit as
well so this is using the same concept
as I had with x-wing wherein butt in
front with the x-wing and it was in
front of me the codes in front of you
there and it's moving things around
what's happening here is is sort of
putting it around yourself so it's
almost like is if you're I've got a big
box and put it over your head move the
box forward it looks like you're walking
forwards rotate the box it looks like
you're turning but it's actually it's
just all an illusion so then we can just
walk around here turn the corner Oh
and there's a little fellow there I need
to shoot him it's just a checkbox you
just click on the checkbox it's just a
label with animation on it and you click
the label checkboxes checked and it
changes the animation to him dying
although actually it's not a checkbox
because originally I made it with a
checkbox but with the checkbox if I
click it again it's gonna come he's
going to come back to life so I'm using
a radio button but it's only one radio
button in there and the array so I can't
uncheck it and then we just got if we
walk down the corridor a bit turn the
corner there's a baddie I've updated the
graphics but he might look familiar
and then you can go oh no I've got a bug
in it so he should be dying now who
built this thing okay yeah whoops let's
get rid of that but it's all on on code
pen as well that's my code pen at the
bottom there it's just cope ender io
port slash AB underscore Jones school
Robbins so you can have a look it up
there if you do look at it on code pen
look at it in Chrome because there's
bugs in are the other places it's a bit
tricky so have a look at that and have
play around with it for kin comment on
it and mess about so I've just got one
more example to show you and that's this
one here and that's this presentation is
in Apple Mail
