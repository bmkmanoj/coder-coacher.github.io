programming language there's it is often
compared superficially to go there's
kind of two types of people who discuss
rust and go there's the people who
understand each languages target
applications and then there's the people
who think they're competitors
goes a language for sis admin's rust is
a language for systems level programming
rust has a high priority on safety and
performance so if you've ever managed
memory before you'll know that it's easy
to make mistakes and the other very
salient feature of rust is it has a
unique and somewhat famous community we
have a strong code of conduct that says
thou shalt be constructive thou shalt
not be a jerk and here is what we will
do and how we will remind you not to and
then remove you if you continue this
makes it controversial among the people
who don't want to work in a moderated
constructive community so the buzzwords
that you'll hear around rust are
pursuing the trifecta of safety speed
and concurrency I find that a little
funny because easy concurrency falls out
of the safety priorities that rust has
rust pursues memory safety without
garbage collection prioritizes zero cost
abstractions and the real motto is hack
without fear if you're not totally
comfortable with this whole memory
safety and garbage collection thing the
long story short is that your computer
has a bunch of spaces where it can store
little bits of information and get back
to it fast and since these are finite
you need to reuse them at some point if
you mess up in reusing them you try to
reuse it too soon you leave something
there that you shouldn't have all kinds
of problems and soon various languages
have various approaches to preventing
these problems see and other low-level
languages basically say here are the
principles to how to do it right you're
smart
follow those principles oh what's that
your codebase is tens of thousands of
lines long and you're accessing the same
piece of memory from 14 different places
oh just just keep following the rules
you're smart
you can do it many interpreted languages
use garbage collection they say no just
I'm just gonna stop when we need more
memory or at a certain time pause for a
moment go through all of the memory and
sort things out the way they should be
this creates a pause that can be
noticeable on lower performance devices
and so refs doesn't consider that an
acceptable solution whereas rust
addresses the problem of memory
management by mathematically proving the
correctness of the program at compile
time it uses the abstractions that we'll
talk about throughout this talk to
guarantee that it's impossible for the
program to break those rules that older
languages say yeah you should just know
it and just do it yourself a bit of
history on rest the language has been
around since sometime in 2010 I don't
know how long graden was thinking about
that beforehand it was really based on a
lifetime of experience from the many
compiler authors rust 1.0 stable was
released in May 2015
so the stable rest is hitting about two
years old we're currently up to version
one point fourteen point zero this is we
release a new stable version every six
weeks and Russ 2.0 would be a breaking
change backwards so that is not on the
roadmap the number will just keep going
up in the middle there and rust is a
project that was originated by a
mozillian when he was working at Mozilla
many of the core team and rust team
members are employed by Mozilla but it's
strictly a sponsorship and support
relationship if let's say the CEO of
Mozilla decided hey Russ needs green
threads again and tried to tell them to
they'd be like ah you can submit an RFC
and we can discuss it but no so it is it
is not owned by any particular company
it is owned by the group of contributors
to it
some projects written in rust that you
might have heard about the servo browser
engine is also being developed within
Mozilla to improve Firefox's performance
ultimately and Jack gave a fantastic
talk about that yesterday so you can
pull up that record recording the shift
guys have recently released habitat
which is I'm just gonna say
infrastructure tooling because if I
to be more specific I will get the but
it can also do that other thing as many
infrastructure cooling systems tend to
be Dropbox users rest quite a bit
internally I find that interesting
because they've considered a variety of
recent languages what's cool to play
with and they picked rest for its
performance and if you want to see more
projects that use rest
check out the friends page if your
company is betting money on rest using
rest in production at some point and
isn't on that friends page pull requests
are welcome you can help us fix that so
under what circumstances should you use
rest speed and safety are critical we'll
set it above any old scripting language
if you're targeting at any architecture
that LLVM supports you will have a
pretty straightforward time getting rest
on it if that support isn't there
already if not you may be better off
waiting for LLVM or working on that
support first because we take advantage
of a variety of the speed ups that LLVM
has learned to use over the years and if
your team likes learning new technology
I see a lot of companies using rest
almost as a reward for their engineers
because they get a shiny new toy as it
were and the obligatory when might you
not want to use rest if you're on a heck
of a deadline and you don't have time to
go spend a few months learning a new
language and getting comfortable with it
rust is probably not a good thing to
adopt if you need to reuse giant chunks
of code that's written in another
language rust may or may not be
appropriate there are a variety of
efforts to work on porting other code to
rest and interfacing between rest and
other code you can hear about the state
of some of them on Friday at 120 and
Tasmin BC and if your company or people
on your team are just not willing to
abide by the rest communities code of
conduct they're going to have a very
unpleasant experience trying to get help
so those are kind of unusual but Russ
may not always be the right answer for
you so any questions at the moment about
rusts place in the world and what's
going on here nope cool yep
yes yes there is a footnote about
mentioning corrode it cannot translate
all see yet but it translates some see
and it is under active involvement and
sponsored by a mozilla grant he has
successfully translated CVS in a way
that passes the tests because there's an
awful lot of code that lives in CVS so
now let's talk about getting rest
running how we're doing on time we are
doing excellently on time so rust comes
out in three different channels there is
nightly which we try to release every
night every once in a while and nightly
will fail because some change got
introduced that doesn't quite build
somewhere although we attempt to prevent
that and nightly is where we try cool
new ideas that have made it through the
request for comment process not all
features in nightly make it to stable
and a feature can often live in nightly
for a very long time before we figure
out the story for how it should be
stabilized there is the beta channel
that you will see when you're given an
option to download various artifacts
which are released candidates for stable
I don't know if any project that chooses
beta and is like let's pin ourselves to
beta as opposed to just using the stable
that's out and the stable versions of
rest we promise we'll always be
backwards compatible you can check out
the rest 1.0 release blog there in the
footnote for the details on that but we
bend over backwards to try to make sure
that no stable will break code that
worked in the last one so which channel
should you be using it depends on the
project stable code should run on any
beta and pretty much should run on any
nightly although night leaves are a
little bit wild west there may be
temporarily a bug in a nightly that
keeps your stable code from running on
it generally when in doubt pick stave
go as far as you can with stable and you
will probably eventually run into a
compelling reason to use nightly if you
need some feature that's not yet
stabilized if you need to pull in a
dependency that requires nightly and so
forth but you'll know when it's time
because suddenly things will stop
working and all of the code that you've
written on stable will just keep workin
transparently so you you will know when
it's time to make that switch but if you
can write your library and only stable
arrest that's a really good practice so
I said that we make a great effort to
make sure that no stable breaks the code
ran on the previous one one of the ways
that we do that is with a fantastic tool
that Brian Anderson wrote called crater
and what crater does is it finds all of
the rust code that we know about we
define this as all of the publicly
published libraries of rest code and it
tries to compile them all with the old
stable and it tries to compile them all
with the new stable candidate and then
we compare the results if there used to
be a warning and now there isn't
something's wrong we've got to make sure
that was an intentional change if there
used to be no warnings and now there are
some we got to make sure that was an
intentional change and so you will
sometimes see pull requests from the
core team out to various libraries going
hey we needed to change a thing and
stable this fixes what would otherwise
have broken so if it's possible to have
your code public that is a major benefit
of doing so and you can view the source
of crater and contribute to its
development or borrow the idea for your
own project from that URL there so any
questions about channels before we move
on to how you get a rust installed yeah
it's pretty up we've got one question
there I will really oh wait let's
I will talk about how to publish to our
crÃªpes index when we talk about about
cargo and about how to depend on
libraries so we will get to that moving
on to how do I get a rest there are a
variety of ways depending on what you
want to do with it if you just want to
play around with rust we have a tool
called the playpen of which there are
two major deployments available to you
at the moment there is playdough integer
30 to calm that lets you use a variety
of the top 50 I think popular libraries
and there's also played rustling org
that lets you have a slightly different
set of features you can see the
intermediate representation that you
can't see on played are integer 32 but
as you're starting out they're pretty
much equivalent if all you want to do is
have a little ripple have a hello world
kind of thing play with syntax then the
play pins are probably what you want if
you want several versions on a machine
if you're going to be running some
things on nightly and some things on
stable for instance or you want to test
with a couple of different stable
versions for some reason you want rest
up rust RS is both the name of a rust
script and the URL to which you can go
to get the installation instructions for
said RESP script then another option is
a system package manager not all systems
have rest packaged for them you can add
up to your favorite if they accept
contributions if you want to know more
about rust and package managers and the
conflict between package managers and
libraries check out the talk at 3:40
p.m. today in Tasman a about all of that
and if you're extremely concerned about
security vetting your code you always
have the option to compile yourself a
rest from source so the playpens you can
view their source change it if you so
desire you have a variety of options you
can pick what you want
what output you want to get rather than
just running the code you can also see
what assembly it actually compiled into
that then got run or what LLVM
intermediate representation it
through to get to that assembly so if
you're tracking down a performance
problem these output options can be
quite nice the probably the best feature
of the playpens other than not having to
install anything on your local machine
is that there's a big old gist button
and when you click that it pastes all of
your code into a github gist and then
you can just drop that link into a
channel an IRC channel a slack channel
wherever you're asking people for help
and they can click on it and be taken to
exactly what you saw at the time you
click that just button in the play pin
make changes run it short link it back
to you and you can collaborate quite
easily on code in that way there's on
integer 32 there's also a config button
where you can pick your favorite editor
behavior do you want your Viking
bindings do you want your Emacs key
bindings you want it to act like the
github editor and so forth if editing
text in a web interface tends to
frustrate you so the next option for
getting rust on your system recommended
way is rest up you can pull out all of
the rest up docks there but basically
you just run these install script and it
downloads the appropriate rests
downloads rest up checks it checks that
the signatures are right and so forth
and then installs it for you it will put
everything by default in your home decor
go bin so it's not really digging around
on your system what may or may not be
desired behavior you can customize that
if you want and then once you've got
rest up it manages your arrests for you
so you you want some nightly rest you
say rest up install nightly and then you
can say rest up run nightly and then
whatever you want to run you can alias
these commands to get them shorter and
you can set defaults within rest up like
usually I want stable but I might want
to invoke nightly sometimes so you'd set
the rest up default stable and in terms
of security there is a bit of pushback
on curling a script which is a fair
complaint to have we GPG sign all of our
releases and the script check those
signatures that key that signs the
releases that we distribute is held only
by a couple of core team members who are
very
possible with it we do have
authentication to keep a CEO because
that is one of the more popular ways to
check if a key belongs to who they say
it does we proved that by local signing
don't worry we're not the kinds of
people who will ever send the private
key over the network as I said rest up
we'll check your signatures and if
you're going from source you can just
pull it from the github repo and read
the entire history to see if you like
what you see if you have that kind of
time and that's the way your priorities
work out so let's say that you've found
a rust project you've installed rust and
you're deploying the rest code the
simple story there is you check the
readme for any funny system dependencies
sometimes if it's using a wrapper for
something that your system package
manager might provide they'll say hey
you need these libraries available you
need such-and-such devel for this to
work make sure you've got those first
and then you clone your project CD into
it and cargo run and when you tell cargo
to run your code it will look at the
manifest and download any dependencies
you need it will download those
dependencies and compile them and then
it will execute the main function if
it's a binary project we'll go into more
detail about how to use cargo later on
for now just trust me that the magic
words to make the rest go are cargo run
so questions about installation when
what method is suitable let's see no
questions there hooray I covered the
content quite successfully so now let's
talk about the basics to writing rust
there is a lot of new stuff and a lot of
new combinations of old topics when it
comes to writing rust code so I don't
expect anybody to get it in a day you
will still be hitting weird errors
months in you will still make the
occasional mistake and be told off by
the compiler if you're one of the people
who wrote the compiler so when you're
setting up to write rust
maybe you're old school and you just pop
up
your text editor and know what you're
doing and remember all the names of your
functions that's cool you're awesome but
if you like to add completion and you
like being told about your errors as you
introduce them we have IDE support in
progress you can check out Jonathan
Turner's blog for the rust language
server which is a thing that I des can
hook into to get faster feedback about
what's going on under the hood and rust
and the canonical source of information
about which IDE is support what for rust
is are we IDE yep calm it'll show you a
matrix of all of the different IDs that
we're trying to support and what they
have and what they haven't got so pick
your favorite pick what's familiar pick
something new based on the features it
has or you can work on adding Russell
support using the rest language server
to whatever IDE we don't have in that
list yet a common question is does rust
have a repple does si have a repple that
that's kind of weird that's kind of a
weird question for a compiled systems
language however if you want that fast
feedback on how your code is doing in
addition to using an editor with good
support from the rest language server I
personally use the play pin it's very
quick and easy to make your edits hit
the Run button get your error your error
will be a link to the docs on that error
as I will go into in more detail in just
a moment and then you can figure out why
it happened and fix it if you're just on
IRC in one of the rest channels that has
clay bots in it and you want to show
somebody a quick example you can tell
play bot a line of rust that compiles
and executes on its own play bots will
run that for you and put the result back
in the channel and there have been
efforts to build a proper ripple that is
I think the one that got the furthest to
my knowledge and it requires a specific
nightly version no older than a certain
date so it may or may not be what you're
looking for there the thing to were to
the thing to think about when rust gives
you an error which it will do frequently
when you're learning the language
is that the compiler wants to see your
code do things right
rest wants you to succeed my mental
image of it is that your apprentice
income really knowledgeable old hacker
who worked on like mainframes in the 70s
and they're gonna tell you hey I know
this works right now but it's gonna get
you in trouble later
oh that's a bad idea that could get you
in trouble
in a bit you shouldn't do that you need
to fix it now and so the borea checker
and the compiler will give you a lot of
those that kind of feedback but remember
that it's because we don't want your
code have memory leaks memory misuse
security holes so the rules that the
compiler enforces catch things that look
like they're bad ideas if you imagine
the set of all possible programs that
are correct that don't misuse their
memory the set of all programs that use
that most compilers will accept is way
outside of that they'll let you run any
kind of thing that crashes that
misbehaves and the set of programs that
the rest compiler will accept is just
barely inside that all the correct
programs there are a kind a number of
correct programs that the rest compiler
won't let you compile because it doesn't
know how to prove their correctness yet
when you find one of those you can you
can file a bug and you can improve it
but usually when you think you've found
one of those it was actually a bug in
your code that the compiler caught for
you it's been getting better and better
at that over the years because we fix it
every time we find a little piece of
it's ignorant so if you want to get
around the some of the rules about
safety you can write unsafe rust all I'm
going to tell you about unsafe rust
today is that you when you think you
need it you probably don't at first you
should probably hop into a chat channel
with some more expert rest users and ask
them hey does this really have to be
unsafe how can I do this in a way that
uses safe rust and then you will find
eventually when you get into
applications where you do need it but if
see an unsafe block in a rust program
that you're assessing that's your cue to
look very very hard at it because
somebody thought they were smarter than
the compiler and I'm sorry but this is a
pretty rare occurrence and then errors
we think that the errors deserve good
documentation as I mentioned if you're
using the play pin and you get an error
it will tell you the error number and
that error number is a link and so you
click on the error number and it says
this usually happens when these common
circumstances here's how to fix it so if
that error documentation is totally
misleading totally wrong please file an
issue and help us make it better because
we were working on it all the time
to make it useful to you as the user and
yes click on the error number in the
play pin so if you think you got an
error that you shouldn't have gotten
first search for that error there will
probably be several people on Stack
Overflow on a forum somewhere on the
rest forums that we use as mailing lists
saying hey I'm getting this error or on
the github issues I think I think the
compiler is wrong here's my code and the
code looks a bit like yours and then the
answers say no here's how you fix your
code so it's fine and apply that fix see
if it fixes it for you drop your code in
some paste bin and ask around on IRC
there our friendly experts who know
about the compilers gets who can tell
you what's happening and why and if it
turns out that you actually found
something that the compiler was ignorant
about please PLEASE file a bug it's the
only way we're going to get better so
there are a variety of other helpful
tools to make your code more usable
better formatted more readable and
easier to collaborate on the two big
ones are rest format which there should
be a button for in the integer 32
playpen which you push the button and it
formats your code according to rest
standards if you don't have strong
opinions about how your code should be
formatted
please use rest format it will have
strong opinions for you and everyone
will find your code quite easy if you
have a really rigorous standard style
that doesn't quite match
you can configure rest format to some
extent and run it locally to make sure
that all of the files in your project at
least have consistent formatting and
also Clippy remember back in the day
when you use a certain company's product
you'd have the little paperclip yeah
Clippy is kind of that but for rest and
hopefully more helpful less weird googly
eyes too so you run flippy as you can
push the button in the play pin or
invoke Clippy as described in the readme
of the docs and clip II will tell you
hey I think this might not be as good as
it could be here's where here's where
here's where you could make this better
you know you know you could be using
that other syntax for this that I think
is easier to read and so Clippy is
another sort of automated piece of
mentorship that will help you write
rustier code so any questions about
errors the fact that errors like Q and
want you to succeed and that tooling
we've got one back there and one over
there
I'm really putting my microphone runner
through his paces uh could you raise
there you go development environment can
you run it you know isolated Network it
seems like if I'm getting errors I
needed to click on these links and go
off can i maybe host those internally
and run those two you can run rust
offline if you're depending on various
packages you will need to get those
packages into the network at some point
cargo has an option to say error if you
want them to hit the network so it'll
tell you what it needs and you can
absolutely run rust format run Clippy
and then just search for that error code
in a copy of the docs that stands alone
so you could happily write rest on an
airplane when the Wi-Fi is not working
I'm kissing with a lot other people are
playing on Russ I played at rustling not
all we have only deployed Clippy to the
Play Doh integer thirty-two common type
in which there yep I did it was a brief
soundbite in a wall of other relevant
sound bytes I don't blame me for missing
it any other questions about errors play
pins
Clippy anything up to this point we've
got one more up here
how far does the the fact that you
probably don't need unsafe rust extender
does that extend to if you're talking to
hardware or to system libraries and see
or things like that excellent question
those are the exceptions you cannot
prove the safety of anything outside of
rust it's almost like the i/o conundrum
in Haskell in in a way where if you're
interfacing with something that you
can't prove is safe that little bit
needs to be unsafe get out of unsafe as
soon as you can by sanitizing that data
performing whatever logic you need to
know to return something that's known
and then you can get right back into
your safe code and keep on going but yes
you will find in crates like me oh the
missing io libraries which aren't
actually missing because they exist and
they're quite good you will find unsafe
for us used to talk to the things that
we can't prove are safe I see no more
hands let's move on so let's talk a bit
about rusts impacts this will feel
pretty familiar to anyone who's written
C or to some extent Java the most
important thing to pay attention to when
you're reading rest at first that's a
bit different from other languages is
going to be the Scopes anytime you have
a matched pair of curly braces that is a
scope and scopes will be very useful
when we talk about lifetimes scopes help
determine when a value is available and
what can be done with a given value at
that time scopes can be nested something
belonging to the inner scope does not
also belongs to the outer scope or
something that's available in the
otoscope is also available in the inner
scope something that's available in the
inner scope won't necessarily still be
available after that scope ends and as
you start reading rest code pay close
attention to what scope a variable comes
into existence during
because generally that is as long as
that value will be able to live
we'll get back to this in lifetimes but
as you read your code I'll be pointing
out the scopes to you because making
mistakes with them is one of the things
that will most trip you up
so you need to make functions it's hard
to program well without functions
impossible to program rusts well without
having at least the main function the
simplest kind of function you can have
just has function declaration FN it's
name and then a scope in which things
happen but most of the functions in the
real world will also have a type
signature so a simple type signature
will have your function name and then
you provide it not only the names of the
arguments that you're promising to pass
but also the types that you're promising
to pass for those arguments the types
don't all have to be the same each arg
can have a different type if you so
desire and then you will have an arrow
and then you will tell the type if
you're returning anything of the result
if you try to fail to return when you
promised you would provide a result of a
given type you'll get errors if you try
to return something when you said you
wouldn't be returning anything you will
get errors if you try to return
something that is not the type you
promised you would return you will also
get errors this is because inconsistency
between what you say your function is
going to do and what it actually does is
a great way to introduce all kinds of
problems into your code human reading
the code problems as well as technical
problems and then once you've spelled
out what your function takes in and what
sort of thing your function will give
back you can then have a scope that
contains the actual logic and stuff of
the function think of the type signature
is basically like Mad Libs you just fill
in in those slots and the syntax what
the name is what the type is what the
next name is what the next type is and
all functions will have at least FN the
name and the scope as we talked about
traits you can also generalize over
types you can say well it could be a 32
bit int or a 34 bit int or really it
could be anything that I can add or
anything that I can divide
we'll touch on that later on so I'd like
to introduce macros to you so that you
have a passing acquaintance with them
before we start diving into code because
the first question when you print
HelloWorld is why is there an
exclamation point in their macros our
shorthand for their syntactic sugar for
functions that take some variable number
of arguments like print the print line
state macro can interpolate pretty much
any number of things into the string
that it's printing so it it doesn't make
sense to have that as a function on its
own so you'll have macro name bang and
then the list of arguments in
parentheses you can read much more about
it in the book and you will mostly see
print line a lot when you're just
getting started and playing with
examples so here's a function have a
number cool the main function is what
will run by default and in the play pin
you will say we are printing and then
the string we're gonna print and the
pair of curly braces interpolates the
first argument after that if there had
been a second pair of Curly's they would
have interpolated the second argument
and so forth and the thing that we're
going to print is going to be the result
of calling have on for have says I will
take a 32-bit integer and I will give
you back a 32-bit integer and what I'm
going to do with it is I'm going to give
you back that over to crazy simple if
you happen to paste or type this into a
playpen and change nearly anything about
it you can break it in a number of
interesting ways if you claim that if
you were to create something a number
that wasn't a 32-bit integer and try to
pass it in it would say no you promised
me you'd give me one of those and you
gave me something else
you lied I don't like you if you try to
return a string from it it will say you
promised me you'd give me a 32-bit in
you lied I don't like you so you really
have to follow through on what you tell
the compiler that you're going to do and
you you'll notice that it figured out
that I wanted that character for there
to be a 32-bit integer cuz it's pretty
smart in that way
it could actually have interpolated some
of the function signature as well it is
possible in the compiler to sometimes
figure that out from context but the
language will always demand that you
spell it out mostly for your own benefit
because it will remind every programmer
who interacts with that function exactly
how it's supposed to work yes yes hop in
there we go sorry so in the keynote
yesterday yeah shutting down that
Mozilla project so now yeah yes I know
they talked specifically about some
functions returned null zero or boolean
false and all those three things had a
meaning you're saying that well this is
just me getting that's not possible at
all it is either an int or it's going to
be nullable I'm assuming so if I say in
my function signature arrow I 32 that
means that if I try to return anything
except a 32-bit integer it won't compile
yeah I could I could have an option I
could say I will return an option type
that can contain either something or
something else I could which is
basically maybe for the functional
programmers I could when we talk about
traits I could say I will return any
type that can be added or something or
that can be divided and so traits give
you a lot of power there and generally
if your function is going to want to
return one of three radically different
things why did you do that yes rest will
not make that easy for you it will make
it somewhat possible if you really mess
around with options and argument lists
like you could say I will return you an
array that has these types in it and
then you could work with that if you
needed to but honestly please don't
please just write good code please write
code that's easy to reason about is what
I mean by good in this case you are very
welcome so punctuation matters a lot
here
expressions and with a semicolon such as
print line and my return statement there
there is a special exception when you're
returning something in that if you
wanted to remove both the return and the
semicolon there just say X over 2 if you
leave a bear expression that evaluates
to the correct type at the end of a
function rest will just say oh you meant
to return that cool so some people like
the syntax other people prefer to be
more explicit about the return that's
pretty much the only case in which an
expression should not be ended with a
semicolon
so spaces matter in that they separate
tokens the string I 32 is not the same
as I space 32 because you have to parse
your code and it has to like work and
you want to be able to take type eyes
and 32 separately and beyond
separating tokens the whitespace does
not matter here I apologize in advance
to anyone who's used to reading Python
like I am that's just as good it's just
as terribly awful if you want to read it
but it does the same thing next slide so
this might be a good opportunity to
mention that you can somewhat obfuscate
your rest and then someone else can run
rest format on it and D obfuscate it if
they so desire and if you really like
doing terrible things with challenging
to read programs or general
underhandedness the rest community team
is currently running a thing called the
underhanded rust competition where you
write a little web server that the
salami slicing on credit card payments
it pretends to take a credit card
payment and if it can successfully
funnel off a few fractions of a cent
each time without us noticing that in in
reviewing the code you can get neat
prizes and international fame so if
that's up your alley I would strongly
recommend you check it out anyways to
continue on with the actual beginner
talk that I'm giving here your control
flow syntax will look pretty familiar
compared to other languages you have you
can say if and then evaluate a thing and
then this thing in the scope will only
go if the F was true you can loop
infinitely by de saying
Loup and then it'll just run you can say
while some expression some condition is
met you continue you can do for loops
with ranges there is a substantial
section of the book on ranges because
you can express them in a variety of
ways as you'll find in the bottom links
on that slide and then what may or may
not be familiar to you probably you'll
recognize it if you're from C you might
not recognize it and go wow I didn't
know I needed that but I really needed
that if you're from Python our map
statements I think it's really neat you
can match on a variable and then rather
than a bunch of nested conditionals it
will just go through line by line and if
it matches then it will do whatever you
told it to
so here I'll also introduce you to
declaring a variable we open the scope
of main we say let day equals 19 so we
have day now owns the value of 19 we'll
get back to that later and then we can
use it we can use the value from it
because they owns the value 19 so we can
print it and then we can do we can match
on it we can say if day is 15 so that's
the syntax for matching a single a
single value we can take some action in
this case I'll print something Q you can
say if we match on any of these
conditions in this list with the pipe to
say or then the action we're gonna take
is print a different cute thing and we
can also match on ranges so triple dot
is an inclusive range and you can say if
it's anywhere in there you can take this
other action now finally you can fall
through and handle anything else this is
especially important if you promised you
would give some value back you'd better
be giving a back a value of that type if
there's any way your program can fail to
give that value back it won't compile
you can catch all other cases with the
underscore and then we can print
whatever the
in that case so that's a simple example
of of matching and rest I think it's one
of the cuter parts of des standard
syntax before you start getting into a
mind-bending bit so questions about
simple syntax stuff we've got one over
there already
oh well say it and I'll repeat it true
and false and there is a boolean type if
you want a boolean make a boolean of the
boolean type do not are you probably do
not want to be coercing things to and
from boolean you can just carry a bool
around so how are we doing we are we
have about four months until I said I
would give you guys a ten minute break
and we are right on schedule
at 25 past we will break so anybody who
needs to hop into a talk in the next
slot can can sneak out anyone who wants
to sneak in can although if you have a
seat here and want to keep it I would
strongly recommend hanging on to it I'll
take a few general questions about Russ
Mozilla whatever whatever interest you
and you're wondering about while we fill
that time well still no microphone but
any other general questions yeah oh um
fantastic question about the rest
community why is there a crab on my
shirt the answer to why there is a crab
on my shirt you can go to rest a Chanel
and there you will meet our mascot
unofficially whose name is Ferris he is
a rest a shoe he's quite cute and useful
for imagery if you're doing a talk and
useful for identifying other risk
stations or which is what we call rescue
sirs some people tried rusta Farion but
that didn't catch on the way row station
did it made the keynote about the
lobsters really resonate with me when we
talk about project maintainer treatment
so
all of the ferrous art is cc0 do with it
what you will send it to spoon flour and
print it on shirt on cloth and make a
tablecloth tweet photos of it and you
will become famous in the rest community
so plushies of him I developed a pattern
and released it for free do what you
will with it also you probably have
stickers if you came inside at the front
early in the break
there will be more stickers at the birds
of a feather session at 12:20 as well
any other general questions I actually
have one yes why is it why are the
Rangers two dots in the loops and three
dots in the match statements if I recall
correctly from having skimmed dots a few
times on that recently is because there
is inclusive and not inclusive Rangers
looper for 100 is is either 0 to 99 or 1
to it oh sorry 199 or yes over this
yesterday by chance two dots is
exclusive at the end three dots is
inclusive for the end yes it does if you
can use that to scrape credit card data
then you should enter the competition
let's
okay and that is just about the time
when I will let you hop out for 10
minutes if you desire a bit of a break
and then come back here at 35 past and
we will talk about ownership and
borrowing types and traits and how you
get involved with rest we can resume the
recording if you'd like so now that we
are back from our brief commercial and
or human break we are back to rest 101
where we have talked about deploying
rust and we've talked about the basic
rest syntax where you can get these
slides at the URL right there talks
dotty denim net / LCA 2017 slash rust
101 PDF they have a variety of links in
them and you may want to refer back to
them in the future so I would recommend
noting that URL as the PDF will live
there for as long as I own my domain
excellent it has been tweeted with the
hashtag so if you check out the LCA 2017
hashtag you will find that link you can
also look at my twitter which is in the
sidebar and also find that link so let's
get jump right back into it we're
talking about
traits and types when I told you that
function signatures are basically Mad
Libs I said you put a type there I'll
use i-32 as an example don't worry about
it we'll get to that
now let's worry about it a little so
traits and types both describe
characteristics of things in your
program you care most about these
characteristics when they're the inputs
and outputs of some operation they're
the interfaces between various parts of
your code we care about what type a
given value is because that helps us
avoid wasting space why would we need 32
bits worth of space if we only have like
an 8-bit value that's just wasteful and
when the compiler is
to prove that your program won't misuse
memory at any point in its operation we
need to know exactly what memory is
going to be used when so the final
useful part of traits and types is that
they remind humans how their code works
I mentioned that you need to specify all
of the types of your function signature
regardless of whether the compiler could
have figured it out because that's a
piece of documentation for everyone else
who ever wants to invoke or modify your
function so a type describes a single
value and tells you some things about it
there are a variety of types built
interests the integer that I was using
before is an example there is the
various primitives that can hold a value
there are built-in array types string
types and tuple types as well now you
can the docs will also tell you about
slices into an array which I would
recommend not worrying too much about
until you're comfortable with the
ownership model that we will talk about
when we discuss how reste enforces
safety and a few minutes you can also of
course create custom types and the way
that you will go forth with making a
custom type is either by making a struct
or an enum and the final way that you
can get a type if it's not built-in and
you're not making it yourself is you
might have inherited it from a
dependency so a type describes one
particular value or what you're going to
put in one particular variable and a
trait describes some attribute that
several types might have in common so I
think of it as they describe the skills
or abilities that a type has so for
instance all all number types all of the
floats all of the intz you can add them
all so there's a trait called add that
each one of them has implemented for it
and when you're playing around with new
types or teaching rest to combine
existing types in new ways you can give
a type a new
trait a new skill the way I think of it
by implementing it you do this with
imple and then that tells it for the
given trait what what should I do if
someone asks me to use this trait what
what do I do with myself and any other
value that's involved in the operation
that this trait describes so traits
allow you to generalize a functions
input and output I'm not going to go too
deep into types and traits here other
than telling you what they are because
the details of using them correctly are
quite complex and they are better
documented in the book and the various
examples that I will point you at then
anyone could hope to do a justice in the
time frame that we have available so any
questions at the high level about this
type system thing no cool I did not give
you enough specific problems to have
specific problems with that was
basically the intent of this section
because the other really mind-bending
thing that you're going to need to be
much more familiar with to get some rest
code working then just putting in the
right magic numbers into lists and the
types when you make a function is the
safety models the core of safety is
ownership when I was describing code
before the break I said we use leppe to
create a variable we give it a name and
now it owns that value that we set it
equal to so in this example my n't that
string is the variable binding and the
value of 42 is owned by that binding so
every value has exactly one owner at any
point in time you can give it away you
can change the owner of a given value
but there will only ever be one at a
time if you own a value and then you
give that value away somewhere else and
it didn't get copied occasionally with
very simple values they might be copied
instead of moved then you can't use it
anymore from the previous owner
so you're actually kind of oh yes and if
you want to change something the owner
can change it if it has been declared as
mutable so if we wanted to be able to
change what my aunt stores we would tell
rusts so right when we're creating it by
saying let mute my int equals 42 or let
my depending on which compiler author
you listen to I believe that both are
correct
so here we go let's make it in it'll be
the first it's owned by the first
binding we can print that out and we
have a very high vaccination we can
access it by using second now if we had
done this with a more complex thing that
wasn't a copy type you would get all
kinds of errors if you tried to then use
the contents of first compiler is quite
clever and may copy the value because it
knows that integers are cheap to store
so let's say that we need to access a
piece of memory from more than one place
at once gosh who would ever want to do
that borrows allow you to grant
temporary access to a value and those
those borrows can never outlive the
owner there's still one binding that you
can prove is responsible for that value
it's just kind of sharing it with some
others for a little bit and your options
with Burroughs are that you can have one
mutable borrow to a given piece of data
to a given value or you can have as many
immutable Burroughs as you want
you cannot both read and write or you
cannot have the ability to both read and
write the same piece of memory or the
same value at the same time and if you
have fought with multi-threading in a
systems language that says oh here are
the rules be smart about memory
management you might have you might have
realized that most parallelism problems
are around that area
oops that changed at a time I wasn't
expecting to it to and I read it so the
syntax to borrow a value is ampersand
value name and there are splendid
examples in the book that show you times
when you would actually want to borrow
something rather than something that
tiny and contrived and stuffed on a
small projector to confuse you so the
other main mind-bending rule about
ownership and borrowing is lifetimes you
will probably meet lifetime errors the
first few times you try to play with
borrowing a value and this is because no
the owner will lose its value everything
will go away at the end of the owners
scope so if you take a borrow and you
try to keep borrowing or referencing
back to some value and that value has
gone away because its scope ended we
will notice that at compile time and it
won't compile rather than finding out as
you're running your code oops I tried to
use a value that wasn't there I wonder
what was there instead so again the key
points here are that anything that goes
out of scope is no longer available to
you it's gone the compiler will do
whatever it feels like with it which can
vary depending on the optimizations that
you're using but no borrow may ever
outlive the thing that owns what it was
borrowing so questions about the
principles of safety in rest if you
would like to create yourself some
questions about the principles of safety
in rest pull up something like the book
on references and borrowing and then hit
the little Run button by one of the
examples and then change a couple things
and wonder why you managed to break it
and the first thing to do obviously
there is to read the error it will tell
you which rule you broke and it will
probably link you to the Ducks on that
rule and then you will probably stare at
the rule and go oh okay I finally see
what I did wrong
and then you'll go fix it so yes
question there sorry I've got to really
put my microphone and run her through
his paces big room frequent question
sections yes you mentioned that
sometimes the compiler says as cheap to
copy an integer so I'll just copy it is
that likely to cause confusion or change
over time that things that were easily
copied no longer are and break things or
things that aren't easily copy become
easier to copy in the compiler decides
just to copy them excellent question
this is actually implemented with is it
a copy type does it have that trait if
it has that trait you copy it if it does
not have that trait you do not so if we
were to add things or remove those
things from having that trait in the
standard library it might cause some
confusion but if we attempted to do that
or accidentally did that between a
couple of stable releases then crater
would suddenly spew problems everywhere
it would say wait that thing that used
to work doesn't work anymore and we
would go oops
that's well again let's not do that yes
you can implement the trait copy for a
type that you want to and then that type
will be copy whether that's a good idea
requires extensive knowledge about the
exact hardware that you're running on
cool so yeah another question how does
that work with constants like you showed
that example with 42 what if I want to
have two things that share the value 42
so how does it work with constants um
long story short if Russ knows that you
have a constant that's never going to
change such as if you didn't declare it
as mutable it will use a different
section of memory to store it then where
it will store immutable values it's a
stack heap thing and you can you can
tell rust that you want it to be
immutable you can if you know you're
never gonna change it then you will
probably just borrow it immutably it
depends on the way that your program is
set up how you
handle those constants throughout yeah
um so I just put that example in where
you said it would throw an error into
the it failed to throw an error because
it copied the value because we used an
int yes if we used I believe if we used
a mutable int it would never throw an
error but I didn't really want to dump a
fancy enum into it we have common it
works with mutable as well because
coffee is a fantastic trait that will
prevent your examples from being as
simple as you would like them to I
apologize for not dumping in something
sufficiently complex that you would go
why the heck did you create that that
way
poor poor example choice on my part and
I will fix the slides in the future yes
the one you said should error doesn't
actually error yes we are discussing
that we were you were engrossed in the
awesomeness of the playpen which is
excellent and I made the wrong call in
trying to simplify the example versus
providing the actual error message that
you would need so with that I will I
will shove slides up with an example
that actually does error shortly after
this and let's talk about that library
stuff that I promised you so the way the
package manager for rust is named cargo
and the libraries are named crates the
packaged index lives on the web at
crates dot IO a common question about
crates do is could we do the left pad
thing where somebody gets angry and
takes something down and then everyone
who depended on it breaks
long story short no you can publish a
crate and then it goes into an s3 bucket
that about three to four humans on the
planet have access to and then you can
mark it as please don't use this anymore
if your deprecating it but you cannot
actually take it down if there were a
legal problem that somebody said hey you
need to take this thing down because
copyright or problematic content or what
have you if it were a code of conduct
violation we'd be like oh okay yeah and
we would work with the dependencies
before deleting it to replace it with
something although I doubt that people
would be intentionally depending on like
a code of conduct violation anyways and
if it were illegal or copyright matter
it would be escalated to the appropriate
people who know the ins and outs of
copyright and we would have a very clear
explanation of why it was being removed
and a story for what to replace it with
so long story short no we're not going
to do the left pad thing there will also
be a talk on package managers all the
way down as I previously mentioned 3:40
today up there in Tasman B and the
crÃªpes dot io guide has most of what
you need to know about how to use crates
io the bits that you really care about
are when you're starting a new project
locally use cargo use our package
manager to start your project because it
will put the files in the right places
and it will make it trivially easy to
publish later on when you decide that
your work is in a state that you're
ready to share with the world so the
first question that you run into when
you're making a project is am I making a
binary am I making a thing that we're
just gonna run and it's gonna be my
program or are we making the library for
other programs to depend upon you're
probably making a binary if you're just
saying hello world or solving a problem
so that'll be Cargo new double-dash bin
and that'll give you a main dot RS in
your source directory that you'll run to
run the main function and in a binary
every time you successfully build your
project cargo will update a file called
cargo lock with every detail of how it
got that successful build everything
about the versions of your dependencies
that it used so if you want somebody
else to be able to run your project in
exactly the same way that you did with
the exact same dependency versions they
can use that cargo dot log now if you're
making a library you will not include
that because cargo is going to worry
about your dependencies when when you
build it so you'll just get that source
lib tar s and it's not really sensible
for a library to make main because why
would why would you run a library as an
application yes
the lock file yeah in to get or not um
depends on your circumstances committing
them is useful in that it helps people
diff their environment against the
environment in which you successfully
built it it helps people troubleshoot
and people can use it to force a
matching compilation so if you really
really hate lock files and want people
to just figure it out for themselves you
can leave it out but it's helpful to
leave it in so when you yes another
question how easy is it for someone to
run their own crate host how easy is it
for someone to run their own crate host
not easy right now unfortunately the
source code two crates do is all public
you could you could try to mirror the
crates to Ohio and then run the web
front-end to it if you wanted to if
you're working on that hop into the rest
tools channel on Mozilla IRC and we'll
see if there's a better way we can get
you the gigs and gigs of crate
information out of our s3 then just
forcing you to download at all it's
generally not a use case that's been
needed all that much yet although
there's more and more demand for cardio
working easily behind a firewall and
caching crates behind a firewall
and controlled environments as rest gets
more and more adoption so basically you
can kind of fake it and just throw up a
copy and hope for the best
but we are working on having a much
cleaner story for the real life
applications of doing that so when you
tell it Cargo new binary or library
you're going to get three things you're
gonna get a cargo tunnel which describes
the project dependencies and the project
metadata you're going to get a source
directory called containing a main dot
RS or a Lib dot RS depending on whether
it's a binary or a library and if you
hadn't already
Eli's the get repo by default you're
going to get get initialized in this
directory because you should be tracking
your changes if you can't use git for
whatever reason and would prefer to
attempt to make it work with another
version control system you can override
that option so you've got your project
how do you bring in a dependency to use
someone else's work and save yourself a
bunch of time to depend on a crate first
you need to find the crate that you want
to depend on which is a story that we're
working on improving the simplicity of
figuring out which of the three or four
competing crates is the best for your
needs however right now you'd search
crates dot io for the general term that
you're looking for a crate that does it
you can look at their repositories look
at any website that they have and use
your personal standards for assessing
the health of an open-source community
to determine whether it's alive whether
it's as actively developed as you want
and so forth and I always search the web
I search for recent blogs about that
crate because if someone has a really
good experience using a crate they'll
often blog about it and if somebody has
troublesome experience that'll often
show up in either a blog or an issue
tracker as well so check through the
dots to make sure it has as much dogs as
you want check that the license will be
compatible with your projects license
again please license your code and make
sure that the project policies and
workflow are going to work for you and
once you've once you've found that crate
that seems to meet your needs you can
add it for the dependencies section of
that cargo tom'll and you can either
specify it by name if it lives on crates
dot io and then ask for the version and
in that case cargo will just go to
crates dot IO find the crate by that
name pull down the version that you
specified if it can or yell at you if
that version is not there or you can
specify a git dependency in which case
you say we're going to use this get repo
optionally at that particular revision
this is very good for dependency pinning
if you are at all concerned about
potential security of crates do then
this
is easier to justify to the security
minded people on your team and if you
are engaging in the underhanded wrest
competition and you want to inject the
problem into an upstream dependency
please fork it and get the pinned on it
that that's the right way of doing this
and then in your file from which you
want to use that crate probably may not
rs before your project has gotten any
bigger you will say extern crate and
then the crate name thank you that you
install and then you will say use
whatever type out of it that you wanted
to get out of that crate
so usually that'll be two lines when
you're not on slides and after that you
can just continue using it as if it was
as created in your code so any questions
about crates and libraries so far yes
what's the best way for tracking
security vulnerabilities in libraries
that you're using to help keep your
program secure what if that is a really
good question and we don't have a
centralized source of truth for that
kind of thing if it's a large crate that
has a mailing list sign up for that if
they release new versions you can you
can try and depend on latest although
that may frequently break your project
so basically as far as I know the state
of the art right now is checking those
dependencies and when they've updated
see why follow them on github get
notified about issues if they tag their
issues for that release and that is that
is a really good point that we do need
better tooling for that is cargo
inherently linked to rust or could you
use it for another language or
particularly if you had a across
language linkage library that sort of
thing you can tell cargo an arbitrary
build script of here's how you build
that particular dependency
so people do use other languages in in
their crates for instance a wrapper
around a library the best way to figure
out the exact details on that would be
to find a popular wrapper library on
crates dot IO and check out what they've
done there right I was also thinking
about the other direction oh yeah the
other direction sticking sticking rest
in to see you I would actually recommend
the talk Friday 1:20 p.m. on porting to
rest they have I think they might
actually be state of the art in terms of
linking easily between C and rest you my
knowledge there is that you can do it
cargo can do arbitrary things when you
tell it to build so maybe that invoke
this make file and build the C stuff but
it is definitely designed with rest in
mind like I wouldn't recommend trying to
port let's say the Python package index
to cargo can dynamically load can we
dynamically load libraries from crates
so like if you change a crate then it
will load during runtime um
I don't actually know that off the top
of my head sorry anybody else here know
that hmm no not a volunteer but a next
question
um do you ever have a problem where you
are relying on a specific library and
there's another crate that you're using
that also uses that library but the
versions are incompatible so the crate
you're using depends on another crate
that's at a specific version but you
need a feature that's in a new one and
if so how do you deal with that
um cargo will compile the right version
when making each crates dependencies and
so you might have two versions sitting
around one of which is used by the one
thing and the other of which is used by
the other and if everything else works
then you're good
okay so let's move on to if you think
the rest is cool if you think that rest
is something that you'd like to get more
involved with how do we make the rest a
better place how do you level up at rest
how do you find your rest project and
how do you get involved with the
language and ecosystem itself so the the
usual caveats to open source involvement
apply make sure you check the other
people's licenses and respect them don't
assume that publicly posted code is
licensed for reused in any particular
way because just posting it publicly
isn't a license so please license your
own code and if you ever use other
people's blog posts saying whoops I did
something silly to get this error here's
how I fixed it please make your own of
those when you don't find a useful one
when you're looking around that's part
of what makes the ecosystem great and
the caveat to using other people's error
experiences and problems with rest is
that it has been moving very quickly
especially before 1.0 hit so double
check the date on any resource that you
read you'll find posts from late 2012
2013 talking about there being green
threads and attempt to GC and rust and
you'll go what I didn't think it had
that and no it doesn't have that today
but it went through some interesting
phases in its youth if you learn and
level up by reading books there are good
books out there
the usual book the rust book that no
starch has been publishing a version of
that Steve cloud Nick wrote is kind of
rust for rubyists it is a great intro to
the language although it doesn't dive as
in-depth as some existing systems
programmers would like into the way that
rest works under the hood it's a great
place to start then if you want to dig
around in advanced and unsafe rust
programming there is the rust anomic on
which is a one of the compiler authors
personal views on how the heck is the
right way to do this and what's
available to you it's a delightful read
he has a very engaging writing voice so
that's a fun one and then coming out I
hear it sometime
here although I would probably get in
trouble if I said that on a recording
like I just did there is an O'Reilly
book on the way which is going to be the
reference that I recommend for people
coming from a hard core systems
background who want to know all of the
details of wait what memory is
allocating and why is it doing that when
I call this function so if you would
like to follow the news about rest
there's a podcast called Noura station
that tracks Chris cricos experiences
levelling up on rust and is generally I
think a weekly thing it can be a good
listen and he provides example code with
it
there's also rusty radio that's a
variety of interviews on rest then if
you like reading blogs and updates this
weekend rest is a weekly blog saying
what changed since the last time we
posted this what cool new developments
are happening what requests for comment
landed and are going to be incoming on
nightly as new features and so forth and
then the official blog announces all of
the really important stuff to practice
your rest there are a couple of places
that I would go first
Carol's 10 cents published a repo called
wrestling's which are simple examples
where she'll give you a challenge tell
you what to do with it and then if you
scroll way down the page she'll give you
the solution so those are quite good
exercises there's also the rest by
example book if you learn best from
looking at simple example code so
questions about where to go on your own
journey interests at the moment yes
don't apologize the question I'm
terribly sorry
so I'm sort of badly clicking around
here one of the things I'd like to do is
I'm just thinking I'd like to write like
a multicast listener or something in
rust so I was trying to find where's the
socket code and I honestly I I've spent
a good like three minutes trying to find
it where am I not looking umm I would
check are we web yet calm for a variety
of so I heard you liked writing servers
here is what we have
available you will probably depend on
either Mayo or someone else's wrappers
around me Oh mio is the missing IO
library which is not in fact missing at
all because it is very present very
robust and very well supported it it
really depends on what amount of
abstraction you're looking for there and
you can also dig around on crates IO for
someone else who uses sockets and just
be like how did you do that those are
those are the approaches that I would
take yes hi can you point out what the
yeah
rest for embedded is in an interesting
state in that embedded is explicitly one
of the places that system language is
shine and yet we don't have a whole lot
of consistent support from people in the
embedded community on fixing rust for
whatever device every single time it
breaks like will target arm but then we
won't target weird problems that you
have on teeny-tiny little arm board for
instance the you will find examples of
rest for embedded platforms there's
quite a bit of raspberry pi stuff pretty
much any board that LLVM supports it's
quite likely that someone will have
gotten rest up on up and running at some
point and blogged about it it's also
quite likely that at the end of the
weekend they will have said okay that
was fun
stick it on github until the next new
adventure so it's the the state of
current support will vary somewhat
depending on what platform you have
picked and I believe that the Redhawks
project the operating system that's
being written in rust actually targets
smaller computers and so generally find
a recent blog post by someone who says
hey look I made it work on my PI see
what they did follow their steps and
then if you'd like to contribute support
keeping that up to date as the language
changes is absolutely fantastic
just wondering where rust doesn't run
like I'm on the same a project and I'd
like to use it in Samba is there any way
that I would expect to find Samba that I
might have trouble getting rust to run I
mean we still have people trying to run
say and run on hp-ux yeah again
the LLVM support list is pretty much the
places where it's easy to get rest up
and running list the most recent place
rust doesn't run that I've met was
actually the ESP 32 board at the open
hardware session because to know for
LLVM so nope there are I don't actually
recall the platform's off the top of my
head but a variety of companies who need
to support obscure old hardware have
challenges with rust because there's
that one person on that one really old
system that rust cannot target yet and
we can't leave them behind
so yeah it's so good I can repeat that
partial answer if you like is LLVM now
supports arm 64 so the places rust won't
run are now fewer than ever such a
helpful answer I know so we are doing
pretty well on time and I will be able
to get through how we find a project and
how to get more involved so you want to
find a rest project to hack on you could
just look up a popular crate on crates
dot io and see what easy issues they
have open this will vary in its success
wildly from crate to crate some have a
very act of moderation team who files
their easy issues and tags their easy
issues and saves them for newcomers
others are totally swamped and don't
really have the bandwidth to bring you
up to speed you can more reliably find
unloved little rust projects that
nevertheless need more hands by
searching on github for it is an issue
it's labeled easy and it's in the
language rust if you then add a date
filter for it had activity on it within
the past two or three months
we'll find quite a few little active
projects that are looking for more
people if they're bothering to label
their issues easy that means that they
almost certainly have someone who's
willing to help mentor you through and
get you up to speed on contributing to
that project another way to get involved
is to try and port something to rest and
see what happens if you learn best by
diving in and getting your hands dirty
this might be the option for you
Jamie sharp has written a tool called
corrode which as we mentioned at the
start kind of sort of ports CVS to rest
in a way that is no worse nor more north
and no less safe than the original C was
although one could discuss what kind of
claim that is as I have been plugging
throughout the talk the session on
Friday at 120 and Tasman B talks about
another option for porting to rest when
corrode won't meet your needs and you
can incremental e add more and more bits
of an existing program to rest using
that programs foreign function interface
support as described on the rest blog so
any questions about how the heck do I
even find a rest project to get involved
with of course the one that didn't make
the slide because it is so obvious is
that you could just start something from
scratch if you have a dream project and
your questions about how to find an
existing one nope awesome we will have
some amount of project matchmaking also
at the birds of a feather session which
will be in here during lunch time
immediately after this talk one of my
one of my jobs with could you bring the
microphone up and one of my jobs as
community team is to find the people who
are looking for a group find the groups
that are looking for people question you
have a cool new idea and you want to
write your library how do you claim name
space yeah has the right to the name you
make sure you're not stealing it from
some other project by googling around a
little
pretty please Google your name on its
own to see what you get if you get a lot
of things that are unrelated to your
project please make your name a little
more unique for the sake of all users
everywhere and
in publish boilerplate crepe to create
Ohio with that name and then you own it
name spacing or conventions around
saying this is something that handles
HTTP or this is something that handles
email I should name it in a way that
matches email rather than just cool name
with my dog um honestly most of that
lives in the metadata and on the tags
that you stick in that metadata that you
can search by tags on crates IO as well
you I I think you get bonus points for
naming it something witty related to
either chemical rust processes maybe
trust if you're a security crate or
there's a cool little fungi there those
seem to be popular although really name
it something unique and easy to search
and describe it clearly in its readme
and in its metadata and you're good my
experience is coming from say Penn which
has a very structured you names yes we
don't currently even namespace based on
user who submitted it so we are talking
about ways that we could improve crates
dot IO without breaking backwards
compatibility generally the only time
that project leadership might step in is
if you're trying to impersonate a more
official crate like rust official
standard library or something and it's
misleading users and making their days
unpleasant I I hear whispered under
someone's breath that's what gotten p.m.
into trouble we won't go there
so now let's get let's say that you like
rest you like the community and you want
to get more involved how do you start
reaching out to the compiler on the
hypothetical path to becoming a
maintainer yourself like we discuss the
keynote this morning well the first step
is probably to file or fix issues that
occur with the language they're on the
github issue tracker rustling rust we do
try to triage regularly so don't take it
personally if we say sorry but that's
already filed over there and if you're
in doubt about whether the thing you've
encountered really is a bug just ask on
IRC we're friendly if someone is
unfriendly they
be stopped promptly so chat online with
people who like the project and people
who run the project the IRC channels
which are officially moderated by the
mod team are rust rust beginners there
are a variety of team channels like rest
deaf community rest - tools rest -
internals for the compiler dev work
please don't ask your user questions on
internals it slows everything down and
you have a less awesome rest as a result
there instead of a mailing list because
we need to be able to moderate well them
and remove any problematic posts we use
a discourse forum that lives at users
dot rest lang org you might sometimes
find information on internals rest langa
or again please take your user questions
to users and not internals because
mixing those two will slow development
down and make you give you a less
awesome rest and we have a variety of
side channels the the mod team will make
an effort to moderate but we provide no
guarantees because there are just so
many of them a couple of the bigger ones
are Reddit and Stack Overflow so our
rust on reddit is the rest programming
language our play rust is the game you
should look around if you like
interacting with humans which I assume
you might because you're here at a
conference for a meet-up in your area so
doing a web search for the name of your
area and rust meetup will often get you
something if that doesn't check out the
rest community team calendar which I
have short linked you there and we try
to keep track of when and where all of
the various meetups are happening
because they all use different software
depending on where they are and the rest
community channel on mozilla IRC IRC up
mozilla.org
is a great place to meet the community
team members say hey i'm thinking about
starting a meet-up in such-and-such a
region what should i do is there anyone
else who's expressed interest in this
and so forth and we can be kind of a
central switchboard of everybody who
wants to lead more involvement and if
you like attending conferences there are
a variety of them last year we had rust
con Rust Belt rust &amp;amp; rust fest in
various parts of the world I don't know
of a southern hemisphere rust conference
yet although if any of you are really
big fans of conferences that can be
easily changed
so those are the links to keep an eye
out for and see when they're CFPs come
around or join their mailing lists so
any questions about getting more
involved in the world of rest nothing
right now that's good because we are
rapidly approaching time my last piece
of information for you is that we are
having the rest birds of a feather
session right here after you've gone and
gotten your lunches so that will be the
time to start hacking run into funny
problems ask about the funny problems to
the other people who enjoy using this
language so thank you all very much for
coming and learning things and I wish
you a successful journey into the world
