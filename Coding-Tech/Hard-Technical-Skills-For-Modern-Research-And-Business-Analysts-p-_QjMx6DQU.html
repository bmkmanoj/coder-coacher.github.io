business analytics at an algorithmic
trading firm in New York City and today
I'll be talking about hard technical
skills for modern research and business
analysts I remember when about three
years ago I was just graduating from
university actually McGill University
here in Montreal and I had SATA
economics in finance I was going to be a
consultant an analyst at a consulting
firm in Boston so I went through our
formal training program where I learned
the analyst weapon of choice this is my
Microsoft Excel and I got really good at
Microsoft Excel I learned vlookups index
matches pivot tables
I memorized and still have memorized all
of the keyboard shortcuts you can
imagine and I was convinced at the time
that if I use my understanding of
economics and my understanding of
Finance and use this powerful tool Excel
I would be able to create these
insightful and impactful analyses that
would really impress my managers and
clients I was convinced of this
I was also naive so this is what being
else actually looks like at the bottom
we have so many tabs open that we can't
tell which data transformation lets the
next one in the middle we have a file
that's just too big and Excel refuses to
open it in the top on both sides we have
multiple Excel workbooks and as soon as
you move one workbook to another
location all the references break for me
this came to a head when I was tasked
with pulling data from a website and
bring into Excel and I had to go through
every page on this website and copy and
paste all the data into Excel and format
it and this was not like some set of
hours this was literally days of copying
and pasting if programmers can imagine
that this is what analysts do this is
actually what they do so what I learned
I had to do because I vowed I would
never do this process again it was so
awful and miserable and thankless that
what I need to do is I need to learn how
to automate this stuff I needed to learn
how to program so I do what everyone
does when they first learned saying new
they google it and this is what I saw
there is just too much software too much
terminology too many concepts to figure
out where to begin
so what I decided to do is I would
assign myself a project I would assign
myself a very simple analytical project
for an analyst to learn the bare minimum
set of tools I needed to get the job
done I didn't want to deal with anything
else so I'd go to this website this is
the IgM economic experts panel it's a
panel of surveys that sent out to
prominent economists in the US and they
asked them survey questions like do you
think interest rates will rise or fall
in the next quarter how confident are
you ten most common confident one least
confident so here's a very basic
analytical question what's the average
level of confidence given by all the
economists on this survey so I would
simply go into each survey in each
survey I find a data table like this and
I'll just take the average of these
numbers
not so hard of course what I actually
had to do was a head learn Python just
begin with that would give me my general
programming language to actually
automate anything but Python alone is
insufficient so I had learn requests on
top of this which would allow me to send
these get requests out to websites and
that would have that would yield me my
HTML but even when I had this HTML is
still insufficient because it's just a
blob of text so I had to parse it using
beautifulsoup
Ida parse it for the date I wanted and
ignore everything else now I think
what's common to a lot of people a lot
of programmers when they learn sign new
if they do way too much of it so I
extracted all the data I could I scraped
all the data I could I open the CSV file
in Excel and of course what happens
Excel refused to open it
so this kicked off the next step of my
journey I had to learn sequel I had to
learn databases to actually store this
information so that I could access it
later and I had to learn sequel not an
analytical sense how most analysts are
familiar with it so your selects your
group buys your wares but I actually had
to do it in a data engineering sense so
this was your data models your create
statements or insert statements your
truncates and only then was I able to
actually have a dataset with which I
could perform my analysis I had to do
all this first before I even do any
analysis so now I got the analysis
select the average confidence from the
economists of course it's so simple this
is what I see so what did I forget to do
I forgot to check my data for null
values and had I done that I'd have seen
that null values are coded as negative
99 those gut averaged in there so what
more importantly what I forgot to do
exploratory data analysis or EDA EDA is
about visually just like we have here
visually looking at your data and
understanding it and familiarizing
yourself with it so what types of values
do I get in a column what are the
columns labeled what do those columns
mean what are the data types you'll
probably have to check a lot of
documentation for this or code books or
data dictionaries and only after you've
done this process can you perform data
cleaning you have to do this first
before you can actually remediate those
errors in your data this step I want to
emphasize because it's so important the
fact is at the end of the day nobody
will look at your data like you will as
the analyst your managers won't look at
it your clients won't look at it your
customers won't look at it nobody will
look at this data except you so it's
very very important that you know it
very well and now we've finished the
engineering pipeline we've pulled our
data we stored our data we've understood
it and now we have a clean data set with
which we can work every analysis it
doesn't start with data it doesn't start
with statistics it starts with a
question and this question is a very
iterative process
so you will ask a question and you will
learn from your data iteratively you
might think that sales managers drive
off a revenue which sales managers drive
all of a revenue but you'll find only
with a give and take with your data that
it's not actually sales managers at all
it's which sales territories are
important so along the way as you're
iterating on this you'll be data
wrangling and this is not the secret we
had before but this is more analytical
sequel so this is your selects your
group buys your joins your window
functions if you're fancy you can also
use pandas and are here or MATLAB and
then we get to what we're paid for this
is it data analysis is our namesake what
I think a lot of people think about
analysis is that is heavily quantitative
it's all residual plots and t-tests and
regressions machine learning algorithms
and it can be all of that but often it's
just this it's summary statistics it's
basic it's the point and what's useful
about these is they're directional so
they tell me where to look at my data
what's signal versus what's noise what
should I pay attention to what are the
patterns I should look for and what's
everything else I should ignore what
what else should I ignore now did anyone
actually enjoy looking at this though
despite how useful I say it is this is
awful to look at everyone can agree what
people actually want to see is something
like this this has the same information
it actually has more information but
it's much more impactful it's much
easier to tell where the pattern is so
I'm gonna make a bold proposition here
every analysis should end with
visualization because at the end of the
day no matter how many smart people we
have sitting in a room nobody wants to
look at a table full of numbers nobody
does they want to see something like
this and you can do the visualization on
the left which is complex but cool and
neat or you can do what I often do on
the right which is simple it's the point
and it tells you exactly you need to
know very quickly so we finish the data
pipeline we actually had to do quite a
bit of engineering before we jumped into
the analysis and kind of
quite a few steps that go in there so
we're done that's it that's data
pipeline one more thing
sanity checking so I can tell you from
experience how easy it is to have spent
days on the engineering work and you
spend days on the analysis after that
and you get your first set of numbers
you got your visualization and you send
it off and your manager looks at it and
your manager goes that day right there
that didn't happen it just didn't happen
we'd never had those sales so what
actually happened probably a process or
a job ran twice it wrote twice to our
database our data got doubled and our
revenue got doubled so what I urge you
to do after you finish any analysis is
to sanity check your data spend one
extra hour two extra hours this is not
like an hour of like intelligence or
skill it's just grit and perseverance
it's awful but do it you'll thank
yourself because you'd rather that you
find the error than someone else two
takeaways from this talk the first is
data skepticism you should be skeptical
of the results that you produce you
should be skeptical of the results that
others produce because as we've seen
there are so many places to go wrong in
the data pipeline you could scrape data
incorrectly you can store it incorrectly
you could clean it improperly so be
skeptical the last point is full stack
data analysis I think analysts for too
long have been siloed in a skill set
that only focuses on BI tools Excel and
they can benefit greatly from bracing an
engineering mindset a software
development set to be able to work with
a data pipeline and work with their data
from start to finish thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
