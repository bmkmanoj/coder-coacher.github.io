won't see on here is my job title this
my twitter handle is how I judge myself
as a person by how many followers I have
so please go and follow me on Twitter
and everything that I talked about today
you can find a lot more information on
my blog essentially this is going to be
kind of four lightning talks almost
about the different technologies up here
now I go by the title security research
so this is why I spend most of my time
doing and as a security researcher
essentially I try and break into things
they could be websites applications cars
whatever it is any system that you can
test the security of so I spend a lot of
my time doing what the bad guys do what
hackers do and once my skill set is the
same I don't identify myself as a hacker
I don't like the term it's become a bit
of a media buzzword recently it gets
thrown around an awful lot when you tell
people you're a hacker they tend to put
their phones into airplane mode and like
yep you just keep talking I'm just going
to turn all these things off but the be
kind of the same title of my talk
these modern web security standards and
this is what I want to talk about today
and the major reason that I don't really
like to identify as a hacker is because
according to Google image search I don't
look anything like one anyway
I don't own a ski mask or an anonymous
mask I never wear black hoodies and no
matter how hard I try I can't make cool
green matrix text come down over my face
in my office at home but I have you know
been quite fortunate to get some good
press coverage
I found a utility company electricity
provider in the UK I could just
literally password reset my way into
anybody's account literally just set a
new password on their account log in and
take full control of that I really like
this one I'm not gonna ask whose copy
and pasted code from Stack Overflow to
save everybody having to put their arms
in the air but we've all done this the
trick is just to not get caught and this
came off the back of some research that
I did with my own car I did this with an
Australian researcher and we actually
found that we could remotely take
control of certain features inside my
car so I was sat in my car in England
and he was in his house in Australia and
he could just take over certain
functions inside
car and they son actually had to pull
the whole lap infrastructure to happen
after this many people were annoyed and
probably the biggest one was the
breitbach's 3 so this is an ISP an
internet service provider in the UK and
they sent these devices about a million
people in the UK alone and I could just
monitor your internet traffic I could
watch what you were doing on your reto I
could create my own Wi-Fi networks it
was really insecure so there's lots of
different ways of things like this can
go wrong but there's lots of things that
we can do to try and protect ourselves
in the first instance this is kind of
the worst case end of the line and one
of the biggest things that we're seeing
sites and anything else that
communicates online actually it can be a
smartphone app it can be a car anything
that talks on the internet we need to
protect the data as it goes over the
Internet if we're communicating with two
different parties to different devices
we have to be able to communicate
securely because without that then
everything after lies pointless like
there's no point trying if we can't even
speak securely and that is HTTP
encryption we need to encrypt the data
that goes over the internet but we we
talk about deploying encryption we're
actually seeing the largest drive
towards encryption in history right now
and we should deploy encryption because
it makes things secure and it makes
things private but that's sometimes not
enough motivation for people to do the
right thing so I want to deploy HTTPS
I'm going to do this thing what else can
I get what else do I get from that and
it turns out there's actually quite a
lot because now if you want to use the
new version of the HTTP protocol we're
moving from one point one to h2 as we
call it there's loads of really hacky
things we did in HTTP 1.1 to make our
sites go faster you probably recognize
some of them things like image rights
things like concatenating j/s and CSS
into bigger single files or domain
sharding where you would have like an
image subdomain to load your images from
so you could pull down more assets in
tandem all of these things are gone in
h2 we don't have to do any of this and
other hacky workarounds that we used to
do you get this all for free by default
in the protocol but these aren't the
only benefits of HTTP
if you want to use loads of the powerful
features and API is built into the
browser these days more and more of them
are being deprecated on HTTP we have to
use HTTPS it's kind of obvious for some
of them like the geolocation API if we
want the user to send us their exact GPS
coordinates should we be doing that on a
secure connection or for everybody to
see of course it should be secure next
one brought the compression I really
like this brought the compression is the
the new compression algorithm that will
very soon replace gzip and it's simply
more efficient it's better we can take
our pages and we can squish them down
even smaller than if we gzip them and we
can get them to the other side faster
this will make your site load faster
plain and simple and the really weird
one that a lot of people miss is that
Google now consider HTTP as a ranking
signal if you have two equally ranked
sites one of them serves HTTPS they will
get a higher SEO boost and appear higher
in the search engine result pages so
there's loads of other reasons beyond
the obvious that we should do this for
the security and privacy and this is the
first step so the four technologies that
I'm going to talk about because they all
kind of depend on having HTTPS in the
first instance a part of how I see kind
of how security has evolved certainly
over the last decade so in our
traditional browsing scenario we have
the browser talking to the web server
and historically all of our effort in
security was focused here we wanted to
make our server secure this was our
responsibility over the last kind of
decade and certainly over the last few
years especially our responsibility has
expanded out into what we call the
transport layer the bit in between the
browser and the server where the data is
going over the Internet and this comes
in the form of HTTPS as I say but with
the four technologies that we're going
to look at now what we're actually doing
is we're starting to reach out into the
browser we're bringing the browser onto
our team we can now as the operator of a
site actually take control of the
browser in certain scenarios force it to
do things which are our preference and
in some cases you can even override the
user's actions if
they are deemed to be insecure so we're
bringing the browser into this
conversation and onto our team and this
is insanely powerful now this seems to
have been a common slide title
throughout the last day or two and I'm
sorry to bring it up again
but there is a really good kind of point
here and most of the things that I'm
going to talk about do have really good
browser support we do have it across
pretty much all of the mainstream
browsers but it actually doesn't really
matter that much because if you deploy
one of these technologies and the
browser supports a then that user will
get the protection of that feature if
the browser doesn't support it I'll just
ignore it and do what it usually did
anyway so you can turn these features on
and give them to as many people as
possible that support them and the
others will just catch up in the future
there's no negative the worst case
scenario is that nothing changes and
that's it so I'm not gonna take the
opportunity to poke fun at which browser
vendors are good or not but I just you
know that wouldn't be cool so I'll just
get past that part and the first three
acronyms from my slide title then what
we call security headers these are HTTP
response headers that configure some
kind of security policy or some kind of
security mechanism and the three that
we're going to look at are down the left
here I've put a few extra ones down the
right if you want to do further reading
there are more than those I have time to
talk about but there we have CSP pkp and
SDS and these are the first three things
that we're going to look at now content
security policy if you've ever seen me
on Twitter or have come across one of my
articles I'm a huge advocate of this
you'll know that I talk about CSP all
the time and it's an incredibly powerful
feature originally it was designed to
stop something called a Content
injection attack this is where somebody
gets something into one of your web
pages that isn't supposed to be there a
really good example if you have a page
on your site you have a comment section
people are supposed to type comments in
there and submit them and then you
render them into the page wife somebody
just typed this script tag like that
now this is called cross-site scripting
is one of the most basic forms of attack
read
against websites and there are ways to
defend against this we can do input
filtering output encoding but ultimately
if we look at this if you look at this
as a person do you want that script to
load in your page and like hopefully
everybody here is gonna look at that and
say no I definitely don't want the
keylogger j/s file from evil comm but
the browser doesn't have that kind of
context that you have it doesn't have
the information you have it sees a
script tag and it goes and gets the
script that's its job with CSP we can
change that we can give the browser more
information to make informed decisions
so CSP itself as I say it's just a
response header you issue a new response
header on your pages called content
security policy and in the value of that
header you put your policy and your
policy is made up of one or more of what
we call the CSP directives this is only
a subset this is our third of what CSP
can do but for example you take
something like the font sauce directive
and then you would provide a list of
locations the browser is allowed to load
fonts from so you say font source this
website com that website comm and the
browser knows it can only load fonts
from those two locations you take the
image source then you say these are the
locations I permit you to load images
from script source same again you can go
through and specify the locations for
all these different types of content now
the most basic policy you could probably
start with would be something like this
the default source is the default for
everything self is a keyword for our own
site so we're saying by default I'm
happy to load things from my website my
domain and from example.com and the
content injection attack that we just
looked at a couple of slides ago would
be completely fixed now because if
somebody put my script tag into our page
loading from evil com the browser would
come to this and say well evil com isn't
whitelisted it's not allowed so I'm not
going to load it even though they got
the script tag there the browser now
knows not to load that script but I
could never deploy that and you could
never deploy that because we lowered all
kinds of content from all kinds of
places so you just do a bit of
fine-tuning on your policy we start with
the default source of our self
then we specify the locations that we
load scripts from new directives
override the default so we have to
specify self they don't inherit and then
we say the Google and cloud fly CDM and
this means you can now have script tags
on your page that look like this and you
just go forwards doing this you specify
the script source the style source image
source where can I frame things from who
can frame me where are my forms allowed
to post to that login form that posts
should that post to other domains you
can control all of these features and
functions in the browser with CSP so
that's kind of like the the basic stuff
that's what chp was intended for but
there are other really awesome things
that we can do with CSP if anyone has
migrated a site from HTTP to HTTPS
you'll have heard about mixed content a
mixed content is when you have a page on
HTTP but one of your image tags or one
of your asset tags may say HTTP in the
source you're loading two different
types of content one secure one not and
the browser's will treat this in a
couple of different ways it depends
exactly on the browser and the version
but none of them are good so there's a
really awesome website called bad SSL
common you can use this to kind of see
what the browser would do in these
various scenarios now this one is trying
to load mix script and chrome currently
will give you this little shield icon
and it will completely block the script
it won't even try and load it it just
says this is way too dangerous I've
completely removed it but if you try to
load a mixed image oh you can't allow it
never press this button as a terrible
button pretend it's not there you can
also load mixed images now images are
allowed so this image has actually
loaded because an image can't really do
much it's considered a bit less harmful
but we've lost our green padlock we've
lost our green HTTPS because we've done
something wrong but as the site operator
unless you actually go to this page
unless you actually find this thing
yourself you would never know that it
was there so your users are getting
errors in the browser they're losing the
green padlock that we tell them to look
for for security and you don't know and
we can also use CSP to fix this as well
there's another directive called blah
comics content and I think this is
actually the first time in history we've
called something what it does because it
does literally just block all that makes
content so if you have your page on HTTP
you try and load an insecure image so
this image is loading over HTTP if you
have the block or mix content directive
fortunately that will save us from
loading this terrible image and it will
block that and you won't get any
warnings in the browser it will just
skip over the image tag and say we've
been told to block all the mixed content
and the browser will literally just skip
over it now that's really good in one
way because we fixed them its content
the user won't get a warning we won't
get that degradation of the UI and the
browser won't do the insecure thing and
use HTTP but what if that website could
post securely
what if this is just a bit of legacy
code like an article from a few years
ago when we didn't use protocol relative
schemes there's another directive being
introduced to the CSP to fix this and I
actually much prefer this over block or
mix content and it's called upgrading
secure requests and what that will do in
contrast to block Onix content is that
when the browser gets to this image tag
it will rewrite it for you and it will
rewrite it to HTTPS so if you've got and
I've worked with wired.com on this I did
some work along sides like Tolman 15,000
pages of historic content where like 10
years ago who knew what anyone did and
you know you can't go back and fix that
you can just issue CSP with upgrading to
secure and just say to the browser look
whatever happens on this page just load
everything securely and that's it it
will go and fix all of your things for
you now CSP is quite powerful and with
any powerful feature we obviously should
test it before we deploy it and CSP
makes this super easy as well if you're
worried about deploying a policy if you
accidentally block all of your style
sheets your website won't look great so
you can deploy it in report only mode
and you append this report only section
on to the header and instead of actually
blocking all of your style sheets what
it will do is it will just put these
messages into the console so essentially
what the browser is doing is it's saying
this is the action I would have taken if
this policy was to be enforced I would
have removed all of these things and you
can say oh wow we didn't whitelist
jQuery comm we need to go at that so you
can you can make sure your policy is
safe to deploy and this is really good
this is really powerful bot you have to
click around your website in the console
and that sounds really boring so we can
fix that as well because there's another
directive in CSP called the report URI
directive and what this does is it saves
to the browser whenever you would write
a message into the console instead of
putting into the console send it to me
and send it to the address that I give
you so you can stand up a little service
to consume these JSON payloads that you
get them now the service that I run I
actually named it after the directive
because I think that this is so
important and so powerful nobody was
doing it and somebody had to so I built
a service to do this and what you do is
you get these nice JSON payloads back
and the browser says look you know this
thing went wrong on this page here are
all of the details that you need to fix
it and basically what we've done here is
turned the browser into kind of a QA
tester we're like here is a policy that
this page should add a to if something
on this page goes wrong please file a
bug report with all of the information
in it to this end point and you can take
this and say right on this page
something violated the default source it
was an image and it was trying to load
from HTTP in good comm so I can now just
go to that page and fix that thing I
actually got a useful book report and
when you can turn every single visitor
to your website into a member of your QA
team who actually files useful book
reports you can walk around like that
all day so that CSP is really good
that's like about a quarter of what CSP
can do you should really take that away
and look at the rest of the awesome
things that are in there
now the next acronym is another security
header and this one's called strict
Transport Security by contrast to CSP
this one's quite simple
now if you operate your site without
what we call HSTs which is HTTP strict
Transport Security user opens a browser
and they want to go to Twitter they just
type in twitter.com like who actually
types in HTTP colon slash slash Twitter
comm good like no one does it right and
this is the problem it's not good that
we do that but it's good that you're on
it so that nobody does you just type in
Twitter comm and you hit enter and the
browser defaults to HTTP because that's
the default protocol on the Internet
so the browser pre-fills HTTP and it
sends a get request and that hits
Twitter in Twitter say no no we don't do
HTTP around here anymore we've changed
the HTTP so they send you a 301 back and
say please come back on HTTP browser
says okay I got 301 we'll do that and
then you finally get to the page that
you wanted see now this whole first trip
is a complete waste anyway but we
finally get to the secure part down here
the bit where we actually want it to be
and this seems okay in it and it kind of
works but the problem is that the entire
first part of the conversation took
place in securely on HTTP now that
includes the bit where the Twitter where
Twitter said hey by the way you should
be doing this securely we sent that over
an insecure connection which means that
somebody could tamper with it somebody
can change that and this is so easy to
do it's quite scary so we send that
request to Twitter and if there's no
security the bad guy can just say yeah
I'm Twitter we're not on HTTPS they can
impersonate whoever they want and we
send a get request to them and they send
a get request to Twitter over HTTPS
because they know Twitter wants that and
then they just give us the page back
over HTTP and that our browser will
never get that 301 because its sent in
securely so the attacker would just sit
in the middle and they will talk to the
victim on HTTP and talk to Twitter on
HTTPS and this is so easy to do there's
a device called a Wi-Fi pineapple you
can go online and buy it for about $60
and it does this out of the box like you
can literally just turn it on and off
you go so we have to fix this this is a
fatal flaw that we tell the browser to
upgrade and be secure
when we're still insecure so this is
kind of useless this is what STS fixes
so again it's just another response
header this is all we have to do issue a
new HTTP response header on our pages
and put the policy in to the value of
the header now in contrast to CSP
there's only three directives in STS the
max age this is the number of seconds
that the browser should remember the
setting for so we turn this setting on
in the browser and say remember it for
this many seconds include subdomains
pretty obvious does what it says
if we issue this on example.com it
applies to example.com and all
subdomains underneath it and pre-loading
is an extra reading one for later
pre-loading is a really awesome feature
in STS so this is the basic policy this
is all you have to do to turn HSTs on
you issue the header and set the max age
to some value you start this quite low I
think that looks like about a year in
seconds you would start this quite low
test the waters with like 10 seconds
turn it on see if you already see if it
works and increase the value over time
when you do this when you issue this
header in the browser comes to your
website what it says is I don't want to
do anything insecure I am a secure
website and you must always speak to me
over a secure connection so if we go
back to the initial conversation when
the user opens their browser and types
in Twitter comm historically the browser
would pre-fill HTTP and send a HTTP gap
if you enable strict Transport Security
on your site what happens instead is the
browser says no this website has
previously enabled strict Transport
Security so I know I must do this
securely and he never even sends the
HTTP GET it goes straight to HTTPS so we
cut out the pointless redirect loop
which makes your site load faster if
it's not a cache 301 and we just default
secure and the really nice thing about
this is that even if the user did type
HTTP colon slash slash twitter.com and
hit enter the browser would override
them and say no this website has told me
secure only and I will force that if
they click a link but say HTTP if they
have a bookmark it doesn't matter what
happens
you now cannot make this browser speak
HTTP to twitter.com and this is
incredibly powerful because it protects
against a whole batch of other attacks
than the one that we just looked at it's
about a simpler mechanism as you can
possibly get and once all of our
communications have been securely there
is no more risk we can make sure this
happens now the next of the the kind of
headers the last of the three headers
was pkp and this one is called public
key pinning and this isn't for everybody
pkp is an incredibly powerful mechanism
and I would only really advise that kind
of high-value website consider this
maybe if your government or finance or
large e-commerce something like that
this is for for the kind of top end
high-value targets but we have a small
problem
with the web and with HTTPS in that when
you want to set up HTTPS you go to
someone called the certificate authority
and you get a certificate that's one of
the things that you have to do and
there's two certificates on the screen
here one of them was obtained by me for
my website legitimately and the other
one was obtained by somebody
illegitimately we call it a miss
issuance or a rogue certificate so if
somebody tricks a CA to issue them a
certificate when they shouldn't have
done or maybe they compromised a CA and
get a certificate issued to them that
says I'm Scott helm code at UK when
they're not this is what the browser
sees which one of those is the rogue
certificate and this is the problem
right like someone's someone's managed
to get one of these and it happens no
one has perfect security miss issuance
does happen every now and again but the
problem is this is the bad one but the
browser doesn't know how to tell these
apart they're both valid certificates
but with pkp we can actually give it
away to know which one of these is which
and we want to test this because I
actually am curious about the browser
support here so if you want to take out
your phone and go to my website
hopefully it will work hopefully it will
load but I want you to load this page
into your browser so you've got laptops
phones tablets and we're going to test
if your browser supports this in just a
few slides time I promise
thing will happen it's not a trick
everything will be fine just like Phil
deftly Phil just load this page in your
browser
we okay we good we're gonna we're going
to test whether your browser is
compliant in just a few slides of time
so what we do with pkp we call it h PK p
again is HTTP public key pinning and
it's just another HTTP response header
you issue the header you put the policy
in it and it shares some similar
directives with STS so we have max age
this is the number of seconds the
browser should remember this for it
should cache this setting for include
subdomains does what you would expect it
to do and we have this new directive
called pin sha-256 and when you deploy h
btep you have to put two of these pin
values in now when we looked at the
certificates a moment ago the
certificates have our public key then
they have our key in and what we do is
we hash that key and we put the hash
value into the header and we say look
we've hashed our key this is the hash of
our key and you also have to hash a
backup so that you can move to a backup
should something happen but essentially
you're just saying look I've hashed this
file on my server and I put the hash
into this header and when you come back
the certificate that you get the key
should hash to the same value that's how
you know it's mine because the hash is
match so we have a report on the mode
again and I cannot stress how important
this is with pkp like if you get this
wrong you will break your website so
please deploy this in report on the mode
first people do break their websites
with this and again just like CSP it has
the report URI directive so not only can
you say look deploy this in test mode
like we don't want to break anything we
just want to know if it's good you can
also say send me reports back when
things go wrong I want to know what
happens on my website when the user sees
an error message send it to me and this
isn't this isn't men sleep our 'fl it's
also real-time it's like as soon as the
browser can fire that post request you
can know there's an error message on
your website somewhere I can't stress
how like amazingly awesome that is to be
able to do but the pkp is probably on
the slightly worse end of this
bactrim for support so when I asked you
to load my website you've now loaded my
pkp policy as well as all the others
I've talked about and that should now be
cached and stored in your browsers and I
now I need to go to this subdomain which
is H PK p dot Scott helm code at UK so
you've gone to my website you've got my
policy and you've cashed it if you now
try and go to this subdomain if you get
this error message then the browser that
you're using is PK p complain if the
page loads then it's not so I imagine
everybody using Chrome or Firefox will
probably get something like this
if you're using any other browser then
you'll probably notice that my site
loads just fine PK P is only supported
in Chrome and Firefox but again that's
like what 80 percent of the market share
these days probably more you can offer
this level of protection to the vast
majority of your users and the rest of
them will just do what they did before
anyway there's no downside there's
nothing to lose here so again be careful
I just want to iterate at that point
this is a super powerful feature and if
you get it wrong your website will just
look like that all the time so make sure
you're sure now the last of the four
acronyms from the slide title before
that nobody probably knew was s RI this
is sub resource integrity consumer
resource integrity is by far the
simplest of these to deploy and it
actually fixes quite a big problem it
fixes the problem of the certain amount
of trust that we place in CD ends in
content delivery networks because we
have our nice super secure website like
I do
we've got HTTPS deployed we've got all
of these security measures deployed and
then we say like hey mr. CDN send me
version 3.1 of jQuery in our script tag
in the path like how do you know what
that CDN actually sends you like if they
wake up one day and they've had a really
bad day and somebody hacked them and
changed the jQuery 3.1 file you then
load that into your website blindly and
that could have all kinds of things in
it and CD ends make really juicy targets
for this reason because if you can
change a piece of JavaScript on a CDN
how many websites do you think you could
compromise at the
time you could get into a lot of
websites so if the CDN is compromised if
it goes rogue if they have a bad day
again nobody has perfect security like
this is a potential risk we want to be
able to fix this we want to be able to
make sure that the CDN can't send us bad
asset and we use SR I kind of like this
so we have our standard script tag and
all you need to do to deploy s RI on to
your website is add two new attributes
onto the script tag now the first of
these cross-origin is always set to
anonymous so we almost don't need to
worry about that one and then the next
one here the integrity attribute this is
the hash or the base64 encoded hash of
the asset so what we do is we say right
we want to include this particular
script into our page so you will get the
jQuery 3.1 file whatever it is and you
will hash it so you can either hash it
locally if you have a copy or I built a
tool to do this online you can just
punch in the link to the asset and say
look I want to enable s RI on this and
it will give you the hash of the file
bank so you can say this is the exact
copy of the file that I want to load and
when you embed that into the script tag
the browser will then download the
script tag as normal but it will hash
the file that it got from the CDN so
will go out it will fetch it and it will
hash in say does the hash whoops does
the hash of this file match the hash in
the script tag is it the exact same file
that I think that I won and that's it
you just literally add those two things
yeah the the hash value is quite long
but that doesn't really matter a static
so you don't have to change this going
forwards the only time that you need to
change the hash value is when you change
the source attribute so if you're
updating to the next version of your
framework you just rehash that and put
the new hash value in with it it's set
and forget there's no one going
maintenance here and if it's a good few
months ago I know actually I started
opening tickets with all of the
different CDN providers you know you can
go to like jQuery CDN or the client fly
CD you can just copy and paste the
script tags most of you if you've been
doing that recently have probably
enabled SR I already because most of the
CDN providers are now actually included
these attributes in the example script
and style tags that they give out
because we've asked them all to do it
like people can you know people just
copy and paste the script tag so why
don't we just copy and paste the script
tag with these two appropriate
attributes already says so have a look
the next time you go to a website you
will notice that most good CDN providers
already do this anyway but there's a
good chance that your code base doesn't
have it and then the problem is solved
of third-party trust we have our nice
secure website something happened to the
CDN they've changed the file there's
some malware or virus in it browser will
load that asset hash it and say well
these hashes don't match this is not the
file that I'm looking for Star Wars
reference so that's it it will show up
the file way it knows there's something
wrong with it and this is what we want
is we trust the CDN and we use them and
they load all kinds of things into our
websites but we should just make sure
that they're definitely loading the
thing that we think we want them to load
so that's the last of the four
technologies there this as I say it was
kind of almost for lightning talks for
introductions to these there was a lot
more stuff like this out there there was
a lot more information especially on CSP
that you can use and what I wanted to do
because we kind of suck at this in the
security industries we have all of these
awesome security features and we don't
often tell people about them or how easy
it can be to deploy these these are all
easy wins you can make a big difference
to the security of your site and your
visitors with minimal effort in most
points a knife and quite lazy I like
that I like the easy wins these are the
easy wins so I hope that you will take
these away with you and secure all the
things thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
