saw back last spring
it's a from a joke account called I am
developer look that tweet is code review
can be honest nice pick one and it got
me thinking this this attitude seems to
be the attitude among many developers
it's that I can either give you feedback
that is touchy and feely and makes you
feel good or is useless and is useless
or we can get some real work done but
you'll feel like garbage and that's just
the way it is the tweet received many
objections from people who were
wondering out loud why feedback can't be
both honest and nice and that is sort of
the inspiration for this talk it's what
got me to propose it many many employers
who are rightfully seeking high code
quality have created cultures
inadvertently that encourage code
quality our excuse me code reviews
leaving developers feeling unappreciated
overly criticized ultimately burned out
furthermore women people of color and
developers from other marginalized
groups have documented overly harsh
unproductive code reviews that seem
really more combative than productive
it's basically that the discrimination
that they face the workplace really
comes to a point inside code reviews and
furthermore when people identifying in
those same groups if they were to give a
code review that was perceived as a
harsh or brutally honest they could be
dismissed as angry pushy or difficult to
work with so what one of the excuses one
of the reasons I did this wanted to do
this talk was sort of an excuse to sort
of learn all about code reviews and do
research on them I did a lot of googling
and I did a lot of talking to many
people this conference impacts and
there's a really great blog article by
art Dietrich called how to use code
review to execute someone's soul
and he lists several flavors of toxic
code reviews and I've paraphrased them
I'm about to paraphrase some of them for
you and I've also added in some others
from just sort of my ramblings along the
internet there's the nitpicking session
it's basically we're going to talk about
how to name variables how to organize
files clever one-liners frankly I don't
think that this sort of the code reviews
are really the best place for this sort
of thing we have linters we have a style
guide if an organization can really just
agree to agree on one and then I also
agree to enforce it I think that's a
much better place to do so so much of
this stuff also can come up as opinion
disguised as fact so you could have an
opinion that variables should be
lowercase and underscored and that is a
popularly held opinion in this community
but it's still an opinion and maybe we
just need to call it an opinion and
supposed of dressing it up as objective
fact also and I've talked to several
people about this there can be this sort
of pressure as a reviewer to find
something anything wrong with the code
right you can't just pass it off as hey
it looks good to me right if I and it's
that if I don't find something wrong
with it
my my my peers and my supervisor will
see me as incompetent or lazy like I
couldn't find anything wrong with it and
so what you get is people taking the
proverbial red pen like your 11th grade
English teacher and circling sort of the
sort of lower order things like
formatting problem or indentation or bad
variable name or things like that and
you can get this sort of deluge of
things that I mean while they're nice to
have they're really they can bury the
lede like and they can bury sort of like
the discussion about the more important
stuff like how does this this submission
how does it fit into larger system that
you're submitting it to and I think
that's what code reviews here really for
there's also the marathon where it's
like we're gonna sit down in front of a
projector we're gonna go over every
single line ad nauseam to make sure it
works and make sure it's right I mean
that may seem like a good idea
and far be it for me to tell you that
it's not a good
idea for your team but one I just ask
the question like what teams do have
time for that
and two I'll just share in my
professional life I have known people
that are able to get their way simply by
talking the longest they're not
explicitly rude and what we would
consider rude but when an argument
ensues they their what they do is they
dig their heels in they do not they
refuse to concede if the meeting ends
they'll bring it up at the next meeting
and then they win by default because the
people they were arguing with got tired
had to leave had to pick up their kids
whatever it is so that doesn't sound
like the most productive thing is either
there's the firing squad and the exit
exam and at this point the relationship
has become adversarial it's that I'm
going to try to poke as many holes in
your code as I can to find efficiencies
if I can find efficiencies you failed if
I did not find deficiencies you've
passed right and I can understand that
particularly with you know things
concerns regarding like security and
making sure the code works but I think
this can have some adverse side effects
you'll spot a toxic code review when
it's defended using something along the
lines of this statement I'm just focused
on the code don't take it personally I
find this framework particularly
concerning because I think it opens the
door to toxic criticism I agree that as
developers we don't want to be too
attached to our code we heard that this
morning but I think the phrase don't
take it personally as flawed we're
thought workers after all the way the
code we write is a as a consequence of
the way we we see the problem of the way
we see the world so telling me that I
can't that I need to compartmentalize
myself are myself and my worldview
doesn't sound entirely possible to me
furthermore in a toxic environment I can
imagine we're you know a team where
people really don't trust each other
this phrase don't take it personally
could be used for all
lines of abusive behavior you're
incompetent don't take it personally
here's a quote from linus torvalds the
creator of linux maybe you know what I'm
about Satan I'm not a nice person and I
don't care about you I care about the
technology in the kernel that's what's
important to me it's a great leader I've
given this talk before and I've been
asked the question but Linus Torvalds
has created so much right he's given so
much to all of us from that matter what
about Steve Jobs he was an infamous
brilliant jerk our brilliant jerks there
maybe they're just worth it you know you
compare how they're mean but I look at
their output isn't it worth it for one
thing I think that this ignores the
externalities involved when people are
in power or allowed to abuse their power
under the excuse that their output is so
great those externalities could include
team burnout people being afraid to
speak their minds people being afraid to
make mistakes we're a creative
profession we have to have the freedom
to make mistakes we just have to this
behavior can come from the jerk but it
can also come from the people that are
in that are that are influenced by that
jerk and depending on how far they are
they are up in the in the hierarchy of
the company that that bad behavior can
spread downwards and outwards right and
it's worse we can we see things like
sexual harassment discrimination
workplace bullying and sexual assault
and we've we've heard many examples of
this especially recently if you add it
all up I'm not sure that brilliant jerks
are worth it at its most fundamental
level though I'm not convinced that we
can ask teammates to just leave their
emotions at the door there's a large
body of research out there especially
recently that despite what economists
say we are not rational beings we're
emotional beings it's it's really just
the core of how our brains work there's
more I've again I've talked to a lot of
people at this conference everyone I
talked to has something to say about
code reviews they either love them or
hate them and if they hate them I asked
them why because
I keep a running tally of what all the
things that don't work so a lot of you
do like code review so I'm not saying
like this is an awful thing and and I'm
about to share with you some things that
I think would make them go better but
there is also the bottleneck and that's
where a single person or a team maybe
the security team or something is
responsible for reviewing everyone's
code nothing can go forward until that
supervisor or small team has approved
everything right as a result we get
people who start writing their code with
the objective of getting it passed that
one person so you know don't do it that
way so-and-so wouldn't like it right and
then everyone starts trying to think a
little bit more like that one person
that's groupthink and as creative
workers that's probably not something
that's good for us as a reviewer who
doesn't have enough context that's can
be a problem too I mean I think that's
interesting because outside reviewers
can bring new fresh perspectives in but
I think problems can happen when that
reviewer doesn't have enough context
about the larger system that this thing
they're reviewing has relates to you so
what they end up doing is again they
start taking up the proverbial red pen
and they start identifying all the
things that they can see but they there
there's probably a lot of other things
that they're just not clued into because
they're just not close enough to the
project not necessarily that you have
you shouldn't use outside people but
that can be that can be an issue
similarly when someone's too close to
the project they've been working on it
themselves for a very long time and they
just missed the forest for the trees
code reviews that are summative and
summative it comes from the education
world if you don't know it's basically
an evaluation of something that has that
is finished right it's like a final a
final final exam at the end of a class
in college how much did you learn right
so if some of the evaluation is how good
is this now that you're ready to submit
it as opposed to a formative assessment
which is an evaluation of something as
it is taking shape so think about it
this way would you rather get a code
review about some about a bunch of code
you wrote over the last month
or would you rather get about Oreos
would you rather get a code review about
a small chunk of code that is still a
work in progress and you wrote it
yesterday
how much context would you was switching
would you have to do just to get back
into the place that you wrote a whole
month ago
sometimes code reviews can be too
asynchronous and if you work on open
source you know exactly what I'm talking
about so let's say I make a commit on a
Monday afternoon and my colleague she
starts reviewing it Tuesday morning but
then she has a family emergency she has
to leave work and she doesn't get around
to finishing it until Wednesday but by
then things have changed and of course
the code has to change too and
unfortunately my poor teammate wasn't
looped in it was my fault
I wasn't looped into this change and she
finished that code review even though it
was basically useless right now that's
that must be pretty disheartening to her
because she invested all that time and
something that and then I'm not being
needed a lot of us are remote workers or
asynchronous workers I'm I do some of my
work that way too we have to be able to
work asynchronously so I'm not saying we
shouldn't do that but it's a challenge
right humans are hard-wired for sort of
face to face communication doing things
together with another human at the same
time in the same place and and frankly
like just that code review is just
homework it's just a bunch of work
that's just piled on your desk and on
top of everything else you're supposed
to do it's you're supposed to review all
this other stuff and it just feels like
too much I've talked to people who said
that code reviews were required for
every commit I think that's a great idea
but I've spoken to people that have felt
that it's sometimes goes a little bit
too far right it's like we can think of
like a human being another step in your
CI server right a human will review
every single change but humans have to
do context switching and they don't do
it as well as as a machine so let's say
there's a really trivial change and I
need to get someone to review it so we
can push it out in a couple of hours
that means my colleague has to stop what
they're doing and review it and maybe it
only takes five minutes but they had to
stop they had to they had to change
context twice just to review that code
and maybe was trivial
so what was it worth it I mean I don't
know but that's a cost that's a price to
pay and then finally like all of the
above can lead to this one no one
believing in the process right so I it's
sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy right
it's like no one thinks that code review
is working at their company and so it's
definitely not gonna work at their
company and then it just gets worse and
worse so where does that leave us I'm
the the thesis of this talk is
definitely not like stop doing code
reviews like I'm hoping that we can
there's a way to sort of find we can
find our way to better reviews
we need to arrive at the best code
possible so there's the poop sandwich
which may you've heard of the basic idea
is like you sandwich two good things and
in between comes and not so good thing
or hard to hear thing I really like how
eg Dex but the part where you did why I
was not so good he should do is he
instead on the whole I loved how it was
blah blah blah and I think this is a
little bit better because it helps
developers it helps develop trust within
teams because the stuff that's hard to
hear is padded between two nice things
it's it'd be a little tricky to be just
I uniformly mean in something like that
um in a past life past career I was a
high school drama teacher and balancing
critical feedback with the the need to
get better was really important to me as
was protecting the ego of fragile 14
year olds we're all 14 year olds at some
extent like deep down we are let's just
acknowledge that the problem with that
was that the receiver would sort of hear
their feedback and they think of it like
a report card I'd say okay I got two
good grades and one bad grade right and
I can take these two good grades and I
can think of them like trophies I can
put them in my shelf and that bad grade
I can put it in my closet and not think
about it so these two things I don't
have to get better at I'm just good at
them that bad thing I'll just forget
about it because I'll never get better
at it and and and when when in fact like
this the truth is like the bad thing
they totally can get better at it and
the good things they could be even
better still so
but I wanted something better and
fortunately I learned about something
better and that's what this talk is
about it's called the Liz Lerman
critical response process the objective
is to inspire the creator to go back to
their work with fresh eyes excited about
making their creation even better Liz
Lerman proposes that the concept of
balancing kindness and honesty is a
false dichotomy really it's about
inspiration inspiration to go back to
your work and make it better it's like
you can't wait to go back to your
keyboard and start working on all the
suggestions you got the story takes us
believe it or not to the dance world Liz
Lerman is and was a dancer and the dance
world is is and was a notoriously harsh
in the way it gave feedback to people
she wanted a framework where creators
were encouraged to think critically
about their work with the and and wanted
to make it better as opposed to just
earning a good grade or getting a job or
earning approval from people who could
further their career it makes sense to
me if your number one objective is to
get a good grade get a job would impact
with that would you expect that would
have on your creativity the critical
response process started out being
something used for artists but it's not
constrained to work so we would call
capital a art it has been used by
artists but also administrators
scientists academics and even the
corporate sector it's really for
anything that's creative and I think
software is the perfect use case for
this there are three roles in this
process there's the creator the
responders and the facilitator the
creator or creators are the people that
are directly responsible for the work
the responders are people that are
offering their honest and encouraging
feedback to the work not nice
encouraging the facilitator keeps us on
track by following the framework so it's
worth noting that roles can sometimes
get blurred so if there's not a
facilitator in the room great we're all
facilitators sometimes but everyone in
the room share is a shared owner of the
work they all worked on it and that
means we're all going to play the role
of both creator and responder
there's four steps and step one is
statements of meaning we're gonna state
the responders are gonna state what
about the work had meaning or stood out
and statements should not be evaluative
good or bad there's a really great talk
from railsconf 2016 by Nadia Oh Jo it's
called the guest a guide to code
hospitality you should really see it if
you haven't or if you weren't there and
in it she proposes that we think about
introducing a person to a code base in
the same way that a host welcomes the
guests into their home I mean if you
were a guest in someone's home you
probably wouldn't upon first walking in
comment on the dirty clothes on the
floor it's rude so here's a good example
I noticed that this code is written in a
functional style that is not evaluative
we can have a great discussion about
that but it's neither good nor bad
here's a bad example this version of
rails is out of date you should update
the rails 5 maybe that's true but it's
evaluative and we're gonna save that for
later to be clear the process isn't
trying to somehow silence important
criticism I just want to make that clear
we're just trying to save that for later
so step two is questions from the
creators responders are allowed to give
their opinion about oh excuse me so
questions from the creators that's
actually wrong I'm sorry creators are
gonna ask questions about the work and
responders are allowed to give their
opinion about things explicitly asked
about that's the key so the process is
aims to put the Creator in the driver's
seat the creator gets to go first by
asking questions that they're just dying
to know about and there may be you may
have done this before to you when you're
writing something you're like oh I know
I just know that that part over there is
a bit hacky I just know that this part
over here could run faster and that's
where you get to go first by saying like
is this part hacky what do you think
and now what responders they get to
answer the question but only the
question nothing else here's a good
example in the docs was it clear to you
what this method does if not how could I
make it more clear and here's and here's
a good response I think I understood how
to call the method but not why maybe you
think about including an example use
hey that's great tangible tangible
feedback that's something I can jot down
and go and fix it here's a bad example
no and in general the docks were not so
well organized the way you should
organize it is that's out of scope of
the original question all right and we
could we couldn't we could imagine that
this conversation suddenly spinning out
of control and to like sort of a flame
war about like how to organize
documentation that's not what there was
what the creator wanted feedback on so
we're not going to do that step three is
neutral questions from responders the
purpose here is here is to understand
the context of the work the questions
should not have an embedded opinion
opinions that just happened and in a
question mark so to continue that
analogy of having a guest in your home
let's say you are taking a shower in the
gas bathroom there's no hot water you
probably wouldn't go to your hosts and
say why is there no hot water instead
you might say something like is there
something special I should know about
the guest the guest shower right because
you are leaving a space for the
possibility that there may be something
about the guest shower that you don't
know right and you could get a perfectly
a reasonable response
hey the hot water in the guest room it
just takes a while just turn it on wait
a few minutes it'll come on for sure or
I already took a hot shower and there's
we're out of hot water just wait thirty
minutes that's great right now you know
something better and you can be a better
guest if you've ever given a talk at a
conference and you've heard someone give
their opinion with a question mark at
the end you know what I'm talking about
we don't hear it at this conference
though here's a good example what ideas
guided you to select factory bought for
this project
bad example what were you thinking when
you chose factory about for this project
okay starting a sentence with what were
you thinking
makes your opinion clear it's rude but
it's also it's like it's it's it's out
of bounds because that's an opinion
we're not sharing opinions we're just
trying to understand the work better
opinions come at the end which brings us
to step four opinions responders may
give their opinions on the work with the
consent of the creators okay here's an
example I have an opinion about response
times in production would you like to
hear it creator says sure go for it and
then they give their opinion or the
responder could say I've an opinion
about the use of factory bots in this
project would you like to hear it no
thanks
moving on right the process believes
that the creator knows best how the
conversation should be steered in order
to yield best results it trusts that the
creator can see when the conversation is
going down an unproductive path in this
case the creator may have their reasons
they may know that they're committed to
that library at this time and it's
really just not practical to change it
or maybe they they could have all kinds
of reasons but it gives the creator the
power to steep to redirect the
conversation to something that's going
to be productive the nice thing about
this framework is that it's flexible
I've given in this talk at my local
Meetup and I've gotten several questions
before here are some of them would this
work on github or slack get up I don't
think it would
github like as you know like a
conversation on a PR definitely not
right like that's just sort of a pylon
of comments that's sort of like again
the proverbial red pen I think there's a
time in place for that and github is
probably great for that but not this
right people need to be in the same
space real or virtual to sort of have
that conversation together slack would
work as long as people are all going to
agree to sort of do it at the same time
right if it's gonna be asynchronous
probably not it needs to be a
conversation again we're humans and were
most hardwired for synchronous
conversation and I think this process
really needs that
does this mean I can say no thanks to my
managers opinions probably not but it
does mean that you and your manager
might be able to work together and
establish a shared understanding of when
and how feedback could be given maybe
and again it's entirely between you and
your manager and your team maybe
feedback at 4:00 p.m. on a Friday is not
the best time or 8:00 a.m. on a Monday
before anyone's even started work right
maybe that's just like it we've
discussed ahead of time that's off
that's off limits
but if feedback is sort of in bounds of
that shared understanding then there's
just this there's an implied
understanding but that yeah that opinion
is welcome at that time based on the
working relationship you have and trust
the framework seems too rigid does it
have to be definitely not okay now all
of you I took a one-day training on this
but I didn't need to all of you are now
empowered to use this and I'm gonna
share the slides with you too so if you
all are ever wanting to have a
conversation like this you all are
empowered to say you know what I think
it's time we're just going to skip ahead
to step four or now that we've talked
about opinions we're gonna skip back to
step one you can totally do that based
on with just what seem what seems the
most appropriate I'll also point out let
it seem that not everyone in the process
needs to know it by name right let's say
you're the only person on in the in the
process in the conversation that knows
about this and you're responding to
someone's work if you're gonna if you
start by asking them questions to
understand the context of what their
work is before you start giving your
opinion that's a win right because you
now understand it better and you can
probably give better opinions on the
other hand if you're if you're getting
feedback no one else knows this process
only you if you're if you're the one
giving you're the creator and you're
getting feedback and you start by asking
particular questions about your code
that you're just dying to know that's it
that's a win - because you've steered
the conversation in a way that you know
will be productive I gave again when I
gave this talk recently somebody
commented that I wrote it down
great teams do this naturally they just
don't have a name for
I think that's totally true for the rest
of us we have a process for the
imperfect teams that that we're a part
of do you really expect jerks to go
along with this I don't honestly like I
don't I I honest but also I I think and
hope that in most work environments
there's there may be this this many
jerks but there may be this many people
who would love to use a process like
this if they if they ever ever knew
about it
and I just think maybe the issue is that
we're we're designing code reviews
without any kind of intentionality and I
think if there were a little bit of
intentionality injected I think we could
all be a lot happier other ever times
when this framework would be wouldn't be
the most efficient if the network's down
that's not a good time to do it if
there's a fire in the data center
there's not a good time to do it but I
you're going to have a conversation
afterwards about what happens and how
you can make sure it won't happen again
and you want that environment to be as
blamed free as possible and really be
focused on identifying the problem so it
won't happen again and who will be
responsible for what and what we need to
change about the prop our workflows so
it doesn't happen and this is a perfect
time this is a perfect place to do that
so just to recap there's four steps
it's the statements of meaning questions
from the Creator neutral questions from
responders and then opinions with
consent of creators I'm gonna open the
floor for questions in just a minute but
I also wanted to give a quick shout out
to the greater-than code podcast if you
don't know it's a weekly panel style
podcast which talks about the human side
of tech this summer they put out a call
for guest contributors to their blog and
because they just seemed so nice I
decided to submit an article which
eventually became this talk even though
I had never done something like that
before
and we're not for that podcast I
wouldn't be standing here right now so
they really appreciate I really
appreciate everything they've done to
support me and I think you should check
them out if you haven't already these
are some resources which you might not
be able to read but you can go to my
github and
down the whole talk and see them there
and that's my talk thank you very much
I'm happy to take your questions oh yeah
I'll repeat it
that's actually great is like over here
we had a comment as like as soon as you
make a PR first thing you do mark up
your own PR and stay like and this part
looks hacky what do you think right and
doing sort of direct people say like
that's actually a great idea because I
think that like as a reviewer that would
give me a free work first sort of like
going oh this person has these questions
okay I'm gonna focus on that I feel like
I've been helpful yeah thank you
other questions or yeah so I think the
question if I'm getting this right is
that there's some questions or there's
some topics where the the creator just
needs to learn something new and Liz
Lerman again she she was a dancer right
she talked about like in in the ballet
world which is like highly technical I
don't know anything about belly but like
there's right and there's wrong and I
think what you're getting at is the same
thing like there's there's some things
that are just right or probably most
likely a good idea and there's other
things that are just probably not a good
idea and honestly like that's that's
another beast the way I see it right
there are certain things that are like
no please don't do that um however like
I think it's what's important to do is
to be upfront about that and say like at
this company we don't do that or this
company we need you to know that this is
the way to do it that's just the right
thing to do and just be upfront about
that and just so everyone can follow it
does that answer your question yeah so I
don't think that I don't think this
process really is for that sort of thing
yeah that's awesome
um I the question was what about
communities there are always
asynchronous like open source
communities so I'll give it I'll give a
shout out to agile ventures if anyone
there's about them you can give them a
Google um they're basically like they
have a they are sort of a collection of
numerous open-source projects that are
the people can jump into they have a
slot community you can get invited to
they have two daily stand-ups that you
can just sort of anyone can drop in to
Google Hangouts and just sort of ask
their questions say these are the blocks
that I've had and and so yeah I mean
hosting a hosting a daily standup or
even a weekly stand-up or it's a like
I'm gonna be hacking on this on Sunday
if anyone wants to jump on a hangout
with me at any point I would love to
sort of help you get get started on this
project but I it definitely takes added
intentionality for open source projects
for sure yeah
so the thank you that the comment was
let's be intentional about saying like I
let's say I believe and I think when
that's the case and not this is the way
it's done you know as a relatively newer
comer
I appreciate knowing when something is
abject objectively true and when
something is a good idea but there's
also other good ideas out there I think
that's a really terrific comment is like
organizations can be really intentional
about these are the things that we are
these are the things that we hold to be
true but there are opinions and these
are the things that are just playing
objective truth
yeah was there a question that you
wanted me to answer was was that I
appreciate the comment but was there any
yeah that's the question was like if
you're on the receiving end of a code
review that is not so great
maybe toxic what can you do to sort of
turn it around into something that makes
it less so and I'll just first
acknowledge that like if you're getting
burned by your co-workers there's no way
to sort of wave a wand and make that not
true like it's it hurts and it can't
just be conjured away as a white male
straight white male sis male I I also
have to acknowledge that like there's
probably a lot of comments that I've
never been on the receiving end of that
some in this room may have but with that
huge caveat
I'll get the best I can offer is that
there are there's hopefully something
what was that
oh there's hopefully something he can
pipe up to there's hopefully there's
hopefully something to learn from it in
terms of trying to sort of dig below the
harsh comment that that person is making
and say like okay well I got this harsh
comment before maybe I can at least
learn like what's the underlying truth
that they thought maybe they're telling
me like I shouldn't use this library at
all why is that maybe I want to google
it and find out they definitely
shouldn't sit shouldn't have said it
that way but what can I learn from that
so I don't think that's a really great
answer but I appreciate the question in
the list so the Creator what if the
Creator is the jerk I think that's a
terrific answer or question managers
need to step up they need to say this is
the way we're gonna be doing things
we're going to be giving and receiving
we're gonna be giving feedback that's
honest and it's useful and we expect
everyone to sort of learn from it and
work from it but managers need to step
up okay so the question was like let's
say a responder like it's sort of a
standoff between two of the creator the
responder and they can't the responder
is not getting their way and so they
recruit someone else on the team to sort
of get them to be to agree with them so
now all of a sudden it's a vote of two
to one I guess one thing you could do is
you could say you could be intentional
about who the team at who the route pool
is going to be participating in this
process and then close the door I mean I
think like I think again I think that
goes back to intentionality I think
that's like that's really sneaky toxic
behavior to sort of like pull people in
when you clearly have an objective so
maybe a door maybe a closed door it
would be be the thing to do in a team
like that yeah the facilitator is a role
that is held by a human or it could be
held it can be shared among several
humans but the idea is like actually
that's a really good feedback so let's
say thank you
that was a great clarifying question
that that answered something for me and
I'm not joking that's that was actually
great let's say someone says this what
were you thinking when you chose factory
bought for this project the vizulator
says whistle don't that's it that's a
question disguised as an opinion can you
try to rephrase that please so they're
they're like objectively enforcing the
rules and they're saying okay now we're
done they might say hey we've heard
enough of step one let's move on to step
two because the Creator while they
should while they are in the driver's
seat
they're busy writing things down they're
busy thinking they're busy asking
clarifying questions and we want a
facilitator that's really gonna drive
the conversation good question well it
is 3:20 I would love to talk more about
this so come find me
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
