with is it food a journey of Mines
machines and meals and when I give talks
I'd like to think about why do I want to
give this particular talk and the reason
why I wanted to give this particular
talk was I wanted to learn about machine
learning and I watched a bunch of talks
and other things on it and I always felt
like the information was either way too
high level or way too low level for me
and I couldn't find that happy medium
that would make me happy
so one of the problems that I often had
was I'd watch these talks and I'd see
things like this a lot of charge to talk
about things like this and reference
linear regression or gradient descent or
other things like that and then I try to
look up definitions for things like
gradient descent and I get this gradient
descent is a first-order iterative
optimization algorithm to find a local
minimum of a function using gradient
descent one takes steps proportional to
the negative of the gradient or the
approximate gradient of the function at
the current point that is that is how I
feel when I read these types of things
so I wanted to set up some goals so that
my talk wouldn't be this and I have two
main goals with this talk I want to
focus on practicality I want to talk
about a real-world use case and frame
everything that I'm talking about kind
of around that idea but I should first
start with some disclaimers I'm gonna
try my best to balance between practical
and technical and as a result I might
end up oversimplifying some things this
is really just meant to be a high-level
overview and my goal with this is to
have a few of you at the end of this go
oh that was neat maybe I'll try it too
so I want to start off with a brief
experiment I want to find out is
something food or more specifically as
people like to remind me that images
can't be food is it a photograph of food
so I hope this will be a fruitful
experiment
is this food sorry sorry is this a
photograph of food how do we know
exactly we've we've seen things that
look like this or exactly this kind of
thing and we know it's food but that
doesn't really get to the meat of our
problem so some of you had met who may
never have seen this particular dish
before yakitori but how do we know that
this is food it it smells good okay so
so part of it is like we can immediately
recognize the ingredients and break it
down and kind of process it and it looks
like something that we've seen before
that's pretty sweet but what about this
is this food see this one's really
questionable but if I if I give you the
contrast here and I say is this food and
then I say is this food right you might
say that this one isn't food but this
one might be because we can tell that
there's something inside of there and we
actually have a lot of experiences where
we've opened up this package and eaten
the delicious crispy Kit Kats and been
very happy and it's really awesome if
you hand a child a package of empty Kit
Kats and they were not used to this
experience yet they get very very
disappointed because there's nothing in
there alright so I just have a couple
more is this food is it is it a picture
of food I'm not sure all right I think
we can clearly identify this as food but
what about this
I really hope nobody said yes but I
really want to talk about is we're able
to look at these pictures and identify
their food because we know about pattern
recognition and in many ways this was
core to our survival in order to be able
to do pattern recognition it's one of
the key factors that led us to
developing language to being able to
develop tools and do agriculture and
we're really exceptional at it except we
hate slow and menial tasks if I gave you
ten thousand images and I said are these
all food you would get bored really
quickly and not want to do that so that
makes us try to venture out and automate
the problem now this is an interesting
kind of problem to try and automate
because as humans we can recall
information in an extraordinarily fuzzy
way and between past experiences we can
piece together the information we had
before and order form new information or
understanding about the world around us
but this process is very hard to program
and so machine learning can be used as
an approximation of this kind of
behavior so I want to talk about three
different types of machine learning in
this situation we have unsupervised
learning which specifically refers to
taking information and kind of
clustering it and grouping it together
into individual parts and the computer
decides what that necessarily means so
you might have a chart that has all of
these things plotted out and here you
can see there are these centroids that
say uh this is the blue group this is
the green group and this is the red
group and it doesn't really matter where
a dot law is it just looks to what
centroid is it closest to so anything in
the green area would be green anything
in the red area would be red and
anything in the blue area be blue and
this is the kind of unsupervised
learning it just kind of clusters
everything together into individual
buckets and that's kind of useful but
sometimes we want to know can we label
something and so that's where supervised
learning comes in and supervised
learning you provide all the information
up front and say these things are this
these things are this and these things
are this and then the system tries to
learn how to identify new information in
that way and the last of these three
categories is reinforcement
reinforcement is kind of similar except
every step of the way you tell it
whether it's right or wrong
it tries to make a guess and you say yes
you were right and it takes that
information and applies it to the next
iteration so that it can get better over
time now for the purpose of identifying
images we're only going to be talking
about supervised learning here and
specifically we're going to be talking
about neural networks so I want to give
you a brief history of artificial neural
networks so one of the first artificial
neural networks created was the
perceptron and it was invented in 1957
by Frank Rosenblatt and this machine was
actually designed for image recognition
back in 1957 which I find
extraordinarily fascinating but one of
the problems with this style of image
recognition was that it couldn't really
learn how to do specific types of
algorithms and so it could only learn
linearly separable patterns and that's
how I felt about that definition now the
problem with the research and the fact
that it couldn't progress forward was
that it caused neural networks to
stagnate for quite a bit not a lot
happened and because of that I'm just
gonna fast forward to 2015 and talk
about tensorflow and that's the brief
history of artificial neural networks
all right so what is tensor flow so
tensor flow was developed as a system of
building and training neural networks
which are represented as something
called a data flow graph they can look
something like this each layer of this
graph which is represented by one of
those oval shapes takes in a tensor and
returns a tensor performing some
operation on the tensor what is a tensor
so when I look this up I got an image
that looked like this and when I saw
this I just assumed I would never be
able to understand what a tensor was but
the simple answer is that a tensor is
just an N dimensional array of
information you can choose whatever
dimension however you want to represent
it and it's just a set of information
that goes in and then you have another n
dimensional array that comes out they
can be whatever dimensions are necessary
for solving the problem
so in this situation you take in some
array and it goes through each
individual step and sometimes it splits
out into more steps and converges onto a
single step so something will come in at
the beginning
work its way all the way through each of
these steps and eventually you'll get
some results on the outside now this
particular data flow graph represents
inception or specifically inception
version three so you might ask what is
inception so inception is a prebuilt
data flow graph useful for categorizing
images and it was originally built on
the image net data set now this is a
pretty interesting website because you
can use it to get human classified
images for categories and there are tons
of them available to you so it's really
useful if you're trying to do any kind
of machine learning to be able to
download these sets of images and use
them in your projects for training
purposes so that covers what is
inception but how does this all tie
together and I want to return to my
original question is it food why am I
trying to answer this question well as
you may surmised from my shirt I work
for a company called cook pad and we
happen to have lots and lots and lots of
data about food and particularly we have
lots of images of food but when you have
a website that allows users to submit
content you run into some problems they
might not always be trying to submit
food to your website and you kind of
care about that because if you don't
care about that very bad things can
happen and people can get upset really
really quickly so there's a couple
things that we want to do we want to
protect our users by ensuring that the
images posted are actually food for a
number of reasons we don't want to show
them something that's inappropriate we
also found that users like to do things
like put text on their images and say oh
you can find the real recipe over on
this other a competing website and we
don't want those types of things to
happen either so where I work at cook
pad we essentially do that we have an
app that basically looks at an image and
classifies whether or not it's food and
so I thought it would be really
interesting to try and recreate what was
already created and do it with a rails
app I mean our main application is a
rails website but the machine learning
stuff is all done in Python so I decided
I was going to build a rails app mistake
number one
actually in all fairness mistake number
one was when I went into this problem I
told myself no Python I'm not gonna use
Python I'm going to use Ruby because I'm
giving this talk at railsconf and no one
wants to hear the dirty word Python so
this would be fine there's a gem for
kind of handling this called tensorflow
dot RB now I tried this a number of
times but I actually wasn't able to get
it running on my machine my guess is
that there's actually an issue with
clang and this gets into compilers and
no one enjoys trying to debug a compiler
on their machine you just kind of want
to download it have it work so that
didn't happen and so one of their
suggestions was to use docker
mistake number two was of course docker
so after setting up the docker image
there were a couple programs written in
C and C++ for kind of solving the
problems that I wanted to do and I tried
compiling those and those didn't work so
I kept retrying and retrying and
retrying and then I got my favorite
docker problem which is your startup
disk is almost full so after figuring
out through the documentation how to
delete all of my images I decided to
start over and so I kind of want to
document my road to success for solving
this kind of problem with one small note
your mileage may vary so let me go over
installation and setup so this was my
starting point I decided to install
Python finally set up a virtual end and
go to the process of installing
tensorflow now I want to make a quick
note here as a rubyist I want to embrace
the Ruby community I want things to work
in the Ruby community and here I'm
telling you to use Python but I want to
be clear here this isn't saying that we
shouldn't as a ruby community embrace
machine learning and try to make it part
of our community but if you're getting
started you do not want to fight against
your tools and right now the best
toolset that I found is using Python the
community is really strong in machine
learning they put together the correct
tooling I highly suggest not fighting
against it I suggest using it going with
the flow and using the tools that work
and so for me I got this set up and it
just worked being able to use tensorflow
now the next step after installing
tensorflow through this process was to
figure out how can I make it solve my
particular problem there is already a
tool inception which works on image net
images and knows how to classify those
but I want to do something different I
want to do retraining I want to change
which image set it's able to identify to
an image set that I actually care about
and we can do this through something
called transfer learning transfer
learning is basically if we look at this
data flow graph we have one step at the
end and if we pull off that step we can
replace it with our own step and the
benefit of this is we can actually use
everything that was previously learned
and apply it to our current set of data
so if you want to work with Inception v3
and have it recognize your own image set
you basically just need to collect a
bunch of data and you need to collect it
into a folder you can call whatever you
want I called it data because I'm not
really creative and inside that folder
you just decide what categories are
going to have now which categories you
choose is really crucial it's not enough
just to have a bunch of pictures of food
if all you've ever seen in your entire
existence is food then all you know is
food so you want to be able to identify
things that are not food so if you can
think of cases that are particular to
your situation that you want to identify
against you should also have images for
those in our situation we didn't really
care about flowers but those came with a
example so my company used them for some
reason but we cared about people we
don't want people showing up in any of
our images we want to protect our users
privacy we want to remove any pictures
of humans and additionally we wanted to
avoid text for that problem that I
mentioned before we had lots of users
who want to say ah go watch the video
for this recipe over here so we don't
want that to happen so we created these
categories and inside that we put lots
and lots and lots of images now for my
training purposes the folders that I had
had between 1,000 to 2,000 images except
for text which has around 600 and the
nice thing about this is the images can
be really small tensorflow actually only
operates on images that are about 299
pixels by 299 pixels
if you don't have an image in that size
it will automatically resize this and
this is another thing that you care
about with your test data if you don't
have your image properly resized and it
tries to resize it if your subject isn't
in the center you might lose that
information so it could make sense to go
ahead and resize your image ahead of
time to make sure that your subject is
in there properly all right so now that
I've collected all of my data my next
step is to try and retrain and I'm no
expert in machine learning so I didn't
want to write this script myself luckily
there's already a script that does it so
I pulled it down from the tensorflow
repository on github I changed some
directories so that instead of
outputting to temp it out put it into my
local directory a few files and then I
decided to run the retrain program
telling it that the image Durer was my
data directory and then I waited and
waited and waited and waited and while I
was waiting it outputted things like
this it said looking for images and all
those directories and it started
building bottlenecks what is a
bottleneck I do not have any clue so I
looked this up and the definition for a
bottleneck was an informal term
referring to the output of the previous
layer and the reason we care about this
is because in order to train the network
it's going to have to keep passing
images through and seeing how well it's
doing and you don't want to have the
image have to go all the way through
your data flow graph every single time
so actually it builds it once and caches
it so that it can reuse it and if you
actually do this from scratch you won't
get this pretty printing of 100
bottleneck files created it'll actually
go file by file telling you it's created
the bottlenecks this is what happens
after it's cached if it's already cached
those values and can find them then it
will just print this out instead of
doing them all by hand the next thing
you'll see is this it'll start referring
to things like train accuracy cross
entropy and validation accuracy and this
was kind of interesting to me I wanted
to know why it was printing out these
three things and what's really neat is
tensorflow is going to do a very
interesting thing where it splits out
your data into three individual parts
one for training one for validation and
one for testing now tray
is the data jr. model on so it's gonna
say like ah these look like these and
I'm gonna keep making things better
along the way and you try to make sure
that through the process it never sees
the testing data in order to validate so
once it's finished this program will
actually run the testing data through
and see oh do we get these correct but
it doesn't use it as a method of
training it only uses it for validation
and that's used to avoid overfitting we
want to make sure improvements in
training accuracy actually appear in the
unseen data set so if there isn't an
improvement that it can see it doesn't
actually care about those particular
weights and then the last part
cross-entropy
is your loss metric and this is
important every single time you want to
train a neural network you need some
kind of loss metric to say this is bad
you want to minimize that value so that
you can make your system better and all
of these values are focusing on the
accuracy but the result of this running
this are two different files that get
output the graph and the labels now the
graph is kind of complex
it's an encoded format of that previous
thing that I showed you that has each
step and that's not really interesting
to open and look at because it's kind of
a weird encoding a mixture of texts and
binary but the labels file is actually
really simple it looks like this and the
reason why is because when we're talking
about a tensor it's mostly dealing with
numbers and at the output you get some
category it belongs to 0 1 2 3 4 and you
care about the actual label of that
category so it just outputs this file
with those labels so that afterwards it
can look up that label and say ah this
was food this was a person this was a
flower so let's get to the point where
we can use it now once I've retrained
I want to be able to take that train
network and label my image and I just
found some code online again in order to
be able to do that so I just copied this
label image py into my current directory
I changed the graph and labels to my
local directory and it ended up looking
something like this so this is actually
fairly simple compared to the retrain
which I won't go in
- the retrains about a thousand lines
but this is approximately fifty or so
and all it does is it basically takes
that last layer that's the final result
part on there and runs your image
through just that last layer since that
last layer has already been trained to
do everything that we needed to do and
so this process is actually pretty quick
we get to the point where we're at the
end here and you can see that it just
looks through the labels file and finds
out which label it needs to pull out so
great I've done this step I've gotten to
the point where I can potentially label
images let's take a look at that
actually working alright so I have a few
test images in here so here we have a
directory with some images in it
I have sushi pizza which I suggest you
never eat I have this post box hamburger
a pizza and some dirt so let's find out
which of those are food and which ones
aren't so in order to do this I just
have to run Python label image and then
my image so let's start with the sushi
pizza and so you can see here hopefully
a little bigger that for food it said
that it had 0.9 as its yes and that's
really high so it thinks that this is
probably food let's try the dirt and
here we can see that it's in the
category of other so that's great we
don't want dirt to show up as food so we
can use this on all of our images test
three is the pizza and of course it's
not so sure that that's pizza it's at
84% instead of 90 or it's food but it's
still relatively high enough and that's
a point to take into consideration it's
never going to be a hundred percent
accurate you're never going to get a
hundred percent this is food unless all
you've ever trained it on is food and it
only has one category there's always
going to be a small percentage that it
could be something else and you never
want to achieve perfect
accuracy because you're probably going
to overfit and it's gonna be bad at
solving the general problems that you
want alright so let's go back we have
this and we can see that it's training
correctly it's been trained correctly
and can identify food all right so I got
to the point where I want to make this
work with a web server I want to be able
to use this in my rails application so
how do I do that
I have code in Python and I want it
inside of rails and so as I mentioned
before I'm already doing this exact
thing at the company where I work so my
suggestion here is actually just to
treat the machine learning aspect of it
as a separate service and call it from
your rails application so in order to
build a service I decided to use
something called flask which is kind of
like Sinatra again was just pip install
upgrade flask and then I just converted
that label image py file into a small
server that I could use to get the
response that I wanted and it actually
didn't take too much this looks very
similar to that label image py file that
I had before but here I've created a
server out of it and it only has one
route classify and it's going to return
the predictions for what things are now
it's kind of important to return the
predictions because you want to look at
not just the top prediction but all of
your percentage is to see if it's a high
probability it could be something that
you're not looking for maybe it's
worthwhile to label something that it
thinks is 30% a person or 30% and text
if your system cares about that we
basically red flag images that fall
under those categories and then they're
reviewed by an actual person at that
point if they need to be but we found
that we actually get about 98% accuracy
on all images that are uploaded all
right so let's use this I built a small
rails application that is actually going
to take the images and identify whether
or not their food by calling out to this
service that we built all right so here
it is we're going to choose a file and
let's start with our sushi Pizza food
all right let's tie something harder I'm
gonna give a taco baby let's find out a
taco baby is food or not not food yes
good job all right I mean we can try
that with any number of images but again
it'll have the same predictions that we
had before so if you want to get started
that's all it really took was
downloading a few scripts offline
collecting a bunch of images putting
them together and running them and
finding a way to make it work now when I
first started this path again I said I
was going to use Ruby and not Python I
want to make sure that no one makes that
same mistake I spent an entire day just
messing around with docker and messing
around in the command line trying to
find like which flags can I use with
clang okay it's not going to work with
clang let me try to set up GHC or say
GCC on my system and make it work with
GCC and going through that whole song
and dance and after spending an entire
day on that I went the Python route and
I took five minutes and so the lesson
here is to make sure that you understand
what you're trying to do and not
fighting against it don't try to do it
your own unique way if you're learning
once you've learned it then you can go
back and do it your own unique way and
suffer if you'd like now in my process I
suggested I read some things and I
suggest also reading these as additional
material
there's demystifying deep neural nets by
Rosie Campbell I highly highly recommend
this talk after my talk it's it's a
really great it goes more in depth into
some of the more technical aspects of
things and then if you're interested in
a book I highly suggest Python machine
learning by Sebastian Raksha and that's
it what was the probability of tako baby
all right we can find this out
it's other it might be a person 30% it
might be a person I don't actually know
the answer to that question
so what I'm sorry I'd repeat the
question the question was how many
images a day is cooked bad classifying
and I'm actually not sure on the exact
number so I can't say I know that it's
quite a few but that's that's it sorry
yes I can okay the question was when
we're classifying text what does that
kind of look like what kind of fonts are
we using or is it an overlay and I'll
answer that question first but I want to
make a point that as an international
company we actually have our biggest
market in Arabic speaking countries and
so we found that Arabic text was the
majority of our problem because of that
reason all of the most of the text in
here is going to be Arabic so we just
have lots of examples of Arabic text
with some emoji and other things that
we're trying to identify you can see
some of them are on top of things that
kind of look like recipes some of it is
English text not sure why it's about
hookworms but we have lots of different
examples in here different fonts
different backgrounds things like that
I have not messed ok so the the question
was about Google clouds vision API I
have not used that yet so I'm I'm not on
the machine learning team specifically
so I haven't messed with those tools
I've only kind of gotten trickled down
education about machine learning and
decided like I was interested in this
and I wanted to explore it more so I'm a
rails developer not a Python developer
and I kind of want to stay as far away
from Python as I can but I'm becoming
more and more interested in it as an
avenue of learning these things so the
question was what would it take to be
able to do this in Ruby and have a not
stock so actually it's going to take the
community to take a look at tensorflow
dot RB and trying to get it compiling on
all systems
the main developer for it doesn't use
OSX you only use as Linux
and he's not necessarily writing it for
that particular thing so if people can
get involved you have more knowledge
about tensorflow itself and C++ coding
and Ruby and making extensions for those
types of things that would be
extraordinarily helpful in making this a
reality in Ruby so the question was when
classifying images how long does it take
per image how does it scale as you add
more images into the system what's the
memory usage like I don't have those
particular statistics I found that
categorizing images didn't take too long
and even on our system where we have a
lot more training data it's still a
roughly short amount of time per image
because as I mentioned you're actually
only putting the image through the last
layer of that data flow graph the whole
graph has been trained up to the point
where the last layer gets to reuse all
of that information and that process is
fairly quick but I would still suggest
doing it asynchronously rather than
synchronously like I did in my example
okay so the question was as you're
collecting images how do you know what's
the right amount of images to collect
and if your accuracy isn't correct how
do you try and correct for it and so the
answer is there's no way of knowing what
the correct number of images are because
again it's an imperfect science right so
you want to collect a lot of images but
there's no like cutoff point where that
number becomes the correct number the
more images you have are great but it's
not only just the more images you have
of in my case food it's more images of
things that aren't food and when you
notice that things aren't working quite
the way you want if you can figure out
okay we wanted it to identify it as this
but it didn't getting more examples that
are closer to that and giving it more
training data that kind of represents
that single form that you're looking for
can help improve that okay so the
question is what size data set do I
think is the appropriate size for doing
this kind of image classification in
production you know it really comes down
to a couple of things I think the image
size data set that I had for just this
testing worked well enough to use it in
production my my accuracy is probably
gonna be a little bit lower it's 80% but
I can start it moving and then kind of
find is it working or not
right if I'm if I'm always trying to
push for that certain percentage I might
never hit that
act 1 I think our goal was to get it to
about 98% I cooked bad and if we could
do that with a 98% we were fine with the
2% that wouldn't get cat or I
categorized correctly so it's kind of
trying to figure out like how important
is it for this classification to happen
and for which specific cases do you
actually care about it being important
right
we don't want humans showing up on our
thing so we want it really good at
identifying like this is a human and we
don't want that picture for a various
number of reasons we don't want that to
happen so we care about that accuracy in
that situation so I think you need to
specifically decide like which
situations do you care about if I showed
you a picture of a doc and a picture of
a duck ends up on the website like I
care a little bit less about that
especially if it's a cook duck but it's
not a cook duck then no I probably don't
care as much as if a person showed up or
text because those are the specific
situations that are actually difficult
for us to mitigate so we don't actually
retrain that frequently part of it was
once you get the system kind of stable
and you don't see any problems there
really isn't a reason to keep trying to
retrain it right if you can get the
numbers that you're looking for it's
fine I'm sorry I should repeat the
question how often do we retrain so it
doesn't happen that often far less than
you think I think unless there's some
catastrophic problem we're like oh no we
missed this situation or another
situation that could come up is users
find a new way to abuse our system and
we want to say like alright we need to
prevent this how can we prevent that
then we might retrain it on an
additional set of data getting better at
classifying this new set of problems
have I ever participated in the image
classification competition no so that's
cool yeah I mean image classification
has a lot of potential uses moving
forward and especially as we get better
and better at doing it there are more
situations where we can find to use this
my my favorite story as I was reading
about image classification was this
farmer in Japan mainly because I live in
Japan right now but his family was a
farming family and they sold cucumbers
and I don't know if you know about food
in Japan but there are very weird
particular things that they identify and
say like ah this isn't a regular
cucumber this is a premium cucumber and
we're gonna charge you $30 for this
cream
cucumber and all of that kind of
classification was done by hand and so
an engineer who wasn't really a
programmer but could basically build the
hardware around this used image training
to have it identify like ah this
cucumber is this category and this one
and this one and automatically sorted
his cucumbers and kind of made that
process a lot better there's an article
online you can read about that
particular problem but the point is that
image classification can be used in any
number of industries for any number of
reasons and I think as we move forward
as developers it's going to become more
and more commonplace to want to be able
to do things like this so I think I'm
