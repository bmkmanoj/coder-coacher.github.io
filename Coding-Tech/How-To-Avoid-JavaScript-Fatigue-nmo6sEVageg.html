when you're getting into trying to
figure out what to pay attention to in
the JavaScript ecosystem but development
in general and the best thing you can do
is kind of practice these critical
thinking skills and find some tools to
help you separate signal from noise what
are the most important tools that I can
use to do my job what are the tools that
are just coming across the radar because
there's literally like a thousand places
you can go to find the hottest and
latest libraries that may or may not
solve your problem but they're all there
and you're like holy how do I like
sift out the stuff I actually need right
now um the first thing I always do is
like I subscribe to all the newsletters
so I get j/s weekly and know'd weekly
and there's a react weekly now and then
there's echo jeaious is like kind of
like hacker news except it's not hacker
news I've blocked hack hacker news in my
Etsy host file because like it's not
worth it
but it's basically hacker news but just
for JavaScript developers so there's a
lot of headlines going on over there
there's like a subreddit district
JavaScript there's a ton of places to
get the information the trick is to not
click on any of them it's just to read
the headlines so the the effect of that
is that you get a sense you kind of keep
your finger on the pulse instead of
drowning in a sea of information you
don't actually need so you can see like
if you go look through the last three
months of J's weekly newsletters you can
probably make a word cloud and see that
react pops up a whole lot more than
angular does and if you look at the
results from that state of Jess survey
it seems to be that people are moving
away from angular and toward react you
can say the same thing about like
backbone and all that stuff the things
that people were using but a foot down
in favor of other tools so if you're
interested in picking a tool for a new
project that's a great way to keep track
of what's popular right now what are the
tools that are going to be the easiest
to find help with because of those
people are interested in using them
right now
another critical thinking skills
learning when to stop reading if you do
click on an article which is still
important sometimes if you if your brain
says I think I get it or I don't think I
need this right now those are
two good clues - maybe just put the
article down maybe a bookmark it and
come back to it later
I booked mark a lot of stuff and put it
in Evernote just because it's all
searchable but a lot of times I'll skim
an article and say that's really great
but I don't need to know how like you
know promise that all works right now so
I'm just gonna go put it in Evernote and
when I need it I can just do a search
for promised at all and I'll find that
page again the Evernote Web Clipper
cosin you can clip entire web pages and
save it to Evernote and search them
which is really cool this is another one
that's been really useful for me this is
just a list of experts that I
particularly enjoy but they're people
who tend to talk more about being a good
developer or they're people who do the
work of separating signal from noise and
helping you think critically and say
these are the important things that we
see as trends because a lot of these
people are software architects or
authors who spend a lot of time working
in the tech community or like addy
Osmani he actually works at Google as a
developer advocate and so his whole job
is to basically know the ecosystem so
lean on them follow them on Twitter or
like a lot of them have their own
newsletters use those as a place to find
the thoughtfulness that is not found
just in lists of links of new tools to
check out another good thing to help you
with finding separating signal from
noise especially for the more like if
you're new in your career it's really
important to have a mentor for other
reasons but especially just have someone
that you can bounce ideas off of you say
hey I'm starting a new web app what do
you think about using jQuery UI pulling
something from like five years ago they
would probably say that they'd probably
like well you can it depends on like
your needs if you're just like trying to
do something really simple that's
perfectly fine if you have like a ton of
business logic maybe pick something
that's a little more robust like react
or angular or a backbone and finding
people who have the experience to give
you good advice like that is essential
another really important critical
thinking skill is called chunking this
is a tool I pulled from
course there of course that took this
past year called learning how to learn
it's really about figuring out the best
way is not to just memorize that it but
to actually take the important concepts
out of the things that are coming across
your radar and categorizing them so the
whole idea is to basically take
collections of concepts and group them
into ideas so I can say you know like
like it's easier to say oh angular and
view jeaious both use the concept of
two-way data-binding
I'd rather care more about that's the
problem that they solve two-way
data-binding then to know like the ins
and outs of angular or view when it's
time that I'm I clean I have a problem
in front of me and having two-way
data-binding would be a really useful
way to solve that problem then I go
maybe I should go look at angularjs or a
view
I don't know angular or view I just know
what they are because I use critical
thinking skills like this to help this
is a really good way to think about it
the English language has 25,000 verbs in
the dictionary and 12 different verb
tenses you can either memorize 30 300
thousand words and how to use them in
all the different tenses or you can just
memorize the twenty five thousand verbs
and probably not even that many and the
rules of conjugation I would much rather
know the underlying rule for why
something works then to know the ins and
outs of every single little tool to to
do a job because like memorizing stuff
really rarely gives you the depth of
knowledge to be able to go home and rest
at night so you know like I yeah
that's all sorry about that learning the
fundamentals this is just it's really
kind of goes along with the idea of
chunking it's that understanding the
core programming concepts behind an idea
help you to find those patterns so when
I say that like I see something uses
two-way data-binding I can say oh that's
just a concept from the idea of reactive
programming because I read a few
articles about reactive programming a
couple years ago and I see that this is
a pattern
pretty common in front-end development
or I see like backbone it's like oh well
that's just like a pretty
straightforward MVC like that is
probably one of the most common patterns
that we all already know but digging a
little bit deeper and finding the tools
and patterns that have persisted across
literally generations of developers most
of the tools like MVC is a tool from
like the 70s I believe maybe I'm wrong
on that but I'm not historian but it's
been around for a very long time and so
being able to understand that people are
reusing these fundamental ideas to solve
certain problems is really helpful
here's a list of JavaScript code
patterns that I pulled from addy osmani
z-- book learning JavaScript design
patterns which is an awesome read it's a
few years out of date I would probably
add flux to this but other than that
flux is a big deal because it kind of
shook a lot of that up it's like a
different pattern but even that the
whole idea of react and flux came from
computer game programming that like an
idea that's been used for decades in
computer game programming because they
needed optimized ways to only rerender
the things that change and then from
there you you maintain your state
somewhere else and that's where flux
came from but all of these core design
patterns are things that are reused over
and over and over again a module is just
it's what ties together commonjs
es6 modules require J's slash AMD all of
these different things that are kind of
come and go you can say well oh it's a
module system okay well I know what
modules are that's all I need to know
about that for right now until it's time
to get into the nuts and bolts of
something observers and mediators that's
a lot of it's just like what does
pub/sub that's a like another name for
like a similar idea to those things it's
really just understanding that there's a
core pattern there that that you can use
to really make sense of it because a lot
of libraries expose like event based
publishing and subscribing to feeds of
data yeah so that's just a really useful
way to help when you recognize these
patterns you start to understand that
you don't need to know the ins and outs
of everything in every single library
because they're all stealing stuff from
each other functional programming is
something that comes up a lot a lot of
the ideas here are used a lot if you use
lodash the docs and the code itself are
actually really really informative it's
basically two set of utilities for
combining small functions together to do
bigger things but a lot of the core
concepts from functional programming are
things that tend to persist especially
in the JavaScript world maybe less so in
other languages but especially in
JavaScript you tend to see a lot of
those things come out because javascript
is built on a somewhat functional
philosophy so when you talk about
reducers you could just be talking about
map filter and reduce the functions that
are actually in like core JavaScript or
you could be talking about Redux which
uses the concept of reducers really
heavily to do the exact same thing but
on a larger scale yeah so I mean and I
could just go through here so like
immutability is another thing that Redux
uses pure functions is another thing
that relaxes I'm just using that as an
example but it does all these things and
it's not they're just not coming out of
thin air it's like these seven or eight
core ideas that are used across a ton of
different libraries but Redux packages
them up and puts a brand on it and a lot
of people think holy crap I gotta like
go learn this whole thing but when you
look at it it's really just a
composition of these really cool ideas a
really important thing to keep in mind
with all of that is focusing on the
value you're trying to create by writing
code most of us write code to solve a
business problem and usually it's
important to solve the problem quickly
and in a way that is has some integrity
so that like you know the code is going
to continue to function what are the
tools that are going to help solve that
problem what are the tools that what are
other tools like that like I was
comparing view and angular before like
those are two ways to solve a pretty
similar
problem react is another one you know
it's like in a node world you could say
well happy and express our two options
that solve pretty much the same problem
because they are just node web servers
so you're saying I have node I need to
be able to serve some endpoints well now
I know I can pick happier Express and
not have to worry about like these tons
of other different things like Seneca
isn't like a tool for web services and
all these things that you're like holy
crap there's this whole world of like
ways to spin up a web service but I
really just need to serve up an HTTP
endpoint these things solve those
problems I don't need to over engineer
something yeah really just using that
critical thinking skill of asking
whether or not something solves your
problem is I think the thing that people
overlook often too often because they're
wanting to use new hotness instead of
the thing that actually works like a
seasoned developer would say that like
if you have a static webpage and you
need to be able to show a modal pop-up
if someone was like oh well you know
what you're gonna need react because you
know that's what everybody's really
using and then like you need a modal so
you should probably get like a modal
library that works with react on top of
that and then redux because you need to
track some state here so you really
should just add that on to and don't
forget to use the fetch API because that
no one's using you know jQuery AJAX
anymore use fetch but then a seasoned
developers can be like wait you just
need one modal on one page well there's
like a hundred jQuery UI libraries that
libraries out there that do that just
drop it on the page and and style it to
make it work for you if you're
over-engineering you're the solution to
a problem you're just wasting your own
time and you could be doing way better
things with it this is probably the best
lesson I've learned in my entire career
is that it's okay to say I don't know we
get like hit with an onslaught of
information every day and people are
constantly trying to stay on top of the
game and understand everything that's
going on in the JavaScript community and
the developer community at large and
there's this constant sense that
everybody else knows a little bit more
than you expect
when you come to a conference you're
like oh my god like I don't know
anything about docker I don't know
anything about you know promises
whatever it is it's like well one that's
why we're here at a conference but it's
also okay to be like I just don't know
that thing and if you're honest with
yourself about it you don't have to
really stress out about it until you
need that thing and you know what I mean
like like it's just to be like okay I
don't know that thing that's okay like
if like there's like what like 100 and
that like hundreds of thousands of
packages in NPM right like there's no
way any one person could know all of
that stuff so don't try like you're just
gonna stress yourself out focus on the
few things you know we're going to solve
the problems that you have but and when
someone asks you know and I don't know
is more than a valid answer and on the
other side of it don't be a part of the
problem if you ask somebody if they know
something don't act surprised that's
just kind of being an asshole I mean
there's really no other way around it
like lance and I were talking about this
the other day at work it's just like
when you feign surprise that someone
doesn't know about the new thing in some
you know like oh my god you don't use
like a sink and a weight to solve your
like asynchronous function problems in
node you're not using like the latest
version of Babel it's like all you're
doing is creating this bubble sort of
like a real estate bubble but it's like
a bubble on knowledge where you're like
inflating people's like sense of need to
know all these things that they don't
just they just don't need to know so
like people are supposed to specialize
the people who exceed in their careers
are the ones who find the things that
they're good at and specialize in them
it seems like overwhelming especially
when you're starting a career as I could
junior developer you've only been in it
for a couple years where you feel like
you have to know all this stuff and it's
more people treating you that you're
supposed to know all this stuff then you
not knowing it that's the problem so
when you have some experience treat
people with less experience and that
specific thing kindly because they
probably know a lot more about some
other thing that you need to know to
learning empathy this is the soft part
of my talk
who hears rather any books by Bernie
Brown I think you all should I would buy
one copy of at least one of her books
for every one of you if I could there's
this YouTube video that really boils
down a ton of her work it's like three
minutes long it's called burn a brown on
empathy it's on YouTube if you go watch
that it will make you a better person
almost instantly and pretty much every
single way but especially as a developer
because developers have a tendency to be
a little less empathic or at least less
likely to express their empathy
externally so being empathetic to the
situation's and the knowledge of the
people around you is absolutely key not
only for your own development but for
their development and for the health of
the teams that you work on and the
companies you work at recognizing needs
is another thing this book is another
one that I wish I could buy just copies
for everybody if anybody in here wants
to borrow mine I will gladly hand it out
Marshall Rosenberg sort of came up with
a framework for how to speak kindly to
people which is kind of a weird thing to
think about but as like as an engineer
having a framework for how to understand
how other people are feeling it was
actually really helpful it's basically a
book that sort of lays out this whole
plan for being able to one identify the
needs of the people around you to be
able to have a conversation where you
can help figure out what their needs are
and three being able to recognize your
own needs and being able to communicate
those in a way that people understand
what it is that you need from them but
also being okay when they can't give
that to you so it's sort of like a -
it's all about creating this two-way
conversation where you and the people
around you understand how to take care
of each other
here's a whole list of needs from the
book that these are core needs that
every single one of us in this room and
in the world need in order to survive as
a healthy and well developed adult
there's a whole list I'm not going to
read them off obviously but when all of
these needs are being satisfied we're
able to be the best version
of ourselves and we're able to help the
people around us to develop themselves
and to the best people they can be and
we can understand each other's strengths
and weaknesses it's a really really
really cool way to work because you're
able to sort of like Evan flow as a team
and you're able to be vulnerable with
each other and understand that some days
we have good days and bad days and you
know just taking care of each other
instead of just sort of being like
insensitive to the way people are
feeling at any given time so that's just
like hitting on the idea of not really
creating a worse problem than we already
have trying to keep up with everything
so to wrap up this is all about learning
to be a lazy programmer by using some
critical thinking skills to to not worry
about all of the you have to try to
figure out how to learn and just focus
on the things that actually matter to
the problem at hand and being able to
ask questions to the people around you
that you know are safe to ask questions
to and also being a person who is a safe
person to ask questions to but then also
taking care of yourself and
understanding that we are supposed to
have lives outside of work you shouldn't
be going home from work after eight
hours of coding and look at another four
hours of tutorials and yeah we all have
lives we all have hobbies we all have
things that make us the people that we
are and spending your whole time
learning some library that's going to
not be cool again in three years it's
not worth your time so like if if your
employer's not paying you for those
hours then but they're expecting you to
come back to work the next day with all
that knowledge then that's probably a
good sign that you need to have a
conversation with them or maybe find a
job somewhere else there's plenty of
jobs so I wouldn't be too stressed out
about that
once again I'm Josh that's really it
it's a quick and easy talk you can find
me at JavaScript fatigue dot Club I'll
be talking more about some of the stuff
I've only been blogging on there for
like a week like I said I just got the
set up but I'm gonna start sending out a
newsletter pretty shortly here where
I'll be talking more about some of the
soft skills and critical thinking skills
that we use to do our jobs as developers
so there's any questions you can come up
to me or you can yell them out or
whatever but that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
