third-generation blockchain technology
and that's kind of funny because money
people have just recently only been in
the space for a little while and we're
already in the third generation
apparently so that's gonna be fun so
I've been in the space for a long time
I've been in the space first as kind of
a lurker and a watcher
since Bitcoin was a dollar and back then
it was a very different environment we
would never fill a room like this I mean
you could be like come free money pizza
everything you wanted we'd get like six
people okay now this has been pretty
common and it's amazing to see the
growth of passion excitement but back in
the first generation back in the day
this was like 2009 to 2012 2013
basically we were just trying to solve a
very simple problem which was could you
create a form of decentralized money
that actually has value and nobody
controlled it doesn't have a central
party behind it tonight today it seems
like obvious right yeah we have that we
have Bitcoin but back then it was
actually a very controversial and
interesting question you'd mind
something but who would buy it where
would you trade it where would you sell
it I remember back when Vic point was $1
I'd be like I have all this Bitcoin in
my friends would be like yeah but what
can you do with it I said but you
understand one day I can do a lot with
it
and they're like oh you're crazy okay go
away so it was it was a heck of a lot of
fun but here's what happened it got
valuable so went from $1.00 in a very
short period of time up to about $250
during the Cyprus crisis and what that
meant was that people started taking it
seriously and when I started taking you
seriously what's the first thing that
happens people start commenting yes but
they want to do something to it they
want to build a business on it and they
start discovering that bitcoin wasn't
good enough so there was an invitation
for augmentation so we started seeing
lots of things like all coins we started
seeing overlay protocols a color coins
and master coin materialized so right
around that time period I said you know
what the heck do I have to lose I'll
just go into the pic coin space and do
something professionally have some fun
the problem was I didn't know anybody I
you know I knew of Bitcoin I had a forum
handle of Bitcoin talk and Bitcoin read
it I mean that's basically the extent of
my exposure so so here's what I'll do
all I
an academic I'll teach a class so I'll
create a free online course and release
it for Bitcoin yay and I'm a Peter
Sellers fan so I named it Bitcoin or how
I learned to stop worrying and love
crypto after dr. Strangelove right and
so put on a udemy put another Creative
Commons license I released it and I get
today I think I like 70,000 students
there's something like that I got 5,000
emails and I replied to every single one
of them and what I gain from that is I
got to meet everybody I met an oblivion
I'm in Andreas Antonopoulos so I met a
lot of venture capitalists it was just
an amazing experience and from that I
was able to leverage a career and build
some companies but the thing I'm known
for is the project of astray ssin that's
a theorem and that came a little bit
later so what happened was that there
was a convergence of forces so I had
worked on a project called bitshares
and I'd worked with many other people in
the space and we were all kind of in at
a rock at a heart place where every time
we build protocol we'd want to add
something to it but after you deploy a
cryptocurrency really hard to change it
that's kind of the point so how do you
upgrade after you've deployed what you
know it would be so nice if you had a
programming language or a scripting
language that let you do that
right around the same time vitalik
butyrin was working on color coins
master coin and he was just in
development hell he was having all of
this trouble trying to upgrade color
coins and master coin to do reasonable
things okay so he said wouldn't it be
nice if it was like the web when
javascript came to the web browser and
we just got a programming language and
now we have Gmail and Facebook and all
these other SAS products right so
wouldn't it be so cool if we had a
programming language for a blockchain
now this wasn't a completely new idea it
has its roots back in the nineteen eight
and 90s from Nick Szabo is called a
smart contract and actually circular
learner who's another pioneer in the
Bitcoin space who's underappreciated was
one of the first people to talk about
turing-complete
scripting contracts and now he's one of
the cofounders of the rootstock project
down in Buenos Aires so Vitalik wrote a
white paper and I got dragged into it
and boy we had a lot of fun along with a
lot of other people and we built
aetherium and that's the second
generation it's I want my transactions
to be
smart and I want my transactions to do
meaningful things okay
so it's not good enough to have money
it's not good enough to have a
decentralized database a blockchain
whatever the heck that means but you
also want the things that are happening
to be eventful stateful rich and
programmable so for example imagine if
you have a business logic we have a
Board of Directors and you have normally
three of five people are required to
sign for a transaction but on December
it goes down to two three because two of
those directors go on vacation that's
your business is custom logic I can't
predict that but with a smart contract
you can write that kind of a
relationship financially speaking and it
can be as arbitrarily complex or
arbitrarily simple as you want the point
was that you're in charge of that
transaction so this was a crazy idea we
took enormous criticism for it we had no
thought that it was ever gonna succeed
we release it now it's worth a hundred
billion dollars and everything's gone
mad right
yeah it's paper so here's what's
happened is that the world is kind of
caught up and they said decentralize
money that's a really good idea okay
check the box smart contracts we like
them there's a lot of cool things you
can do and now we're having questions of
how do we want to do them you know they
want to be turned complete
turing-complete
do we want to write special languages
for them do we want to write them in
normal programming languages that we're
going to run them on blockchain off
blockchain but the concept is okay check
do they work for billions of people know
crypto kitties killed us be killed by a
cat oh well at least we have a few more
lives so anyway they don't work at scale
the other problem is we have thousands
of them right if you go to coin market
cap you'll see all these kryptos all the
way down a few I built and guess what
they don't talk to each other a lot of
them are blind deaf and dumb so that's
not a good thing finally how do you
decide how to pay for things and to
govern things with crypto currencies so
let's say that you are genius
cryptographer and you're like yeah man
I'm gonna solve this quantum computer
crisis
I have X MSS it's the best signature
scheme ever and he's also a genius
cryptographer he's like nah man lattices
are like so much better we're gonna go
with bliss or dilithium or something
like that
okay these are two proposals and let's
say they're both great guys how do we
decide which one to go with who gets to
decide that do we just go to Bitcoin
talk
we gotta read it whoever has more
Twitter followers I mean like what is
the empirical meaningful systematic way
upon which we are going to govern these
open source not centralized not curated
protocols without an appeal to a cult of
personality or something along those
lines that's a challenging question and
we've already seen the fractures of
governance anybody here here the block
size debate yeah anybody here have any
Bitcoin cash anybody have any etherium
classic yeah there you go I'm just going
home now okay so anyway so anyway
basically we have governance crisis and
it's a very challenging one and it's one
that it creates a barrier to consumer
and enterprise adoption because you as
an executive can't go to your boss and
say hey CEO I think we should use this
blockchain for this thing it's like yeah
but we have no idea how it's gonna
change who's gonna change it when it's
gonna change and what it's going to do
and we have no say in the matter it's
like yeah that's a good idea I should
build a billion dollar product on that I
mean think about that it's not a really
good a meaningful conversation you know
the other thing is how do you pay for
stuff so we have the ICO anybody hear of
an IC oh yeah right SCC is not in here I
think right okay good so what is the ICO
well you know we inadvertently created a
Rube Goldberg machine with aetherium for
venture capital which really makes
Mike's life difficult alright if you're
like wait why do I have to give you
equity I can just issue a token and
raise ten million or something like but
that's that's temporary
don't worry well you guys will be okay
but basically you just issue a token
like any RC 20 token you go to a crowd
sale whatever that means and you raise a
bunch of money and now you have much
money and you can go spend it and it's a
donation so no strings attached but no
levity aside the icos are great and
they're becoming regulated there's lots
of ideas from
marv Allard a blockhouse and others
project Brooklyn from consensus about
how to do these things how to govern the
funds that are collected the checks and
balances and controls that ought to be
put together so that's wonderful but
it's an injection of capital and like an
IPO these are injections of capital that
you can't do consistently and repeatedly
right so what how do you pay for things
long-term and how do you pay for things
without having a big pool of money
laying around that somebody's going to
control okay so we have that problem
again so we have a sustainability
problem as well so we have a scalability
problem we have billions of users that
are coming in and we don't know how to
handle them in crypto kitty's is killing
us we have an interoperability problem
in the ecosystem where we have thousands
of crypto currencies and they're all
just not talking to each other well and
we have a sustainability problem where
basically you can't figure out I pay for
things without these damn icos and also
it's hard to figure out where to go so
whenever you have problems that are
indicative of your size scope and scale
whenever you have problems that occur as
a consequence of success that's a good
symptom that you have a new generation
coming just like in the old days where
when we went from first generation the
second generation we were saying gosh
everybody's trying to get smarter
transactions everybody's trying to do
more but every time we try to do it it's
painful now we're in the same situation
where I want to do all this cool stuff
but I want to do it on a global scale I
want to do it with traditional systems
and other people's systems and I also
want to build a community with having to
hold a billion dollars of their money
and trying to play venture capitalists
that's a big challenge and that is
basically an invitation for the third
generation of cryptocurrencies it's an
invitation for new classes of
technologies so congratulations you've
lived through two generations already
isn't that cool
you all have should have like white
beers and be like vint cerf and be like
wow back in my day we screwed up so bad
right okay so what is AI ohk what is
cart dah no and what are the other third
generations
so after aetherium I kind of had the
luxury of being able to start a kind of
company that I want
to start so I'm kind of an academic I
studied mathematics I like analytic
number theory and so I said you know
there's a deficit in our space with
respect to rigor there's both a
peer-review and academic deficit and
there is an engineering deficit so on
the peer-review side we have a lot of
people writing papers and those papers
are not really rigorously checked by
people who should be reading them and
these papers are playing with not simple
things they're playing with cryptography
with programming language theory they're
playing with game theory they're playing
with all kinds of things that people
spend a lifetime studying and rigorously
reviewing and having to go to great
schools like Harvard and MIT and Boston
University and cu-boulder to write
that's for last go Ralphy
but anyway they have to go to these
great schools to learn how to do these
things and then they have to go submit
their papers to a conference for the
computer science side or a journal for
other Sciences and guess what happens
you get your paper rejected or if it
gets accepted it's like conditionally
accepted and they yell at you and then
you have to go and show the paper off
and then they yell at you and it's like
a very masochistic process I there's
must be a special kind of crazy that
goes into these fields but the end
result is that you actually have some
degree of assurance that the paper may
be right but the claims may be
reasonable that the things we're trying
to do may be accomplishable and that
they've been checked by people who've
spent their lives thinking about this
stuff so I said to myself it'd be so
cool if I started a company that did
that but that alone is kind of not a
business model it's kind of a lost
leader spend money but there's like not
money coming from the other side so I
said you know I need to need to do
something so why don't we build crypto
currencies for living that would be a
heck of a lot of fun so I said okay but
if we're gonna build them we're gonna
build them like a mathematician would
build them so we're gonna build them in
Haskell and we're gonna fill them with
formal methods so what the bloody hell
is Haskell or what is functional
programming well basically it's just a
different way of writing code that
brings you closer to math it's a
different way of writing code that
allows you to use all kinds of new tools
to test and check what you're doing to
make sure corresponds with reality
new it's been around for a long time the
problem is it's a little harder to write
Haskell code it's a parter to test it a
little harder to find developers so it's
not quite as popular as Java JavaScript
but the other thing that Haskell can do
that's really magical with Haskell also
is really easy to work with formal
verification tools so what the heck is
formal verification why should we care
okay so you have a paper okay I don't
have another problem actually I do have
the stand okay and so you have your code
code lives here so your paper lives in
like the billikin land Billiken is like
a Japanese spirit if the god of way
things ought to be
not the way that things are okay so this
is an ideal it has ideal functionality
all these cool properties and features
and this lives in the academics mind now
let's assume the paper is right then at
some point an engineer comes along says
I'm going to implement that paper cool
it goes over here and writes much code
and there's this gap that's called a
semantic gap and basically there's going
to be a difference between what the
academic did and what the engineer did
there's a thousand assumptions there's a
thousand ideal functionalities that had
to be turned into real functionalities
for the sake of practicality for example
you can't instantaneously transport a
blockchain to everybody right right at
the beginning of that launch the network
doesn't happen but you can assume that
to make a proof work so there's this gap
right here and if you're not careful the
thing you end up building here isn't the
thing that you wrote here so all the
promises security guarantees and things
that you'd care about are actually not
ported over here so what formal methods
to do is they say we're going to do
something about this gap we're going to
write a specification that allows us to
close it up a little bit and it's going
to extract all the ambiguity and be
machine understandable but it's not a
full implementation then what you can do
is use what's called a proof of by
simulation here to here and actually
show that every output here is the same
as that specification so in other words
it has no bugs and as long as the paper
is okay the implementations okay you're
like what but Charles that sounds great
why doesn't all software do that it is
horrendously time-consuming and
expensive
and the French are involved with it who
would want to be with these guys I'm
serious they screwed us man they're the
most popular formal programming methods
language is called coq coq I kid you not
so so this is what we deal with so out
of principle we use Isabel which is
slightly less popular but you didn't
want to say every day and at levity
aside it takes a lot of time for example
let's think of things you'd like to be
verified how many people here of
operating systems well you do you have
phones and computers right so the kernel
of an operating system would be really
nice to know that that's properly built
because you know you kind of rely on
that every single day for every single
thing you do in the digital world so
somebody did that it's called the SEL
for microkernel project and it took over
five years
millions of dollars a hundred and eighty
thousand lines of isabel code to produce
seven thousand lines it generated see it
had some nice properties it's not easy
so I said you know I want to build an
engineering company because I'm kind of
a crazy entrepreneur not only do I want
to do the paper stuff right and go
through peer review but I also want to
do this but I want to do it quickly it's
kind of a crazy idea so that was the
dream of ayah which K get the
engineering right to functional first in
formal methods and get the academia
right started in 2015 there was just two
people my co-founder and I and now we're
a hundred we operate in ten countries
got nine figures of revenue we have a
lot of projects we work on the largest
of which is Cardinal and we're building
Cardinal with this type of approach so
what is Cardno and why is it a
third-generation cryptocurrency and why
do we think it's fun and interesting
okay so as I mentioned before there are
three characteristics scalability
interoperability and sustainability that
justify the third generation okay so in
terms of scalability our belief is the
best way to achieve that is as you gain
users you gain resources pretty simple
good idea should be simple so we can
think of any other protocol that has
this property anybody have any ideas yes
sir
iota
maybe BitTorrent well that's the one I
was going for it's more classical less
controversial
okay so BitTorrent what is bit torn
about so first off it has over 250
million concurrent active users that's a
lot and it carries about 1/3 of the
Internet's traffic the only way you
could have a protocol like that run
consistently for more than 15 years is
if you have a property that when someone
enters the protocol the protocol gains
resources it gains capabilities so that
you actually get faster or stay at the
same performance despite the fact that
you're gaining hundreds of thousands
millions billions of users that's a
basic characteristic of scalability now
BitTorrent quite simplistic it's just
moving data around so crypto currencies
are a bit more complicated nuanced
because you have more than just moving
raw data around you have transaction
processing capability and this is where
things like hash graph and iota are
trying to make innovations you have
things like data storage okay
so where do you put all the information
who stores the blockchain is it shard it
or not are you trusting somebody to hold
it and there's the actual data itself
that you have to port and move around
think about the consequences of having a
system that runs at a million
transactions per second how much
bandwidth would be required for a node
to process that it's not cheap it's not
small and it's not coming from Grandma's
Wi-Fi so our current models that we have
for replicated networks for generation
to generation one cryptocurrencies exist
in a world that everybody has a full
copy of the blockchain that everybody
has a reliable stable internet
connection and can keep up with the
network these are assumptions that will
become untrue because we become victims
of our own success so chief real
scalability you need a protocol that
gains transaction processing power you
need a protocol the game's network
resources you need a protocol that gives
you more data storage as you gain more
users so that's the first property that
we try to resolve with Cardinal now the
problem is that this is a horrendously
complex task a lot of people can claim
that they've solved it or they know
exactly how to do
what it is but it requires lots of
protocols it requires you to design
Network protocols it requires you to
sharp large datasets it requires you to
implement new authenticated data
structures it requires you to put a new
cryptography this is a challenge and no
one solution can actually do all these
things together and also let's say you
think you haven't how do you know you
have it you need peer review you need
some bedrock to sit on so in 2015 when
we first started working on this project
the very first question we asked is what
is bedrock for a cryptocurrency it turns
out not until 2015 was there even an
answer for what is bedrock we didn't
know what a ledger is we had an idea of
a blockchain like an append-only link
list there's been some ideas of directed
acyclic graphs these types of things
like Spectre for example okay and yet we
didn't actually know what properties
they should have or how to write a
security proof so guess what we had to
do our chief scientists had to write a
paper on it
it's called gkl 15 where we define this
is a secure ledger this is the standard
upon which we ought to be judged great
so the first question you ask is Bitcoin
a secure ledger and actually in the
paper they prove that Nakamoto consensus
forms a secure ledger so congratulations
Satoshi did something really magical if
it's Craig kudos because guess what he
here is tickly designed a protocol that
actually turned out to have all the
security properties you'd want to have
without providing any security proofs
that did it years before anybody
bothered to clean it up that almost
never happens so bitcoin is pretty
magical and there's a reason why it's so
loved so proof-of-work solved that
problem great the next question is what
other types of protocols that are much
more scalable have these properties so
we'd like to use proof of stake there's
a lot of good conversation around it
there's a lot of good science around it
that's floating about but does it have
an equivalent level of security as proof
of work this is a horrendously
controversial statement amongst the
Bitcoin people they say of course not
but we're academics so we said let's use
this foundation we've generated that
we've proven that proof of work is
herewith and then let's go ahead and see
if proof of steak has the same
properties and surprisingly the answer
is yes turns out that given certain
assumptions proof of steak can have an
equivalent level of security as proof of
work that to me said we're in business
now the question is how do we make it
practical
so what protocols do we have to marry it
with so that we gain that scalability
property and what protocols we have to
marry it with so that it becomes a
sustainable system and so in 2016 we
wrote up our proof of steak protocol
called aura borÃ¥s we had to go through
six revisions we first submitted it to
Oakland got rejected
that's a tough conference to get into so
we went to one better called crypto we
dusted ourselves off we got into that
conference in Santa Barbara we had to go
hang out with Adi Shamir and Whitlock
tiffy and the rest of the old guys and
some of the new guys and get yelled at
which is our favorite thing to do in the
whole wide world and then after that we
said you know we're not done we have
like six more papers to publish because
this is hard stuff one of which we
presented this morning and we wrote
another paper called orb or Sprouse
that's making our protocol more
practical and we have more papers on the
way but every single one of them is
making that heart beat that consensus
algorithm of our system a bit more
resilient a bit more robust a bit faster
and eventually it will gain resources as
people join the network now that alone
is not enough we need a network protocol
we've chosen Rena
by the way kudos to Boston part of Rina
was developed here at Boston University
so whoo any be you've rats
okay so there's guy named John day he
helped create the Internet along with a
lot of other people and John is the guy
create a recursive Internet work
architecture wrote a lovely book about
it
and he was one of many who looked at it
but looked at networking as a
distributed computing problem it's
complicated involved so I won't go into
it tonight but it's a new type of
protocol it's a little different from
normal Network protocols and the power
and advantage of it is you gain much
more granular control over how you build
these large-scale distributed networks
so you can model them so that you don't
have to download everything and you can
still use them safely now if we just did
those two things alone we'd have built a
pretty good cryptocurrency and it you
know it'll be worth some money and
trading but remember what I was saying
is that you have to be interoperable and
also sustainable
plus it would be nice if we had good
smart contracts and stuff like that
right this is just generation 1 stuff
we're just trying to make generation 1
faster okay so how are we doing smart
contracts now here's the problem we
screwed up with aetherium sorry first
off the virtual machine wasn't really
well designed and it was not well
designed because we didn't put enough
time into it enough people into it we
didn't have enough resources to really
carefully think about what are we doing
the languages that we wrote like
solidity anybody here a solidity
developer okay is that your favorite
thing in the whole world you just like
wake up every day be like man that
solidity is like Zen right no no one has
ever said that about solidity I meet
these closure developers and they're
like hanging out painting the Bob Ross
like loving life everything's great
and you made a solidity develop you're
like in a basement with whiskey doing
cold shot saying why won't this work
okay so that's an indication we kind of
screwed up on language design so
aetherium has a bit of problems the
theorem itself acknowledges it and
they're fixing them they're creating new
languages like Viper and bamboo they're
cleaning up the virtual machine and
these types of things you're even
thinking about pivoting to web assembly
so evolution is on the way and things
will get better in an ecosystem but the
first thing we do because we're
academics as we say well what should the
machine look like so let's study what we
did so we worked with a team for called
runtime verification they're based in
University Illinois urbana-champaign
huge campus little city wonderful place
grigory row shoe and his team wrote the
first set of formal semantics using
something called the K framework where
they actually modeled the operational
semantics of the etherium virtual
machine huzzah the hell does that mean
it means that we very carefully read the
documentation and the papers and
translated it into a formal language
that's machine executable in other words
we actually made the computer understand
what we wanted to do as opposed to what
we actually did in code okay what does
that mean it means that now you can
actually rigorously look at the system
and say what did we do well what didn't
we do well and what needs to be
completely thrown away oh god what were
you thinking that kind of a thing the
good the bad and the ugly of systems
design so the Gauri's team took
kay EVM which they published last year
he updated it upgraded and created a new
register based assembly virtual machine
called yella named after a Romanian
fairy you can you can guess where
Grigory is from so anyway great machine
we have a semantics for that and we
think that this is a much better
foundation because it looks a lot like
LLVM developers are a bit more familiar
with that it's easier to build compilers
for that it's a much better studied then
the current foundations that we have but
the problem is we also need to be able
to write smart contracts in the
languages that you want to write them in
not the language that Charles Hoskinson
wants to write them in right so we said
wouldn't it be so cool if we had some
sort of framework where all we have to
do is just define a language and then
suddenly the framework itself would like
build a compiler for you and then you
could just write your smart contracts in
it you don't have to do anything if I
ever update the virtual machine I just
do it once all the compilers know to
build it all but Charles if only well it
turns out that we may be able to do this
and we think we can there's this thing
called semantic space compilation and
there's a thing called the K framework
and what you do is you write the
semantics of a language and K takes care
of all of that translate your language
into another language so we have K
semantics for Java for C for JavaScript
for solidity for Plutus which is our own
in-house language and Viper and we'll
just keep writing him we'll just keep
making the framework better the longer
the shorter it is that if we pull this
off you'll just write your code in the
language you want click a button
compiles runs on our framework and you
don't have to worry about it or build
your own compiler or these types of
things that's pretty cool and it's
actually a big innovation in computer
science and we're pretty excited about
where we can take it have a very large
team led by run time verification that's
working on that we think that's fun okay
so we're pretty comfortable with the
smart contracts side of things we're
pretty comfortable with how this stuff
is evolving we love the fact that we're
introducing lots of great formal methods
we even have conversations about like
proof carrying code and actually we've
even specified the first formalized DRC
20 token spec this type of stuff that
would be a cool
but what we've just done is built a
better aetherium and I didn't sign up
for that I signed up for the build a
third generation cryptocurrency
so briefly there's two less things I'll
mention about Cardinal and then we'll
take some questions because I know you
guys are probably dying for them
first is interoperability so what is
interoperability really all about what
are we really trying to solve there
there actually it's amazing him there's
two things right there's actually two
things to worry about with
interoperability what is the legacy guys
the chases of the world and Wells
Fargo's of the world the bank's
exchanges traditional regulated
financial actors to are the crypto
currencies of the world okay so the
problem here is a problem of attribution
and metadata and standards and it's a
problem of consensus within a community
and we just have to accept what they
want to talk to them because they kind
of own their side of the system it's a
negotiation but this is a problem
resolved by committee and it's a problem
resolved through things like inter
ledger and what ripple is doing and
other such things okay and that'll come
when it comes I don't have any control
over it the problem with the
cryptocurrency world is actually a
cryptographic problem it's actually a
very easy to understand cryptographic
Rohm really hard problem to solve so the
problem here is if you're a Bitcoin and
there's litecoin over there if somebody
sends you a light coin transaction wants
to put some light point on your Bitcoin
blockchain you want to honor that you
have two questions you need to answer
first are the like coins real do they
exist do they come from somewhere second
have they been double spent or not these
are two foundational questions the proof
of existence in the non existence of a
double spend pretty simple right so how
do we do that well we trust the
consensus of the system we have a full
copy of the blockchain so wait a minute
if you have a thousand crypto currencies
how can we have a full copy of every
chant no you can't so wouldn't it be
super cool if you construct a proof a
very tiny proof in the kilobytes the
mega bytes for each cryptocurrency that
can act basically as a bridge between
you and the other currencies so that
when you get those transactions you can
verify that they exist and they haven't
been double spent we wrote a paper on
this it's called non interactive proofs
of proof of work and it's awesome we
love it we just recently pushed it out
and we're translating it to proof of
stake
or hope is to pull this into as many
proof-of-work cryptocurrencies as well
the carrot outside of interoperability
is the fact that you also get super
efficient lightweight clients because
the very same thing that allows you to
validate the transactions are legitimate
from external blockchains
allows you to trap vero date the
transactions or legitimate within your
own blockchain without possessing the
whole copy so it's pretty cool science
and it's gonna take some time and effort
but that's what we're doing there now
for the sustainability side comes down
to voting voting voting now we had
election recently if you guys didn't
didn't know did your favorite candidate
when mine didn't although I I work for
Ron Paul so I never gonna win at
anything guys right okay so the problem
with that election was less about the
candidates running it was more about the
voting system itself and the fact that
we were given poor choices by the time
we had the right to vote so it's not
just being able to vote that matters
it's what you get to vote on when you
get the vote your incentives to vote how
you vote who gets to be on the ballot
these types of things that are much much
more meaningful and it's been studied by
cryptographers and political scientists
and other academics for a long time but
come up with all these cool names like
condors say voting systems and boorda
voting systems and so forth and the
theory is quite interesting so we have
to take a position and we think the best
of the worst is liquid democracy it
actually has a lot of really cool
interesting properties we get to do
things like additive homomorphic
encryption god help us but at the end of
the day what this is all about is being
able to just delegate your vote to other
people for each situation whether it be
funding for a ballot or it be voting on
a change the underlying protocol and
this is a matter of setting thresholds
and assigning incentives closely so like
all good academics we did a literature
review so we started with - bitshares
and other systems that have been
released in the past that had some
notion of voting or Treasury and we
extracted from them the good the bad and
the ugly similar to how we extracted
from the etherion virtual machine the
good the bad and the ugly and we wrote a
paper put it on our website then we put
a whole team of academics together at
Lancaster
universitÃ© wonderful place in the UK led
by benching and we're now actually
writing papers on how to build a voting
system and how to build a Treasury that
we can abstract away from a blockchain
and then put in as a reference model for
any blockchain that wants to adopt it
similar to our interoperability work so
our hope is that eventually this can do
what Tasos is trying to accomplish which
is saying that you can mutate or change
the chain you can fund things these
types of things but it can do it in a
way with it has some good cryptographic
guarantees and some fine game theoretic
properties that your voting will result
in good outcomes as prior elections have
shown getting an election system right
is super hard and in itself it's worth a
generation but in my view it's the only
way that we can actually succeed or do
anything interesting in the long term
because at the end of the day these
systems need management they're getting
too big
the money's getting too big the risk of
their failures getting too big if we
can't find a way to govern ourselves the
governments are gonna just govern us for
us and then we've lost so that's what
Cardno is in a nutshell we have some
ideas about scalability that starts with
the Ouroboros agenda the conceptual idea
is just increased resources as you get
people we have some ideas about
interoperability and that's just all
about saying let's do some sidechain
stuff and some magic there and for the
legacy stuff let's join the right
committees and just adopt the standards
and then we have some ideas about
sustainability that stems from let's
build a good voting system and let's go
ahead and build a great Treasury and a
great way to change the cryptocurrency
all of our work is open source all of
our research we try to make peer
reviewed and we try to collaborate with
as many people as possible I which he
has three research centers one at
University of Edinburgh one at Tokyo
Tech so that does mean I get to go to
Japan a lot and one at University of
Athens we're also setting some up here
in the United States and we'll be
announcing that soon hopefully and we
work with lots of different academics
from researchers and open source
developers and it's been a heck of a lot
of fun learning how to build this type
of a project now I mentioned there are
some other competitors and you know I'll
mention them you have guys like iodine
AOS
and they're in the scaleability bucket
they're really trying to push that we
can do millions of transactions per
second and these things can handle the
load there are people who are in the
governance bucket for like the dashes
and the tase osis of the world so we're
really emphasizing that element of the
system and then you have people like
ripple and Avion who are living a lot in
the interoperability side of the
spectrum so that's okay that that's
their vision and they're all executing
and they have money and people and we
love reading their papers and we love
seeing where they're going for Cardno we
try to be a little bit like the capybara
try to be like the Zen master of the
animal kingdom we try to be in the
center where we do a little bit of each
and provide that to people so thank you
so much for coming I hope this was a
little educating and I'd love to get
your questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
