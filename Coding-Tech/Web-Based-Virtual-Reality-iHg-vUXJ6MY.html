before I begin anything I just want to
ask some two questions how many of you
here are web developers awesome and how
many of you have had their hands on
developing for virtual reality
experiences that's less cool so the aim
of this session is primarily to make the
count of these two groups straws we
equal little about me as she already
said I'm a tech speaker from Mozilla and
professionally I work as a software
developer at HSBC and I've been
contributing for quite some time and a
frame is something I've been working for
for a year and it's interesting now
what's your reality a by definition if
we go it's basically the computer
generated simulation of a 3d image or an
environment and which can be interacted
with in a seemingly real or a physical
manner it's basically a technology that
transports you to completely different
interactive and 3d environment and you
can already see how cool things people
are doing in the background it's it's
going to be the next platform it's going
to completely change how we live work
and play and it's relatively new we are
still in the first generation of
headsets we have some like the Google
cardboard on the first one it costs
around $5 and it's it gives a basic very
basic VR experience a 360-degree very
low SDS and field of view and not such
not a very good experience but good
enough for a beginner to get started and
then there are high-end VR headsets like
the HTC vive at the end it has two
controllers it has base stations and you
can go around it it has complete room
scale tracking both positional and
rotational tracking great field of view
but the thing is that you have to
connect it to a PC with a very high
processing power and for every for me
like in India they don't really have HTC
vibes
so we've too many import it from the US
and then the
charges very expensive we pay almost a
double and then assembling such a PC is
probably more and then so basically we
were discussing day before yesterday we
are is not yet for the common man but it
is soon going to be so but that said
experience is provided by these headsets
are absolutely mesmerizing and these are
the kinds of headset that the we our
industry is focusing on is targeting but
the problem for developers is that
there's a lot of friction in the VR
ecosystem and what I mean by that is
that you have to go through there are a
lot of gatekeepers you cannot just build
something and share with the world like
hey I build this okay and check it out
you cannot do that because you have to
go through a lot of approvals for
example the oculus store it takes only
the top three top ones into the store
the rest are rejected so app stores and
corporations the control distribution
you can take down your content or block
it and even if you go through all these
procedures you will have to make other
people download your application and for
them it's a complete black box right
they don't know what's going on inside
and speaking of downloads you yourself
will have to download a lot of bulky
softwares and complex setups just for
the development so these things are huge
obstacles you probably have to learn a
new language and then you'll spend some
time fiddling around figuring out how to
make it work with multiple headsets we
want we are to be successful right so we
want these a platform without these
points of friction and the answer to
that is indeed where we are so where we
are is basically allows web developers
to create fantastic cross-platform
cross-device applications VR experiences
quoting from a talk in Google i/o VR
should be accessible to everyone because
it has the potential to let everyone
play explore and create an amazing new
ways so developers should be able to
build something quickly and share it
with everyone
no matter what device they are on kind
of how easy it is to share stuff on the
web but in VR and that is the very idea
behind where we are it's we are on the
web for everyone anyone can create
anything just like they create the
regular websites that is with vet
technologies and of course it has all
the properties of the web it's open
anyone can publish open source open
standards open culture it's connected
you can try at reverse worlds and scenes
and portals just like hyperlinks in the
2d web and it's instant of course you
just click a link and bam you're there
you can just share it with the world you
can tweet it like check out my what I've
built so more specifically these are
browser API is that enable WebGL
rendering to the headsets and access to
VR sensors it was initially by Mozilla
the web via our API then currently
there's a working w3c community a group
and Mozilla via Samsung Microsoft when
all these browsers have currently
implementing web VR 1.0 API so these are
the browsers that supported Firefox was
one of the first browsers to sip fully
support where we are
it started with nightly it's currently
in the release channels also after
Firefox 55 and there are these other
browsers mobile polyfill uses your
mobile device orientation sensors to
polyfill on smartphones so the concept
of meta worse from the science fiction
as we know it's the idea is basically
collective virtual persistent spaces and
where the world might live in they might
work and play in and to achieve it we we
need to have it decentralized it must be
open it must be connected you cannot
have one corporation controlling the
world people live in so how can we make
it more accessible because
as we saw yesterday in a talk 3gs is one
of the libraries used to create content
and where we are but it is still very
hard I mean the developers don't tell
you that but it is still very hard to
create experiences in 3GS you need to
import where we are polyfills set of
camera lies we are effect etc etc all
these so many things these are a huge
obstacle if you're just just I wanna
build something very basic I'm a new
beginner I just want to go and
experiment something but this is a huge
obstacle for me so I want a platform
which in which I can just concentrate on
what I actually want to build these this
boilerplate code it probably needs
updating with the newer versions of 3GS
where we are and browser quirks what if
we could make it more accessible what if
we could encapsulate all of this into a
single line just one single line well
introducing a frame a frame is an open
source web framework for building
virtual reality experiences and it helps
developers web developers build VR
content without graphics knowledge and
it helps you prototype VR UX faster and
it's basically a quick kickstart to the
VR ecosystem the best part is that you
can create a lot of a-frame scenes
entirely in simple plain HTML now all of
us has probably studied HTML in high
school and even if we haven't how much
time does it take to learn HTML it's
couple of hours that's it doesn't it
sound super easy now so let's just see a
hello world example in a frame so by the
way just when using a frame you need to
include the script tag and that's it
there are no build steps as such and
remember how I told you about
encapsulating all the boilerplate code
in a single line this a scene tag is the
global object in a frame that does that
for you aiding encapsulate you it does
all of it like
render controls we are effect that we
are polyfill everything just magically
does that and you do not have to put any
extra effort on things you don't want to
do you can concentrate on the actual
business logic so let's start putting
stuff inside our scene so here have used
a box a cylinder a sphere a plane
respectively these are the primitives
provided by a frame just out of the box
respectively to build cylinders spheres
etc and components in a frame are like
CSS tags you can just add them like CSS
tags and sky is basically the sky the
world the surrounding wall in me a
360-degree image or color this is just a
very basic hello world application but
just look at this piece of code it is so
readable I mean hTML is arguably the
most accessible language in computing
and this is encapsulated so if you copy
paste this code somewhere else it will
work there are no states or variables as
such and of course for for very advanced
applications you probably have to write
some JavaScript for the logic or the
components but that's about it you have
the full power of the web and it is so
easy it's beginner friendly so with
those four lines of code we have this
scene created we can move around using a
headset and check it out there's a very
basic scene but we won't but what it
took was only four lines of code so
we're already one step closer to the
meta worse we talked about and this
scene by the way is an a-frame scene
embedded in my HTML slides and I can
just modify it and change it using the
Dom inspector and now since it's based
on HTML it works with all your existing
and favorite libraries and frameworks so
you have d3 view react Redux all of it
you name it you have it and this is a
really good reason of having HTML as an
intermediary layer
or WebGL three triggers and underneath
it's just a extensible declarative
framework for three TS
so a frame uses an entity component
system architecture this is an
architectural pattern famous in 3d and
game development those of you have
worked on unity must be aware of it it's
particularly famous in unity so the
concept is that everything it's
basically promoting the idea of
composition over inheritance in
hierarchical everything in a theme is is
an object which is inherently an entity
which is empty it does not have anything
of its own any appearance of its own but
you can plug in components to add
appearance behavior and functionality
now in the 2d web we layout elements
with fixed behavior in hierarchy but in
3d and VR things are absolutely
different it can be I mean the objects
can have infinite types and complexities
so there is a need of a unique I mean of
a different way of building up objects
and ECS provides that and it promotes
cleaner design by the Cape's
encapsulation the coupling reusability
removes all the problems associated with
long inheritance chains interwoven
functionality so for example this is an
entity you have an entity which is the
base of all the objects it does not have
anything of its own it's kind of like an
empty div tag in HTML if without the
components you can plug in components
which are modules or data containers to
add the appearance behavior and
functionality so here we have the
geometry component which might have its
own properties like sphere or the radius
and the parameters we add the material
component so we can keep adding
components like plug and play to reuse
to mix and match and configure and build
up an entity it's like alchemy so for
example if you have
ball this is an entity it has a geometry
certain geometry and material sphere and
some leather probably and then you add
the light component so it becomes a
glowing ball then you add the sound
component becomes singing glowing ball
then you add explored component becomes
an exploding singing glowing ball the
point being that you can just keep
adding components on to an entity to
build up the entity and you can
construct any kind of object this is the
concept of composition so for while
coding what we do is for any entity we
use an a entity tag you can add the
geometry material like I specified
before and keep building up the entity
by continuously adding components you
can just keep adding components as much
as you want like a valid rotation
position on XYZ axis here so the these
are the components that ship in a frame
out of the box these are provided by
default but a frame has a huge community
and they've been building up a lot of
components and using the awesome stuff
and these are some advanced developers
who are helping empower other developers
we've built tons of components you have
everything these components can do
anything they have full access to the
JavaScript and the Dom API is and there
are these are like you just name it you
have it you you have all the kinds of
components ready-made built for you like
networked a screen is networked seen for
building multi-user applications you
have particle system you have oceans you
have sound you have audio visualizations
you have a lot of components ready-made
just built in just ready for use and
these are all curated in something known
as a registry now a registry is kind of
like a store an asset store a free asset
store where you can just go and search
for components install them for
installing them all you need to do is
drop the script
and that's like a very convenient
curated collection of a-frame components
for example if you have a leap hands
component now you can just drop the
script tag in your code and in the
actual program you can include it as we
can see here and you'll have two hands
and you can do whatever you want with
them now a frame also comes with a
visual inspector so it's a keyboard
shortcut whenever you press ctrl alt I
in any a-frame scene you can you get to
a completely different view a completely
different it takes you to a 3d grid
based system where you can pick up and
drop objects you can add components and
you can move around things you can
change values it's like a 3d analog we
are analog of the browser Dom inspector
that we have it's just that it has many
more features you can even copy the
changes made it made and you can paste
it into the actual code
so of course JavaScript you can
programmatically change components in
the scene using JavaScript we can do all
the little things like query selector
coil selector all for getting a
reference to the scene and it's entities
we have set attribute to modify the
entities we have a pen child to add the
modified entities onto the scene we can
probably create a random user random for
loop in JavaScript and add 50 a boxes on
random locations you have event
listeners too you can register handler
functions to perform a particular
something when a user performs a
particular action when a particular
email event is emitted and all these
little things you have basically all the
power of JavaScript available with you
all the power of web technology is
available with you and it is easy now
you can even add 3d models of course 3d
models basically come with plain text
files
and they have the textures animations
etc they also come along with images and
you can basically the three Jas loaders
parse these files and render them as
meshes in the scene and every model
components wrap around these three treys
loaders so this is um the 360-degree
image of Park gÃ¼ell and there is if you
can see a 3d model of a queen right
there in front of I can move it around
it can be animated also it's up to me I
mean and all I have to do to import this
into my scene was use the obj model
component because this is obj file and
material file I included it and I can
add components like scale position
rotation this is an entity I can add as
many components as I want and there I
have it
so speaking of multi user applications
I'll just give an example of how you can
use components to build multi user
applications now you might think that to
enable multiple users we have to know
all the concepts about servers and
complicated networking protocols
well this component the answer is of
course no not anymore the network Efram
component has you covered so all you
need to do is just include it in your
file and it it abstracts away all the
complex concepts that you might not be
aware of to begin with we have this
basic template we have a a scene a scene
that we already know about we don't have
anything inside it we have included the
script tags of the required files so if
we add the networked scene component
besides a scene so like in entities we
keep adding components this network a
scene component component we want for
the entire scene so we added besides a
scene this is just a basic template app
you can check out the syntax and the
documentation is a unique app ID unique
room ID and now we create enough
so basically what I've done here is
created a sphere using a sphere another
two spheres four eyes white color
another two spheres four black pupils
that's it that's all that is there in
this code now I want it to come out
track I mean the scene must be built but
it's all popping it at the same place so
I want to come I want to have it at
random locations
I want the akhtar to pop up in lanham
locations in different sessions in the
different clients so I just wrote simple
JavaScript to randomize the location the
position just five six lines and I can
include that component in my entity ID
equals two clear tag and I can keep
adding I have to add network ID equals
two templates something whatever
template I have built and I have to add
the component that I just wrote for
randomizing the location and that's it
so this is just to make a little more
prettier and to add up a little spice I
have a grid a black colored grid on the
ground and I have a colorful sky with
snow kind of stuff falling in so
basically the scene has been built but
this is just to modify the background in
the environment and if you check out
this URL right now we will have
something like this the gif you will
have multiple users if you open it right
now you probably can see other users
looking here and there and popping into
the scene so that was about the
multi-user applications so that was
super easy right we're oh Joey's just
wrote a few lines of code and we built a
very pretty cute application and as I
said a frame has a huge community it I
mean people have been working a lot
contributing to the code base as well as
the components a frame dot IO blog is
where
there are many things released like
there is something known as a week of a
frame every week there are featured
applications that are released I mean if
you can just build your application and
tweet it with a frame we are
they'll probably feature your
application in the week of a frame if
it's good now these are some examples of
the components of a frame applications
already built by some users a painter is
a clone of Google tilt shift tilt pane
that was built it was to show how
powerful a frame can be you can just
take two brushes and put on a headset
with controllers and paint around and
instead of building your own models in
blender or complicated software's like
that you can just paint your own stuff
and import it into your scene there's
something cool and journalism well this
is a journalism application this was
built to show the happenings in Syria
the bombings etc this was another Jonas
journalism application this is a sand
and this is a city builder a game built
by some one to show how we can use a
frame for games also you just need to
pick up and drop things which you want
to have in your city is a city filter
application this is my personal favorite
data visualization you can just have
multiple variables and columns you can
put it into the box and you can just
visualize it in 3d you can have data
visualization in 3d and it's really
beautiful and useful this is another
gaming application a blast you just use
your controllers to hit some mosquitoes
and it's a game prototyping is very
useful for prototyping of course you can
have your product in virtual reality you
can see it how it looks like and you can
build it and then you can maybe move on
to building the final product it's good
for Matt Matt it's it's also useful for
visualizing in 3d the graphs and
collating etc ER doc genius is a
framework that is being built currently
and it is very new and it's under
development which something very
interesting and allows you to develop AR
applications using a frame so using it
actually uses a our toolkit and lets you
build using a frame it's still in its
very initial stages but it's being
developed and making great progress it
is something good to check out its MA it
builds marker based AR applications and
they have been tools built on top of a
frame to enable you to without coding
you can build virtual reality
applications so where VR studio is one
of them real estate life tour this is
also an interesting application
education so for example if you if
there's a student studying for becoming
a doctor or medicines so you cannot
practice on a real human right but you
can do all this pick up a heart and do
all that to a man in virtual reality
it's just virtual reality right so
that's interesting for practice so a
frame has a lot of contributors and
stargazers on github
there are many lot many members on slack
if you check out a frame dot io /
community you get all the information
about how to get involved and it's
really interesting and it's still in its
initial stages stages so it's a very
good platform to contribute and to get
started with and there are lots of
featured projects as I talked about a
week of a frame and awesome a frame are
some repositories now there's a contest
going on currently 13 cage race games
that happens every year but this year
there's an a-frame category also so I
would probably recommend applying to it
all you have to do is just submit your
game
and it has to be 13 kilobytes of a file
excluding the a-frame library and just
for participating you probably get a a
frame special headset and t-shirts and
it's something really cool I would
recommend applying to it and other than
that I would recommend checking out the
documentation of a frame it's very
exhaustive it's really very informative
you can go and check out the syntax of
various primitives and components
available so yeah that's kind of about
how much I can talk about in 30 minutes
but you should definitely check the
documentation thank you and thanks for
having me a full stack fist thank you so
much I gusta that was really inspiring I
have a few questions here for you can
you talk more about the performance
concerns on web versus mobile okay so
you I think you mean native so I think
that's a very common question whenever
someone talks about the web the
performance of course undeniably native
applications have a little better
performance there is a little commerce
that you pay when you go for web
applications in terms of the graphics
performance but in exchange you get this
incredible power of distribution and
that is sometimes very much worth a
price paying for and other than that
there have been developments and so you
can use all the regular things that you
do with JavaScript like web assembly you
can have web web workers which can parse
things off the main thread and other
than that there have been developments
like streaming content so you get a
basic immersive experience in 300
milliseconds but that's not fully I mean
you can it gets more improved and as and
when it gets hardware and resources but
you have an experiment have to wait for
the download of the 3d models or
something so that's that's yeah that's
all I have to say thank you what are you
most excited about in terms of the
future of VR and web VR so my personal
interest and uh an area of research I
would like to see is into in the field
of education
so there are a lot of possibilities in
education like I showed how how we can
practice medicines in and in education
and I've also like I work for a bank so
I've been working on software for a bank
like when a person can go into a virtual
bank and check their account summary and
visualize the data that would be
something very cool so yeah that is
something we are in banking awesome
thank you so much like after let's give
her another round round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
