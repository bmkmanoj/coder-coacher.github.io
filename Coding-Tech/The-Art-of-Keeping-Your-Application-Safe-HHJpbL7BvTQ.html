to kick off this talk on security I'm
going to tell you a little bit about my
favorite vulnerable key so they'll
happen in 2008 and that was a really
good year for tech and web Google
released Chrome and everyone was very
excited about that a competitor for
Firefox so do I love Firefox HTML say
html5 was introduced and the first ever
an Android device was released it was
also very interesting year for the
security community because some people
discovered a way to embed a jar file an
executable jar file into a gif and that
caused quite a bit of a stir because no
one expected that an image would be able
to cause such a big vulnerability and
Java was quite a powerful language so
you can only imagine the extent of this
in 2012 people didn't completely abandon
the idea of using crazy things like
images to attack users so they went
ahead and discovered a way to embed
actual executable code not just archives
into images and they created something
called an image yes images attack and in
the example there I'm pretty much
embedding like a PHP script and to an
image and I'm taking advantage of the
fact that the browser knows that your
file is an image just by looking at the
hell're and then there's a bench
there's a bunch of like blob of just
like nothingness junk that the browser
ignores and then there's the actual
content that makes the image so in that
blob of junk you can pretty much put
anything there and this is the script
that says hey it's a lovely day isn't it
so let's see why that is bad well saying
I have an app that allows users to
create also and upload those sorts of
content for example images there's
nothing stopping an attacker from
uploading this image into a very nice
URL so it's just kittens skipping dot
jpg and then link it to well the same
URL except at the end of it instead of
jpg we have dot JPEG dot PHP so assuming
that that website is actually running
PHP when I click on the link well guess
what would happen
my scripted run and instead of being
able to download this cute kid a kitten
kitten image
you're just saying hey friend from IP
it's a lovely Monday afternoon isn't it
this was actually in my hotel yesterday
so that's why it's Monday and that's the
actual I peel the the hotel so if you
want to play with this how it works a
bit just don't get help with with all of
that what's particularly bad is if you
notice the URL it's actually running a
script that it shouldn't under a website
that well it should do something else
right and that's bad because something
called the same origin policy which if
you don't know what it is I strongly
recommend you do some reading on it but
it's one of the most important web
application security policies and ideas
he and it basically allows here it tells
the browser that if the script runs on
the same origin as the website there
Iran then it should have access to all
sorts of crazy information like well
let's just say your user data which is
pretty serious and it allows it's what
allows people to impersonate you right
so yes cats are playing to kill you or
at least your identity and your money
very soon which is very sad because we
love cats but it kind of goes to my
point of like you never know what people
are gonna come up with and they're quite
inventive in ways that they're gonna
attack your app so you never know and it
plays very nicely to the first rule of
web security which is never ever ever
trust users submitted data ever there's
no guarantees it doesn't matter if it's
an image where you like sound or
anything just never ever trust it okay
why two of the story I'm gonna tell you
a little bit more about intercom so an
intercom we have a four year old amber
app and if we look at the stats from
just kind of understand the magnitude of
this if we look at some stats from last
week we have 37 authors that submitted a
total of one hundred and ninety commits
to master in 220 across of branches
which resulted in a total of 892 file
changes with more than 5,800 additions
and almost 16 K deletions so it's pretty
big app and on top of that shipping is
at the heart at the heartbeat of
intercom so we are shipping to
production more than 100 times a day the
back end of our app is rails so
everything that we're gonna talk about
today I'm gonna try to like talk from
the perspective of a very mature app a
little bit about me into
sixteen I started working with ember and
in about two months later I had to fix a
an issue around uploading real like
uploading in real time preview of an
image without introducing a nexus
vulnerability in the code now my
background is like in Frey and back-end
so I kind of went like this is all this
mean especially because our app is huge
and decided to look more into it and I
guess well here we are today so this
talk is going to be a tool Aiden read
that I list of things that I wish I had
back then some ranting about lenders and
the regular expressions and a way in
which I think engineers can help with
the security of an application so again
I'll put into the context of like a very
mature Amber application well so the
first thing that you do when you don't
know what to do is prepare for battle
and get to know a little bit more about
your enemy and while what all of this
means so something that I think it's
really really important before you start
and before you dive into it something
that's like very theoretical because
security tends to be that way it's know
a little bit about user input and
understand what's what you expect from
your users and then know a little bit
about the same-origin policy because
everything that executes on the web will
follow that rule know a little bit about
the content security policy and why it's
such a powerful tool we're gonna get
into that a little bit later know some
know your browser's know your tools so
the security features on your browsers
and what does heats ml as input even
mean a number and how does import do
that so that's what we're gonna try and
focus on today throughout the talk well
and so let's look a little bit into what
a vulnerability like where an injection
attack actually looks like so see we
have this API that allows me to search
for coffee and then it returns a list of
results that that are displayed in your
browser and the top of that list is just
something like results for coffee and
then attacker sees that it kind of goes
like hmmm that coffee matches the search
term that the user that like iced
minutes so I wonder what would happen if
I actually
use a script to search for it now in the
modern browsers if you just do a script
alert the browser is smart enough to say
hey you probably shouldn't be doing that
it's gonna block it
however in older versions of the
browsers by older I mean like about a
year ago
Internet Explorer was still struggling
with this so if instead of passing is
just a script put an alert you'd pass
something that's slightly malformed
which is this image tag with like three
quotes that doesn't make any sense
the browser is gonna go um I don't know
what to do with that so I'm just gonna
run it so yep yep it's not scary at all
so it actually runs and you know when
you have an alert you don't really care
I mean it's a bad user experience but
it's minor the real problem is that you
can do something like document that
cookie and what document that cookie
returns is actually the content of your
user document and that becomes a problem
if it's in the wrong hands so this is
something that's called a reflected XSS
this is kind of how it looks like and
you can pretty much just pin up your own
server and try this on your own so now
that we know what we have to deal with
let's prepare our spells and look a bit
into how we can dress all this the first
thing that we're gonna look at is ember
we are a modern web application so we we
want to use a modern framework right and
in this case we're using ember so it's
very important to know how amber does
HTML escaping and how it deals with user
content and then we're gonna look at a
little bit into the content security
policy and why it's so powerful so what
ember does as a way to protect you
against injection vulnerabilities is
actually by default escape all the HTML
so the Ember rendering it layer whenever
you basically return a piece of HTML
from your helper because why not you can
it's gonna go um I don't think you want
to do what you think you want to do so
I'm gonna escape it for you just to keep
you safe
and that looks pretty much like this so
if I have a helper that returns a cat
image and I just I'm returning to see
image tag with the source as it is
Amber's gonna go um nope so instead of
seeing a cat image you're just gonna see
the string of what you returned if you
want to see an actual cat
you have to tell and were explicitly
that that hTML is safe to display and
you can do that with Amber string HTML
safe which is also very bad thing that
you shouldn't be doing and we're gonna
get into that a little bit later but if
you want to you can so when you're doing
that Ember says oh you actually wanted
an image and it's gonna show you the
image of a cat reading military strategy
which is pretty much what we're doing
right now and yes and again there's a
just on github so if you want to play
with this how it works it's all there
cool so now that we know a little bit
about amber what the hell is a content
security policy well in 2004 people kind
of went um kind of tired of this XSS
attack is there a way to mark what is
safe to run and what is not so the
guides of Firefox ie Firefox we're the
first one to him implement like a
somewhat version of the version one
content security policy and then other
it became really popular in other
browsers became interested so in 2012
wolf they actually went on and released
the first version of it and it's a very
powerful and very good way to say this
crypt is safe to run and everything else
is not so you can you can whitelist what
your app considers to be safe the
content security policy gets returned
pretty much as a hitch as a header in
HTP request that tells the browser hey
here's the list of scripts that I think
are safe and the browser is gonna read
that and say okay so everything from
self and starting mysite.com is safe I
see someone's trying to like embed this
pure evil I'm gonna go ahead and block
that because that looks wrong and it's
not part of your security policy the
very powerful thing about it is that it
will it will also stop you from it will
also start online script which is the
last example when someone's trying to
run the script as a taking it as an
image so it too late didn't read because
this is a kind of a talk on its own
there's an ember CLI add-on from Robert
Jackson that like if you don't have a
usually the content security policy is
something that you take care of at the
server side but if you're just running a
number app and that said go read that
it's very powerful - pretty good
and keep in mind to always use the
content security policy version to a
version tree version one was a little
bit of a interesting conversation where
people couldn't decide why the line
script shouldn't do so it's a little bit
of a mayhem just to be safe do that but
version two is like I know how to fix it
so they introduced hashing and ways to
validate that an inline script is what
it is and there's a really good
documentation about it so the content
security policy and like the consortium
did a very good job at putting together
documentation so you can go ahead and do
a bit of reading on that cool so with
our theory in mind let's see how we
write better code right because that's
kind of the point of of all of this so
we're gonna look into eradicating HTML
safe and writing better helpers so you
should avoid HTML safe at all cost
why well because you can never really
velch for the content that your user is
gonna submit you have to make a lot of
assumptions and that's pretty scary and
the risk of missing something increases
with the number of assumptions that
you're gonna make so a better way
like now it's not worry about it try to
avoid HTML safe and figure out better
ways to rewrite your code never use
directly on user input the in your
controller should not HTML ever
you shouldn't have HTML in your
controller it doesn't belong there and
as a power-up there's contextual
components so let's say I want to just
write a very simple card component that
has a title and a content and that works
for a very long time and then someone
comes along and says hey I actually want
to a name input and I want to say hi to
that person in the title can you do that
and the answer is well you can and for a
very long time this was the way this was
addressed well you'd have just a card
component that takes a title and then
the content part of it
and then in your controller you'd say
okay I want my name to be displayed with
balls so it's gonna return HTML safe
high name and bold and that's it and
that's that is pretty bad because it
potentially it could potentially
introduce the vulnerability you have no
control over what your name
so better way to rewrite this is using
contextual components and again this can
probably be a talker and words toriel on
its own so I'm gonna give you the basic
and then if you want to read about it a
little bit more there's the D ember map
has a really good tutorial on that so
I'm gonna rewrite my component using
these yielded properties so then I can
access the car title and the card body
directly and the reason why I want to do
that is because the title and the body
have two different two separate
functions right in two separate roles
and I want to be able to be a little bit
more opinionated about that and if I
want the title to be just a simple
string then I can do that and if I want
the title to do something crazy like say
hello to a person then I can do that as
well so I'm just using the card
properties idle and the body to just
tell them what to do and it's gonna look
something like hi Hermione in bold and
just a text well done Harry this looks
significantly better if we look at our
super card component and how that is
implemented it uses this hash helper to
actually yield two components one
component for the title that will take
care of displaying Hermione or ember
column for whatever we want in there and
then a body that will just yield
whatever content we want as well and if
this component gets in a title as well
then it's just gonna call the title
component with that title and let the
component take care of that so it
becomes so much simpler in our body we
don't want to do anything fancy we just
want to yield whatever content we have
and then on our title component from the
child title component if it has a block
so if I just want to display something
very simple like Hello I'm very excited
to be here which is true then I'm just
gonna give that content and if I need
anything if I have the something more
complicated like HTML then I can do that
as well cool so that takes care of using
the name and the title if like I said
before if I just want something
simple which is ember comp then I can
just pass the title to the super card
component and have it take care of how
to display it and where to display it so
I don't have to tell ember what things
are safe to display and where it should
be anymore it's gonna it's gonna take
care of that itself and I'm just calling
the so car that body and passing the
whatever content that I want displayed
on the body because I already have a
title so it's it's just a much nicer
much more deliberate way of displaying
content and it involves less hacking to
be able to accommodate future use usages
so if I want to change this into
displaying an image or whatever the hell
I want to do after that it's very easy
to do it with this I don't I don't have
to worry about it anymore
so contextual components are quite
powerful I feel very bad that I'm unable
to cover more of this but do you go and
do some reading on them they're they're
awesome and allowed us to lower than the
number of HTML States and I rock in a
wrap Oh something that's also very
important is writing good helpers if you
remember my very cute cat image that
returns to HTML ideally you should
prefer updating the Dom over having HTML
and helpers and say let's say you want
to write something that takes a wants to
return a user email or a helper to allow
you to like send an email well what do
you previously do this is that you'd
have to sanitize the user input to make
sure that there's nothing crazy going on
there and then you'd have to use HTML
stay safe to tell ember that hey this is
actual HTML I vouch for it and you
shouldn't touch it and that's kind of
scary it because you cannot like it can
introduce unexpected behavior and again
it runs on the on you making assumptions
about your content so much better way to
do is to do this is to use the Dom
directly to create a text node and then
set the style attributes if you have to
because you can and it's very simple and
then append lets you have an anchor in
this case to append the anchor child
element return the node and then that's
it so let's look at we already waited
let's look how what all this means in
code right
so you have this good meal to help her
and it takes a parameter an email a name
and a class if you want a style that
email and then I'm going ahead and
creating an element an anchor tag
element I'm setting the target to blank
I'm setting the reference to the user
email I'm setting the class name if if
that was provided as a parameter and
then the old magic is when I'm creating
the text so I'm creating this element as
the text node and letting the browser
take care of all the escaping and all
the displaying and just say hey browser
always treat this text rather than me
having to like be deliberate obviously
the HTML or is it text or whatever so
just don't worry about us or worry about
it
and then I'm appending the child the
text child to a and then just returning
it and it's so much nicer way to again
just worry less worrying less is good
cool so now we know how to write really
we know we know how to write better
components and we know how to write
better helpers but we have templates as
well and turns out you can escape HTML
on your templates and we're gonna also
talk a little bit about target --blank
and what that means and why it's a very
bad idea to use it on its own so
escaping we've already kind of
established at escaping HTML is very
dangerous and what ripple Curly's is
basically HTML safe for templates and
you should never use directly on the
user input and in fact you should be
always deliberate and mindful about what
you vouch for but the reality of it is
that you should never ever have to find
yourself in a situation where you have
triple Curly's if you do then you should
probably consider refactoring some code
with contextual components and good
helpers in mind and good helpers plus
contextual components would actually
allow you to not have to have triple
Curly's in your code anymore and if you
do please go and refactor it
target Bank is probably one of the most
underestimated abilities in the security
in the security community and I guess
the Tillie didn't read rule about this
is that you should always use target
bank with no opener and no refer as
attributes and the reason for that is
when you specify target --blank that
tells your browser that hey the next
page should have access to a bunch of
odd - a bunch of window objects
especially a window object and window
window sorry window opener and window
opener location so it allows the the
page that you're linking to to have
access to the location and change it if
you wants to - pretty much whatever it
wants it can be a phishing website can
be something completely safe it can be
something completely unsafe some of the
permissions will automatically be
negated by the same origin policy so it
won't if it's a different origin that it
won't have access to your cookies or
anything crazy like that but window
location is fair game and it's a very
good way for people to like redirect you
to whatever website they want the
problem with this is that browsers tend
to have different opinions when it comes
to no opener and no refer and by that I
mean that Firefox decided to not
implement opener until well version 54
that's gonna be released at the end of
this month so if you only have one of
them in your code then you're actually
letting users that prefer browser over
the other a little unprotected and
what's even funny is that Instagram
suffered from this vulnerability until
last year when someone wrote a very
raging blog post that became super
famous overnight and when hey Instagram
could you actually fix your stuff so
this is how so to make sure that your if
your support if you support Firefox were
a large range of practice and you should
always use realm opener and I'll refer
in your in your templates in a very good
way to detect that is using the
important frequent by Robert Jackson and
for those of you that are familiar with
this the linter used to validate for no
opener or no refer
and there's been a patch submitted this
week to actually validate both so all
you have to do is make sure that you're
on the latest version and then switch
from true district and make sure that
you also like fix your code if that's
the case otherwise you're gonna see a
bunch of errors but it's gonna allow you
to make sure that both your users are
protected and it also provides detection
for triple Curly's so it's quite a
powerful at and I strongly recommend you
go and add it to your project cool now
that our code is a little bit better how
do we keep it that way
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
static analyzers which is my favorite
thing to rant about these days and we're
going to talk about is lint we're going
to talk about why regular expressions
are evil and I hate them with passion in
who I saving water marks or like land
lines in the sand for like where you are
from a security point of view is a very
good and very same thing
so first the story before he has lint
that was grabbed so we have this idea of
checking for the occurrences of HTML
safe and our code using grep because you
can and we built a tiny iodine that uses
a post built hook to get real-time
feedback in dev about whatever it is
that you want to check so it's a
combination of fine plus grep plus
regular expressions plus WC - also word
count lines and compare the count
against the static limit that's been
preset so say you have HTML safe 5 and
now when it runs if HTML safe it's at 6
then you have a problem and then feel
the build of the numbers don't match you
know and this was built with getting
engineers real-time feedback in dev and
giving them an opportunity to address
those changes especially if it involves
refactoring you don't want to find out
about it when you're running in CI you
really don't especially if you have to
fix something and fix it fast and that
works fine but hey regular expressions
are load but like black magic and you do
kind of have to sell your soul a little
bit to understand them I know there's
people doing crazy things with regular
expressions in Perl I won't
go into that but personally and the
reality of it is whenever you have a
regular expression it makes that much
harder to maintain your code so it does
work it as fast but it's not ideal so we
looked into a way to do this a little
bit better using yes land and we thought
hey could we maybe use linters for
real-time feedback and figure out a way
to like plug it all in and have the same
line in the sand but instead of using
grep using linters to make it a little
bit more maintainable the problem with
this is that lenders are notoriously or
could be notoriously slow especially
when you run them on thousands of files
so we definitely didn't
our main concern for this was with the
lender be fast enough to be able to run
real time in-depth so the main idea was
to write a custom rule that checks for
blacklisted methods so it would get an
argument or a list of blacklisted
methods that you want to check for like
HTML save and then use the es lunes
running engine to get a count for that
so the insulin for those of you that are
not familiar with it relies on something
called an ast tree and then the parish
parses that tree and checks for whatever
it is that you are interested in so in
our case it's a function which makes it
a call expression in the eslint land and
it's looping through all the blacklisted
methods that you've got as an argument
and if it finds one it's going to throw
an error saying hey this method has
actually been blacklisted and you
shouldn't use it cool so now we have the
rule that runs that how do you how does
it actually how is it going to run right
in the code so we're gonna use the we
use the ESN CLI API plus the customer
role that we just built to get the
counts for different blacklisted methods
and then allowing Uslan to actually
cache so in dev to actually catch all
the runs to make it faster and it turns
out it's actually like the performance
difference of like using cash and not
using cash is between 10 to
I've seen something crazy like 60
seconds on like slower machines so
caching is something that's very very
important for four years Lent which
means yes on a colder build you're gonna
have some issues but if you're not
running for the first time you should
get quite good performance results with
caching and then fill the build up to
your account is bigger than the maximum
allow and this is kind of what it looks
like when you run in down so the first
time there's no problem it runs just
fine and then I'm updating this new Jas
and using HTML safe because I don't know
any better and then I see a big red
error on the screen going hey actually
you've just introduced a new HTML save
vulnerability you probably shouldn't do
that so it allows the engineer to go oh
actually fair enough and go and refactor
the code make the change and then the
three bells if you're looking at the
rebuild time we're at 1.3 seconds I
think and so it is pretty fast to be
used in there and you can also this is
just taking advantage of the post built
hook but there's nothing stopping you
from running it and yeah as well so if
you don't really want to deal with
configuring all this we are working on
an add-on to blacklist methods so I
guess follow me on Twitter or intercom
engineering and there's gonna be more
news about this in the following days so
yep where we got your back now that your
code is better you have a lot of
information to keep going you know what
what to do it's generally a really good
idea to like Joe and I in the community
and see what happens and basically
consult with other wizards a really good
resource is the OS top then what they do
is check every year what and create a
top 10 off like the most common
vulnerabilities shocking XSS is still at
the top of the list and then broken
identification and session management
was used to be I think not on this list
or at the very bottom of this list about
three years ago and now it's at the very
top so that should probably make a lot
of people start worrying and something
else that we've done is run back bug
bounties and intercom so up until
February 2000
we had a private back bunky and now it's
a public one and it's a very good way to
