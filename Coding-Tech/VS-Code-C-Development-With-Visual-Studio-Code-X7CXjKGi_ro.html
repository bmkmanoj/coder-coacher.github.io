about in this session so we're gonna
start off with a quick introduction in
to VideoStudio code what the product is
about and I'm gonna spend most of the
time doing demos actually ended in the
tool and then we will have some a few
some summary slides so for the demo part
actually before I get into that cannot
get a quick show hands how many people
have heard of vs cold product everyone
wonderful how many of you have used it
almost everyone maybe 85% how many of
you have been using it on a daily basis
couple six seven eight okay thank you
great so since most of you have heard of
the product and the majority have used
it I'm gonna go over the the easy part
very quickly so we're gonna start off
with something really simple so I want
to do a twenty minute challenge to
myself on stage and my team members
think I'm crazy that I want to do that
on stage but I actually want to build
something from scratch like with zero
code to start with and then we're gonna
get into how we view the code and debug
the code on stage or within 20 minutes
so hopefully I'll be successful but then
we're gonna move into trying out a more
complex Eva's first program in BS code
we're gonna talk more about intellisense
features and how you viewed and debug
with more advanced features and then
last but not least I'm going to show a
few vs code features so how you can make
vs called your editor there are tons of
things you can customise new videos to
your code to make that your editor
this sounds good to everyone what we're
going to cover today all right cool all
right oh so quick introduction because
you guys already heard or abused it so
this is Visual Studio which is a really
great ide on Windows it is
to be a fully-featured ide which has got
lots of lots of features in it it helps
you to target multiple platforms
it's got rich editing experience
advanced debugging it's also got like
testing advanced diagnostics packaging
tons of stuff in there and that's what
vo studio is meant to be video scene
your code on the other hand was invented
with a different going mind it's meant
to be a lightweight code editor that's
why we added code into his name and we
complete change the color of the logo
just not to be confused with video
studio so it's meant to be a lightweight
but powerful code editor more good news
it's completely free it's open source on
github and it runs everywhere by
everywhere really mean it
it runs on Windows Linux and Mac it has
got buting support for javascript
typescript and nodejs but it does
support more many more languages via
extensions so we add Microsoft that we
provide the C++ and C sharp extensions
and there are there's the community out
there that's providing much more
language support as well
yes code is completely extensible and
customizable what you'll see in some of
the demos later arm last but not least
it also get-get integration so you can
pretty much do everything with it from
within the visual studio code IDE so
let's talk a little bit about the vs
code C++ extension that we provide
basically enable C++ in Tennyson's Co
browsing code formatting and debugging
functionalities and things it was
shipped a year and a half ago we have
got over three million downloads so
we're really proud of that and we are
keep keeping updating this extension on
monthly basis so you're gonna see a lot
of updates and today actually I'm gonna
show the actual latest features that I
have installed on my machine that's
going out this week
so there's definitely something you
haven't seen before that I'm gonna show
you today and of course it runs
cross-platform we do support all the
three platforms that vs code supports
that's why I have brought you two
different machines today
here's Mac answering Windows machine I'm
gonna do demos on both machines just so
you know when I'm not lying to you that
we support cross-platform so you're
gonna see the experience there's not
different machines alright let's get
into my 20 minute challenge you switch
over to my Mac machine awesome alright
this does not count let me just show you
real quick for people who haven't used
this tool before real quick how the
simple layout in the vs code you I
really that you're working with cup of
tabs on the left side this is where you
see all your files
it's like explorer and then this is your
search get source code control
integration right here this is the debug
menu which we're gonna use later on when
we debug this is where you see
extensions I don't have it this machine
connected so I don't see this list but
otherwise you're gonna see a full list
of extensions on the marketplace that
you can download and install right here
and on this especially I only have the
C++ extension installed and that's
that's everything I'm gonna show you it
is either either features in vs code
itself or comes with C++ extensions so
that's the only extension you're gonna
need and up here a few quick menus over
here so you have file edit selection
view go that's all for navigation and
then you got debug that's for debugging
stuff tasks is where you're gonna run
your build tasks we're gonna see that
later and then got window and he'll and
that's all it's really really simple
layout for you to get started so it's
not too overwhelming
alright now if anyone want to count the
time I'm gonna start my 20 minute
alright gonna do this here okay uh first
of all it is gonna be a fun scratch for
sure so what I'm gonna do is new folder
here and CPP calm I want to open a
folder as opposed to open a single file
and there's a reason why I'm doing that
if you open a folder you're gonna get
better
intellisense experience for single file
we have zero knowledge of your code
therefore when they are able to provide
anything but if you have a folder which
I'm going to open here we are gonna do
some magic behind the scenes I'm gonna
show you what the magic is the B after
I'm done with the challenge so that is
not count I'm gonna do a new CPP file
I'm gonna do a simple calculator so I'm
gonna do it like a console based app so
and I know I'm gonna need CLC e so right
away I'm gonna type in include you see
you'll get something tell us ins help
right here and I'm gonna do main and
start writing up my code so I'm gonna do
STD : : you see I get autocomplete list
right here if I type in C out you see
the cook info to tip right there so
there's definitely some magic we're
doing behind the scene for supporting
that it is really intellisense it is
really intellisense I'm gonna show you
how we do that later off well this is
done
hold on the thoughts okay so since I'm
gonna do this a couple of times I'm just
gonna do it using namespace here you'll
see once I do that I still get
intelligence
okay save and now I'm gonna do my
calculator and I will have one method
one function here that's public and I'm
gonna have it return integer and passing
three integers and HR as the operator
now I'm gonna increment the speed Oh
this function and I get intellisense
here as well as I type I get function
and see how hard it is to type on stage
that's why it's a challenge
okay so I'm gonna cheat a little bit
here well don't laugh
there's a reason I'm doing this okay
okay
pasting the code looks fine but the
formatting is kind of weird so I'm gonna
do right click and say format selection
and it's formatted we do support the
clamp format in vs code
okay good all right now I'm gonna just
call this function in my main my third
do please enter and I'll pray there
number two I'm gonna take you the input
if I do that I'm gonna need a few verbal
and chard as my operator calculate
across that value to result and you see
I got intelligence again here and they
can as you can see as I type I get the
parameter hints as well so it tells me
what we put there it's as I move on to
the next argument it's gonna highlight
the different argument in the argument
list so it's really handy here and I'm
gonna put my result all right okay it's
the format document so everything I type
thing is auto format it nice alright I
think I'm done did I miss anything
let's try how about let's try so I did a
bunch of typing now if I'm good with the
code let's try how about let's try view
this code so Visual Studio code does not
come with a compiler which means you
have the freedom to choose whatever
compiler you want to compile with so in
this particular case I have a mom our
Mac machine so I'm gonna use GCC to
compile this code I already have that
installed but how are we gonna tell me
as code how to come how this code using
GCC now let's do that
I'm coming from a video studio
background so what are the first
direction for me will be I want to do
ctrl shift B that's hard yield right so
it's actually going to be the same
shortcut key in the S code so our Mac
it's gonna be command shift B or if you
want to go there to tasks there's gonna
be a run Butte task menu there so if I
click on there now it's gonna tell me
that no Beauty task found
press configure tasks to define one so
basically I need to come config that
first Sofia's called ships with a few
tasks runners this Emma spewed and
couple other things but really for what
we need now is to run any arbitrary
external command so I'm gonna get click
on others so vehicle creates a task JSON
file this is the default things really
there's only a few things you need to
change here for this code to be able to
to know how to do it so first of all I'm
gonna give task name to just name it
Butte and this is the key here which is
a command prompt T this is where you
tell vs code
what external commands you want to run
in this case I'm just gonna do GCC I'm
gonna do - G this is really important if
you want to do debugging later on this
gives you the singles and I'm gonna do
calculator CPP file and outputs are you
just given name that's why I need to do
really to config the view tasks but I
could do one more thing cuz this so far
vs Mexico knows this is a task they said
the command I'm gonna run but it doesn't
know this is a beaut ask so what we
could do is to say give it group and let
me just know this is a beaut ask and
this is my default view task the reason
will not set up this just so I can use
command shift B to Butte as actual
cookie much easier so if I want to do
that oh I can't come here to say we're
on my bill task that's the same thing
buuuut okay it's running it's kind of
little small but this is actually my
command rent in vs cold and this is the
result I'm getting back from the
compiler that says there's a warning
because we as code doesn't
no this compiler so it doesn't know what
to do with this output so it's it comes
back as just text you know output window
if you switch back to the problems
window you got nothing here problems
window is like the equivalent of ever
list in Visual Studio wouldn't be nice
if we could just go click an error here
which will take us to the code
so actually BS code support is by this
property here called the problem matter
what this is is basically you have to
you have a few definitions that's
defined via regular expressions just so
be as Co knows what to do with the
output of your command so we are
tradition shipped at the fourth one for
GCC so you don't actually have to go
define the regex
yourself but you can just use this two
for one so now if we do run again
of course I'm getting the same warning
but now if I switch back I'm actually
getting the warnings and could be errors
in the list if I double click it
actually takes me to the code of course
this is about what the problem was
because it's because I have the switch
branch which may not be returning
anything so for now I'm just gonna make
my compiler happy by if I do this again
it's kind of compiled just fine and my
problem goes away
all right we're good now we have our
file compiled and I have a program I can
actually run let's try that in in the
command window so
Oh oh yeah keep forgetting when I switch
back and forth between of machines all
right so now we got our app running and
says I should put in number so I do this
do two plus three who would expect my
code would just work the toe the code I
typed on stage will just work you guys
anyone bad I'm just working oh you guys
are better than a debugger really really
because I was gonna say that the
debugger to figure out the problem well
the problem was all right pretend you
didn't know okay but but really I want
to show how you can set up debugger
really really fast in BS code so now if
I want to come back to start debugging
so either I can go to the menu or I can
switch over to this tab here so you have
the arrow that would alter debugger but
before I do that I need to config setup
configurations surely there's nothing
click on that which is asking me which
environment I want to choose so in vs
code we support our Mac Linux we support
gdb and LDV as ready bugger windows you
actually have the voice of MS video
studio debugger or the t DB debugger so
in here I'm just gonna pick C++ gdb ODB
and similar to the tests the JSON file
there's another JSON file that's credit
called long JSON that's what you need to
define for the debugger to work so again
it comes with the template and there are
very few things I need to configure
really the only thing that matters for
launch is the program you wanna launch
so yes code need to know the name of
your program so just gonna do workspace
slash calculator that's all I need to
config now I can come back to my code
set library
point right here and if that should just
work did I save I need to save this
okay now breakpoint is hit but we
haven't put our input there yet do that
okay so that's right here it's not gonna
hear it because I'm missing a carrot
okay now it's back in look in the
debugger so even though it's a pretty
basic debugger compared with advanced
features in vs it's got the basic stuff
going okay as you can tell you can hit
breakpoint you can step over step into
the code I can run into the actual code
that does the calculation and go through
and realize I'm not getting the result
I'm expecting because my operator
apparently wasn't getting the
classifying I was giving it so now if I
go back to my code no see the result is
wrong and my y-value seems to be right X
right but operator it was the problem
and then realized getting this wrong so
now since I've made it changed my code
what I need to do which I often forget
is I need to review my code first before
I launch it right and there have been
many times where I just forgot to review
it and they're wondering why f5 didn't
give me the right result so to prevent
me from making that mistake I'm gonna
come back here in the lobster JSON file
and I'm gonna tell there's code that
before you do launch free do a
pre-launch task first and in my case I'm
just gonna have it run my bill tasks so
now if I save now we got
issue five experience as you would have
any other tools all right now here's
number all right yes
what time is it fifteen minutes
yes I did it thank you guys to set up
with the program states okay all right
now before I move off this machine let
me show you how we do the magic how we
did the intellisense now by default you
don't have to worry about this because
everything is done behind the scene but
if you want to customize or if you're
curious this is what you could do do
command P which is going to bring up the
command palette in vs code this is where
you can type in any command so what I
wanted to is to type in CCPP edit
configurations this is the one you want
to look at this actually generates
another JSON file managers don't tear
some files but I promise this is the
last one so we only have three that's
the three you need to remember this is
what this one is for intellisense so as
you know the intellisense engine which
is the one we're using right now is a
compiler based engine so it needs to
know where we could find your headers we
need to know you're in group half and
this is where we do the magic is we have
the default for each OS so for this form
which is Mac this is number these six
numbers of in krupov is what we where we
look for in this particular case it's
iostream which happened to be here and
the reason i got these three paths is
because I have Xcode installed on this
machine so we do a detection if you have
Xcode we have additional places where we
look for those files but if not it's
just going to be a low point include
so we also are by default include the
workspace route so anything you put in
there we will find so in this particular
case it's a really simple app so I
didn't need to customize these settings
but we're going to see how we can
customize these in the next demo when I
switch back to Windows ok so that's that
and one more thing on a show you before
I move off this machine is the source
code control integration so we have our
app running on the Tongass local machine
everything is good and now I wanted to
put this under source control system so
this code actually has git integration
already built in
you don't have to do anything here
coming here you can do initialize
repository which is going to ask me for
the past which is the current path Amin
automatically it finds all the changes
I've made in this folder and then I can
decide with what files I want to enter
the source potential I can say stage or
changers and then maybe remove the ones
I don't need back here when you type a
checking message I don't have the
Machine connected but if you had just do
this click you're gonna have everything
checking into your git and then look at
control you can also have vias code
connect to your repo on github directly
and then you can publish all your
changes directly to to the remotely repo
as well now the good thing about under
having the code under contendere the
source code control is now if I make
more changes to it simple you're gonna
start seeing these changes reflected in
here in the vs code UI now I've made
some changes on this CPP file now I can
right-click and say open changes this is
going to be open a side by side view to
give the changes really simple but you
can pretty much just do everything
complete your code do debug checking
according to source code control control
system or from with MIDI in vs code
okay so okay so that was the first demo
and I show you this one more things just
to remind myself I don't forget about it
okay now now let's try a different
machine windows here and we're gonna
look at a more complex program because
you might say the calculator is too
simple too easy and what how are we
going to deal with a much larger project
and a lot of times you might be dealing
with code base that that you didn't
write that's some some other other
people's code base and you might be
getting stuff of github and just want to
read the code or make some changes and
you can actually do all that in your
video studio code with the help of
persons and Co browsing features so what
I have here is I already have a folder
open this is a project github it's
called the BX form builder it's a pretty
sizable project
it basically is a designer based tool
for you to help you design widgets or
forms and then it can automatically
generate all kinds of code C++ PHP so
it's a pretty compact complex copies so
if you look at all these source code
it's called multiple folders lots of cpp
and header files in here
and here this deals with all the
designer stuff so there's a lot more
stuff here utilities and here's a main
to you without really knowing much about
this code base I'm just gonna go and
open a CPP file right here okay so
here's what you usually get my open a
project that you really don't know yes
hey I'm getting all these squiggles what
I'm gonna do because as I said we really
need the intelligence engine really to
need to know where to find this header
and by default we show you an bunch of
green squiggles has anyone seen this
green squiggles your code is somewhere
in vs code so what do you guys do what
would you do when you see these green
squiggles that's when you open you with
your studio we have the option but if
you are Mac and Linux you don't so let
me show you some techniques actually
some of the new latest features that we
developed that could hopefully help to
make that easy because we know it's a
pain to have to go through each header
file and then find out where they are
and add them manually each one to the
include path so we also show these
problems in the problems window where
you can see what files were missing in
this particular case the first file
missing is model slash types H which is
attractive reference from this file so
if you hover over this destroy this
crude squiggle it's gonna say there are
include errors detected please update
your include path that's when you need
to manually add or the include path
remember that JSON file I showed you
that's where you add a new path but the
second half of the message basically
says the Internet's features for this
translation unit will be provided by the
tag parser so what is a tag parser third
parser is basically a fuzzy parser that
we use to assist with intellisense
features so so it does not validate or
recognize the full zip as plastic tags
it it basically simply matches an output
and input stream of tokens with some
patterns it does not know about types
other than the beauty types it does not
have the photon contacts or macros it
does it's its scope its translation unit
is strictly within single files meaning
it does not
follow through your pound includes it
does not have knowledge of that
but regardless regardless of all those
restrictions it is super fast so it can
run pretty fast our large code bases
that's why we use that assist our
intelligence experience but right now
this is say the true compiler based
intelligence engine is getting arrows so
everything here or the intellisense
experience you're getting here is
provided by tag parser because the tag
parser has more knowledge even though
it's not it's fuzzy it's not super
accurate but X actually runs fast and
has some knowledge of your code
so here's c'mere I will give you an
example of what I meant by fuzzy results
so if I hover over here on this method
you see lots of possible matches and in
fact this one here has really really
long list because the race could be a
member of vector could be a tree could
be a string could be a list the tag
Carter doesn't know where it comes from
because it does not know name of many
types if I type in here to get my
parameter hints it's gonna circle
through all these different signatures
but in some cases the tag parser would
be doing a good job when there's no
ambiguity in the missing bones so in
some cases you can actually get pretty
good result over so that's that's how
the tag parser works in the current
experience you're getting by the fault
is what these green circles indicate but
we really really want to get a compiler
based intestines working because now it
then we can get more much more accurate
results when you type cold when you
hover over you know exactly which method
you're looking at so here's the new
thing we added the bits might not be out
now but you will be today so
if you click on those cream squiggles
you should see a light bulb on the left
side and that gives you a number of
options so if you guys are using delays
did the latest C++ extension before this
one you should already have seen these
two options but this is the new thing is
we are giving you suggestions where you
might be able to find those headers so
if I click on that what happens is if I
go over to be as cold JSON file is my
incra path so what just happened was we
automatically added that suggested path
to a new path so you don't have to go
through that manually so that's great
now let's come back to this file of
course I'm still getting squiggles
because you know there are multiple
headers I need and this time it's
actually not types header the age
they're saying we cannot open this WX
string dot H file which is not a direct
include but it is a dependency of my
directing food so we are giving you more
information about which file we are
looking at we're looking for so you need
to basically give us the this string and
just string dot H where that file is
right now what I'm gonna do is I have to
probably go back to my file explorer and
start searching here right to find where
they include where the header is that
could be a really tedious task and I
really don't want to do that on stage
especially so what I'm going to is a new
thing we added because of the these
suggestions that we populate the way we
populate that let me do that first and
then I explain to you what we're doing
so I'm gonna copy over these 3includes
which has the basic means it ability
include and some special things this is
also mean to WM but some special things
that this project is using but I don't
know all the subdirectories all I know
is
these root folders seem to have lots of
stuff in there but they're because of so
many deep subdirectories inside I'm just
not going to go through that but I'm
gonna have my lovely tag parser to the
work because the tapper says it is a
tireless hard worker that's gonna go
through everything in this folder so
addition in addition to the in coop has
what we have here in a JSON file is a
broad pass just gonna do that first save
it and let it do the work you can see
it's on fire fire so we need to wait for
that to finish but essentially what we
do is tack parser is going to search
through everything in those folders it
does it recursively so it's going to
search through all subfolders so the
difference between the compiler based
engine and tag parser is tag culture
doesn't recursively but the intestines
engine does not the intelligence
basically takes whatever include path
you would have passed to the real
compiler so it has to be exact path
where you can find those headers but tag
parts it doesn't care it's going to just
go and look for those everything in the
in those whole folder it's gonna store
all those information in a database so
it can lock up really really fast
that's how we use these we are able to
use information that that's searched by
the temperature to populate these
suggestions so now we if we come back
here we get more suggestions yeah this
is a subfolder under the include path
that I just pointed to right now instead
of us having to search through tag parts
that doesn't work say hey we find some
possibilities now in this case I was
actually able to solve all those three
run great squiggles now we only need to
have two left
yay big progress now once you do the
change do an update if you have the tag
parser is going to keep working
really hard worker now if I come back
here now we're getting some other
intelligence results just add that one
so that goes away
oh there's one when I one coming back
getting so close this boy is getting
something oh okay
more suggestions for this particular one
missing which is the big setup dot H
file so this is where the fuzzy result
matters is because tag parser doesn't
really know it has multiple choices
that's why we don't do everything for
you automatically but we instead we
provide these options to you so you can
tell us which one is the one you want to
pick so in this case I'm going to pick
this one and of course you mean if you
pick the wrong one you can always come
back to the JSON file to modify it
manually but the idea is really about
hey let's help out here that the tag
parser do the work instead and you all
you have to miss to do multiple clicks
on these labels some more does it go
away some more time oh that's another
challenge to do on stage is to get rid
of the screen lows see how hard that is
it keeps coming back okay how many
people bet this time will work yes no
wall squiggle so I'm done I'm done I'm
not gonna try to resolve this on stage
that's too hard oh but what I'm gonna do
is to show you another thing so there
might be cases where you just can't
locate the headers like either the ones
that you currently don't care about or
you just can't locate them at the moment
so the question is at this stage try
really hard to get rid of the screen
squiggles but if I really want to
confuse the compiler based intelligence
can I do that so yes you can here's the
option you want to use
so go back to light bulb and say for
semantic intelligence what this does is
it forces our intelligence to use Intel
compiler based analysis and not using
the tag parser to provide the inter
sensory results so of course we are
getting the rest we go instead
that's indication that you're using the
compiler based intelligence engine of
course that might be something you want
to solve eventually because that's gonna
be a build error but the good thing
about enabling the compiler based
intelligence is now actually you're
getting real squiggles that reviews real
problems in a code just to be clear this
is not a bug in this product that's just
a bug that I inserted here just so I can
show you the squiggle but it's not a
problem with the project so first of all
we get this swill oh that's telling us
I'm not using this not calling this
function right because I'm not matching
any of the argument lists now if I
remember we're getting lots of results
before like 10 or so when we still go
through the permanent hints now I'm only
getting one I'm sorry we are I'm getting
two because our intelligence engine the
compiler based one is really accurate it
knows exactly which matter that would
function this this comes from so now I
can type in as a type actually get
autocomplete as well as I move over it
moves over to the second parameter okay
switching back from Mack clicking on the
wrong keys okay so that's Colonel goes
away that's awesome so we can actually
leverage the red squiggles to fix real
issues in the code and basically what we
do so the default experience coming with
the C++ extension eventually we are
still experimenting these features but
eventually the idea is we're going to
turn on the compiler based in engine as
the default if it runs into any issues
like any include errors that you see
earlier we're going to automatically
fall back to tech version to provide the
results so you still get fuzzy results
but you are not buried in like tons of
red squiggles all over the place that is
why we had this all about fallback
mechanism in place so I would definitely
recommend everyone to use the engine the
compiler based one as the default
because you don't have to worry about
screw those of the place because we
always fall back so but as soon as you
fix you tell us or the include path as
long as soon as its config correctly
we're gonna automatically switch back to
the compiler base one so you get the
better results so you don't ever have to
worry about that setting other things I
want to show you is if you're reading a
large code base you wanna navigate
through different files we actually have
built in code browsing features right
now all these Co browsing features are
provided by the tag parser so we are
working on getting them to use the new
intellisense compiler based engine as
well in the process of doing that just
to show your real quick right now as of
now this is experience you can get so if
we click on a function I can do go to
definition of course or I can hold the
ctrl key to click that takes me to the
CPP file from here we can do a switch
header source that's going to take me to
the header file of course I can always
just go through the different
declaration directly I can do a go-to
with
takes me to a different file or I can do
a peek which brings in the definition
Internet embedded window so I don't lose
the context of my current file so those
are couple features other things we can
do is to search for singles really fast
so I showed you this command palette
earlier so if you go here and type being
at it's gonna give me populate and less
of the other singles I can look I can
type in I can do setlist it's just gonna
take me right here and we could also
navigate through two different files
that's really easy to do as well so you
do ctrl P and you just I start typing
the name of the file so in this case I
know there's a main GI CPP file and just
goes over there so at this point you can
pretty much just use a keyboard for
these quick navigations
and in here I can do ctrl P and I if I
do :
this allows me to typing a line number
so I can do to force one which takes me
to this line directly now in here if you
want to do some more editing here one of
the things you might want to do is you
if you have similar things in multiple
lines and you want to do edit your
multiple lines at the same time you can
actually do that you can scold real
quick with just keyboard you want to
hold ctrl and alt and move your up and
down arrow now I have multiple line
selected I can select them all together
okay start type I get the intellisense
as I type but that's really really
convenient as you are if you want to do
multi-line editing okay
lots of the editing and car browsing
features now let's talk about butyl bit
so earlier we build a really simple CPP
file with just GCC command this project
more complicated so it is actually set
up to deal with make if I go in here go
to this folder to make it's got a lot of
the make files already generated so what
we want to do with this project is we
want to build with make you can't have
to do that in this code because we can
run any external commands you can do
whatever you want so I'm gonna come over
here this is my cast so JSON file we're
familiar with this there's a command
last time we just passing simply passing
GC plus plus this time I'm using calling
a bad file that I created you can do
anything there so the bad fire halves is
it basically goes into the build folder
and say make me a debug dude and that's
all I need to do and of course I can
still do Joseph B to be my project
that's gonna pick up the change I made
in the CPP file when I fix the argument
list link Butte
all right it's done so that's that's
building you me s code with a more
complex project system and the last but
not least we can do debug this app this
is an X file so if we go to and show you
real quick so in the last time I showed
you how to do launch basically just
neutralizing this parameter the program
name basically that's all you need to do
as well so last time we build we debug
with LD B and that's one I'm debugging
with gdb I'm very very similar or it
needs is where we can find this program
which is the sexy file right there now
let me switch back to our to my code let
me show you something real quick
tapping this file so I know there's
something interesting here so in the CPP
CD file it's actually doing cogeneration
as I mentioned this is a form builder
which then generates CPP file or lots of
other languages oh this is where that
happens I know there are there's a
functioning here that actually takes the
property of those controls in the
designer and turn those values into the
code let's say I really wanted about
this but I'm so lazy that I don't even
want to set a pre point come back here
to the break point last time we simply
just click to get a break point set but
here I can actually type in the function
name to that vs code to find our break
point right there by looking at the
function I should be able to launch this
XC that I just build there's our
designer okay let me add a form real
quick switch over to generate some cpp
code yay that's our break point by
function name of course I can do the
normal things and other things I want to
mention real quick here is this what we
know of course you can look at the local
variables but the watch window lets you
to do expression expressions as well
will evaluate those so in here
the type is PT text so when I have this
value it's fetching here it's gonna tell
me it's false other thing I wanna
mention is all these threads now only
you can see how many threads are there
but also you can click on each frame to
look at it for anything here so it's
gonna be really useful when you do
multi-threading debugging the other
feature I'm gonna show you real quick in
the debugger is if I want to say oh this
is a long switch statement so if I want
to just skip all that
and say hey debugger just run here
because I don't want to look at
everything in between I can't say run to
cursor and they're just gonna go wrong
of course in this particular case it so
goes back but you can basically have the
debugger run anywhere you want okay so
last but not least when the debugging
when when we are in the middle of
debugging you can actually interact with
the debugger using the debug console
window one of the things we could ask
quit pretty often is hey it does vs code
debugger support viewing what's in the
registers and we don't actually have a
window for that we don't have at
assembly window for that but you can
actually get a similar the seeming from
information I just come here and do this
command dash X seeing four registers
it's going to show you what's in the
registers registers are being used
basically you can you can talking any
gdb or LDV commands in the in the debug
console if you want more information of
course you want to be careful because
you're interacting with the debugger the
same time as it's breaking so it might
cause some problems with but viewing
registers is definitely doable no
problem with that okay so we're running
short on time let me just move quickly
over on these things so pretty much just
summary of what I just showed you
earlier in the demo lots of editing
features intelligence to go browsing
code formatting we have two intelligence
engines one is compiler based is
definitely recommended with a red heart
and there's a tag parser based one which
gives you fuzzy but quick results and
how you can switch between them you can
always wit tell us which one to use
there's debugging where you can by
defining it test JSON file we can
promote you run any external tasks which
means you can build your project win it
with any
view systems we have built-in support
for MS Butte you can of course build
with make which I showed you if you have
si make projects we actually have a an
extension in the marketplace this is
called si make tools extension for me s
code this is created by Victor boo he
did a really good job getting the same
experience in BS code in there so you
can build with C make projects with very
minimal efforts in BS code external
tasks which means you can do anything
else beyond debugging as well you can do
maybe two part packaging testing
deploying there's pro matter and enjoy
terminal I showed you and bugging
features now let me do the last demo
real quick
that how you can customize vs code to be
your editor because I showed you how
easily you can get things up running I
showed you the richness of the features
across editing beauty in debugging now
you have but you might still have one
concern in the back of your mind
which is if I'm coming from another tool
I'm already used to the colors so
whatever sitting or the key bindings
over there it's gonna be a deep learning
curve for me to pick up a new tool now
here's good news is the s code is fully
customizable so first thing I will show
you is go to preferences these are the
settings tons of settings in here that
you can customize for me all I did was I
changed font size for the demo but
that's how you found it do you find this
is a default the way it works is you
have to click on edit and replacing
settings it's gonna copy over this
setting to your side of the settings
this is everything you are customizing
and you change the value to whatever you
want
and you can do that for workspace or per
user so it applies to all of your
projects lots of colors you can
customize there are different color
themes in here that you can use Oh
actually there's a quick way to get to
the
to the colors this is the default but if
you want to do height contrast I do like
this one this is the view light actually
like this one looks pretty nice this
might be too much but the idea is hey we
have Beauty lots of themes and you can
install additional themes but if that's
not good enough
you can come here and say I want to
totally customize all the colors to what
I want and pretty much everything to
what you want and anything you customize
here is gonna override the default seed
okay so that's the look and feel but if
you ask about the key bindings here is
how you can customize all the keyboard
shortcuts every single one of them if
that's too much work there's good news
if you're coming from other popular
tools and come here to find extension
that is designed to do the key mapping
for you between the other tool and the
vs code so I don't have the network
connected but if you do here's what
you're gonna have you have key mappings
butene for all these tools but if you
see anything missing that you would like
to have let us know last thing I will
show you I thought it was a pretty cool
thing there's a Zen mode UVs code if I
do that everything else goes away
I'm just coding right here okay so there
we go that's all you have the same mode
everything is peaceful okay so a few
quick things as I said you can fully
customize base code to beat your editor
just to summarize what we covered today
a lot of stuff for
with VideoStudio code and the C++
extension vs code could be a really
powerful C and C++ development
environment and it runs everywhere
across platform so you got fast
lightweight tool it's free open source
runs everywhere customisable extensible
there's lots of extensions in the
marketplace today already but if you
find anything anything that's missing
it's it's really really convenient to
just write your own next extension as
well and get integration I showed you it
a bit and on the Supersmile side what we
are adding to it experience is in
terraces go browsing formatting and of
course you can view that run with
external tasks and we got debugging
functionality or beautiness as well so
everything can be done in that one UI
all right I think that's my oh one last
minute perfect on time okay call to
action after the session if you haven't
already go download VST decode from here
this is where you can get a stable build
or get vs code inside a build this is a
free the cutting-edge latest editor this
is basically the daily beaut that we use
internally for developing vs code so
you're getting the exact same view our
developers are using and we as extension
we sometimes would experiment new
features with the inside a beaut first
so you're not only getting the latest
from BS code itself you're also getting
the latest from the C++ extension you
don't have to install both you just need
to warn each one but of course if you
want to the run side by side just fine
just get either one of those get the
simplest extension this is where you can
get them to install from marketplace or
you can just install from within BS code
like I showed you click on the extension
tab typing C for us find the one that
comes from Microsoft and clicking stop
that's all more links down there to give
feedback and suggestions last but not
least follow us to get the latest news
we publish video C++ team blog every
time we ship something new we're gonna
talk about it there and the follow us on
Twitter we are all also publish tweets
there whenever we have news and that's
all I have I think I'm running right on
time
but I'm happy to take any questions
after the session but I want to thank
you so much for spending the time here
really wonderful audience thank you so
much and let me know if you have any
questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
