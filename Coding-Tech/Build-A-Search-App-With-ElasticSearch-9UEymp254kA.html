that hard and you can get I'd say four
there's a lot of tuning that comes with
elastic searching getting the the
behavior and the relevance notion of
relevance just right but getting the
thing out of the box and turning it on
it'll actually get you about fifty
percent of the way there so it's a it's
a real quick technology to get up and
running and get some good results in
order to install and run elastic search
this is pretty easy you all probably
know it W get is so you can pull down
the find your favorite mirror pull down
elastic search in this case it's a I
need I do need update my notes here it's
a little bit older version of elastic
search but pull down unzip it to
whatever or if you want it to live CD
into that directory and then start the
binary bin slash elastic search once you
do that you can just curl localhost at
the elastic search port nine to zero
zero and it tells you hey you know for
search like in case you forgot that it
was for church but laughing search is
now up and running and just like with my
sequel with elastic search you will want
to speak in advance about the type of
data that you're going to be interacting
with and build a schema for it or as
they say in elastic search a mapping now
elastic search is interesting here
because early on they advertise that
they were a schema less data store in
the age where MongoDB was rocketing all
if everyone's kind of packed packing on
to this and it's it was true to an
extent that you could just start dumping
information into elastic search and that
gained elastic search a lot of
popularity but it's still kind of an
anti-pattern so it's in my opinion over
years using this technology it's still
very important to think through what
you're getting ready to do with this
thing so setting up the mapping is
simple everything in elastic search is a
JSON interface and in this particular
this is a Python conference so every
example that you'll see here I am using
the Python client but it's
it's really nice it's really a fairly
thin layer over the JSON interface of
elasticsearch so when you're setting up
the schema all you have to do is specify
the fields that you're going to have in
this case ID name description city start
date price and you get all of the things
that you would typically think of
existing in in a data store so you have
numbers integers floats strings dates
it's actually so you can start to get
more complex things like dates and get
locations that are a little bit more
aware than you know just two numbers it
knows what a location is and but one
thing I'll be focusing on is not only
can you have strings but you can say
that your strings are special in some
way for example an ID is a type of
string but it is a string that is not
analyzed that means that we're not going
to do any special special massaging and
trying to understand this as in a string
from natural language however both the
name in the description here I've marked
as having an analyzer that is English so
this is me giving elasticsearch a hint
that not only is this blob of bytes
actually text but it's text of English
and and I'll show you what that means to
elasticsearch in a little bit but it's
interesting because you don't have to
put English here you can put chinese or
japanese or any language most any
language that you'd want and you can
make up your own stuff so there's
interesting things that you can extra
rules you can put in for like if you
have camelcase strings because you're
indexing programming languages you can
break it up and make your own analysis
chain for it and then of course you
here's me using the client you create
event pipes with that that mapping
structure okay so we have an index set
up ready to receive events actually
adding the events at that point is
pretty simple you have an array of
events and it's just JSON blobs again
the client is nice because you can do
you can use date times and it does the
right thing and then the simplest
version is for just an iterator for
every dock that you have then dump it
into lastic search this does make an
HTTP request for every dock so there are
batch methods once you actually really
want to put this into production that's
an easy way to get up and running okay
so now we've got a bunch of documents in
the index the next bit is to pull stuff
out of it and the easiest way to explain
this oh yeah sorry for the microscopic
text how horrible is that people in the
back I'll just speak louder so the
simplest building block for pulling
stuff back is a is this match all query
and it does exactly what you think it's
effectively the select star from the
events table it gets everything back in
the order that you indexed it in and and
you you don't have to understand what is
on the screen here but I'll provide
these notes on my Twitter account later
you can see it but it gives you back
what you'd expect it tells you how much
time the quarry took it tells you if
there's any errors and obviously
importantly it gives you all the hits
back all the documents that match the
query sorted by how well they match the
query in the case of match all there's
no notion of relevance to just get them
back in the order that you index them
all right so that that was like the the
hello world of making a query but
there's a lot of different things you
can do to craft the notion of relevance
what is an important document what
should match what should not and the
building the smallest building block for
these is the so called term query so if
we have an index document it's in a it's
in the event in Nashville if I wanted to
make a filter over all the documents and
only hit documents corresponding to the
city Nashville
then that's a term query I say this is
term the field of city the token is
Nashville the special thing about a term
query is
just like earlier arrested not analyzed
term means that this is just a token it
has to be capital na SH VI lae does it
do anything special and so that that's a
match but before it gets interesting and
where you really get a benefit from a
search engine it's when you start
incorporating this notion of hey this is
not just a string this is actually
English text and so if we have a sort of
stupid document here name equals Dilbert
sorting for fun and profit then a query
that is not a type tech term but a type
match actually applies that special
knowledge about this is English and so
rather than looking for sort filbert's
the exact tokens there it knows that it
can be lowercase we can split on spaces
sorting and sort should be basically the
same information and so that's a match
so compared to what you think about how
you'd have to do that in my sequel you
would have to make a horrendous query to
make that one simple match right there
and it would also be very poor for
performing for reasons that I'll get
into in a little bit of getting more and
more complicated because what your
application has to have a lot of
different ideas mixed together you can
do phrase matching so not only do we
have the notion of matching documents
that have these terms but we want a
document that has the term sorting and
fill Burtt in it in that order this is
not a match because the original
document had silvered sorting however we
search for filbert's space sort that is
a match despite the fact that it's
different from the original document
original document has uppercase and has
different parts of speech but think
about as a user looking for something
you don't quite remember the name of the
movie but you're probably going to get
something like this so getting these
these type of fuzzy matches is a
specialty of search technology
Philbert fun won't match because there's
space between filbert and fun just more
example tough match phrase works but you
can you can add this notion of slop and
everyone chuckles when I do that one
what it's called
you can add slop slop and it'll find any
document that has these two words within
a space of two and you can go nuts with
this I once had a gig with a US Patent
Office and their search technology that
they were getting rid of and moving to a
different search than the elastic search
Solar they really wanted to know I want
to find this word within the same
sentence it's some other word and I want
to find it before or within like some
number of words and so you can take this
same behavior and overload it and get
some really complex search paper but
everything I showed you at this point is
just like atomic like I want this thing
for that thing you have to have a way of
gluing these things together in elastic
search that is a boolean query it in
normal notions of boolean queries in
normal notions of boolean you think and
and ORS and nots elastic search has that
but using different terminology rather
than ands we say must rather than should
or we say should and then not is most
not that one makes makes pretty good
sense but the idea is and if you play
around with a few queries you see why
they move to this terminology up usually
you have an array of things that must
match so in your last search query you
have a must
key and so you stick everything that
must all these sub clauses that must
match there and additionally you have
several things that don't have to match
but should match if they could match if
you could find documents that also
happen to have these other things it
should boost a little bit higher so
that's yet another array of things that
if it matches then you get a better
score each one of these pieces you have
the ability to also adjust weight so
we're starting to get
into a notion of how search understands
what's important to your customers and
to your business you can not only match
documents that match the queries but you
can also boost documents that that need
we need to sell quickly because they
need to they're expiring inventory or
something like that
and that and that leads us to our next
big topic search relevance I'm curious
how many people here have heard of the
notion of tf-idf okay only this half of
the room that's interesting oh you guys
should have mixed in a little bit more
it's not a hard concept and so I I think
it's intimidating at first but I can
break it down pretty easily this will be
a little bit of a Matthew slide but not
too bad
first off TF is really just means term
frequency and I'll get into that and IDF
means inverse document frequency and the
best way rather than giving you the
Webster's definition the best way of
explaining this is through an example
and let's say a user comes to your
website in and makes a search for the
diddle now that seems odd until you
realize that one of the matching
documents in your index is hey diddle
diddle the cat Missal it's actually
pretty good match for it
so let's do a little practice round and
see what this document would be scored
as in from the search engines
perspective term frequency is simply the
number of times a term occurs in a
document so the TF or V in this case is
two there's the the occurrence of V is
twice similarly just by coincidence
diddle also occurs twice so TF for both
of those guys is two so far so good
good inverse document frequency
sometimes I just wish they called it
document frequency and just put it one
over it it's basically how many number
of times B so the document frequency is
how many number of times the term occurs
not in this document but across the
entire set of documents
so document frequency for thee pretty
high so the inverse document for thee is
just about zero makes sense and the
document frequency for diddle not a very
common word is about it's only occurs in
seven documents so it's actually very
important and it gets an inverse
document score of 1 over 7 which is a
lot lot higher than 0 so when you
finally are figuring out the total score
of this document against this query you
put all those pieces together the score
is the tf-idf score for d+ the TF idea
score for diddle and you probably make
sense but just be a little bit redundant
TF of these two IDF of the zero goes
away TF of diddle is 1/7 there's two and
IDF is 2/7 and so you get the final
result of 0.285 seven bla bla bla bla
bla but the but the idea is every
document is going to go to the same
process and be sorted and so the way
that you craft your query informs the
way that this math works in the
documents that you know you have about
10,000 matches but you want to make sure
you do the right thing so the top 10
search results are what they want okay
yep so that was that was a pretty
overloading slide I always like to take
a break after heavy slides like that and
I think clay work is really sarap utak
and in particular I think that this this
is this is my favorite one ah that's
great we're gonna watch that one more
time I love this part of this talk okay
surface is good break so at this point
how much time have I got left by the way
so
at this point we've done a lot to get
you in the mind space of how search
works from a mechanical perspective how
to dump stuff in how to pull stuff out
what it can do as compared to other data
stores like my sequel that I was picking
them the next thing that we want to do
is dive inside the data store and give
you a little of intuition about how the
piece is inside work and what so five is
it's not that complicated
so after this section will you'll have a
little better understanding about when
it's right to use elastic search and
when when it's not so getting data in oh
in any data store there's two main
chunks that you have to understand how
you get data in and how you get data out
so that's that's the outline for the
next bit the first step of getting data
into elasticsearch is a step called
analysis and basically we're going to
take a document in this case I've got
just one field out of a document and I
will show you how it effectively gets
shredded and rearranged and shoved into
the data structures that make search
technology so fast our example in this
case is the sentence the conspirators
conspire conspicuously I chose it so
that I could almost not pronounce it at
a conference tokenization that's the
first step in this case we have told
elasticsearch hey this is English and
that gives us some interesting things
that we can play off of
we know that English is split on white
space and also punctuation we can we can
basically throw out punctuation and
interesting sidenote that I always like
to make here is this is not true of a
lot of languages and on the other half
of the earth right so like my wife is
Japanese and so there are places where
you could have symbols right next to
each other and they're different words
in the same thing doing the same thing
in Japanese which you still have to do
you have to have a really complex
algorithm to know where the best places
to split these things to make a logical
sentence so tokenization itself is a
fairly deep topic next step is actually
a fairly shallow topic
lower casing pretty easy but if you if
you have someone type in lower case you
what you better make sure that it
matches a document on that has uppercase
letters stop wording a lot of the words
in English are just noise words they
help us understand where things are
placed relative each other but they
don't really change the content so we
can throw a words like V in is and was
and stuff like that and perhaps my
favorite step of analysis is stemming
this is another place where because
we've given elasticsearch the hint that
this is English it knows some some
interesting tricks to do if you want a
document for farming to match a query
for farms which is often the case then
effectively what stimming does
accomplished is that you can take a word
and using a statistical technique you
can chop effectively chop off and
sometimes modify the end of these words
to make tokens that are easier to match
no matter what the intent was of the
people searching alright next step after
analysis is indexing so our example
sentence has turned into these three
tokens conspira-con spiricon speakers
sounds like let let's say that this is
document 1 the secret sauce of
elasticsearch for being so fast is
effectively during the indexing process
it takes these sentences turns it into a
bunch of tokens and then it effectively
transposes that so instead of document 1
has these tokens at the end of the
analysis when you've gone through all
your documents you say these tokens have
these documents so document 1 had these
tokens but in the end on spear appeared
in document 1 as well as these two other
documents conspicuity Road in document 1
as well as these 3 other documents and
so effectively from a Python point of
view you can implement this with a
dictionary where the keys are tokens and
the values are an array of ID's now this
is under the hood this is actually
implemented in Java
and they do a lot of sneaky stuff they
shim extra information in the keys so
all the notions of document frequency
which we use for scoring get shoved over
into the the keys when you look stuff up
and all the notion of term frequency
that's the other half of the tf-idf are
basically hidden into the values on the
right as well as other information like
the positions of the words in the
document so you can do phrase matches
and stuff like that
but effectively a simple search engine
is just a Python dictionary like that
all right so we have now gotten all
information in da index the next half
the equation is getting information out
of the index so our inverted index looks
like this and yeah make this interactive
how would given that data structure
what's the easiest way to find all
documents that contain conspicuous and
aardvarks anyone yep that's all you have
to do effectively you have either lists
but they might as well be sets or
iterators and you find whichever one IDs
occur in both and you can build
arbitrarily complex things on the same
idea or just a set Union and if you
combined a more complicated search it's
a set Union followed by a different set
or set intersection pretty easy so but
that's only half the puzzle because my
sequel is really good at finding
documents that match I just showed you
how elastic search finds documents that
match efficiently but elastic search has
to turn around and do a sorting
algorithm that is is part of the
important aspect of search when google
gives you back the sixty thousand
results it supposedly says you have for
your query you only see the top ten and
they're usually pretty good if you
scroll down 50,000 pages they would
probably be less good so it's important
to know how that works effectively what
happens is when your user gives you a
query you have an iterator of all the
documents that match and so what you do
find the top 10 if you initialize it you
have a priority queue you all know
roughly what a priority queue is okay we
can talk about that but effectively what
you do is every document that comes
through you take it off of that iterator
you look at all the other secret stuff
we've hid in there and find the score
for that document and now you put the
document and that score on your priority
queue and there's something there that
just iterating doing that with every
single match that that exists the
interesting aspect of this primary
priority queue though is that it doesn't
keep up with every document it ever sees
it's only of length 10 or whatever you
tell it to be so as as soon as you get
past you know the top 10 documents
you've got one that's scores lower than
the documents then it it compares itself
to not even ten like you know it's log
order log in or whatever it compares it
to a few of the documents and says I'm
lower than all these never think of me
again and so the act the action is
actually pretty efficient now there's a
little side note this is another
intuition that might be important for
elastic search if you're doing some sort
of relevance but you also want to return
100% of the documents think about how
you to implement that if I want to deep
paging is what is called if you've got a
robot scanning your website for the ten
thousand to ten thousand intent most fun
event then this means that you have to
have a priority queue that is ten
thousand and ten long and you sort all
the documents in so away the first ten
thousand of them it gives that chunk
back and guess what happens when the
dice when the robot goes the next page
carelessly it just gets worse and worse
and worse so that's one important
intuition to think about search
technology elastic search allows you to
turn that all so you if you don't care
about relevance but if you do I would
recommend not letting anyone get past
about 500 results all right and then I
already said it returns that the most
high priority contents rank you
that's effectively what we do like after
top ten they go away that the data
structures only ten items long so it
can't hold any more than that one oh
yeah yeah that's that's not a bad idea
if yeah I don't know how I would
implement that in elasticsearch I don't
think they make that easy for you but
yeah that's that totally checks out all
right okay so I need a little transition
slide here but effectively that gets us
through everything that a search engine
has been until about three years ago but
a last six so search came out of
information retrieval library technology
type stuff finding whatever I wanted to
find but elastic search is started to
prove the point really strongly that the
same data structures that serve search
results are actually really good for
online analysis log parts and stuff like
that and a big chunk of that is its
ability to do aggregations and I think I
can convince you that it's it's
basically what we're doing before just
one extra step and you get this nice
ability to do aggregations for free
almost so just like before whenever
we're aggregating over the you know we
want to find the a histogram of the
ticket prices or something like that we
have all the results that we had from
before we do the sorting like we did
with them before but while we still get
that document in hand we push it through
an aggregator it's basically just a
little in-memory thing that says okay
how many documents have have seen in you
know from $10 $20 and it just increment
Stowe's counters for every document it
does this and at the end of it you pass
back this aggregator thing and you have
these really nice results and it was
just something that you did almost as a
byproduct of the actual search itself so
with the building blocks that I've given
you right now you you can see how we
have the ability to easily filter just
what a search is you can group stuff
because you can see as the documents are
coming through you can already figure
out which group it belongs to and within
each group you can do calculations
do running averages or anything like
that so to give you a little more
intuition about how you might use
aggregation here is how I encountered it
for the first time let's say you go to
and with your chuckling have you have
you seen my that top book by the way is
a really excellent book so anyways
that's if you go to ecommerce sites you
see a lot of the original use for
aggregations is they were called facets
faceted search you have a list of
subcategories on the side you have
accounts for how many things are in that
category you can click on it and it
serves as a filter it gives you a little
bit of what I call relevant feedback so
you can understand what's actually
happening but people taking the same
data structure you turn it on its side
and you've got really nice histograms
which at Eventbrite we're making them
prettier now but you can use them to
feed back good information about how
many tickets are sold from a particular
class you can take exactly the same
information but a different data set and
give spark charts for how many tickets
were sold in a particular day and you
could take again counts over buckets and
you can plot it on a map and you've got
a really not nice geo information
console just to give you intuition about
where things are happening
in geospatial relationship and finally
it's I don't know exactly how to make a
picture for it but analytics of log
analytics in particular are great with
elasticsearch building elasticsearch
building aggregations the last search is
easy I'm going to kind of fly through
this so I have a couple questions but
effectively all you have to do is you
have your normal query
you keep asking your quarry like normal
but you add a new section to your your
query tool ask church called eggs and in
this particular case it's going to be
hard to read so I'll blur over it but
you say you can say things like my our
group aggregations I want you to count
for how counts groups by city so that's
a term aggregation with a steel this
city and I also want you to do a
histogram
variation for the prices with an
interval of 10 so that's the second
thing the results come back and you have
the normal search results at the very
top but you have a new section that has
these these aggregations in it in this
case I've got the city bucket right
there with my Nashville and Dallas and
vfe events and I've got my price buckets
for you-know-whats distribution of
events occurred but a neat thing that
you can do so right now I really needed
a graphic for this right now I've got
two separate aggregations a neat thing
for us to provide back to our users is
not only the histogram of all the events
but we could do a histogram per each
city and you can do this with lassic
search you Oh aggregations can be
arbitrarily nested there's performance
issues after you after some point but I
can say at the top level do a terms
aggregation so we bucket everything by
city and I get the counts back and then
within that aggregation do a histogram
so that we can show our users here's the
price distribution within the city that
you're interested in that the results
turn come back very similar structure
except it's appropriately nested so that
for each city bucket you have the count
and within that you have sub buckets for
the histogram so that you can draw it on
the screen that's effectively it I've
been doing this a while so I have a lot
of lot of things to learn but a lot of
other things that I would enjoy talking
about also if you're interested in
learning more on your own I know of some
reading material and you know find me on
Twitter tell me tell me what I did right
and what I did wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
