it's basically development with a
certain tool called vs code I guess by
now you know that it's quite around the
corner that we will be doing development
in this great tool but this tool can do
a lot more in my opinion that has been
showed until today
now a question who of you has never
worked with TS code and clap hands
no no just once else is a lot of people
again who never never worked with vs
code so let me introduce you this is
fish code nothing more than that
obviously this is not fish code this is
the guitar would you be able to play
this guitar of course you can there are
strings in that and you can play will it
sound good probably not really for this
guitar vs code to finish you probably
need some more stuff and that is exactly
what you can do with vs code you can
change configure and put together a
toolset around this great tool to fit
your needs
how you want to play it how you want to
work with the tool and you can make it
exactly as you want and that's basically
what we are going to do a little bit
today rock and roll with that tool so
what is fierce code a lightweight tool
vs is not Visual Studio yes this visual
studio but more like the family name
Visual Studio basically this is a light
weight to my future students definitely
it's not multi-platform you can do OS
development
or development on a Mac OS which you
might have seen yesterday I think in the
session which key strength of AVS code
is definitely the extensibility and
basically a lot of a language that it
support okay let's dive into that how
does it look like is this it has a menu
not really the Visual Studio menu that
we have these zillion ribbons and
buttons well you have a simple menu
you're not confused there is an activity
bar to basically easily go to and and
and navigate to the different parts of
of Visual Studio code status bar please
do not underestimate the power of the
status bar which is quite good read
status bar it indicates that something
is not good basically there is a text
editor well feature studio code is a
text editor so luckily we have most
space there for edit our text and there
is common palate that's very own menu is
not entire ribbon and you have to find
and click and use mouse and stuff like
that no there is a command palette you
can use very efficiently your keyboard
to go forever and execute whatever you
want to execute and you will see that
hopefully a little bit today as well so
working with vs code means you put all
these things together and be as
productive and efficient as at all
possible which means first of all which
I'm not going to show but it will be
very clear during hopefully the demos
you will work with files
there is no object designer object you
will have a directory which is called
the workspace and everything in that
directory is your project and basically
your app that you will be creating we
have the common palette you have you can
do lots of configurations source control
integration debugger everything that you
expect from development tool and will
start
with source control integration out of
the box you have source control
indicators and you all know what that is
right right only a few people know what
source control integration is okay let
me explain you a little bit you need to
know who changed what when and why who
what when why yeah
are you source control in your CA L at
the moment who does not source control
its its developments in the moment quite
a few quite a few and that is Norwood
because in our seat not normal this is
not this is development it should be
source called controlled let's say but
it's difficult in fierce code is
integrated so it's going to be easy you
know what it is you need to know who to
blame so if somebody messes up you can
deal with that yes there is an
integrated connection basically with get
you all know get get is like basically
built from an open source platform and
is now what the most used source chrome
management system there is now there is
a connection between vs code and get
only the connection it is not integrated
so yeah we will go into that in a minute
not only get the support there are some
other SEM providers that is supported
that you can add by installing an
extension so if you're already on VSDs
yes you can still use your VSDs now for
this get support which we will show a
little bit today it's basically just
invoking get if you have not installed
gate support then yeah well there is
nothing to invoke so just that it's not
that you install vs code that you can
just use gate no you need to install
some more which is basically with this
URL downloaded installed it press next
next next next next next
next next next next next next quite a
lot of next next and then finish then
you need to configure it you need to let
know who you are you can fake it a
little bit so you can if you check-in
nobody knows who you are but anyway you
need to net you know and there are the
comments basically to configure your
user on your machine and then you're
good to go
and from that moment gate can be connect
or the other way around fee is code when
it runs a good comment will basically
able to run that comment but still in
your workspace you need to enable gate
it's not that you just create a
workspace that all of a sudden there is
get you need to initialize it get
response repository you might have seen
if you've done that there's a git folder
in your workspace which is hidden true
this hidden that usually means that your
kid is being initialized and yes you can
basically execute or execute all the
gates comments for your visit ory the
easy way to start with that if you
create a completely new thing is yeah if
you are having a remote repository
remote repository is basically github
you can example of that where you put
your source in the cloud or whatever the
local repositories the one that you have
on your local development machine the
two needs to be synced and that's all
part of basically get support now to set
it up is most easy thing is just create
a repository and get up and close that
back to your development machine less
easy way to set it up is create local
repository and sync it create a remote
and sync it up to Keita that's a little
bit more cumbersome so I don't like that
so I usually just created a get up and
clone back down there are a few things
here
which is a kid terminology like you have
a repository which is basically the
database of your source control you have
the remote which is the key to part
cloud part where everything is basically
think you have to clone yet you can
clone down to your own machine and so on
I'm not going to go too deep into that
because basically there is a really good
session about that at 1:30 of CERN and
Yanis whoo yeah he's going to basically
rock and roll with source control let's
clone a repo so let's just assume that
we have some kind of github and cloud
from a strange guy and he's got a really
useful useless up that was ever being
created
you say well 36 commit see that must be
really good app so the only thing you
need to do is copy that URL open vs code
and open the command palette ctrl shift
P will go into the common palette in a
minute
clone a repository yes that's the URL
and then I need to indicate some kind of
folder I will take this folder and now
it's downloading the sources to this
folder I open the repository done I'm
basically now I have created an offline
local environment development
environment for this app and the remote
is all basically already connected so I
can start syncing up to get up if I
would like and are able to do that now
this is an al workspace let's say this
is an app so I need to download some
symbols let me do that and done I'm
ready to go
now you're developing on that and
probably more multiple people is
developing on that you might run into
conflicts this you go change the same
object and you sync it up probably maybe
there are conflicts and also that is
integrated you can solve the kind of
like looks like this and when we are
soft and one remark on the git ignore
this is a file where we can add
basically files that you do not want to
add into your repository and I think it
makes sense for al development to not
include the app files you can generate
and by compiling so you don't need to
sync it up to your kid well yes it makes
sense and then again for dependent
extensions you might want to have that
still in your repository so do what you
want there is a dot git ignore and you
can manage that like that there is a
common palette so now we have something
to develop let's develop and let's start
a little bit with the command palette
and I've got here an MD file which
describes basically what I want to show
so very easily set the common palette
cantos SP let's not spend too much time
on that contrast if P is the one
shortcut that you will use a lot I have
heard that f1 works as well fruit but
for some reason I always use contra 6 P
and then you can start typing like
change language mode and look at that I
type just four characters and it finds
that still a while the characters are
not like attached to each other so there
is an really neat and fast way to search
for this and this does not only work in
income and poverty - also works in
intelligence and all that and all that
so that is really nice
now these are is basically the common
palette because there is this kind of
arrow over
a bracket I don't know what that is
greater than side that makes it the
entire comment being searchable for for
comments to actually execute something
to give it a job right merge or push or
sink or whatever if I remove that
bracket I've got something else
basically I I can search for files I can
search for symbols yeah so that's
basically the ctrl P if I press ctrl P
there was no bracket if I if I put a
bracket there manually I'm back in a
command palette yeah basically there was
just one way for you to search for
different things if you put that kind of
bracket you can search for that those
comments if you remove that and you
place a question mark you have an idea
on what you can search for as well and
what I really like for instance is that
I can search for symbols if I press a
hashtag hashtag and then some kind of
symbol like a table and it's going to
search my workspace for a symbol that
includes the letters that I just have
given it and I can easily navigate to
some kind of code unit in this case just
some not notification it opens the file
I can start developing that in my
opinion is really cool and I see a lot
of you not giving it an X you can search
the files as well you see I've got quite
some files in my workspace this is my
workspace right that is one folder and
quite some files and so forth and stuff
like that you can search for any kind of
file by just removing all brackets and
it starts looking for files so it's
really easy it will look for files also
in subdirectories alright so looking it
up or browsing through your workspace is
really easy using this command palette
next configuration I can configure the
bejesus out of vs code about all little
detail you can configure and let me go
into that configuration and I've got a
cheat sheet for that row and let me show
you a nicer way so first of all you have
configuration files now every
configuration is done in JSON files so
it's not like if you just click here on
a menu it gets a nicely form like Thomas
would say with checkboxes no you
basically get a JSON file so if I open
this if I actually click it then you get
a JSON file that you can add it the left
part are your default settings the right
part are the actual settings that you
have changed yeah so the default
settings obviously I cannot change but
this is I can not edit this but I can
search this basically I can see here all
the settings that I would be able to
change on the right part are the ones
that I actually have changed so I have
to whatever that is we'll go into that
in 52 minutes and 20 seconds and I have
here so zoom black oh that's nice so
there are shortcuts for you to control
plus for instance and that actually
works and if you see now on the zoom
level here basically zooming means
updating the settings file saving it and
it is being applied let's not assume
that much because the screen is quite
good okay you see that I have some other
settings here which is not really that
important and I can obviously also
change the team here let's not do that
one setting that I tend to do is what I
don't really like at this moment but
that's a personal thing it's this this
is nail file
and you see all these references and
this is one reference these as two
references this is what is called the
coat lends personal this is a personal
opinion I'm not saying that you should
do that but personally I never look at
that if I want to see the references I
can look at the reference with the short
cut
so we can easily UM change that I
basically can choose like okay I do not
want to coat Lance and now you see here
that I make typos that also these
settings file and basically all settings
and Jason Jason sorry I've got
intelligence as well it is a language
and this development environment so yes
you have intelligence into your settings
as well so I want to do this editor coat
lens and I want to set that to false I
saved that I go back into my L file and
my references are gone one disadvantage
is I might like this for PowerShell so
now I basically switch it off for all my
languages Wow let's let's not do that
you can have language specific settings
as well and you can do that by look at
that a snippet snippet in JSON files I
have a language specific setting for the
al language in this case and I can
basically just copy or move this setting
to the language specific setting and now
I have set it up for me as a user for
this language I will not have goat lands
like it
not much it will get more complete okay
you have seen on the top right you see
user settings I can have workspace
settings as well I don't have any at the
moment now this works workspace settings
are as it says settings specifically for
this workspace like for this project and
don't want the debugger it's a challenge
something like that it's going to save
that somewhere and by just selecting
this it basically created here at
setting stop chasing within my workspace
but in the dot vs code folder of my
workspace that's indicating okay this is
the specific settings found for only
this project while the user settings
they were saved under my profile update
our roaming profile so it will live with
me whatever I'll live on this network
basically okay so far for settings we
have shortcuts as well and we can change
shortcuts one of the remarks I've heard
is well I hate shortcuts of vs code well
that you're right but you can change
them why not
I'm so used to having like a for for
deleting line f3 for inserting line well
you can search for the insert line
insert line above you can press the the
pencil you can change it to f3 or for
the lead line you can change it to f4
done and now you can simply use f3 and
f4 and make it your preferred keyboard
shortcuts you can completely mimic see
al if you really really like that yeah
ok
what can you do more that's slipping you
can create your own snippets please do
that you need to do that it will speed
up your development a lot now on the
same place here I can go to the user
snippets and of course I have language
dependent snippets it doesn't make sense
and I can put J what is it adjacent
snippin email development and JavaScript
but in a PowerShell how do that make
sense everything makes sense with
PowerShell so let's just assume I want
to have some snippets my own snippets
for al development and then it creates
basically an Al dot JSON file
almost almost a certain place if you can
find it out as well and that's again on
the roaming profile it creates a
language name in this case L though
Jason which are your snippets now just
assume and let me open this beautiful al
file just assume you don't like the
default tables metadata that comes with
Al and there are a few reasons not to
like that maybe you don't like the fact
that it creates triggers that you don't
use and hopefully you don't like it
because of this global variable that
this place there and every single
snippet which I really don't like
personally so let's let's let's try to
change that now the difficult way is to
start building this into a snippet but
there is an easier way you can basically
find out where Microsoft snippets are
you just go to your user profile and
there is a vs code folder there's an
extension folder there's a Microsoft al
folder and in that there is a snippet
phone those are the snippets that comes
with with the product the extension of
Al and you can change them don't because
next time you update this extension you
lose your snippets to don't do that
just open the table one copy it
to your own ale Jason one and I will put
it here at the end and you can see that
I have been trying up stuff okay I will
put it in the beginning and then you can
start to change it I don't like these
triggers and I definitely don't alike I
will I want that bracket still but I
don't like this global variable done I
will call it something different and I
saved that and now I should be able to
delete is and use my snippet which is a
much cleaner one you can very easily
it's a matter of minutes to create your
own snippets if you see that you're
always changing the the same things on
the default snippets creative wrong
snippets it will speed up development
and there is a lot you can do with
snippets I don't know if you noticed
this let me just do this again I can tap
between different parts of the snippets
these are placeholders and yeah there
was some syntax on that but it's very
easy to learn you see here place all the
number one place all the number two I
give it a default and basically that
makes you tap over the different ones
more than you can do this as well if I
yeah once you're out of the snip of the
top sequence there is no way to get back
into top sequence either we insert your
snippet so tap a name and you see here
that I'm changing two things at the same
time so that is possible as well well by
simply naming that see the same way same
place all the same number okay you can
do more I've got a coaching snippet here
and I if I you do that you see that it
inserts automatically my file name so if
you have a decent file name convention
which is
that I definitely did not apply you
would be able to speed up a little bit
like that as well I just didn't manage
to exclude the extension just yet maybe
there is a way I don't know last but not
least which I really like let me put
that coat unit back I might have a
repeat the repeat loop and you see here
this is maybe my crust and again the
same placeholders and there is a choice
you can include choices so in this case
I obviously definitely want to do this
no no okay good you're still awake okay
so yeah you can do a lot with snippets
and apparently I have been doing a
little bit too much with snippet so let
me remove this weirdo so I can recreate
that weirdo again
a few demo
those are most commonly things that you
can configure on vs code so you have a
setting such a sin which basically it's
either your workspace or a user settings
placed in a certain way you can
configure whatever behavior you have in
vs code on top of that you have the
keyboards you have the language the
keyboard shortcut sorry
and the language snippets and that's how
you can make it like it is the snippets
it's not just text it's more than that
you can have these place all the step
sequence you have multiple place all
this will show we have multi cursor kind
of thing that you can edit multiple
things at the same time you have these
variables are shown in the file name but
you also have a selection variable so
just imagine that you select a part of a
word and then you want to activate a
snippet well with this word you can work
within your snippet as well some editing
hacks so while you are using PS code you
might want to be a little bit you might
want to be a little bit efficient so
here are a few shortcuts I'm not going
to show am all just a few shortcuts that
can make your life a little bit easier
and there are a few beautiful ones like
if you have an MD MD file like this I
basically like to see it side by side if
I edit it this way and this is how you
edit it I might want to see how it looks
like and there was the ctrl K control
case expects always another letter to be
pressed you see now the status bar like
hey ctrl K was pressed I'm waiting for
you for another key if I press V it
doesn't do anything okay let me try
again that was just a V and now if I get
my MD file side by side this is much
nicer to see whatever I'm doing now that
is not that important but I want to just
have that side by side so let me go into
this coach unit here you probably know
the f12 to drill into definition this is
normal we even had that with CL but in
CL when we did that we couldn't go back
right I can tell you you couldn't go
back to go back and especially you
couldn't go back to a previous object
and stuff like that now we have the out
and the arrows and you can go and
navigate well however you want so I can
go back to one another object and I
can't go back and back and back and back
and back so with the out and the arrows
left and right this is really beautiful
so you can investigate the code go in
cone and go to definition and back and
back and back come back and go back and
yeah basically go back so I want to go
back here what you can do here as well
is yeah peak instead of already go into
that and some more let's not go too deep
into that with the alt shift here and up
you copy stuff and I luckily had my f4
so I can definitely just remove that
again the ctrl T is also a really nice
one but what I really want to show you
is this selection of lines control I if
I'm not mistaken selects a complete line
but if you do that multiple times you
have multiple lines that you're
selecting now in this case I'm selecting
an integration event you know that means
integration event first you have the
attribute and then you need to define
the procedure a procedure needs to have
the beginning the end and by default
looks like that you you have basically
five lines of code which actually is
just one definition of an integration
event or or a business event now I
cannot put I think the attribute there
but if I select these and compress ctrl
shift P I can join the lines easily and
now I still have the same it's still
compiles but at least now have a decent
definition
of an integration event if I can do that
on everything let's not do that now a
vehicle likes it obviously okay move the
selection thing it's really nice you
don't have to stick with only one course
if you have multiple cursors and you can
just place them by pressing the Alt key
and start clicking so if you want to
really be crazy you can just play for us
a number of cursors here and start
typing at the same time this is
obviously not useful but if I press my
my cursors here I might want to add a
caption which is empty it at this point
and and go from there
yeah I hope you like that I mean this is
very good just okay
imagine that you are adding fields only
have like twenty fields and you need to
add oh I forgot caption or oh I forgot
the application area easy just select
all these places once you add the
application area you don't have to do it
once and I copy it over and messing up
your formatting no this is really really
nice
and changing for instance your symbol as
well I've got a symbol here editing
hacks which is your function I can have
a peak well this is a function that is
being created here apparently and I want
to rename that function now here I call
the function and I basically have
defined it in some other place and
another object with a simple F - I have
a rename symbol and I can change it like
I'm going to call it editing hax - if I
now pick you will see that I still have
three references all the occasions of
this one symbol has been changed on all
all the things and all the files so that
is really also I use that a lot naming
is really important and the tool gives
you a really good way to
if naming is reporting renamed is
probably also very important now be sure
that the f2 is definitely something
completely different than the control f2
which is basically just going to select
all instances of this text within your
file you can do that let me just try
something out this and we called here
Waldo but now if I see the references I
do not have anything so that is not good
right you need to have this other one
this is also a really nice one just
assume that I want to rename cursed only
in that and this procedure I do not want
to rename it or not cast maybe this this
this code in that name here and not in
the entire file then I can use ctrl D
which selects the next instance and I
can keep pressing ctrl D until I've got
all of them then I can change it and
obviously this change is accepted
because I basically change the variable
and and how I call it so that is really
really nice I find at least okay let me
close this all down and let's see if we
can do more like debugging I was told
yesterday that debugging was showed so
I'm not going to show that too deep but
there was one thing that I was told I
was not a test session for my apologize
but there was one thing that was not
shown that is actually conditional
formatting that's conditional debugging
so what you can do here you can set a
breakpoint now this code unit is
something that you should never do
basically it's subscribed to the on
after login it will basically loop 100
silly loops and assign the silly
variable one of the times when you log
in it's just to slow down my demos I
would be completely before time so what
you can do here is you can put a
breakpoint and you can make it
conditional so I did breakpoint I only
want to be here if my value equals 60 60
instead of 100 times into this loop it's
only going to do yeah it's not going to
do that when you press control f5 which
I now pressed that is out of yeah I
always press ctrl f5 just to avoid the
debugger not that I want to avoid it I
just want to consciously use it okay so
let me see if it's going to stop there
it's blinking here so probably did
something and you see the value is 60
you can obviously add that to the watch
and the nice thing is there is a
complete skull stack even into Seaside
good that was the debugger most of being
the shortest demo of a debugger of all
time
let's go into some interesting
extensions as I said we did the
configuration part of eh code but there
is a lot more that we can do we can
extend fish code and that's basically
yeah adding more functionality to be
more productive one of the extensions
that we all know is the AL extension the
language extension of of Microsoft for
us supporting al but there are other
interesting extensions now what is the
next engine some short theory yeah
provides videos code for more
functionality and runs a separate
services so it does not really interfere
with each other on top of note js' it
can include languages by Microsoft Al
but also debuggers team snippet scholars
i compacts and functionality many more
today also functionality
now with envious code obviously you can
search for extensions you can add them
you can delete them you can disable them
there is a complete management of
extensions you can download them from
marketplace or you can just get a
physics file from someone and install it
manually good that was the theory let's
go into practice what I think are
interesting extensions now first of all
snippets I hope you all liked snippets I
like snippets I think they Rock you can
really use snippets for being really
productive and there is a snippet
creator I basically did it completely
the slow way again probably for time
fling reasons but just let me show you
another one there is let's just say that
you ever create a wizard in a oh wow
this is about the minimum wizard that
you can get and let me just show you
that it's yeah some code let's say there
is a lot that you'd need to take care of
you need like the visibility of the
groups you need this media repository
stuff you need to have the banners on
top you need your buttons on bottom
right there's a lot to take into account
now what you would do is let's just say
we want to turn this into a snippet and
what if there was some kind of smart guy
that had created an extension and I can
show you the extension it is the snippet
creator over here which you can
basically use it adds there is a
contribution
it adds create snippet comment and what
you can do is you can close your fallen
completely be slow
this one control-shift be I want to have
my comment
come on palette I want to create a
snippet and there it goes I can now ask
or give in the language and give it a
name Waldo snippet I can give the short
T Waldo snippet whatever and a
description model description and there
you go
now let's have a look at our snippets
and it should have created here teve all
those snippets which we are able to use
if I remove this one your this and it
adds my snippet this is really cool in
my opinion we need to changed a little
bit because best practice is is that you
yeah press yeah this is one indent so
you need to like use the top to indent
that so you need to change that you can
then again easily change that because
there is also a shortcut alt shift where
you can block comment like if you want
to have a comment I say block selection
yeah so I can just change all this in in
backslash T and I would be able to
change this in completely shortcut this
one in backslash T and so on so you can
quite easily turn this into a decent
statement all right
it's d-pad creator feature is create a
snippet there is a get up connection as
well so the this is the one so there's a
github extension which basically
connects to your giddap quite like it
don't really use it in in practice at
this moment because I just ran out but
what you have is a lot of Browse
possibilities like I want to have my
issues and browse my oven issues and
we'll look at your remote it will shoot
look at my remote okay okay I have my f1
issue and now I can open that issue and
it will open the browser but it knows
the connection right your remote is
basically the key to the camp and that
is where it is connecting to so I have
one issue here that I just closed no it
didn't close that all files are enroute
yeah and that doesn't really make sense
that's absolutely true that doesn't make
sense I might want to change that later
on okay there's a lot more on the github
I'm not going to show you all you can
create merge and all that for pull
requests there wasn't complete pull
request management basically it opens
the browser on number occasions the
thing is it does quite nice I just don't
know why I want to do that like if I
have here my cursor and I can open the
github open open the file and then it
opens that file and get up at night I
see it already why would I want to open
that and get it which is not opening and
get up at the moment
okay let's not go too deep and do that
we can't go deep into that didn't open
okay get history that is a really nice
one and that is one that I do use and
that is yeah getting whatever history
that you have been checking in and one
thing that I want to show you on that is
the git log it's basically a
representation of all your check-ins in
some kind of graphical way and you can
see like that I've been doing some
change I have today in the last hour
last second change on some kind of files
and then you can obviously browse the
files or compare them to a certain
version or at the previous version
you can see what I have been changing a
really nice way to you have an overview
of what happened basically within your
workspace
in and and also who did that it also
adds here to commits to the Explorer
where you have the same overview
basically and the files that you have
changed really nice for ya just source
control integration as an addition at
least and then we have really cool that
we have been using into practice quite a
lot and that is the rest client and
that's this client that's the
possibility to easily call rest services
so I've got some examples here where I
have added let me just show you the code
that I created which is a code unit and
I want to publish this as a web server
so I have here the XML if I include that
into my Al part it will automatically
create a tenant based web service based
on that code unit so there are three
methods I want to be able to test these
methods that's the idea and I can do
that with this new extension the next
one here is I have a query saying this
query I have here again next ml that
automatically will create that as a web
service when I publish this extension
and I've got this XML port which I'm
using in my code units here too
yeah call that as web service now how do
I test that I have been publishing this
already I can do that again let's let's
hope it works if it doesn't work you can
all go home well it does so here it is
and my web services just trust me on
that are published now I have these rest
files here as well as not al files is
HTTP files
the HTTP extension makes sure that the
rest client extension understands
whatever is in that file at the moment
so some examples I've got here as your
functions the same as your function that
vehicle yesterday created to show you
hello world or are these kind of things
you see how that can be done
I simply this is just a text file I'll
simply put get and then the string or
the URL and that's it and on top of that
I can use variables so I in this way in
the rest client I can use variables the
thing is it all the services that I have
here we'll use the same variables it
will read the entire file and these
variables will be you so if you have the
same variable name five times the last
one is the value of the variables
something you need need to get used to
in the beginning from the moment so if I
just remove this for instance you will
see the button sent request is gone I
can just say get and so on and you see
the sent request appears the rest client
understands this text file it's
comprised compiling that basically and
then from the moment it thinks that it
can call that URL and it will do that
done so I can click that and you see it
comes back with the web servers that in
this case vehicle has created as an
edger function I call the same thing
with a different variable name and this
is how you do variables within the rest
client and it comes back with hello all
and so on and obviously you can do this
on nav web services as well so I've got
a few examples here for web page web
service a default page web service there
is the job list somewhere so I I just
want to test that and here you can see
that that it doesn't work
oh it does so a soap request do data
requests it took too long let me take
that again yes five six seconds for the
data request and obviously a versa for
as well which should give me some kind
of Jason you know this that's all cool
but the thing that you probably mostly
do is calling a web service that is
based on an external port I hope you do
that at least let me try to see where I
have put that yeah so this is still my
query I'm going to skip that trust me it
works you have heard that a few times
yesterday there are some soap some soapy
quest and I would like to show you so
you remember that I needed to call a
method in the code unit and Anna might
want to get back the results of a
certain XML port well there I need to
provide the header for the soap or a
request and that is basically how you do
that so it's a little bit more typing
this is all that that you need to
proceed the authentication how it's
basically all set up I did put in some
variables here like for the method 1 to
open my I'll to to change my so
passionate song like that there's the
first time everyone anyone asked me to
zoom on after days actually
the screen is not big enough look for
next year
so yeah there's a little bit more typing
but the result is that I cannot push
anything anymore
what happened yeah
so here you have an error cool let's
change oh no no it is not an error I
know what happened I raise an error
within my function that's what you do
this right last one is obviously the
most important one where I call the XML
port and here you can simply see the
result of your your call really nice
addition the nice thing is that I can
just make this part of my of my
extension and basically the testing of
the web service is part of the extension
as well all right so you can do a lot
with a rest client sequel server is the
same every sequel server extension 4vh
code so I can basically call sequel
server stuff for instance have you ever
noticed that your data disappears if you
didn't let me show you for the sequel
server there is first you need to
connect to a sequel server
so let's first connect and then I
already set up some connection profiles
if you don't have any that you can set
it up yourself then it will not have any
list here basically and it will guide
you through a wizard to set it up so on
a dev server I want to connect and I
want to execute this sequel statement
which is basically going to show me the
content or whatever or execute the
sequel that I just do here and that is
actually looking up my companion tables
of my extension so it appears that I
have one companion table for the
customer for this extension which is the
app ID of my extension next a union I
also want to show all the tables that I
actually created which is not a
companion table but a normal table as
you can see here just some table I can
see if there is some data in it and
there appears to be some data in it and
not really here
did I miss miss clicking I miss quit so
there's not no data in there
let me quickly add some data I will run
the web client look at that how easy
that is we will show that in a minute
all right I will add quickly some data
and now our sequel statement should
actually show that oh no that's that's
wrong although it is execute current
statement and there is my data so I'm
just going to publish my extension ctrl
f5 let's just assume we did we add the
code in it whatever I'm not interested
in the client at this moment I'm
interested in the data so let me execute
this one again data gone and thanks to
this sequel you can easily find out you
have a problem next we will see how we
can solve that as well
there are snippets in this yeah it
starts with SQL and are the snippets
like if you really want to mess anything
up drop the database and so on there is
intelligence as well which I really like
select star from and look at this all my
tables of my
math database which is in docker and all
that so it's nice to have that and to
have a quick overview or whatever to
compile something that you might want to
test against you can export as well so
if I for instance select star select
start from customer like that this table
I execute this one I get my customer
table and I want and might want to
export that as either CSV of course not
we are totally into Jason customers I
can save that and here we go I've got a
customer station file and you can do
stuff with that I honestly don't know
what you want to do with that but you
can do something with that right sequel
another one create gooood you need that
why do you need that you think in al
development why would I ever create a
good app ID yeah you can generate an a
manifest from form comment so let's not
generate our own app IDs but when using
notifications then you need quick to it
like this there's a simple notification
but you should include a GU it as an ID
of the notification now what I did I
created a simple or I installed a simple
create cubed where is it
create commit extension and I can simply
be here ctrl shift P create go it it
will put it on the key and clipboard I
pasted it done you don't need some kind
of website to generate goo it and
copy over Dooku it so what does this
extension do well it creates a good on
top of that did you hear something about
talker
please confession so some people yeah
there is docker are you familiar with
docker so you all have been creating
your docker images and and using docker
somewhat less I'm not familiar with
talker and docker for me is something
completely new and at this point docker
more looks like this for me so it does
help me when I go and in search for some
dogger extensions and there are two
docking extensions there is one docker
extensions that helps you create and do
whatever you want to do with scripting
docker images and stuff like that again
I don't know on the other end there was
dr. Explorer and that does help me so it
puts these things here where I can see
okay which images do I have which I can
play with here locally which containers
have I set up and so on so I have here a
separate container thing so apparently
I've set up two containers with probably
the same image and yeah I can do stuff
from here I can at least find out what I
can do with talker here like having
these statistics let's see how this dr.
thing is doing for me at the moment and
so on I can restart I can remove good
one I can start stop and all these these
kind of things so that is nice so really
if you are not familiar with docker just
install them in vs code and manage it
from there it's it is a really easy
thing so I said you have either the
docker extension and you also have the
talker Explorer which I've used most to
just manage and restart and delete
especially delete my daughter team if
you want to know more on
docker next session is completely about
docker that's bad it's the three guys
that made docker a reality for us you
really need to thank them because this
is cool although sometimes it still
looks like this okay yeah I cannot do I
cannot do a session without our say-so
and luckily we have a partial extension
within fiesh code and I tell you now
this is let me just take no chances and
just delete this customer JSON file
because I don't I don't know I'll break
that this and how what its gonna do for
my for the demos PowerShell we are very
lucky that PS code or active Microsoft
is building a PowerShell extension for
vs code as well that makes vs code so
much more powerful and this partial
extension gets updated like every week
there is unbelievable how much
functionality has been added now you
have seen here already I've got the
console of PowerShell just built within
my what in my vs code and yeah what I
would use it for I think is quite easy
I obviously used it for setting up my
daugher stuff and that might be part of
your solution right so having just a
PowerShell script to set up your two
containers which you might need for
either death or test it's just it's just
easy the fact that you have installed
extension within vs code makes it you
can also run it I'm not going to run
this one because it will remove and set
up my containers again but yeah it's
just part of my extension which is
really nice few things I would like to
show you
especially this the first two lines here
you already have some settings within
your al extension well you can read them
from PowerShell you can easily reach ace
and files from PowerShell and if there's
the JSON file into
sorry an object and I can very easily
address the different parts within
either the app to chasten or in the
language of Jason and I think I use them
in some occasions it's probably and in
any different I think here yes so I want
I need the up Jason name for my script
in this case to work how I structured
this usually is that I have one settings
script where I load my variables and
then a few other scripts where I use my
variables so this is the one that I
usually change and this is just a matter
of of executing it now remember when we
re published
we lost our data that is not nice so
let's see how we can overcome that so I
will load my settings here so I've got
my variables now in place and I just
want to close I should have had already
installed our extension but if I didn't
let's test it again
it might end up in an error you see that
this is one script which is going to
publish an extension on a test
environment remember is to contains one
that I use for development purposes this
is the one that is in in setup in Milano
Jason that means this is the one that I
publish my extension to from the
development environment I also have a
testing environment and that's the one I
might want to keep my data from so it's
successfully executed
let me see and I have a script here to
check my data as well let me just check
if there's any data
and there is some data the people that
were sitting next to fee at the moment I
was actually entering this data okay let
me just now create a completely new
extension I want to upgrade my test
environment and install a new extension
the way you do that is you might want to
update your version of your app Jason
then if I would now build this extension
and publish it to the dev server I know
already
I lost my data I just want to keep my
data so let us try to build a new
extension ctrl shift B and it should
yeah there is my new version of the
extension I can turn back to my
powershell and in my powershell i've got
an upgrade now on tests which is
basically going to take care of my
contain stuff I'm using the nav
container helper here on the stove
whatever is there publish sync and start
enough contain the data upgrade so I
select everything I press f8 I have an
error and hopefully okay that is not a
good error okay yeah this call I having
the wrong number let's just delete this
one and let's try that again
this one's gonna work
yeah it should take that file it's not
taking that file build one more time
execute the settings and one more time
it should take the last or the only
version of the app file which is this
part last app file let me see it what
are this this number three that's not
good man I did say the final but this is
not working well let's not go into it
trust me it works trust me it did work
it doesn't work obviously okay you can
do a lot with PowerShell you know that
I'm just showing you a few things that
don't work but there you can do things
that do work and as I already have shown
you there is a lot of different types of
file now your extension is probably a
nail it contains a lot of al files but
that doesn't need to be the only father
there is in my extension there are quite
a lot of other files I've got like this
markup of markdown files to describe
whatever demo I wanted to do I've got
JSON files I've got this HTTP files
called PowerShell files I've got the
sequel files and still I can create a
package file and still let's hope that
works I can publish that yeah so it can
just be embedded into your complete
extension no there are also extensive
tour specifically for tal language like
d al for mother really nice one where
you can yeah for ma tal language so
suppose there is someone in your company
but definitely or not you that creates
it codes like that come on this is not
readable well a simple alt shift F turns
it in diesel format I can imagine that
at certain point Microsoft will include
is in their own extension but at this
point there is some smart guy called
Rasmus I was that right pronounced or
was is the guy and he is doing that at
this a really nice one another one is
basically the Al lint well-known mark
bromo he has been putting some time into
yeah watching over our code let's say
and I must say mark is not really happy
with me because I have been apparently
doing a very bad job let me show you
this it says that I have a lot of
problems ok you have unused variable
here and unused variable there and there
are some dirty code unit here with
variable it's not my aunt's want the
green lines here that's basically his
contribution to my code so you can
easily fix your code that is you go to
the Al lint which I completely don't see
it and you uninstall that extension I'll
call your code is fixed
obviously not it just gives you a nice
overview or hey you have variable here
or you have used like if I would use reg
here it would call it hey you have used
Hungarian notation that is not good okay
on top of that it introduces what what
he calls refactor what I call turn into
function so if I call this refactor he
is going to put these three lines here
on the bottom and put that into a
function luckily we have this Rasmus guy
that formats my code and there we go
everything is okay again so that is the
two functions that we have with al
length which is basically eye watching
over our code a good contribution is
still in development but you can see
people are already adding al extensions
like I have been doing actually as well
I have created the serious al language
extension I this very broad name because
I didn't really know what I'm I was one
I wanted to do basically I want just try
out typescript and it turned out that
now I'm doing like installing my modules
yeah why not
but the other ones are quite useful like
I tend to use it which is compressive P
with the C arresting you find out which
which comments you have and there is a
run thing well you can run any kind of
object in a certain client even Windows
client if you are not using docker at
least but here just use in for build for
for example tablet points you can select
the types that is supported by the
topless kind to to run the page 50,100
and it's going to open that exact page
it's nice one which I tend to use quite
a lot else you always need
change the lounge yeah that is a little
bit more cumbersome what I also have
included which should work let me fix
this is you see here this is all
completely messed up this is not the way
how you should call your files you need
to include in my opinion the object type
the object name and also the object ID
to have some kind of clear overview of
which object numbers I have used and for
that there is this reorganize all files
which ask for confirmation and it's
going to put that in the objects folder
the code unit and it basically put all
the files in a structured way called it
all the same not all the same with at
least like it should and now you have
kind of like an overview like oh I
forgot here an object number at least
that is that is the start and that is
yeah my extension basically now you can
contribute to these extensions please do
I know that Rasmus mark and I are very
keen to learn what you think of it what
does not work
what we should improve and you can
actually also do that on the rest client
and all these kinds of things so let me
quickly show you how you can do that
just go to your extension that you were
using and you say mark this doesn't work
just click on his extension click here
you will go to the market place and then
they're usually there is some kind of
here open issues you can click to this
then again usually is a github and you
can create an issue there please do that
I mean it just makes our development
life for the entire community better or
you can create your own extension did
any one of you ever create your own
extension for TS code not for al
pervious code you did did you
the creator of the al-aksa Nations is an
India created and an extension well you
can do that it's just a matter of yeah
getting your way through either
JavaScript from vehicle probably that is
not a problem for me that's a big
problem and luckily there is also a way
to do this with typescript which is yeah
what I think a little bit easier at
least for me
don't be how do you get started you
install node.js you need this runtime to
be able to either the earth get the
package that you need to create your
extension but also to you know debug and
all that you need human human is a code
generator and for yeoman there is a
specific code generated for vs code
extensions so basically you start off
with some generated hello world kind of
thing that you can start and change into
your own extension so this is how it
looks like so let's try this out and I
really mean that let's just try this out
I will create a new folder I don't know
why I would do that should let me just
you know I need to be in some kind of
folder not that I need the comment line
documents that's a good one and the
first thing you do if you installed all
that on nodejs and yo and you that's it
and code generator you can call yo code
yo code and this is going to start human
and it wants to generate basically code
for me to start creating vs code
extension and he asked me okay what do
you want to do you want to create a
typescript code if you echo would say of
course not that's not cool cool
I don't create self eclipse extension
and you can do some other things here as
well so I will create a type scripted
sketch extension most of it all most of
the extensions are created in type
script basically type script compounds
to JavaScript and that's what's the name
of your extension I will call it Google
I want to go
what's your identifier Alice called
Google I'm a description of your
schedule and what was the publisher
that's Waldo do you want to use get of
course not I want don't want to use get
who wants to risk it anyway come on and
now it's preparing my extension
basically generating the code will not
take too long
there it is so I should have a Google
map now there are this and I can open
code and this is where we start our very
first extension is done it this is
generated it generated quite a lot so
all these files node modules which is
basically libraries that I can use
inside my development and all that so as
I said I want to go and just so I want
to define that this extension will be
used for Google and I've start off with
opening the package dot jason this
package the jason is your manifest you
see this manifesting it's not an al
thing it's quite you being used in
multiple environments so here this
manifest I need to define that I will
contribute to not only a hello world
thing but I will contribute some other
comments as well so the first comment
and I've been using snippets here to not
to type too much the first comment I
want to add is a search current word on
Google the idea is I am in my
development environment
I select or I'm Oliver
I don't know what that word is I want to
google that word yeah so that now I
defined that well obviously I didn't
write any code I just defined to the
manifest height this is something that I
will contribute so that means I need to
write code there is something called in
the source of directory there is a file
called extension of the yes this is
where your rock and roll is going on
right this is where you will create your
code and you can see there is always an
activate a function this is the function
that will be called when you activate
your extension haha I need to activate
my extension I might want to define that
as well in in a manifest and there are
some activation events here as you see
my extension will only be activated from
the moment I call this a Hello comment
well no I don't want that I this is a
google extension i want to use it all
the time so i'm just using all the
events to activate my extension okay
so that will be called and now what i
want to do is write my code this is
going to be the most simple way to write
a code obviously not the most structured
way to write your code might i only have
ten minutes or I might not have time to
do to dive into that so this is first
line of code basically I create a new
comment I registered that and the code
that I will be executing is open which
basically is start in PowerShell or what
does that CL opening a hyperlink
basically and you see that doesn't
really work because I've got some red
lines here well that's because I did not
install this library it doesn't know the
open library so you might want to add
that library to your extension and you
do that with NPM which is the note
packet manager because I installed
nodejs I have this note packet manager
as well and I can inst
all the OPN library which includes the
open yeah the functionality basically
that I need what it did now it added it
should have added let me refresh this
the OPN library to my note module so now
I can code against that this number one
number two I need to make sure that I
have a variable that knows the open so
actually the open variable I declare an
open variable and that is basically the
library from opions so now this open is
okay I will be able to call this then I
need some logic to get this word and the
idea is I'm on a word with the cursor
well select that word and use that word
as a search in Google and you know what
I like Internet and it was just plain
old on the Internet
there is a get word function that I will
add and you see it's clearly going to
select the word and then provide that
word here as a return variable see yes
okay you believe me okay done
let's test this f5 builds my extension
and it says congratulations your
extension Google is now active that's
already a good start so let's create a
file let's see if our get word works
ctrl shift P I should have a Google
search Google and there we go
Google is searching for the word and I
was having and it also selected the word
basically cool not cool enough now this
is not cool let's try something else
let's search anything in Google so I
registered a new comment search anything
in this case I actually want input from
the user within the comment palette
basically the comment so I add that as
here as I register comment but obviously
let's stop this one I need to add this
as a contribution as well so let's
contribute here a second one which is
search anything on Google and you see
here that I'm using the vs code a P to
show me an input box and with that input
box I will basically do the same as as I
have been doing here just opening the
URL let's try that so I should have now
a second comment
I'm fifty Google something on goal this
is my input box let's search for bleep
let's find Waldo and Nereus and this is
the most basic way to start off with
creating your own extension it's a
little bit more to it you need to like
include your readme file decently
obviously describe your extension what
are the contributions how does it work
for instance for the rest client there
is very big readme file but it basically
is a complete manual on how you use the
rest client extension you need that I
mean people need to know how you how
they are going to use your extension
package Jason which is the manifest it
yeah main part is there that you need at
your contributions you can contribute
more than comments you can contribute
snippets as well
you can contribute callers the burgers
and all that one thing that I didn't do
well is I actually depend on this OPN
thing so I need to add my OPN to the
dependencies as well oh it's already
there okay it's already there so source
directory gets your source I put
everything in the extension dot TS
please don't do that that it's just not
not the right way to do that not really
clean what you can do and let me show
you something else so this is the code
from this the air language extension not
saying that this is right you see here
that is a lot more des files and in my
extension dot es which is still the one
that's going to activate all nine
comments well it's it's a little cleaner
I will call out to the different files
basically
that yeah that include code specifically
for uncertain function but in any case
extension TS is where it all starts
let me skip because I only have three
minutes and I want to show you this now
this extension and I don't have any
money in this but I did struggle through
quite some stuff that I don't want you
to struggle with anymore it is on github
so you can just download it and do
whatever you want with it and there is
already solutions for for instance
reading your settings in vs code reading
the lounge doc Jason reading the
application and using that as settings
within whatever you were trying to do it
is a solution and thank you you own us
for how to call PowerShell this is there
already as well so please don't put too
much time and finding out the stuff that
is already been put time in let's be
also try to be as productive as possible
the open URL which idea I got from
Tobias Fenster yeah there are as you can
see already quite some stuff that has
been found out please download it look
at it and I have an extra download as
well so there's one quote of the
previous day I would like to show you
which is vehicle obviously who said
vehicle is absolute in my four most
favorite development environment beyond
any doubt I saw during a session a big
red cross over the vs code thing or
didn't really mean that it was just
three is code for agile functions if he
could he would very much use vs code for
that I like to hear that especially from
someone like him like he has been like
diving into a lot of languages and if
you can do that with fierce code and his
favorite tool is fierce code I think
that's a very good statement which and
my session um did I at least a little
bit rock and roll this videos coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
