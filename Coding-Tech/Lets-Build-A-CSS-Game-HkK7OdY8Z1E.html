I'm super super excited to be here this
is one of my absolute favorite
conferences and this is such a massive
and awesome audience so thank you give
yourselves all a round of applause I
love CSS comic because it honestly feels
like this giant family we're all into
these really nerdy things we're all into
them together and it really just feels
like this big family so I wanted to
announce something that I've been
working on for the past couple of months
almost a year that kind of feels like my
baby and this is the only appropriate
place to announce it I'm writing a book
it's called the front end developers
guidebook I just had to know that here
because I love all of you
so this is about front-end development
everything from soft skills like how to
learn about side projects how to make
time to technical skills all the
foundations also internationalisation
SEO accessibility performance all those
things so finding that for a while I'm
working with the publisher is smashing
and it'll be out soon there's a lot of
practical stuff in this book but in this
talk we'll flip that over and we'll end
this conference with more of a party
mode we're gonna write a CSS game but
don't worry we'll go over some some
things for you to learn we'll talk about
SAS data structures there's going to be
a lot of sass involved in this we heard
some really good talks about CSS and
JavaScript this is gonna be writing
functional programs inside of SAS itself
so we're gonna kind of flip that script
a bit we're gonna do some pixel art
we're actually gonna create some
generative pixel art based on things
that were writing individually inside of
SAS so that would be some fun we'll do
some functions and loops will talk about
grid very briefly we'll learn about some
pointer events CSS animation and
basically how to crash your web browser
because none of these things are really
great for production but they're great
for making games for having fun for
experimenting with CSS so
let's meet our cast have you seen these
people around these are our lovely
organizers and MCS here today and I
wanted to kind of bring them in the game
I wanted to give them high fives for the
awesome job that they did putting this
together I was also inspired by Mario so
I thought maybe I could get the cast of
her game put them into Mario and make
some magic happen
so we're gonna do that I brought them in
to illustrate her first and I mapped out
pixel by pixel exactly what I wanted
them to look like and I translated them
to maps so we rehab Paulie Kevin Tim
Christina you got Jessica and once this
is all said and done if all works out
well we will have created this CSS comp
high-fives game oh gosh isn't going a
little crazy so it lasts for eight
seconds it counts up our points all of
this is done in just CSS I am going to
use gulp to essentially just run browser
sync so that you're not waiting for me
while I'm doing this and also run sass
but yeah let's get started this all
boils down to CSS and HTML so the first
thing that we want to do is build those
characters but those characters are
gonna take a while doing them pixel by
pixel so I'll do a little bit of a
simplified demo with a heart the first
thing that we want to do is hook this
into the HTML with a class we'll call
this class pixel eyes heart I'm using
Emma so I just hit tab it creates that
for me then I want to open my heart SDSS
and get started next thing what we want
to do is create a map of colors so let's
say we want to use red and transparent
we can map this with a key and a value
so we can map this with oh for a
transparent and then we can use R for
red cool so now we know what colors
we're gonna correlate our pixels to the
second thing that we can do is determine
the size of the pixels so let's make
this 20s a little bit easier to see for
all of you out there now what we can do
is start creating this pixel art I have
a map called pixel art it's a variable
and I'm gonna have multiple maps inside
of that map so I'm going to call this
map heart and that's gonna be a map
itself and we're going to create this by
multiple lines that are included in
parentheses to determine the number of
rows that we have so we're gonna have
six rows it's gonna look something like
this and they're gonna fill those with
the pixels that were expecting to have
trust me there's a method to my madness
you can then go through and draw out all
these pixels individually like you would
see in a heart and I know that you can't
see it yet but in a moment I can
highlight all these Reds and show you
what it's going to look like in a moment
so here I am just drawing this out and I
could see that I've aired here so I'm
gonna just fix that and really you can
just set these colors you can apply
multiple colors you can create like
stripes if I want to if I could add more
colors to the list but when I highlight
the Reds you can see very lightly that
I've created a heart out of OHS and ours
to create this pixel map so we have our
heart pixel map but now we need to read
through this entire map to pull out
those pixels what we're gonna be using
here is box shadow because box shadow is
really easy to hack and it allows us to
give an unlimited number of arguments in
the property list itself so we can have
an unlimited number of arguments and we
can place them based on an x and y
coordinates from the top left as pixel
values so lets us make this let's write
that function because we can write
functions and sass so inside of here I'm
gonna say we first are gonna generate
the shadow list so we can create an
empty string to begin with and we'll
fill that as we go and then we're gonna
also need to get the rows so as I
mentioned earlier the Rose is going to
be the length of the matrix since we
have six of these one two three four
five six going down that's gonna then
denote the rows for our entire matrix
and we can iterate through those rows to
get the actual row number so in SAS we
can also use a for loop at four row from
one through the number of rows here so
here I'm going to use Rose a variable
that we just set I'm going to set that
row number so it's just going to be row
num and then we can use the nth value to
pull that in so the nth value of the
matrix and the row so now we know what
the actual row number
is that we have landed on now we could
go through that again and get the column
number so the column is going to be at
four call from one through the length of
the row number because that means that
we're going to go through all nine
values that are in that row and get the
column value and finally we can see
where the dot is so from that we can see
that the dot is the end value of the row
number in the column so now we know if
we are in an R or an O value once we
have that we can start building this
shadow list that we have so the shadow
list then becomes the shadow list this
is how you append in SAS plus the values
that we're pulling from here so we can
get the x position by using size the
pixel value that we set us twenty pixels
times the column plus me to have a space
here for the syntax of drop shadow plus
the size times the row and from here we
can get the color so we also want to add
another space we want to then map get
which is how we access items inside of
the map itself we're gonna access from
the colors map and then use the dot
value to pull in either transparent or
red now we're converting that from an O
or an r2 transparent or red we're almost
done with this item the shadow list but
next we then have to add a comma we have
to have a comma between every single
item in this list except for the very
last item because if the last item has a
comma it'll invalidate and it won't show
up so we have to do a negated if
statement so let's say at if not cow is
equal to the length of row num which
means that were at the very last item R
at number nine and we're at the very
last row so we can say Rho is equal two
rows then we want to add a comma then
the shadow list becomes the shadow list
plus a comma cool so the last thing I
want to do is return a value we have to
use at return unquote because currently
and it is still a string that we have
unquote the shadow list and we can
finally return a value so nothing is
going to appear until we actually use it
inside of our div that we created in the
page so let's make this and after
pseudo-element and then
apply it needs a height and a width
first so the height can be the size and
the width can be the size and we want to
give us a content since it's a after
suit of element this is going to be very
fast CSS so I apologize about all of the
like improper placement of all these
things if you always make sure they're
nice and neat and orderly and inside the
box static we can use the function on
the right-hand side of the property so
here we'll use our function which is
called pixelize and we need to map yet
because again the heart map is inside of
another map so we're gonna map yet pixel
art yeah pixel art is our a sort of map
of our Maps map get pixel art and heart
and then we're gonna send the size value
again which is default and it's set
globally here so once I save this our
heart will appear it appears in the
screen I somehow didn't mess up that's
great
the next thing I'm gonna do is step in
set this I'm going to use this ampersand
which acts as an anchor in SAS so what
will happen here is I can edit pixelized
heart give it some properties and it
still has pixelized heart after set up
in there I'm gonna give this an outline
so I can debug this I lined 1px solid if
you see that this element is not taking
up any space on the page because we
haven't given it a width or a height and
that's not great if we want to use this
within our game itself it has to take up
some space so first I want to get as
position relative and I then want to
give it a width and height and I'm going
to be using that based on the size that
we've dynamically created in this matrix
we can also set the size so I'm gonna
give it a height and the height again is
the length of that matrix times the size
so get the pixel size and multiply it by
the length of that matrix and in this
case the matrix is math get pixel art
heart copy that paste it in there and
then the height the width is going to be
the length of one of those columns so
since we're out inside that loop again
we can get the size and the length of
just one of those columns so we're gonna
have to map get one of them and use that
nth value again to say n of this matrix
and the first column because why not so
say that and it is now properly placed
but you can see that it's shifted over
and the reason why is because box shadow
starts at the bottom right corner of the
div it starts at the end of it so now we
have to shift this up so we can say top
of negative size maybe left of negative
size and boom our heart is placed inside
of the div as we expected based on this
heart that we just created out of
literally letters on the screen together
here so we can then take this idea and
open something like I have a character's
SCSS where I already did this and I'm
gonna just uncomment and zoom out of
here so you can see what
the characters actually look like my
vision is forever ruined but it's fine
so if I save this and then I open I have
a character's file you can see all the
characters have appeared out of this
generated map and you can dynamically
change the colors so like if I wanted to
go into here and I wanted to change all
of the black to like a red because why
not once I save this instantly it'll all
change so you can just create this art
dynamically in your browser and it's
really fun to play with
you can also animate this if you're a
masochist and want to make your browser
to run really slowly it wouldn't
recommend animating box-shadow but it is
an option so the next thing that we want
to do is keep some score we have our
characters but we don't really have our
game set so we have to create like our
entire game area in here we're going to
use Emmet to make this really quick for
ourselves I'm gonna have a list so just
ul and that list is gonna have a class
of game area and then within that I want
to have a couple of list items so I can
say that I want to have a list item next
to that I want to have an input it's
going to be a checkbox so it's gonna be
type equals checkbox this is going to be
our click area that we're going to use
to sort of make sure that we've counted
up these points from once we click we'll
count up the points next to that we have
a div and it's going to be a character
and with Emmet you can just do times
three hit tab and now I have this list
and within it I have these three list
items inside the list item I have an
input and I have our character nothing
is going to show up until I go through
and make sure that I add a little
character so here I can say pixel eyes
maybe we'll have a Kevin in there we
could have three Kevin's or I can mix
this up and add like let's add poly here
let's add a Christina on our screen and
now all of our characters are happy and
have appeared and they're ready for high
fives also with these boxed items you
can add a border radius make them round
you can make them bigger or smaller
based on the pixel size it's four pixels
here but it really allows for a variety
of options that you can play around with
so we also want to add a place for our
score to show up here so we can just
have an h2 with a score and then inside
of that lets get a span with a class of
score that we'll access later to show
our points go zoom out there a little
I'm gonna split this screen here alright
so the next thing we want to do is then
open a new CSS file just to keep this
organized we're going to open our
gameplay s CSS so gameplay is what it's
called I've opened this now we need to
design this click area so that's not
just the small check box over there so
we can just quickly edit this maybe give
it a position of absolute so that it
shows within its parent there we can
give it a display:block and then we can
do some things like give it an outline
so that we can debug this this is my
favorite way to debug because outline
doesn't take any space on the page
whereas border does so I have that
outlined maybe I want to give it a width
of 40 pixels and a height of 40 pixels
so you could see it it's currently
behind the characters I believe so we
need to give it a z-index the index of
three could work at this point I'd
probably want to create a z-index map
and then use that to adjust accordingly
so that everything is orderly but like I
said we're just gonna speed right this
game and then here I can do appearance
none to get rid of that check box this
works really well in WebKit and in
chrome does not work in Firefox so you
would have to create a span that
surrounds your check box style that span
and have appearance none on your check
not a parent's done you have to have a
display of none a check box in order to
make this work in Firefox so everything
else will be identical except for this
little click area I also want to give us
a tap of like negative 10 pixels and a
left or like negative 5 so that it just
positions nicely maybe you want to give
it a type of 10 so once I've done that
when I click on it now you can't tell
that it clicked on it so we need to make
sure that there's some kind of feedback
mechanism I don't even know that I can
hover over it because the cursor hasn't
changed so a really nice cursor for this
it's called grab because it's like a
little hand you I don't know if you
could see it here but it's like a little
hand hovering here that's a little
for the high-five so that was good we
now know that were hovering and maybe we
want to add a property of if it's
checked give it like a background of
green or something so we know we've
clicked on it okay cool so we know now
what's being checked what's not we can
get rid of this we'll deal with that
later
we can get rid of this outline great
let's count up some points so here we
currently have score and we have a span
next to it with a class of score that
has nothing in it because we haven't
provided it any value but we can do this
with a property called counter increment
in CSS counter increment was originally
intended for outlines when you have an
unlimited amount of data that you're
counting up and you want to be able to
just increment it up we can use counter
increment in our game to check where we
have our check boxes and apply the value
put it out on the game so inside of
score we can give it an after pseudo
element with content and the content
that we're sending over that we're
pulling from DOM and sending over is
going to be the counter of a game so
once I save this a 0 will appear because
we don't have any points yet on the game
and we can mitigate that by adding the
rest of the things that matter so the
game area needs a counter reset of game
we're naming it here and then after that
we want to give the Kliq area when it is
checked a counter increment of game when
I save that now once I've clicked on
these you'll see that it's starting to
count up our score so counter increment
can be used for that if you want to make
this game even challenging we can also
use a decrement counter increment is won
by nature but you can customize it so
that you can add multiple points
negative points and really play this up
if we want to make it challenging so we
do want to make it more challenging not
in that way but we want to add a shield
because right now I can just click on
all of these and count up and I win so
let's go back into our index let's you
know get rid of some of this stuff I'm
going to say that to my clipboard
because we want to add a shield inside
of our list we still have this unordered
list with a class of game area
inside of that we still have our list
item but instead of having it directly
next to the input and click area of the
character we want to wrap that inside of
a character wrapper so let's say we're
going to say dot character wrapper and
then next to that we want to have a
shield so we're gonna have a shield plus
a character wrapper and maybe we want to
have nine of those so once I hit tab now
I have my list item with the shield a
character wrapper inside of the
character wrapper we have our checkbox
aka our click area we have our
characters and we're ready to go and
make this game what it is we also have
nine of them so that we can make kind of
a grid a 3x3 grid and here I can go
through and add pixelized characters
let's have all of the Tim that's just
lined right up no it's at all the other
characters here it lets add a Jessica
let's add a Christina let's here let's
add a Kevin let's see Polly there might
be a few multiples so they're all here
we have four teams in a row but it's
fine who likes to give high fives
we'll just leave that so they're all
kind of on top of each other
I'm actually gonna change one because it
looks looks a little crowded they're all
on top of each other we want to arrange
them on the screen here so we're gonna
use some CSS grid fun have you all used
TSS good for how many of you used it I'm
seeing like a quarter of you it's really
amazing like oh it just gives me the
shivers I love CSS grids okay so we have
our click area right and the first thing
that we want to do is give it a display
of grid and first gonna style the list
items so that you can see it and see
what's happening here I'm gonna give it
a background of Dodger blue
unlike the papaya whip that Glen likes I
am a Dodger blue kind of girl so we have
that color I'm gonna then go back into
our grid and apply some magic nothing is
happening yet but when I give it a grid
template it's just automatically gonna
fall into place
I want that 3x3 grid so I'm gonna just
use the fractional unit which says take
up as much of this remaining space as
possible within this fractional unit so
if I use one it's gonna all be even to
each other
then I can say I want one two three rows
and then I want one two three columns
you can also use a repeat property
inside of grid to do this but it's a
little bit more clear right now if I
just do when fr went that far went too
far okay so this isn't moving but I'm
wondering what I wrote wrong when I fire
over one well let's let's find out so I
save this out the the board isn't giving
me a background here either let's see if
I I spelled something wrong what is it
click area you're right it's game area
that's exactly this is why I love you
all and you're sitting in front of me
awesome so if I give it the correct
class name you know live coding who
thought something could go wrong
it appears powerfully as I expected and
then here I can give it a grid gap of
say like 20 pixels and only the space
between the pixels moves it's like magic
nothing on the outside if you don't have
to work with these like weird end values
or last child hacks it just works the
way you expect it to and now we're gonna
do that mysterious second biggest
problem of computer science and sent her
things so we're gonna vertically align
this with display flex we're gonna do a
line items Center and we're going to do
justify content center here so once I
save that all these elements will be
kind of aligned within this space we're
going to then use some margins here to
Center this area we're gonna give it a
width of like a tvw and a height of say
80 V W and then we want to do a margin:0
auto so it's centered in our screen and
looks a little bit nicer here cool we've
got that now we have this shield so I
just pre wrote it because it's just
placement background with height
absolute positioning but we haven't in
front of our character so when you click
you can't access that hand unless you go
a little higher to get that score value
up we want to bring the score back into
here so let's go ahead and add that back
in and when I click up you'll see that I
can reach the hand here but not here
so we'll needs to go back in to our
board or our gameplay file to make this
even harder because we can still tally
up these points it's still not something
that's challenging until we make it
challenging and we can do that by using
some animations so let's go back into
this file and add some CSS animations we
can use keyframes to do this we're gonna
say keyframes of move because we don't
have to be creative we'll just really
quickly come up with a name I'm gonna
have this go from 0% to 50% because at
50% I'm gonna have it alternate and it's
just gonna go like a little bounce
instead of going from 0 to 100 and I'm
gonna use the transform property to move
this in a way that it's going to
translate why to move up and down so I'm
going to say it's transform translate Y
and it's going to go from negative 25
pixels to 25 pixels I'm going to apply
this to both the character and the click
area this animation which is move I'm
going to say is 0.5 seconds it's gonna
be forever they're gonna be jumping up
at us infinite and it's gonna be
alternating for that bounce and it's
gonna be moving forwards because we want
the paint to move forwards all right
gonna save that and now our characters
are all jumping up at the same rate
ready to give us high-fives it is much
harder now to click and to grab them
while they're up there but it's still
kind of weird that our characters are
all moving at the same rate here on the
screen so we can now use another for
loop in sass but instead of doing it
inside of our class we're gonna generate
our classes within the for loop so let's
say at 4 we'll use i from 1 through 9
which is the number of characters that
we have you can also use a variable for
this
we'll set a speed and here we can use a
sass random function within this to
create different animation durations
different speeds for our characters so
let's use random I will do random times
like 1.5 and then we have to add the
second so that it knows what we're using
here for the duration so now we can say
we want our list items and we can use
the end child a selector we're going to
interpolate that I variables
we can use it within this class in this
class selector that we're creating here
and inside of that we want to give it
the speed so here we're gonna say for
all the characters and all of the click
areas within this list item with an nth
child of 1 through 9 we are going to
change up the animation duration and
overwrite it to be again interpolating
that speed variable hit save and now
they will all be moving at different
rates oh we got an excited Tim and Kevin
here mmm maybe I'll make this 2.5
alright that's a little bit better Tim
is still very excited to be playing this
game so this is starting to look more
like what we're expecting but we still
are going to ultimately always be
winning because we don't have a time
limit yet so let's add a time limit if
we go back into our index we can then
create a class like a stopper class so
we'll create a stopper and inside this
will have like an h3 that says game over
sorry and we'll save that and then we
can go into our board I have it here
again so I could just uncomment that
it's currently just on our page but what
this is doing is its styling it so that
it's being an override on the page it's
taking the full width and height it's
getting that background of cyan I'm
increasing the font size a little bit
for styling purposes but now we want to
move this off of the page so we want to
do a transform translate Y of negative
100 VH so it just moves off the page and
we want that to eventually appear in
when we want thing to move in CSS we
have to add an animation so let's add
that let's do a keyframe for stopper
we'll name the animation stopper and
we'll do a from and up to here and we
can use this value this transform
translate Y so we want this to move from
negative 100 VH to 0 V H so it goes back
to the original location on the page
this is kind of like that reverse
animation that we heard about before
with some of those awesome data
visualizations so we're gonna apply this
to our stopper we're gonna say we want
to add an animation of stopper make that
0.5 seconds this could also be a
variable really great when you're
creating style systems to variable eyes
your animations
they have the same look and feel to them
I'm also with your bezzie acres and any
kind of animation curve you have there
I'm just using linear for now so I'm
leaving it at its default and so I have
this animation I also want the paint to
go forward so it ends as it goes so when
I save this it pops in but that's a very
short game the game is like less than
half of a second long so we can use this
animation delay property to make our
game eight seconds longer or something
like that so once i refresh this page
it's going to take eight seconds until
the animation stops working and I want
to pull this out into a game length
variable so we're gonna have that game
length be eight seconds and then I can
just use that and use that and propagate
it through the rest so if you have
noticed we've lost our score the score
is now behind our stopper because we
haven't styled it yet and entire score
is an 8 - don't fight me on this it's
just a demo yes you should namespace all
of these things but we then want to
style that h2 that appears above we're
just going to do a z-index here of 10 we
are going to give it a position:relative
and then we're going to also give this
an animation we want this to appear but
not from negative 100 to zero we want
this to appear from 0 to negative 50 VH
because that way it can pop in and kind
of go in with this game over so I
haven't applied this yet oh gosh this is
at the top of the page I need to style
this has to be positioned
oh that's why okay so this this needs to
be scored
we haven't applied this yet we're going
to apply it here when we apply this
animation you're my favorite person in
here right now thank you so here we go
we're gonna apply the stopper we're
gonna have it have the same animation
delay but maybe we want to add like 0.25
seconds so it occurs a little bit later
than the last one and so once we play
this will refresh after eight seconds
the first one will appear after eight
point two five seconds the second one
will appear and they'll have a nice
little pop in effect for this game so
that appears that way I want this to
continue to look a little nicer so we
can do some more things here by applying
some some notifications that you've
clicked on the characters like right now
if I'm playing this game I clicking on
the characters they're still moving
around you don't really get any feedback
the UI of this isn't that great because
I I don't know that I've really gotten
the score unless I look down so we can
then go into our click area and say if
the click area is checked we want to
stop the animation and this is why
before when I was applying those
animations I applied them to both the
click area and the character instead of
doing to the character wrapper because
we're using this click area and it's
it's sibling the div right next to it to
apply the stopping so with this check we
want to say animation none we also want
to say pointer events none because that
means that it's no longer going to be
able to be clicked on you can't unclick
you can't remove your score we also want
to say any character next to this is
going to get an animation none and we
want to maybe add a filter so here we
can apply like a grayscale filter to it
and as we play we can refresh once I
have clicked on this eager little person
they're hard to click sometimes they
they should be stopping so let's debug
click area checked animation none
pointer events none let's see this
theoretically should be
but I'm wondering why it's not maybe I'm
not clicking on them maybe I am when
this happens you have all these things
saved so believe me this usually works
I'm going to go to another branch I have
which is called step 12 and then I'm
gonna hit gulp and it's gonna all be
magically done for me when i refresh I'm
gonna click that and it's stopping now
so it looks like the code is the same I
may have done some kind of strange thing
I'm gonna refresh that I'm gonna just
close out of it and open board as CSS
but yeah maybe I just wrote this wrong
anyway as I'm clicking this it's
stopping the propagation of the event
this character stops moving we now know
that we've clicked them as they stopped
moving that one was just really hard to
click we have our score we have our game
let's add that heart back and then we
created since that heart is an after
pseudo element we can go and then just
extend the class we've created so we can
say add extend dot pixelized heart and
when we replay the game a little heart
animation a little heart will appear
once I've clicked it so I've clicked it
the heart is there we can even give this
a margin top of negative 25 pixels so it
appears just on top of that character
and we have created here in like 35
minutes a CSS game live on stage with
all of your help so thank you
it's a difficult game
so what I really wanted you to get from
the talk is while you do these things
there are so many CSS properties that
you might not use for everything but
there are so many uses of them that are
creative uses if you go on to code pen
you can find some really awesome
examples of CSS games you can even play
this game if you go to this site unity m
/ CSS comp EU 2017 post your high score
let's see how you do you can also fork
this from code pen and make your own
game you can improve it you can build
upon it you can play it and you can make
it even better with some of those
awesome things that we've learned today
thank you so much for having me and
thanks for making the web fun and
beautiful okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
