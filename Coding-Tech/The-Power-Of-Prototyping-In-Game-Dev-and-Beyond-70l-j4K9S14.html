it starts here I was watching Star Wars
with my nephew and the movie finished
and the credits come rolling in there
were names and names and names and names
and names and I'm thinking to myself how
the did they make this because
every time I've made a website with more
than five people
everything goes this I catch on
fire and you know dogs die it's terrible
like I don't understand what's going on
and I so it this kind of launched me on
like a one or two year quest to to sort
of answer a question and that question
is how do large creative projects
succeed and when when I'm talking about
large creative projects I kind of mean
more like specifically digital like like
you know digital things that go into a
digital medium and then kind of the I
guess inverse of that question is why do
large creative projects fail so I've
been doing some research I've been you
know scouring the internet making
connections and I've been doing a lot of
research and finding examples that
confirm my bias and I've been looking
around and really trying to figure out
how these large you know popular
creative projects succeed and and I
think I've come up with some answers and
the answers prototypes so let's begin or
continue our journey and the first stop
on our journey is Pixar I think we all
know Pixar they're a beautiful animation
studio who has created in specifically
Pixar because they have created dozens
of hits over and over and over and over
they make good movies there's maybe like
two cars - in the good dinosaur that are
not so good
but they keep making good good good
products and I was very
thrilled to find this book by Ed Catmull
called creativity Inc and it's a look
inside - how Pixar works and who is Ed
Catmull good question he's this guy he's
the guy you don't know in the middle is
Steve Jobs computer guy I guess John
Lasseter very talented animator and then
Edie Catmull is a computer scientist but
he specialized in computer animation and
in fact his first like his life goal was
to make an animated film he was the
first person to articulate like animate
in articulated hand going like this and
that's like amazing amounts of computer
science but he was his life goal was to
make a animated film which he did with
Toy Story in one Oscar z-- and they did
it again with Toy Story 2 and he found
himself kind of okay I'm done
I did in my life golf I'm done thank you
bye but he switched his focus in how
Pixar runs in working on how Pixar makes
movies hits after hits after hits and
there's a lot of good advice in this
book if you can find this book and read
it I don't know if it's in German but I
hope so
but it it there's a lot of good advice
but one thing I want to kind of draw
attention to is this is the way he
describes making a movie versus making
an animated film when you make a movie
you have you know the first step is to
have some directors some writers kind of
start pieced together a storyboard a
plan
they they they kind of put this all
together and then you capture the film
and you have maybe a hundred people you
have the actors Tom Cruise you know on
set and then you have the the caterers
and then the people who operate the
cameras you have all these people on set
for a very short amount of time you try
to minimize that amount of time because
that's it's very expensive to have Tom
Cruise on set so you want to make that
very sure
and then you go into an editing phase
and maybe you do reshoots and in in fix
things up but you do it's all very like
it's mostly like three like six people
or so kind of finishing out the movie
you know depending it can flux but when
you make an animated film though it's a
lot different you don't have an editing
face when you use so when you make an
animated film the the animation process
with all the people is very expensive
it's not a hundred people it's somewhere
between four and seven hundred people
highly skilled computer animators that
you're bringing in for a short amount of
time as possible like one two years you
want to bring them in so as a result you
have to do a lot of planning and there's
there's conv is saying there's there's
no editing in animation because it's so
expensive to kind of edit and reshoot
and redo and redo and redo redo so you
have to kind of have a plan and make up
a plan a really good plan and so a lot
of animation ends up looking like this
this is kind of how you plan out in
animation you do a storyboard and these
are all hand drawn images pinned up on a
wall and then you kind of walk through
meet moment by moment keyframe by
keyframe and tell a story and get people
excited and kind of this is kind of the
prototype of the movie but as you can
imagine this is a very hard task right
drawing every frame of a movie and
putting it on a wall so what I found was
interesting is Pixar made some software
and this is a piece of software they
call pitch deck or no pitch oh what is
it I have it here pitch doctor yeah
pitch doctor and this is the only
picture I could find on the Internet of
it it's very secretive I think um but
it's it's a it's basically PowerPoint
that you sketch in and you can add audio
tracks and basically time out a movie in
time build a whole movie in sketches
right in a PowerPoint like interface and
you can add notes and sketch and
and kind of fix things up as you go so
this allows them to prototype more and
prototype faster before they get to that
expensive part of building a movie in
animated film so oh there's a head with
some gears on the wall what does this
mean well this is where I want to take a
moment to kind of apply this kind of to
the work we do we make digital products
like the websites apps I actually don't
know what you do I would love to hear it
but like let's look at how this affects
our work and but the first thing I'd
like to do I'm launching a new product
today I'd like to introduce you to a
revolutionary new Design Thinking
thought technology are you ready it's
called sketching you see your sketch on
paper and it works really well what I
love about sketching is anyone can
sketch you can sketch he can sketch she
can sketch your boss can even sketch an
idea out and you can start communicating
I would actually argue if you can't
sketch it don't do it like if you can't
get this idea in a really rough form
don't even try it and this is how we do
a lot of our work is we kind of just do
a sketch and there's like a thing it's a
carousel and I don't know everything
needs to care so so we we like to kind
of sketch out ideas and communicate with
that because it is it's free it is so
cheap to do this over and over and over
you can do thousands of these and they
go in the garbage or recycling yes they
go in the recycling and in you you can
be so much farther along in your
thinking before you even start opening
Photoshop or code so that's kind of the
okay let's sum it up the think through
problems before getting to the expensive
part that's the thing I kind of learned
from Pixar and then kind of find or make
technology that allows you to prototype
quickly okay
like pitch doctor maybe there's
something you can find that helps you
prototype more quickly so the second
example I found as cruising through the
internet is overwatch does anyone play
overwatch yes okay all right I'm a junk
rat main we can talk later overwatch is
a game made by Blizzard Entertainment
from World of Warcraft all of that 30
million people play this game that's the
size of Germany or Canada a lot of
people play this game it's very popular
so I thought it'd be interesting to see
how they kind of pieced together their
their new ideas and I was thankful and
in the story sort of starts with this
character
this is a African Minotaur
built by a 13 year old girl named IRISA
she has a cannon and then she like
throws down a drum with some energy
shooting out of it obviously yeah
it makes sense but what's even more
interesting is how they came up with
this character and I was pleased to find
these developer updates that sort of
explain how they come to these ideas so
I'm gonna play a little clip there's
some audio here so hopefully you don't
get blasted but here we go a lot of the
characters have overwatch come from many
different places sometimes it's from
designs and dented from story sometimes
it starts with the art we talked a lot
about introducing another what we like
to call anchor tank
right heart is well the only churches
that can really sort of stand his ground
and mark a spot and move with his team
real slow so we thought it was a great
opportunity there for another option
ERISA was amazing almost from the
earliest prototypes well I was testing
and iterating all these ideas I was
actually using one as our eyes alternate
skins internally to make it so it wasn't
too confusing absorbs in the game just
we could test it we see a gothic Zarya
adds to it bastions cannon that was just
a combination of cobbled together parts
but it was instantly fun and that's how
we knew we're onto a good hero a
combination of cobbled together parts
but it was instantly fun and that's how
we knew they took you know the model of
one character and they took a gun from
another character and they took a shield
thing from another character and they
just smashed it together and we're like
is this fun and the answer was yes and
then they built it and they kind of
continued on the art and everything I
find this really inspiring I like to
think of all of my productions as
cobbled together parts it doesn't sound
so good but let's think about how this
applies to us I think the the most
obvious thing is do you have a a system
of parts a pattern library who here is
working with a pattern library of some
kind yeah yeah it's been very popular in
in web front-end stuff for lately but
pattern libraries are amazing you figure
out all the problems and then you just
have parts that you can cobble together
into new things and you don't have to
make those decisions over and over and
over
I think Mina Markham's story about the
Hillary campaign is amazing you she made
pantsuit and that allows loud her
allowed the the Hillary team to make
dozens of products in a 18-month life
span so if you're talking about how can
we quickly develop I think the answer is
in establishing a style guide you can
quickly create Minimum Viable products I
actually hate oh I hate it when my
computer goes to sleep but we are good
okay
you actually hate this term Minimum
Viable products I I I don't think anyone
uses it correctly I don't think anyone
actually does it well usually it's kind
of Minimum Viable products means minimum
or maximum amount of I can put into
a two-week sprint you know it never
never works out right okay
so I like to say find out if it's a dumb
idea as quickly as possible because if
you find out it's dumb all everyone has
ideas your boss has a lot of ideas it's
best to find out that it's dumb real
quick than to spend eight ten twelve
months on a bad idea right so the
quicker you can get into prototyping
with your cobbled together parts and
then you can show your boss hey there's
your idea cool guy later yeah I think
you're gonna solve a lot of problems
before they turn into a lot of heartache
moving on Nintendo
I am a Nintendo fanboy I love it very
much this story I was pleased to find a
story about the launch of Super Mario 64
who has played this game is it on the
Nintendo out there maybe oh I hope so
but Super Mario 64 this was an amazing
game this game basically pioneered video
games 3d platformer video games the the
video games that exist today
overwatch it's some way owes its credit
to what the work that was done here and
what's amazing about Super Mario 64 is
this was that they were building it for
hardware that didn't exist yet the
Nintendo 64 didn't exist when they were
developing Mario 64 so they were
building they were building on $10,000
computers and it was going to ship to
$200 Hardware let me repeat that they
were building on $10,000 machines that
was shipping to $200 hardware does that
sound familiar
that sounds a lot like my job holy crap
so there the way they did it and I found
this interview on this blog that
translated these old Japanese interviews
from from a Japanese magazine and this
is Shigeru Miyamoto and he said the way
Mario 64 happened is there was a room
made of simple Lego like blocks Oh
Legos that's a style guide trigger and
Mario and Luigi could run around and
climb slopes jump around etc we are
trying to get the controls right
I hope everything's okay we're trying to
get the controls right hope with an
analog 3d stick that once felt smooth we
knew we're halfway there and then this
is the most amazing quote as for the
courses in the enemies those actually
came at the very end they were done in a
single burst of energy almost just
thrown together Wow
the game that defines 3d video games was
almost thrown together oops I find this
amazing and when you get into the
philosophy of Shigeru Miyamoto the the
creator of Mario the creator of Zelda
the creator of Donkey Kong you start to
understand this I feel like this is his
ethos we get the fundamentals solid
first then do as much with that core
concept as our time and ambition allow
they figure out the function and then
they work on it they iterate it as far
as they can go and I think that's
interesting for us because I don't feel
like I'm ever sensitive to like let me
get the core and then we'll just work
and see how long we can go until launch
time I never think like that it's always
like a rush to launch time and I'm
sweating and crying and in Miyamoto says
this phrase a lot this is the Japanese
where Tegel type
which means hand response there's also a
thing like when you bite into something
that that's aa goat ia like like the
feeling when you bite into something
tango tae is the feeling when you when
you use something with your hands and in
English we say game feel and I'm sure
there's some like 20 character German
word for it but is there one is that six
okay how do you say it in German optic
Oh have dick okay yeah haptic yeah there
you go we learned something did it a
little more you know so they focus on
this this haptic this this game feel
like the feeling of the game I was
pleased to find another example from
another Nintendo title called splatoon
anyone played splatoon okay very few
understandable it's a little niche but
um the game is basically a game where
you run around and you try to paint a
level and it's kind of like a shooter
like like team shooter but you try to
paint a level and it looks a little bit
like this you're kids running around
with guns and then your squids also - I
don't know it works out but but but
would you like to see how this game
started it's very interesting it started
like this and they called it tofu just
little blocks of tofu that would
disappear come up and shoot and I don't
know if that's a gun or a nose or what
what that other dot is but um they would
run around and shoot and and just see if
it's fun
they just established that core function
and then they kind of iterated on it and
they that's where they added you know I
guess squids because of ink and then
squid kids because squid kids and this
is from satoru iwata is the late just
recently passed away but president of
Nintendo the way that Miyamoto San makes
games comes not from the design but from
the function the design comes after and
I know every designer in the room just
said nope
but when I think when they talked about
design they just mean the visual like
the visual look and feel I think as
designers you should be involved in the
function function is not just code
function is is is feeling like is this
going right is this fast is this is that
does this is this good for the user you
can decide that before you start getting
or how does this have to feel you can
decide that before you get into the
visual aspects of design so let's get
our brain going okay let's get the gears
going here we go I think it's important
to prove ideas before committing to them
you know if if they walked in and they
said we're making squid kids let's go no
one would know but instead they started
with this idea let's try to make blocks
move around and shoot and paint and see
what happens I think that's a really
good way to kind of do that and to build
digital products and the way we do that
at my work is we do it on code pen we do
a lot of code pin like I have 700 code
pins in my account you can maybe see
half of them because they're all private
there they're like for big clients that
we work with and I I do the dumbest
things and and I do very useful things
but most of don't even look through my
my code pens because it's mostly just
Bill Murray photos and it makes no sense
but it makes sense to me because I'm
working on on that gray that tofu I'm at
the tofu stage of experimenting with
things and just because you know Josh
Joshua Davis spoke last night I thought
it would be good to to share a
collaboration I'm doing with Taylor
Swift okay let's see here
do and then I'll go
oh man I've been experimenting with web
via our I think it's really fun I'm not
working with Taylor Swift on this but I
think it's very fun Web VR and when you
see if I can get this guy over here you
know if you like you're in the headset
oh here we go
but this is a whale that if you click on
it let's see he dispenses agile wisdom
so so you just keep like you so you just
wake up in the morning and you put on
your VR set and talk to your whale
you know life coach I think it's very
important oh yes I think it's very
important to experiment this is just a
dumb experiment but I'm learning a lot
I'm learning about VR I'm learning about
3d models I'm learning about the Web
Audio API that or the speech synthesis
API actually that allows you to make a
web browser talk woah interesting things
got interesting this is just kind of fun
in fact I even let me go back to the
talk I was giving you know I even
prototyped out a game I had this dumb
idea where I I had a it was Sunday night
and I had a conference on Friday and I
was like I'm gonna make a game for the
conference that 600 people can play oops
I had never made a game before I didn't
really even know canvas so I just said
I'm gonna do it so I cracked open code
pen and I wanted to make like an
asteroid shooter game you know defend
the city and I was like okay I know how
to do this so asteroid that's like a
circle shape so if I make a circle fall
down
I made a circle fall down easy God had
done one for hours
so I'm dad so now it's Tuesday and that
was like okay now we need to shoot the
the asteroids and um you know so I made
a button and I was like okay um let's
just shoot again this is the tofu level
and what's interesting here is I
originally wanted lasers like true and
when lasers but I was like I don't know
how to make a laser but I do but if you
think about it a bullet is just a very
small asteroid and I already have the
code for asteroids I just need to make
it go up instead of go down so I copy
and paste it and then I set positive to
negative and there we go I had bullets
that shoot up I you can't aim yet but
that was kind of the next day I like
figured out how the gyroscope works on
your devices your laptops and phones and
then I hooked that up and then the next
day I think I was on a plane and I was
doing a lot of scary math like I was
doing like math on the plane like on
paper and it looked very suspect but I
was doing a lot of math and then um
eventually I put together this game that
I we won't play it now but we couldn't I
guess but um it's a game you can play
you basically have your device and you
rotate your device your laptop or your
your phone pretty much would be the best
solution but you there's a way that this
little ID here your friends can join in
you know you can put this up on
conference wall and your friends can
join in and also try to kill asteroids
it's kind of a lot of fun ok let's put
this in our brain I'll try and smash
through this build a prototype to
validate your ideas I think if you you
can understand your work and share that
idea
people will start understanding it the
the what cardio city they will start to
2-under easily understand the idea and
it's a lot easier to do in a prototype
then then right before you launch your
product an experiment to get estimates
better estimates of the work required
that's another thing they do they
figured out how much work it was
take and and planned for that and how we
do that at my job is Jekyll we use a lot
of Jekyll it's a static site generator
as anyone used it okay good good amount
of hands I love it I it could be any sex
I generator really anything you want to
use this is just what we use what I love
about it is no database yeah this from a
computer perspective eliminates so much
heartache so much pain because when you
go to the database and you connect to
the database well you have a lot of
problems you have like security concerns
you have oops I deleted all the users on
the website concerns don't do that so
when you prototype outside of the
production environment if you pull it
outside of your master branch or even
not even the master branch the master
project if you pull it outside of that
and you work on something it's very easy
you you feel relaxed and free to kind of
experiment but just because there's no
database and doesn't mean you can't have
data this is what I like about Jekyll is
I can I can get a dump of all the
products from our database I can get all
the products from our database and I can
iterate through them in a template
language and this template language is
so easy it's really easy to translate to
something like like a Java template
system or you know note or anything
really you can this is really easy to
translate but you can experiment with
your data inside a static site generator
I really recommend it I would be happy
to talk about how I do it some more
I really owe like about 100 blog posts
but I'm gonna wrap up let's finish with
a something from Microsoft
it's a twenty page research paper which
I would like to read in its entirety
abstract now this is a research paper
from Microsoft Research and it's called
what went right and what went wrong and
analysis of 155 post-mortems from game
development this is what's interesting
about this is the okay so video games
are a good analogy to what we all do the
average video game has ballooned in
complexity and is now the average video
game is a two year project to make a
video game is anyone here on a two-year
project to make a website yeah or now
yeah yeah it really slips you know you
you said six months but you're at one
year and they they kind of analyze these
game development post-mortems with from
gamasutra it's a blog and what's
different about the game development
post mortems and the startup world post
mortems is game development tends to be
a little more honest the startup world
is usually ah we crushed it but the
world wasn't ready for our disruption
send me bitcoins you know I don't know
but game developments a little more
honest on the problems that occurred and
here's like a chart and graph of all the
problems there's there's four big spikes
the biggest one is obstacles these are
things that you don't expect
somebody's partner passes away mental
health breakdowns things of that nature
that you don't expect kind of general
business risks the next three are very
connected there's game design there's
development in their schedule and the
problem here is the game design was
overly ambitious and they design things
that were not easy to create so the
development struggled to create the
designs as anyone ever happened that
ever happened to anyone okay and then
because of that the schedule kept
slipping and people got mad and then
project managers were like it has to be
out by Christmas and then everyone's
like no way
so they come up with some conclusions
all I highlighted one and in here it is
prescribed to an iterative development
process and utilize prototypes as a
method of proving features and concepts
before committing them to your design
does that sound familiar it should
that's what I've been talking about for
the last 40 minutes and third don't be
overly ambitious in your design be
reasonable and taken to account schedule
and budget hmm
that one hurts so let's apply this to
our brains yes yes yes that's what I
just said prescribed development process
and use prototypes as a method of
proving features and concepts before
committing them to your design that's
how we get out of this Jam so I'm going
to wrap up I yes I'm gonna wrap up I
have a timer here but I don't know if
it's the break timer or if it's my timer
oh it is great I'm just gonna hang out
here for nine minutes so I want to talk
about valuing prototypes I think it's
really important to value prototypes I
think we all kind of prototype to some
degree but I don't think it gets the
value that it deserves in our production
processes I feel like in my experience
in digital products we get you know it's
pixels are so cheap we get locked into
this idea that we can just Oh we'll just
commit to master or we'll just we'll
just ship it bro ship it ship it ship it
agile ship it and so you get in this
this cycle where you just keep just
trying to ship things without you know
doing the right amount of thinking
before you go into it so I think
prototypes are very valuable not only to
to your business but also just
preventing naive product decisions from
making it to market in the next point
I'd like to make is just that prototypes
are for everyone the example was
sketching
your boss can prototype the lady who
makes the lunches at your office she can
prototype anyone can prototype in your
workplace and in the and you when you
have a prototype and you make it visible
in your organization you don't hide it
away on just your computer developers
you don't hide it on your computer you
share it with everybody and it becomes a
communal thing that everyone can use
everyone can contribute to it has high
visibility we've actually kind of
started a sort of a phrase we like the
idea the phrase prototypes not
powerpoints because how many times have
you been in a meeting where you saw a
PowerPoint of something you didn't know
about and all of a sudden it's your
responsibility to make that to design it
or develop it and you're just like oh no
you see this this business idea and
you're like oh it would be better if you
were sitting in the meeting and they
show came up and they showed a working
prototype or they handed you a phone
with a working prototype and they said
here try this out this is kind of what
we're thinking for for this new feature
I think it brings a lot more clarity and
a lot more helpful discussions and I'm
actually the the jerk and my company
when people are talking about something
I'll just start building it in a code
pen while they're talking about it
because I don't want to have a
discussion later I don't want a JIRA
ticket later I just want to solve it in
the meeting so that's all I have so
thank you everybody very much for
