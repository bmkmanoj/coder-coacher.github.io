environment where you can be productive
at work right think about that that
space that you carve out for yourself
allows you to do your best work
everybody have something in mind maybe
it looks a little something like this
right you got the noise canceling
headphones on right full cup of coffee
ready to rock and roll no distractions
no nothing life is good right but of
course this isn't how things get done in
the real world right we have to work
with other people we have to talk to
other people right our work is done with
other people for other people right
that means having meetings hovering art
directors right tear sessions code
reviews stand-ups flat candles oh my god
so many slack channels so anyone else so
everyone by that and like crazy yeah so
this is a talk about how we work with
each other how we talk to each other how
we coordinate with each other and how we
collaborate with each other
anybody feeling like their blood
pressure just went up a little bit right
there are all these eternal battles in
the you know in the design and
development world so let's say let's
have a little fun let's hear it for the
Photoshop people yeah come on come on
Photoshop enthusiasts
how about versus the sketch people where
am i sketch people at all right where
are my let's see drupal people have it
like one dude yeah WordPress people
instead all right all righty
ah spaces people cabs people all right
all right so yeah so yeah some of this
stuff is just sort of cheeky personal
preference or whatever but some of these
things have real implications on how
things get done right how work gets put
in front of our end-users like these
things matter and how many people have
ever worked on a project where somebody
was just like ultra jazzed up about
using a certain technology or tool that
that is just sort of like overrode the
rest of the process has that ever been
you so good just do things got published
yesterday we're totally doing that right
so if everyone had their way and we're
all able to sort of pick and choose from
this whole you know platter of stuff you
know you end up in sort of this chaos
right you end up in this this situation
where everything is just you know it's a
free-for-all
you know developer ones using angular
developer twos using react you know this
person is using that tool this person is
using this other tool so that's
obviously anarchy
you know doesn't exactly lead to great
collaboration between teams so okay well
what's the alternative like total
lockdown mode right wherever everybody
is forced into using sort of certain
tools there's certain technologies or
doing things a certain way you know like
rule with an iron fist was a
dictatorship right so so we have the
spectrum all right somewhere in between
complete chaos where everybody's just
allowed to do anything that they want
and then this sort of stifling rigidity
on the other end of the spectrum where
it's like you know your your opinion
doesn't matter at all so so where's your
sweet spot on the spectrum right you and
your team like where does where does
where do you fall in this spectrum and
the answer is going to be different
depending on who's in your organization
how you're set up and stuff like that
but I think that you know what we're
really trying to get at is this
environment where so that everyone
understands the rule they play in the
you know overall project and the overall
organization everyone knows exactly what
they're expected to do what you know how
stuff gets done you know what's what's
considered good work what's considered
bad work and stuff like that right so
good good work happens when when people
know this stuff in the sensors into the
realm of sort of principles and
guidelines and in thinking about this
stuff I think that there's there's a bit
of a hierarchy across the board when it
comes to principles and guidelines and
so start with sort of the the base
company level right a company whatever
company you work at is made up of a
bunch of different people and many of
them have different roles and do
different things right you have you know
marketing department you have a sales
department you might have a digital
department an engineering department
customer support right you have the
executives you have you know accountants
HR people or whatever right and whenever
you open up the door you say okay
everybody let's do business right it's
like okay well you know I'm going to go
and run and do business in the way that
I see fit right like so
but that doesn't all
is you know involve everybody moving in
the right direction it becomes a bit
like the sort of parable of the blind
men and the elephant wherever you know
these blind men approach an elephant and
you know the ones touching the leg and
it's like Oh an elephant's like a tree
and you no one's touching the trunk and
Oh an elephant is like a snake and stuff
like that right nobody has the full
picture and so as a result they sort of
act based on their own perspective of
the organization and of course
especially as organizations get bigger
and bigger it's harder and harder to
sort of see that full picture
so what principles and guidelines do is
sort of help set the stage for what's
expected like what what you should care
about if you work at this company right
you know this takes many forms in the
form of a mission statement right
charity water is a nonprofit
organization bringing clean and safe
drinking water to people in developing
nations boom right that's what we're all
about that's what we're doing right
that's great it's also a little abstract
so so a lot of organizations will take
it a step further and sort of establish
these company values Zappos sort of
famously has these ten core values
deliver Wow through service enhance and
drive change right create fun and a
little weirdness right like these these
principles which of course they go on to
to further articulate help give people
an understanding irrespective of their
role in the organization they this is
how things get done here here's what
here's what we consider to be good
behavior here's what we consider be bad
behavior if you want to get a raise if
you're you know a customer support
person or whatever like these are some
values that you can you know apply to
your specific role in order to you know
really thrive here but of course values
you know oftentimes their aspirational
you know there's a fly the friendly
skies and not going so well maybe I
don't know but so you know a company
cultures is really really important
whenever it started researching this
talk it gets into like weird does this
suit consultant sort of stuff a little a
little too too hard to so it's
little hard to digest some of the stuff
but the one book I read by a guy named
Chris Edmonds he talked about this
notion of having an organizational
Constitution that specifies your team's
purpose values and behaviors these this
idea of sort of like liberating rules
like you basically put these things down
so people know how to how to behave in
certain situations and I actually really
liked that that word liberating rules so
that's sort of the base right everybody
working at a company can follow these
values follow these principles in order
to to you know get aligned so now let's
move into say a marketing department
right something you might work with in a
marketing department it depends on how
your company structured or whatever but
you might have management public
relations and research and digital
people and social people and you know
all sorts of people you know VPS and
CMOS and whatever and again it's like
okay everybody let's do marketing you
know and everybody's going to apply
their own sort of perspective to that so
again we have to establish these
principles and guidelines to say here's
actually what that means here's what
doing marketing here means here's what
communication means for us and this
takes a form of sort of brand guidelines
right so this is going to z' wonderful
brand guidelines around how they use
their logo right what the you know
incorrect usages of their logo is what
the spacing around it is here's what
colors we use here's our neutral palette
here's the sort of you know tints and
tones of this stuff here's our fonts and
how to think about them here's these
pictograms on how we think about that
stuff here's these patterns that we use
throughout our brands materials and
stuff like that so so making this stuff
explicit giving people some guidelines
around how people are expected to
interact with it with your brand
identities is really helpful for anyone
who's communicating on behalf of the
brand the other sort of guidelines that
that work at this level are voice and
tone guidelines MailChimp sort of
famously has voice and tone calm which
is
a fantastic resource but they have this
super strong brand the super you know
clever brand and stuff and they have
these days in their voice and tone
guidelines they articulate how people
are expect to to talk and communicate to
their users in different scenarios right
so they have this very like cheeky fun
you know tone of voice usually and so
you know the idea is oh if a user just
finished a campaign you want to you know
sort of congratulate them and so you say
fine piece of work you deserve a raise
here comes a little chimpanzee dancing
across the screen or whatever that's
great
but you don't want the little dancing
chimpanzee to come across as like oh you
just spam 30,000 users whoopsy right
like that doesn't work so they have to
be explicit with how people are expected
to communicate with their users in
different scenarios then getting up to
the team's level so like teams plural
right so how many people work at
organizations that have like multiple
teams doing like different products or
different parts of a product or
different parts of the site yes like a
lot of people right so now it's the same
situation right okay everybody let's do
websites all right you know everybody's
going to go off in their own direction
and again the angular people and the
react people come out and the Drupal
people come out whatever right so we
have this idea of sort of you know
special snowflake syndrome where you
know whatever you try to to sort of
unify this stuff and get the stuff
together former client of mine said you
know design systems like this whole idea
of like sort of creating a unifying
language for our stuff it's sort of like
public transportation it's a good idea
but not for me you know it's like like
sure yeah I think that you know we
should be on subways and whatever but
it's like you don't understand like I'm
I'm different I need I need a car right
I need I need to drive around and and
have this freedom and stuff so so we
have to overcome that
so again principles and guidelines come
into play to sort of help align
everybody doing websites or doing
web apps or whatever the kids call them
these days and get them all on the same
page and this is the realm of design
systems and thankfully we've seen so
many great examples over the last few
years sales forces lightning design
system you know material design of
course iBM is a carbon design system
this is one that I worked on for a big
enterprise recently but these design
systems and accompanying style guides
sort of help round up you know all the
things that go into doing design and
development at the organization like
this is our sort of official story of
like here's how we do stuff here right
and that includes you know overarching
principles which we'll talk about more
you know high-level UX guidelines like
here's the data display here's how we
you know enter data you know here's how
we think about navigation here's how we
think about color here's our code
conventions right all the way through to
these low-level components right here's
our different form controls here's what
a hero block looks like here's what you
should be thinking about as you're using
this hero block right so we'll talk more
about that in a bit and then we get sort
of further up the pyramid right into an
individual team those individual teams
are made up of different disciplines
right we got a UX designer front-end
people of visual designers QA folks
project managers scrum masters and stuff
like that right and so so again
everybody looks through websites right
let's make this specific website for the
specific application or whatever and
again everybody comes to that with with
a sense of perspective and stuff so once
again these these principles and
guidelines help align everybody and this
is a you know sort of building on that
design system work but it's actually
applying it to a specific application
right so you know if you're making a UI
that's going in front of doctors and
nurse practitioners and things like that
like you're going to have a specific
persona in mind you're going to have
like specific objectives and stuff like
that in mind so you need to come to you
know establish some principles and
guidelines about you know how you're
going to solve their needs
and then lastly at the sort of top of
the pyramid and it gets maybe a
suggestion but you have a bunch of
people working across an organization
that also to do the same thing right so
you got a bunch of front-end people
again front-end people as it turns out
to have opinions about things like
developers have opinions on stuff it's
sort of weird but it happens and again
strong opinions oh my god all right so
everybody else ends up in their own sort
of you know thing wherever they're going
in every which direction so we need once
again principles and guidelines to sort
of help guide the way so what does this
look like this takes the formula sort of
code style guides right there's all
these different you know CSS
methodologies ways to architect
everything you know you have to make
these decisions like is this how we do
it this is how we do it that's how we do
it this how we do it that's how we do it
all right so it's like you have to make
these calls right and come to a
conclusion but once you do that stuff
everyone is aligned everyone knows what
to expect everyone knows what's expected
of them so these sort of five things you
know all sort of work in tandem if
things are set up properly there's sort
of a straight line everything is in
alignment right where the front end
style guides will build upon you know
the underlying design system stuff you
know the the which will build upon the
brand stuff which will build upon
everything else we're really the realm
of design systems is at this sort of
teams and team level right so everybody
doing work everybody doing stuff for an
organization it's really important so
these design systems have really sort of
come on the scene and really solving
some really thorny problems especially
as our digital landscape just keeps
getting bigger and bigger there's more
devices there's more stuff there's more
content there's more pressure to produce
more stuff and less time and all that
stuff shoot it right all that so so
these design systems help us maintain
our sanity as we go down this
laughs right so there's many benefits of
design systems like promoting UI
consistency in cohesion right so not
reinventing the wheel so you have like
50 different button styles or whatever
else Nathan well I'm sure we'll talk
about in a bit but it's like so that's
great and that's the main thing that
gets put in front of the users but if
you get the rest of these benefits right
faster production right shipping more
things faster higher higher quality work
faster establishing a shared vocabulary
so that designers and developers and
project people and you know stakeholders
are all calling the admin bar the admin
bar not the gray top bar or whatever
right making things easier to test
making things you know more responsive
more flexible more performant a useful
reference for the team to come back to
and laying down this sort of foundation
for the team to grow and evolve over
time
all of those other benefits are all team
facing rather than user facing right so
this is these design systems are tools
for us to to use to better communicate
and collaborate with one another so how
do we actually make these happen in my
own work and as sort of a consultant and
going in to different companies to help
them design and build these design
systems is starting with research and
user interviews is a great idea just
because obviously you were you're able
to sort of check the pulse of where the
organization is on their journey to
having a more unified UI language and
you end up with all these great pull
quotes you know you could probably carve
in data our UI is based on what you're
looking at right the main challenge is
the existing thousands of lines of code
acquisitions and existing suite of
technologies that make up the billion
dollars a year we'd like to not lose
that billion dollars fair enough and I
suppose right there's a lot of
institutional knowledge here locked up
in people's heads slack channels are
great but it becomes a scavenger hunt to
find information right for a basic
expand collapse pattern that does spent
two days to go into different teams to
find the code and still have to rebuild
it themselves I am sure might sound
familiar but
so this stuff helps you know establish
these sort of key themes and trends and
really to again guess at what are people
struggling with and how might a design
system help address those issues all
right
and what we do from there is take that
into like a formal kickoff and we do
something called the priorities exercise
which is we basically start off as my
good friend and colleague Josh Clark a
very flattering photo of him he loves it
but this is our friends at about.com
right here in Times Square and sort of
after doing these interviews we sort of
reflect the stuff back like here's some
of the key themes that we hear and we
sort of take these tear sheets and put
them up on the wall and have everybody
in a very democratic way each person
gets about 5 sticky notes to vote on and
we'll sort of stick these up against the
wall right so everybody's going around
they're sort of like silently voting on
this stuff but then we have a
conversation about basically here's what
things are most important to us as a
group right as a team of stakeholders
here's why why this stuff matters and
let's also talk about the things that
didn't get any votes right why didn't
they get any votes and stuff like that
what this does is helps create
priorities right it creates a sense of
of okay if push comes to shove the
design system is really going to have to
nail these three things it's not that
the other things aren't going to matter
at all it's just that we're trying to
get a sense of priority you could do
this with features of the style guide
itself and stuff it's like what features
do you think the style guide should
include in order to be most helpful and
stuff so you could do it with more
tactical stuff as well so this
priorities workshop really helps get
that alignment and sort of that broad
consensus around like yeah we all agreed
as a group in a very democratic way how
we should sort of proceed with us once
we get to the end of that we regroup and
sort of reflect back like okay here's
some of the things that we did you know
here's where we landed on certain things
and here's what we're going to do now
again this is our friends at a Balcom I
like showing this picture just because
it shows like how many people are
involved in this process this isn't just
like three people off in a room making
these decisions on their own it's a very
inclusive process because these are the
people that are going to be affected by
the design system okay so once that
happens you have a sort of a good
direction of sort of what matters what
problems need solved and stuff and what
this translates to ultimately are a set
of design principles Luke Wroblewski
wonderfully articulated the you know
benefits of design principles that
they're the guiding light for any
application right they articulate the
fundamental goals that all decisions
could be measured against and they're
thereby keep the pieces of the project
moving towards an integrated whole right
it helps guide literally every decision
business decision development decision
design decision as you sort of go
through this process of spinning up a
design system what we found in our own
work is that we end up with sort of a
couple sets of principles one are the
design principles that are going to
guide our process as a design system
creators like the people that are
actually putting the stuff together and
then the product itself will sort of
embrace its own sort of design
principles so for a recent project this
is you know sort of where we landed with
with some of our process design
principles right you know we interviewed
tons of dozens of different people this
was an organization that literally
employs eleven thousand developers so we
had like almost none of them front end
people so this idea of just sort of
making it really you know quick and easy
to sort of grab and copy and paste and
go is really important you know making
it scale to different technologies and
stuff like that some of these things are
just sort of general good practices but
some are very specific to the
organization but then the actual product
once we achieved you know we actually
built the thing that
system itself ended up sort of embracing
its own sort of set of design principles
right strong and direct you know not
using a lot of rounded corners and drop
shadows and stuff like that you know
squaring things off solid colors and all
that good stuff and we see this across
many many many different systems right
from operating systems you know - you
know iOS The Hague and all of that stuff
right but these are again the principles
that that undergird every aspect of the
system Jared spool has a really
wonderful stress test for how to create
good design principles and he has these
tests which is great like does it come
from research like are these born of
like you know real issues that people
are facing does it help you say no to
things right does it help you
distinguish you know your design from
your competitors if it's like make it
clean and fast and it clean and simple
clean and simple just make it clean and
simple
how about clean and simple mostly so of
course of course we're going to make it
clean and so right you know is it
something you might reverse in a future
release you know have you evaluated it
is it is it tested is this like actually
you know not just something you're
putting there and ignoring but yeah so
again design principles really do
underpin every decision you're making as
you as you go forth on this and embark
on these projects okay so we have a set
of principles we have needs that we
understand we're going to you know
address before we actually sort of roll
up our sleeves and start building out
components building out cards and
buttons and form inputs and stuff like
that we have to make some decisions
around how we're going to work together
there's a couple different flavors of
that right sort of like the intra
disciplinary stuff right so designers
visual designers working with other
visual designers front-end developers
working with other front-end developers
and then there's the sort of
interdisciplinary stuff right how all
those people work together
group so how many people have used a
Adobe's Creative Cloud libraries in here
you like it there's like a lot there's
like weird like hands it's like mime
says yeah right so it sounds good but
like what this does is like allows you
to extract you know color palettes
typography symbols and all sorts of
stuff and sort of share those across the
team so that's a great way for people
working in those tools to sort of help
you know get a bit closer together so
you let you're not copying and pasting
and using the wrong blue or whatever
anybody play around with figma anyone
familiar with Sigma so figma is sort of
like all that crazy goofy stuff that
Vittel II was just doing with Google
Docs only it's live as a design tool
that's pretty neat so that obviously
puts people in the same document so that
sort of helps what those designers
closer and closer together and hopefully
that means that means less of a
disconnect between designer a and
designer B then there's anybody using
craft by envision I'll play this little
video real quick that's not all oh my
god you can sync your brand and UI
components to the cloud so everyone on
your team has the most current stuff and
if something gets updated everybody has
it
craft also builds style guides for you
with a click
giving unparalleled control over colors
fonts and textiles
change it once see it everywhere that's
not all why are we where will anybody
play that music as you use craft by
envision ah well that's great right you
know again I'm so excited that more and
more people are sort of addressing these
issues this is another tool called brand
AI this does not have electric guitars
but back in our master design document I
can make some design changes to the
analytics plan these changes could just
as well have been made by another
designer on the team they have like spa
when I upload the button to brand a I
choose just that layer this way if other
designers are working on other parts of
the design system I don't have to
overwrite their changes finally back in
Joe's webpage design file you can just
click Add styles and symbols to the
document and the changes I've made to
the button automatically change and
reflect with his new design so there we
go again
it's great to see so many people
starting to tackle these problems
because gone are the days of you know
having to wade through 70 PS DS if the
client goes you know what let's not have
those button corners rounded anymore
right but just even it aboard like sort
of crude sense just some of the more
infrastructural stuff is anyone familiar
with Dan roses wonderful Photoshop
etiquette site definitely check that out
even if you are one of those people that
were screaming for the sketch stuff
because there's just some really good
advice around sort of naming things and
folder structure and all that stuff
these are all important things as you
sort of work with different teams and I
can't tell you how many projects I've
worked on where all of that just goes to
 like immediately so so like
formalize that stuff put that aside and
then and then you know just work that
way from a front-end perspective same
thing applies right you need to make
some decisions of how you're going to
write your front-end code I created
something called the front end
guidelines questionnaire which is a
little questionnaire I do with a lot of
different front-end teams and the the
work that I do and
to consult with and you get all of those
opinionated developers in a room
together and you go through and make
some decisions around like what are the
principles we think of as we write HTML
right what are these things that that
are most important to us is it semantics
is it accessibility is it making sure
that you know you know all of that all
of that stuff spaces their tabs yes you
go there and just again make a decision
and carry on right are you going to use
smack so you're going to use BEM are you
going to use something else right Oh CSS
or whatever what tools are you going to
use to help you write CSS together right
what tools are you going to use in the
JavaScript world right what libraries
are using what are your build processes
like how are people going to get that
stuff does everyone know what that stuff
is all right so again just making these
decisions and not you know jumping down
people throat if they don't know what
that stuff is right but you have to bake
that into the process and get that
alignment we also have to set up as
front-end developers that the
environment that we're going to actually
build these components and build these
pages and build all the pieces of this
system recently I sort of finally I
think found a way to talk about sort of
the the pattern library and design
system sort of you know dev environment
universe I called sort of the workshop
in the storefront so my wife is a
jeweler she runs her own jewelry
business and she has a workshop this is
her workshop this is the space that she
lives in most of her waking hours to
craft things out of metal and experiment
and prototype and break things and you
know blend things together and all of
that right solder with an acetylene tank
and all that stuff right you can see
there's even like patterns and stuff
pretty cool very similar right but this
is the environment that that she is
created
so that she could be productive right in
the work as she's actually creating as
she's actually doing things it's sort of
like a no-nonsense place where she's
everything is within reach you know
things are designed for for her to get
stuff out the door to be creative that
is a much different environment than the
place she's actually showcasing her
final work in presenting it to the other
intended audience right so her website
her Etsy shop that provides all sorts of
different context right here's the name
of this thing here's how much it cost
here's some you know overview
information here's you know what all
what materials went into this here's how
the process was you could learn more
about her write all of this stuff all of
this extra contextual information is
designed to help people hopefully make a
purchasing decision right her Instagram
page is where she showcases her final
work right live shows is where she
showcases her work right so this is a
much these are much different
environments than the place that she's
actually you know rolling up her sleeves
and being productive so in our world
there's over a hundred and three sort of
pattern library and style guide related
tools out there we have to make a
decision on on which tools we're going
to reach for in order to build a style
guide or to build our design system I
work on a tool called pattern lab and
what pattern lab as again I've been
working on this since 2013 and I've
never sort of fully had a good
understanding of sort of how to talk
about it because it always gets clumped
in with like oh it's a style guide told
but not really it's more the workshop
it's the workshop where we design and
build these front-end patterns right
design these UI components like a data
table and we're able to sort of display
those components we're able to put them
into context of of a template right but
then take that a step further and
actually pour real representative
content into those components to make
sure
that they're actually serving the needs
of the organization and the real
specific business use cases as well
right we're able to see like does this
does this hold up whenever we pour this
kind of content in it does this pattern
hold up whenever we put it you know in a
container that doesn't scale the full
width of the page and we put this other
kind of information in it does it hold
up whenever we put really complex
information inside of it does it hold up
on smaller screens as we sort of resize
the browser and fired up on different
devices right so this is again very
similar to my wife's workshop where
she's stress testing thing is she's
prototyping things she's throwing a lot
of stuff against the wall and is
iterating on these things until she
arrives at something that's worth
putting out in the storefront the
storefront then becomes the style guide
where all which is the happy home for
all the ingredients of the design system
right and again this is serving a
different purpose then the environment
you're actually creating things in right
so here we're not saying here's the
table and here's how to build it it's
more here's the table and here's how you
implement it right here's the code
snippets for for getting at that table
code here's the usage here's how we want
you to think about responsive design
with respect to data tables here's how
we want to think about data to add
density here's all the different class
names and what those all are and which
ones are required and stuff like that so
these are this is a different use case
meant for the people who are ultimately
going to be reaching for these patterns
and using them and injecting them into
their own applications so we see it as
sort of this thing right where pattern
library or whatever dev environment sort
of setup you have whether it's fractal
or like something else there's there's a
bunch of tools out there right and then
sort of the we found that just sort of a
grunt or gulp sort of copy task is
serves as the delivery track to sort of
feed that stuff into a style guide where
then the you know the manager the store
is able to go back into the inventory
room and decide which things
we decided to show two to the actual
users of the design system so pattern
labs been around for a while and again
like I'm not here it's open source toy
or whatever but it's sort of neither
here nor there it's just the one that
I'm familiar with but use use your tool
of choice from a style guide perspective
we didn't have that piece of the puzzle
in place so we add the build one so just
like maybe like a week and a half or two
weeks ago launched this thing which is
called the style guide guide which is
basically a shell like a vanilla shell
for a style guide so it has like basic
information architecture for like here's
a getting started page here's like our
you know guidelines overview page here's
our design principles page of course
like you have to fill in the blanks and
replace all the you know design and code
for yourself or whatever but the idea is
it sort of gives you a shell gives you a
starting point so if you want to check
that out you find that here okay so now
we're finally ready to work you know the
intra disciplinary part everybody has
their tools set up everybody's sort of
you know has an understanding of how
they're going to write code how they're
going to design together but then
there's the sort of interdisciplinary
part of it and this is the part that's
historically been pretty hard because
this is the you know the the former
waterfall process of like ooh I'm done
with design right have fun
asshole right and of course this process
you know doesn't not always lead to the
best results I like to say how many how
many designers in the room have ever
been ashamed to put a live link to the
website because you're like that's not
what I design yeah right so how to least
that's not good right so this how many
people just like had a heart attack like
you're looking at this stuff
right like that these days of like
trying to go in and sort of sort this
stuff out right so how do we work
together as a team how do we collaborate
more there's a bunch of different
techniques and tactics
to quickly walk through the this notion
of design tokens which was really
popularized by Salesforce in their
lightning design system basically what
these design tokens are are these sort
of abstracted properties so if you have
if you work at Starbucks and you have
you know internal communications you
have native apps you have a marketing
site you have an intranet you have a
product they're all using Starbucks
green right how do you ensure that
everybody is going to be using Starbucks
green without resorting to the
eyedropper and stuff so this is where
these design tokens really come in to
sort of serve as this sort of technology
agnostic source of truth for these
variables right it's Starbucks green in
the abstract and you could apply this to
all sorts of different properties right
background colors type colors font
families font sizes all of that stuff
right and tools like brand a I allow you
to sort of round up and provide a GUI
for managing that stuff so you might
have brand colors with you know brand
green neutral palettes and stuff like
that here's what fonts we use here's our
headings here's our you know our icons
with stars and rocket ships and poop
emojis or whatever and then all the way
through to you know border radius and
spacing defaults and stuff like that
right so it's nice to have this thing
what's cool about this tool is that it
beans those things it can export those
things and integrate into tools like
sketch and slack and you know sort of
exporting it as SAS variables or less
variables or even into tools like
PowerPoint or Microsoft Office and stuff
so just sort of show real quick what
that looks like
so if I have all of my design tokens
sort of identified here and I have okay
here's my primary heading in brand AI
and I have a sketch file and they have a
little plugin or whatever so if I wanted
to come over and then there's my primary
heading in pattern lab and if I make a
change to that thing I'm going to change
it to gray or or brown or whatever it's
already there
think that to the document it gets those
updated styles I run my command that
pulls it down from there from their
source and then rebuild pattern lab and
then go back over into the browser
basically these get exported as like
mix-ins or whatever and so it's cool
because boom there you go right so
you're sort of managing this stuff all
in one place so that helps sort of
bridge that gap between design and
development and sort of like maintain
this stuff in one place recently air B&amp;amp;B
release their new tool that basically
takes their codebase and then back fills
it into sketch which means that people
in sketch the designers and sketch could
be building things and using the actual
real react components sort of to design
within inside of sketch and that's
pretty cool because that again it keeps
a single source of truth and then that
means that the design team can sort of
confidently work with those designs and
sort of play around and pipe in
different data to make that stuff work
so there's great tools out there but
it's true that even in 2017 there's
still this stuff this nonsense
lots of medium articles I found publish
websites directly from scratch from
sketch no coding needed oh thank god
right translating a visual design to a
CSS and HTML is now a mundane task of
the pass right the responsibility for
all things UI is back in the hands of
designers we don't have to talk to those
commodity developers anymore
thanks God right so you know no tool or
tactic is going to substitute actual
human collaboration in communication and
in my own work we did a redesign for
TechCrunch a few years ago my work with
Dan Maul involved like him sort of
sketching things up like this inside of
Photoshop or whatever but me sort of
building an adjacent HTML prototype and
then us working together to sort of you
know massage this stuff into place and
arrive at
at a solution that looks good but also
you know is responsive is performant as
accessable displays the true color in
the to text rendering and all of that
stuff shows interactivity and all that
stuff so it's not one or the other it's
both of these things and designers and
developers working together to take
something from like a stupid you know
HTML prototype that can be done in like
literally two minutes and sort of evolve
in that design into something that that
the whole team is happy with it's the
sort of process of designing and
building and communicating and
collaborating with one another in order
to sort of get things into the final
environment much faster and yes this
means that sometimes that we end up
leapfrogging over these tools that we
spent a long time mastering right if you
could go have a component library in
place do whiteboard sketch and build
that out in HTML like five minutes later
that's great right because I really want
your your brain as a designer I don't
necessarily need your artifacts I want
all of your great thinking I want your
you know aesthetic sensibility I want
your us UX sensibilities so
communication and communication really
beat deliverables it's all right so I
hope you find your place on the spectrum
I hope you're able to sort of establish
these principles and guidelines at your
own organization and I think that you
know as time goes on the world is a
crazy place or whatever it's like I do
think that we need to actively and
intentionally find you know this common
ground for us to stand on right we have
more in common than we have you know
that's different we just have to seek
out those common human principles and
and find that common ground in order to
do great things together so if you're
interested in all this sort of design
system stuff learning more about
collaboration communication stuff like
that we wrote a book called atomic
design with that thank you very much for
your time
