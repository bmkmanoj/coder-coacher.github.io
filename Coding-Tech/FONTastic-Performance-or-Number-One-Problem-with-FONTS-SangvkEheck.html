run into this thing that Zack Leatherman
calls the Mitt Romney problem so in the
last election there was a conversation
whether Mitt Romney was going to run for
election or not and then slate had this
article where they were announcing the
decision of whether he was gonna run for
president or not and somebody tweeted
that you know how you load your fonts
actually matters because on a slow
connection you would see this for a
little bit that he is in fact running
for president and that's because the
browser was waiting to download the
italic font and tell you he's actually
not running for president but if you're
the slow connection I feel like three
seconds you'd be like he is running
wait he isn't which is the number-one
problem with the web funds and the
reason why this is happening is that
this particularly thing is called a
flash of invisible text or a fight we
also have a different kind of problem
which is the flash of unstyled text and
that is when we see something in a
fallback font and then suddenly
awesomely it appears in the correct font
and that's called a flash of unstyled
text so fight and Affeldt and you can
get both of these in the same
application and the same time you're
running it because of how web fonts get
rendered and that's because the browser
Chrome or Firefox all of them have
incredibly many opinions but in
particular incredibly many opinions
about fonts and how they should be
loaded and these are opinions we've
acquired over the years that come with
like emotional and historical baggage
but it is what it is
they have opinions and we have to
understand them in order for us to
optimize our sites when you load a page
you go to an index.html your browser
goes and fetches that bunch of HTML and
CSS and whatever and returns it back and
then starts working on it
so the parser will start look at it the
start crunching it and the first thing
of interest the person might find is
that style sheet import that you have
where we download we think we download a
font from google fonts and it's gonna go
and fetch that and it's gonna like wait
a little bit style sheets in particular
are what we call render blocking so
we're not actually gonna paint anything
on the screen until we get CSS back and
that's because the last time that you've
had CSS fail on a page the alternative
is so horrifying
like you just get a lot of like unstyled
text and everything into a lot of sites
that isn't acceptable so the browser's
have agreed that we will block while
you're downloading CSS because we really
need to return that CSS back so you're
gonna get the stylesheet back and you're
gonna be like sweet a whole bunch of fun
face definitions and you're gonna see
that they're split up depending on you
know bold fonts or non phones for
regulars or whatever so we have this and
then the browser keeps crunching any key
scruncho key was crunching and then goes
uh huh and you think somebody wants to
use Roboto on this page and here is
really shocking and awful think about
web fonts until this point the browser
hasn't actually downloaded your web font
all it has is the fact that there is a
font face definition for that font but
doesn't have the font file which means
that at this point you could have been
rendering some text and the browser
would have been like oh I need to
do it in Roboto but I may or may not not
actually have robot on the page and this
is where we start getting into that
flash of invisible and unstyled text
because the browser does not have the
font so whenever you write your whenever
you write your Styles just remember that
just because you think you have a font
doesn't actually mean you have the font
that's like the dirty secret about web
fonts
so what its gonna do now that it's seen
the fact that you need Roboto is going
to go ahead and download it we don't
want to do extra downloads so this is
when we actually start downloading that
font file and here is where we run into
the sort of font life cycle like the
life of a web font because here at this
point in time we may remain on however
borrow we might have Roboto on disk you
may have installed it locally it may be
like a local font which is great you may
have it in the front cache if you've
been to this page again the browser was
like I'm gonna cache all of your fonts
because I know the disaster that's gonna
happen next time you go to this page so
you may have Roboto if you have it
amazing we're gonna render in Roboto
it's going to be beautiful if we don't
have Roboto we go into a Kris hinted ad
which is the block period and the names
are kind of really confusing here
because this block period is not like
the CSS block period when we're blocking
different things here which is blocking
painting of that particular font so
we're gonna take all the text that we
would normally paint on screen and make
invisible in this depending on what
browser you in has a different link it
could be zero it could be three seconds
it could be infinity amazing and then
after a while the rows are gonna be like
hey do I have Roboto yet and here the
font may have come back if you're in a
fast connection you definitely would
have downloaded a fun way now in which
case if you do amazing we're gonna
render it but if we don't we go into
what we call the swap fate or what I
like to call the we render things in the
fallback font which is we're gonna go
down the font stack that you saw it this
morning and we're gonna pick the next
fallback that mean think we have usually
it's like in this example it's the
default sans-serif we know you have it
it's like Arial or Helvetica great so
we're gonna paint in that and then after
a while if we still don't get Roboto if
we never actually get this Roboto file
we if we get it we render but if we
don't we going to the fail state and
this is basically the same thing as if I
woulda fat-fingered Roboto and written
like Roboto of one that doesn't exist
you're never gonna get that file it's
gonna fail in that case but basically at
some point the browser is gonna like
give up one waiting for this font and in
reality it looks a little bit weird so
this is a video we wait for a font three
seconds have passed we ran on that
fallback font and then we switch this
isn't a non typical example I discovered
that I was upset about what finds when I
went to Taiwan and I had to G because I
was roaming and basically every single
site that I visited looks like this
every site that I visit in Europe when I
roam is basically this a bunch of
nothing and then a bunch of ugly
something and then a bunch of like the
slightly fancier Roboto that you wanted
to display things in my favorite part of
this video is this thing at the
beginning where you see phantom
underlines and that's because when we
paint the invisible text we literally
just paint the text invisible any text
decorations like bullets or in text we
don't care the underlines on lakes
aren't text we don't care so we leave
these like artifacts that are around the
text but the text itself is invisible so
you'll see like all these bullets just
hanging into ghost air and doing nothing
that's the block period it's terrible so
that's a flash of invisible text it's
all
waiting for usually about three seconds
and then the flash of unstyled text is
once we've given up waiting for this
font for a little bit and we want to
show something to your user at this
point you go or I definitely did I have
a revolutionary idea to fix web fonts
what if we just do away with this blog
period right what if we just like never
show invisible text that's clearly like
what you should do and here a story so I
sit next to people that have been around
the web for a long time and can tell me
these like stories about like what
happened in the world to make it so that
it is like this today in particular
fonts are kind of interesting what funds
haven't been around for their entire
life we originally got fonts because
somebody named Dave David Hyatt used to
work on WebKit and he was building
something called iBook though I
understand it and I book was basically a
way for you to read books online when
you read books there types it in a font
and matter as what type would find here
typesetting things in so he wanted to
load a web font which is great but it
makes no sense to see any fallback text
like if I have a book in Garamond and I
buy it from a book store I'm not gonna
like flip the pages in some some of them
are in Garan ones some of them are like
or any aerial all of them are in
Garamond so initially this block period
was actually infinite because we really
really really really wanted to get that
web font right and actually safari until
last year had a block period of infinity
which means if you are god bless you on
a 2g connection waiting for a web fund
you would look at nothing for a long
time especially the fund was a big file
so at some point browser engineers were
like okay this is a little bit on the on
the weird side surely we should show
something to the user and then they
agreed that three seconds might be
better the reason why can't be zero
seconds is that after being infinity for
so long it would be very weird for
brands for example to start getting this
like instant flash of fallback text
going back to The New Yorker
imagine if the New Yorker because the
font isn't in the cache yet before you
saw the New Yorker branded logo you
would see it unlike Arial first and then
it would flip to the New Yorker for a
brand awareness that's really weird
so three seconds was a compromise which
is like we really hope we're gonna get
the font if you don't we'll deal with it
later so those are that the historical
reason for having these problems
that doesn't really help us with our
performance right it's not magically has
fixed our performance so let's talk
about it there's two way the two things
that we can do we can fix our point the
invisible text or fix our fout be the
unstyled text having no text at all is a
way worse user experience and having
ugly text so we're gonna spend all of
our time fixing the invisible text
because if you're like a news
distribution site or something you want
to get content out your whole job is to
get content out to the user so however
form that is that should be our priority
obviously the first thing that he can do
is just not use web fonts you know what
is faster than a web font no web font at
all so this is a thing that you may want
to consider for things like body text it
doesn't really matter like it doesn't
really matter that you want to display
things in a slightly prettier sans-serif
then the user normally has most of like
half of the audience probably has a Mac
Helvetica is a nice alternative the
other half of the audience probably has
a Windows machine Arial is a perfectly
nice alternative there's a lot of users
who install local fonts so if you really
want to use your Botto you can say use
your Botto but only if it's locally
available those are perfectly acceptable
decisions especially if you just want to
display just body text github for
example doesn't use any web fonts at all
and it's amazing and it still looks
pretty the thing that you if you really
want to use a web font because you've
really committed to this idea of like
branded text you need to like shake off
some of this weight because web fonts
are files that we download the smaller
the file the better it is and the first
thing that like obviously comes to mind
is just download fewer things waft you
you heard this morning it's like the
best it's the best format for a font
it's the smallest it's like a 30% of the
size of a regular non lofty font it's
available on everything but I eat 11 I
11 has one you can use that as a
fallback this is amazing the next thing
is to download even fewer things you
might not want the entire font a lot of
funds have all of the characters for all
of the languages and all of the
punctuation if you just need to display
a particular string of text you just
need the letters for that particular
string of text
and that's what Unicode ranges and you
saw this is morning Christmas talk but
this is like a way to performance the
next thing you want to do is just
download things earlier because remember
the browser doesn't actually know that
we need this file until it sees a
selector that uses this particular font
so one of the things that are now like
coming to the browsers and it's a new
spec is this idea of a preload which is
basically a hint from us to humans to
the browser that it's like even though
you don't believe me browser I promise
you I'm gonna need this font I really
promise you I know you're gonna like not
believe me for a while but eventually
you'll see that I'm right
and in this case we put our preload at
the beginning and we say browser please
down with this font so that by the time
you figure out you needed you actually
have it the problem with preload of
course is that you if you preload
everything in your application because
you can preload scripts and images and
links and other things if you preload
everything in your application then like
now your application has to download all
of these things that the browser spent
like 20 years trying to optimize so
don't preload everything just preload
things that you are really really really
crucial like fonts the other thing that
you can use as font face observer and
fundraiser observer is a tiny little
library written by Bram Stine it's like
5 K and the idea is basically that you
will in your JavaScript hands take the
power away from the browser to decide
this block and swap a period so you
basically decided yourself and the way
we do this is that normally if we don't
use any of these things we would put our
web font let's say on the body in this
case and then the browser would be like
sweet I need to like block and swap and
do that dance from before instead what
we're going to do is do that in a class
in a selector and I in our body in the
default state we're just going to render
things in the fallback font so at this
point we basically decided that we are
not going to have a blog period whatever
the browser wants to do with that it
doesn't matter because we no longer use
that web font up front we're going to
paint things in the fall back in the
fallback font and then we're gonna write
a little bit of JavaScript that goes
like this
hey font face observer you go ahead and
wrote that load that Roboto font and
when you're ready you're gonna give me a
promise and I can do things so you're
gonna get a promise back when that font
is actually ready and you can do things
like
switch now like do those this switch
manually to use the Roboto font you can
also be a little bit smarter here and
see how long it took from for the
requests to come back if it was
something like twelve seconds maybe
don't relay out the userÃ­s page because
there probably you know a couple pages
down it's reading your blog post and
your new fancy Roboto isn't gonna make a
difference at that point this library is
awesome if it's if you don't remember
anything from this dock just remember
fun face observer will call it like it
will solve 50% of your problems but
their thing that I really want to do as
somebody who works with browsers and on
browsers is that I want the browser to
let me let me do that not like me to use
somebody else's JavaScript library
because the job of the browser is to
make your life as developers easier and
if it doesn't do that then we have a
problem and that's fine display so fine
display optional is a new thing that's
coming it's a spec it's being
implemented I think it's in Chrome and
Firefox and not Safari but Safari just
put it in technical preview I think
which is amazing because fun display is
what you actually want it's how you get
to control how your fonts get loaded you
control that block in swap period and
their durations and it goes like this
amazing so it's a descriptor so you put
it on the font face and it basically
says this is a font
it's available in weight 800 it's called
Roboto and you control how how it gets
loaded fine display block is the default
it's also Auto because we need default
font if a block is what current browsers
do except for ie 11 which i think is
does swap which is the next one so again
like before we show things in an
invisible text for 3 seconds and then if
we have the font we render it if not we
show a fallback font for as long as it
takes for a font to actually comes back
and after infinity time or 10 minutes or
whatever usually like 5 seconds if we
get the web font we're gonna display it
in the web form this is the current
behavior that works like this in all
browsers where you would use one display
block when it's very swap is different
than that and then you would use one
display block for things where a
fallback doesn't really make sense so
like an icon font or
a very particular branded string like
the CNN logo or the New Yorker logo or
something like that
but if I swap it's different than that
because it has no block period
it's that genius idea that I had where I
was like let's do away with it and now
you can with fun display swap you would
use this if content is your main goal
for this font if it's body text or like
something that you really need the user
to look funny spy swap instantly
switches to the fallback font doesn't
show any invisible text does that for
however long it takes for the way fun to
come back and then when the web fun
comes back it switches that around which
is cool but it's not perfect
fine display fallback is a little bit in
between these two because it has a very
short block period it has something like
100 milliseconds 100 milliseconds is
just enough to get it from the font
cache but no longer than that you don't
actually get to download a font in a
hundred milliseconds the browser just
gets to be have I seen this fun before
yes cool sweet there it is that's all
you get to do so after 100 milliseconds
you've been invisible for this time if
you don't have the fund you render it in
the fallback font for about three
seconds and then you get the web font
when the reason why I say it three
seconds is that if the font takes longer
than three seconds to download so let's
say three seconds and a half we don't
actually switch to this Web point we're
going to be in this fallback font for
the rest of your pages life which is
great but it's still a little bit not
great because three seconds is enough
free to like read on mobile about a page
of text and then you've scrolled and
then the font does a little rejigger
again so that could be an odd experience
but it might be a thing that you want
but here we go fun display optional the
magical promise of the future so it has
the same 100 milliseconds blog period
which is if I have the font go ahead and
use it and then if I have the web font
I'm going to paint the page in the web
font this is the ideal scenario
everything has gone right but if I don't
have the web font I'm going to paint the
page in the fallback font but never
switch to the web font which means that
the moment you get text on screen you
always have the text on screen you don't
do a page relay out you don't repaint
things you don't move around in the page
because your headers suddenly got bigger
you don't have this flash of unstyled
text and you have any
a small flash of block text of invisible
text for that time when we're getting
these from the cache this is why this is
amazing if you need if you need it for
like a content this is the perfect one
because you always get content out so
that's great take pictures of this this
is your summary page the way this looks
like in practice and this is gonna be a
really confusing video I have it just to
show that like it works fun displayed on
glitch dot me is where this actual demo
lives but here I have three different
kinds of different kinds of fonts and
here I basically have a server that
depending on the request is throttles it
so it simulates a very slow connection
or a very slow downloaded font there is
low at the top very fast at the bottom
so like a regular Wi-Fi really shitty 3G
and what you're gonna see in the demo is
that I'm basically displaying the words
blocks WAP fallback and optional and
you're gonna see them come at different
times what I want you to notice though
fun display optional being the awesome
one you get like text instantly so I'm
gonna fall back we're weird in the
medium one cuz you're like a sweet I
started reading go no everything's
different now
life is hard that's what fungus boy does
go ahead and play with it it's really
great support is if you at the moment
but it's coming where it's it's a thing
that everybody wants because it's the
first thing that actually lets you
control how if funds get loaded so we're
good we've minimized our invisible text
if the browser helps us great we have
fun display we've done that one if the
browser doesn't help us we have fun face
observer which is JavaScript not great
but at least we get to control it we've
nailed this invisible text the next
thing that we have to do is the unstyled
text right because nothing here really
prevents us other than fun display
optional from having this like jarring
change between your fallback text and
your actual web font and here then you
only you can only do manual things you
basically have to match your funds so
that they're sort of similar and the the
difference isn't that big and this trick
actually comes from tim brown who was
amazing and was like these would be two
fonts a fallback font and a the sign
just came in fallback font and a web
font and if you put them on top of each
other
they don't look at the same one of one
of the strings is clearly longer if you
have a lot of text they're gonna wrap in
two new lines that's gonna cause a
complete like relay all things are gonna
jump around it's not ideal but you can
do however is trying to match the
heights and the widths and the spacing
between the letters you can decrease the
letter spacing on your fallback font
you're trying to get your fallback font
to look like your web one so you can
increase the font size or decrease the
font size adjust the spacing between the
letters so that these two strings start
looking the same start having the same
shape because then the difference is
very tiny when you're switching this is
really annoying to do manually so I
built this tool called font style matter
which is does basically that loads all
of the for any font that you want from
the Google web fonts and then lets you
adjust these properties and it goes like
this at the bottom you can see it
flashing so the initial difference is
pretty big and then you can start
adjusting the size usually the letter
spacing is the one that's the most
important and when you're done with it
you can like see the colors like paint
them in different colors to see the
difference but at the end the unstyled
flash is very small there's a very small
difference between these fonts so it's
not actually that jarring the felt is
not really a big deal if you actually
try very hard to manage your funds so
that's cool that's a tool you can use it
alright we can now safely use web fonts
we've solved all of us with ones
problems we know how to load them really
fast we load how to like not have a
block of invisible text we know how to
make it less cheering let's go to town
with web fonts we are ready because you
can actually do fun things with both
ones once you don't have performance
problems the first thing is icon fonts
and this isn't exciting we've had icon
of phones forever
but I found a new way to do a confluence
which is kind of exciting this is a
ligature you saw out on Chris's talk the
ligature is basically two things that
together look at differently if I always
look terrible if you've noticed PT Paolo
has three ligatures which is I think a
record number of ligature isn't a string
I am delighted by them it's beautiful
it'll of ligature is a trestle you can
use ligatures for icon fonts which is
kind of amazing so imagine if you had a
ligature for the word settings you don't
actually have a glyph for s and
and TNT they don't make sense by
themselves but together the word
settings is a ligature and the glyph for
that ligature is the gear and that's how
the material design icons work which i
think is kind of amazing you know long
we need to do these like class hacks or
you're like I have to put the right
class and then somebody need to swept
the class and like define all of my
fonts in a class descriptor or anything
like that you just use ligatures which
we have in funds this is what they're
there for
it's kind of awesome really exciting and
if you don't have the web fund your
fallback says settings which makes sense
great for accessibility killer the other
thing is that you should of course write
your own fonts why not
why just let it to type designers and
letter is just make your own finds it's
really fun all you have to do is draw
some that you want display on the
screen and then nothing else that's all
you have to do because there are tools
for this fantastic Donny is a site that
lets you basically upload SPG's or
images for any of the letters you want
to show so in this place case because
I'm obsessed with emoji I made an emoji
font that looks like the first ever
emoji font from 1999 I liked
painstakingly drew nine by twelve SVG is
like 144 of them and then I uploaded
them and they match to the exact code
glyphs the code points that regular
emoji do so here is the same string of
text rendered in the apple emoji or
entered in my font that's kind of cool
now I can use like these weird pixelated
emoji why not make your own maybe you
have like opinions about emoji go ahead
and do it the thing that you notice here
though is that like you saw on Chris's
talk the Apple emoji is a color font and
my emoji is a really boring web boring
black and white fun because we don't
know how to do colors but color phones
are exciting I don't know how to use
them but they're awesome so maybe one
day I will this is a fun piece called
Gilbert which is really cute this says
the word pride in different languages
find your language it's probably up
there if not it's on the site and even
though you can't control the color of
this you can't say color right on this
it looks pretty if it makes sense for
your site maybe you want to design your
own color font that matches your brand
it's not really a shareable thing but
that's a cool thing that you can do this
only works in Firefox right now because
of
horrific reasons you don't actually want
to know and they have to do with you can
write fonts in four different ways and
the only work on some platforms and
browsers are really hard but you can use
them on Firefox and you can see them
live and kind of fun to play around with
variable funds are literal sorcery and
you saw them this morning animating but
you can do you like crazy awesome things
with them so the premise behind a
variable fund and the reason why you
should get excited about it is because
it's actually good for performance is
that if you have a regular font you need
to download several files you need to
download Roboto and Roboto condensed if
you want them to be like skinnier in
together you need to download it for
like wait a hundredweight 400 wait 900
if you want to display it and wait 700 a
file that you didn't download the
browser's gonna be like oh it 400
is close enough it's gonna do that it's
annoying you have like six files here
that you need to download variable funds
or magic because you basically have one
file and they just like magically
interpolate all of these widths and
Heights and do you want wait 120 you can
have wait 120 there's no one's stopping
you the way you use them is with fun
variation settings which is like a
cryptic list of strings and values that
the fun designer hopefully has
documented somewhere because otherwise
good luck finding out what they are
this forum still part all of these demos
that I'm gonna show you are from the
access practice site watch them in
chrome stable or canary or Safari on the
Mac so here I'm adjusting the height of
the letters and the width of the letters
and it's cool okay in one file that I
can control what it looks like it gets a
little bit more exciting for things like
this font which is where we go back to
the wild wild west
we can add decorations to the font I can
change those X's I can add little
bullets in the letters I can you know
modify the concavity of the hooves and
stuff like that I can create different
fonts as I want but I've only downloaded
one file this is kind of amazing for
designers who have very strong opinions
about brand fonts and want very
different things from the same fund but
now you don't have to create like 17
files you just have the one get ready my
favorite example
oh sure this one exposes like other
cryptic letters like concavity probes
the things from there yeah I have no
idea how will you find out these values
like I had to inspect in the and the
chrome inspector be like oh I see it's
far very good anyway the next one is
icon fonts so to animate icons it's kind
of a pain but if the designer actually
puts things like motion and size look at
the next one where hold on the moon and
the biker are gonna start moving
isn't that amazing
isn't that an awesome thing that's the
future these are my favorite links about
web fonts Rammstein just recently wrote
the web font handbook which is like the
Bible if you care about with funds
that's where half of his things in the
talker here yeah this is where you take
photos Zac Leatherman has written every
single blog post about web fonts that he
will ever need to use and Helen and Jake
have amazing posts so that's it use your
web finds fun and performing way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
