already put my slides up online so if
you want to check out the Meetup event
there's a link to where you can download
and view the slides if you want to cheat
and run ahead of this presentation this
is me I'm a senior front-end developer
at imp rays I have a background and
back-end dev as well I've done a lot of
different presentations at different
conferences so I like speaking speaking
at meetups and in other technical
settings and I'm here on behalf of my
company in praise we're hiring we're
desperately trying to find more
front-end developers so if you're
interested in the job or you're
interested in what I have to here in
what I have to say today and you think
you might want to work on it let me know
so the basic problem that we were trying
to solve when building this project was
that our website sends a lot of email
and the way that our website works is we
have a very spiky load on our emails so
the way so in praise is a system that
helps companies manage performance
reviews and typically we want to send
out reminders for everyone in the
company to say hey you've got you know
48 hours left to submit your review hey
you've got 24 hours left you've got 4
hours left go to the website and
actually do your review please so what
that means is every so often we go from
0 email sent to a couple hundred or
thousand emails sent as quickly as
possible because these are notifications
and they are time sensitive well we
don't actually do the email sending
ourselves we do need to render the HTML
that goes into each of these emails so
that the people receiving the email sees
their name and the information related
to their review and it got to the point
that our back-end servers were getting
bogged down by so much HTML and text
that they needed to render for these
emails so what was a good solution to
having a spiky workload we decided to
check out AWS lambda and see how we
could harness the power of lambda to
scale up and down very very seamlessly
the next question was what do we
actually run on lanta and the front end
team at our company decided why don't we
check out react why don't we try running
react on the server side in order to
render the HTML for these emails so the
nice thing about that was it's a
familiar technology we're already using
it in praise it's a familiar use case
because basically rendering HTML is what
front
development frameworks are all about so
it's already well tuned for this use
case and of course because it's
JavaScript we have access to the entire
NPM ecosystem and we could pull down
lots of different tools that would help
us out also as was mentioned earlier
this is like the hips turist of hipster
technologies so we figured why not see
just how far we can push the envelope so
we came up with this project that we're
calling react mail merge and it is
open-source you can go on github right
now check out the project clone it play
around with it and so on some people
might be thinking so what's with the
name well any of you who were around in
the battle days before email got to be
super popular there was a process in
Microsoft Word called a mail merge where
you'd link up your address book with a
form template in Microsoft Word that had
forms for like a first name and address
and so on and it linked these two
together and create for you a couple
hundred different copies of a letter
that's almost the same but has
information from the address book for
each person so it's sort of like what
we're trying to do here this project is
not actually delivering emails it's just
putting together the HTML to do so plus
it's way retro and we've decided that
everything old is apparently new again
because tech keeps on reinventing the
wheel over and over and over but that's
inside conversation anyway so how does
this project actually work its first of
all it's more of a set of guidelines
than a reusable framework we don't
really have a project that you can plug
your own code into but the way that the
code is we've written it so far works is
we have one lambda function per email
template now this means that your email
templates can be as flexible or as
inflexible as you want them to be so for
example we have an email template for
inviting users to our platform we have
an email template for letting them know
that they've joined the group and so on
but we also have one email template for
all the different reminders that we send
whether it's a four-hour reminder or a
24 hour or 48 hour or one week reminder
or whatever we all use the same template
for that so you can be as flexible as
you want we have an API exposed so that
you can invoke this temp
with structured data mail-merge does
data validation to make sure that the
data that's being passed is exactly
what's needed to render the template and
you're not missing anything important
like oh the name of the person who were
sending the email to then it renders the
email templates both HTML and text and
you can either pass it a single set of
data for a single person or you can pass
an array of data for every single user
that needs to receive one of these
emails then it takes the results of that
rendering and passes it along to your
mail delivery service we happen to use a
company called postmark but you could
customize this to use whatever mail
delivery service you want and it gets
any errors that might occur from the
process of sending the emails from the
mail delivery service and logs them and
returns them to our back-end that's
calling mail merge as well so there were
a couple of benefits that we wanted to
get out of this project like being able
to deal with spiking workloads but there
were also a couple of unexpected
benefits that we found along the way and
briefly those are using storybook for
mail preview finding out that fixing the
email copy using this project was
surprisingly simple using JSON schema as
documentation for our back-end
developers having robust localization
and internationalization support and
also being able to do continuous
deployment via our CI system so what all
those means first let's start with
storybook I don't know if any of you are
familiar with this really handy project
called storybook but basically what it
allows you to do is to take a component
that you've written or a section of your
code and display it in a way that's very
friendly to see and easy to modify so in
this case we've set up storybook with a
bunch of our different email templates
and we've added in some basic
information that you can use to render
the information as well so we're using
this plugin called storybook knobs so
you can put in the base URL that you
want the links to go to the username
that you want to show up on in that
email and a couple of other pieces of
information as well it's really easy to
change it's really easy to instantly
type in a different name type in a
different group name and so on and see
how your email is going to look with
that new information now as an aside
email HTM 8h
email is awful and just because
something displays properly in in the
latest version of Google Chrome does not
mean that it's going to display properly
in an ancient version of Microsoft
Outlook so you have to do more
validation than just checking in
storybook but this is a good start
another unexpected benefit that we found
was easy copy edits you're all familiar
with react you're all familiar with the
JSF with the JSX
syntax essentially it looks more or less
like HTML and we found that people at
our company who were not developers but
already knew HTML were able to
understand what was going on in our
email templates and to very easily make
copy changes so if we found that a word
was misspelled or there was some
phrasing that was a little bit awkward
or something like that the product
managers and product owners didn't have
to wait for the developers to get
started on this they could actually make
their own pull requests to the
repository and this happened multiple
times which was really cool because it
meant that the developers the developers
could focus on the more difficult deeper
problems and the people who wanted to
focus more on exactly how the emails
were written and how they were displayed
could focus on that very easily as well
we also use JSON schema to validate the
data coming in to our lambda function so
this serves two purposes one it makes
sure that the templates that we're using
receive the data that they need in order
to render properly for example if you
have a reminder email that is supposed
to remind someone about an upcoming and
event but the data that gets sent to
react mail emerge it doesn't have any
information about that event you're not
going to be able to generate an email
that's actually meaningful to send off
to the user so we use the schema
validation to make sure that whatever
the backend is passing is actually
meaningful and has the correct structure
but in addition we found an extra
unexpected benefit here which is that
the people who are writing the backend
of our software the people who needed to
actually integrate with AWS lambda we're
able to use these schema files as a form
of living documentation so they could
simply read the JSON schema file
and see exactly which information the
lambda function was requiring and the
format that it was requiring it in JSON
schema is a pretty readable standard and
you can learn more about it on the
website we were using a library called a
JV to handle the validation it also does
really nice error messages which is
important we also do localization in our
emails because we need to be able to
display information such as dates and
times in a way that is robust and works
for lots of different users and if you
don't think that this is important then
you've probably never had to deal with
the user time zones before we have users
all over the world and all of them
expect to see notifications in their
native locale it doesn't help someone
who's living in Europe to see the date
that the date and time that an event is
closing if that time is in the u.s. time
zones or vice versa everyone wants to
see information in their own local time
zone so that's why it's important to be
able to have information about your time
zone fortunately there's a really handy
library called format jeaious which
handles localization and reactive really
smoothly I was shocked to find that it
was by Yahoo I didn't know that Yahoo
was still doing cool stuff these days
but apparently they are and lastly we're
doing continuous deployment as well
because lambda is very easy to deploy
new versions of functions on - and very
easy to test as well by having lots of
different functions destroyed deployed
in staging services as well we're using
a system called apex to manage how we
upload and deploy all of our functions
I'll be honest I don't know all that
much about how apex works I'm a
developer I'm not so much focused on the
DevOps side but it's something that was
very easy for our DevOps people to set
up and we have our system running on CI
specifically we use circle CI and every
time a commit is merged to master it
just redeploys all of our lambda
functions and it works beautifully you
can also run automated tests to make
sure that the code that you're writing
is safe and isn't going to break things
and we have very high test coverage
actually on our project we have 100
test coverage at the moment now it's not
all roses we did run into a couple of
unexpected problems and I'll go over
them briefly first of all we discovered
that backwards incompatible changes are
painful as I just mentioned we do
continuous deployment for all of our
lambda functions so what that means is
as soon as something is merged to master
its out on production there's not really
any delay so if you want to change the
schema that that we mentioned this JSON
schema that I talked about earlier let's
say we want to change the name of one of
the parameters well we did that a couple
of weeks after launch and then shortly
discovered that all of our emails were
failing and that happened because we
hadn't yet made the change to the
backend that was calling our lambda
functions so it was passing information
in the old format whereas lambda was
immediately expecting information in the
new format and so it was just throwing
validation errors so we reverted that
change very quickly and we've learned
that now all changes need to be
backwards compatible at least until the
back end is modified to fit with the new
structure of the data as well we also
unexpectedly discovered problems in our
database problems with the data that we
held in increase so for example every
single one of our emails has a big
highlighted call-to-action button so it
might be something like login and accept
your invitation or go and submit your
review to this person we had our email
setup so that if you pass an optional
invitation token parameter for each user
that was supposed to indicate that the
user hasn't actually claimed their
account on M phrase yet and therefore
the call-to-action should say register
and submit your review otherwise it
should just say submit your review well
we had a couple of customers contact us
and ask us why they were being asked to
register for their emperor's account
that they'd had for a couple months now
turned out that the code in our back-end
wasn't properly deleting the invitation
token and the back end was just you know
sending that information along to lamda
which meant that our emails were doing
exactly what they were coded to do they
were sending along the information that
said you need to register so having this
robust data validation helped us
discover problems that we didn't think
we had in a very unexpected place and we
were able to solve them pretty quickly
another this is not so much a problem
just sort of a lack of time issue we
haven't actually gathered performance
metrics now I said right at the
beginning of the talks that one of the
reasons why we wanted to do this is
because we had a very spiky very heavy
workload I'll be honest I don't actually
know what our workload was like and I
don't actually know how much it's
improved I presume that it has but this
is one of the things that we're looking
for help on this we know that we want to
move in this direction we know that we
want to gather performance metrics and
make sure that our service our servers
and our services are running smoothly
it's just not something that we've
gotten to yet there's another problem
that we've been having where we have
unexpected timeouts on a doe AWS Landa
most of our functions go perfectly
smoothly and all of our emails are
getting sent out but we've discovered
that some of these lambda functions
after the email gets sent out after we
send it over to postmark our email
delivery service just kind of hangs out
just kind of waits on lambda until the
timeout happens doesn't exit just waits
until o lambda kills the process we
don't know why we're hoping that we can
figure out why that's happening so that
we can cut off these processes earlier
because of course every millisecond that
we spend on lambda costs a little bit
more money so it'd be really nice to
figure out what's causing these timeouts
so as you can imagine we could use your
help as I said this is an open source
project
it's MIT licensed so you're welcome to
check out the code and to use it for
yourself personally use it for your
company the way that we made this
project open is we started out writing a
private repository with all of our
actual emails and we stripped out all of
the private proprietary information and
logos and such and made this repository
which is open so as a result this
repository is fairly minimal right
we have two example emails that you can
check out they are based on real emails
that we use a temp raise but of course
they don't use our logos or anything
like that
we would love if you could check out
this project try it out maybe write a
couple of more example email templates
we'd love to see people using different
email delivery services as I said we're
using a service called postmark but it
probably makes sense to write a service
that works with Amazon SES which is
their email delivery service
maybe people use mailgun maybe people
use something else if you use something
you don't give it a try you let us know
how it works we would love some better
documentation as well the documentation
that we have is sort of copied over from
our internal project and is really meant
for internal use but we would love to
have more robust documentation about
this is what the project is this is why
it works this is how it works
this is how you can adapt it for your
own project in your own use case as I
mentioned before we're using circle CI
for our continuous integration system
but for this react mail merge project
I've also set up Travis CI just to
handle things like running the tests and
deploying the latest version of story
book to our github pages so you can
check out how it looks online so we
actually have both files in the
repository we have our Travis CI mo and
we have our circle CI mo you can take a
look at both of them it would be great
to have some documentation explaining
what each one is for and how they work
and generally just kick the tires and
let us know if it's helpful you know we
built this project for ourselves but it
would be great if other people it got
some benefit out of it as well
so that's basically what I've got the
repository is online as I've said my
name is DeeDee I work for M praise the
slides for the presentation are also
online there's a link in the meetup
description as well and I'm happy to
take questions if there are any</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
