terms I've been writing software since
before the beginning of time and done
all kinds of crazy things
and now rust and JavaScript is one of
them currently work at a company called
to you which is a pretty cool
EdTech company shameless plug we're
hiring if you're interested find me
after the talk and we can chat so what I
hope you get out of this talk is that
you had a basic understanding of rust
and enough to take advantage of the
performance boost and kind of how to use
it and understanding of how to call rust
from node an understanding of when it's
worth using rust and when it's you know
not gonna be advantageous to you what
you're not gonna get out of this talk is
you're not gonna become a rust expert in
thirty minutes that's not a thing
if you want to be an expert it takes
time but you'll have enough to to use it
competently and you know look definitely
have resources to learn more so let's
get started what is rust rust is a
low-level systems programming language
with high-level convenience so what does
that mean that means it's strongly typed
everything in rusts you have to either
declare the type or use type inference
to get it it does provide type inference
as I mentioned you do get some
high-level language convenience so
unlike C you don't have to declare
everything rusts compiler will try to
figure out what a type is if it can't
figure it out then obviously you'll have
to specify it it's sponsored by Mozilla
it was originally created for the
firefox HTML stuff to help render it
faster and more securely and things like
that it has since been used in many many
places including the world's largest
package manager NPM they use it for a
lot of things
Coursera Dropbox just a couple of
examples of places where it's currently
used it's designed for speed and safety
speed is great safety is even more
amazing thing that Russ does Russ actual
motto is actually hack with
fear so hacking without fear basically
means that I can do all kinds of crazy
things and the compiler will stop me
before before I do something that's
going to you know cause me all kinds of
problems or try to anyway so speed so
aka why you're here Russ is a compiled
language which means that it has its own
tool chain and spits out a binary at the
end for that reason it's not necessarily
appropriate for modules that you're
going to distribute because obviously if
you distribute rust then they have to
install the rest tool chain but for
internal modules and things like that
it's a great choice rust has no garbage
collection or automated resource
management this makes it very
predictable it makes it very fast you
don't pause for GC cycles at random
times and things of that nature you can
get very close to the hardware in the
sense that you're on the cpu already but
you can also do things like run on the
GPU and you know do all kinds of crazy
things with hardware that obviously you
can't do with JavaScript in most cases
rust is as fast as C which is extremely
impressive in cases where it's not it's
a pretty close second and so safety so
the safety is actually a pretty unique
feature you can't have null pointers in
rust where you know you've read
something and then you try to use it or
you try to use it before it's assigned
like you kind of get in JavaScript
occasionally you'll get you know can't
call blah blah blah undefined
you'll never you'll never see that in
rust in fact there's no null at all
there's no such thing as null in job in
in rust there's no menu memory manual
memory management so one thing you might
think if there's no GC well now I have
to handle my own fries and my own Alex
and things of that nature but that's not
actually true so what Russ does is it
has this very interesting ownership
model where the compiler
handles all of the freeing and and
allocating of memory for you without you
having to worry about it but it's all
done at compile time so it's it keeps it
very very fast and we'll talk about that
ownership model in a minute the
threading is much much easier because a
lot of the problems with threading are
thinking about how to manage shared
memory rust makes that very easy with
its model by eliminating data races if
you're not familiar with what a data
race is it's basically when you have two
threads running and one thread modifies
data the other thread doesn't realize
that and all hell breaks loose those
types of bugs are really hard to find
and rust just eliminates them all
together so you can there's even a paper
recently that was published where they
used rusts macro system to prevent
security leaks by marking things as
secret and then if at any point that
secret variable was copied into a space
that wasn't marked secret the compiler
would prevent you from even compiling
the code so what is ownership ownership
is the right to destroy it's kind of the
best way to think about it if I owned a
car I can put that car in a crusher
right if I loan you that car and you put
it in a crusher we're gonna have a
problem so the the idea is that one
piece the memory is owned I can hand out
copies but it's mine to destroy there
can be only one owner of memory at no
point can you have two people owning the
same piece of memory which prevents the
data race so variables are immutable by
default which means that that helps the
compiler decide you know how I can what
I can do with this with this variable I
can mark something as mutable but but by
default it's going to be immutable
I can loan you the variable like I can
loan you my car right you can look at it
you can do things you know you can't
really do things to it but you can do
things with it
I can also mark variables immutable as I
mentioned and that that lets me change
the variable once it's set previously
but I can also send out borrows that are
mutable but only one bar mutable borrow
is allowed again we want to we're
worried about data races so you can only
have one alterable copy and if there's
an ultrabook copy out there no other
copies are allowed so in that again to
prevent data races and and things of
that nature you can transfer ownership
to someone else I can sell you my car
once I sell you my car I can't crush it
anymore you are now the owner of it you
can do whatever you want with it I can
borrow it I can mute ibly borrow it but
I don't I don't any any longer have the
right to destroy it a little bit more
about memory because of this memory
model you can ensure that memory can't
be corrupted you the only way to corrupt
memory really is to use the unsafe key
word so you can kind of escape this this
whole process so you can interact with
some C libraries and things of that
nature but in general if you're writing
in rust you won't have any problems with
memory no runtime overhead and you get
the same memory safety as a you know
garbage collected language it's pretty
nice so enough about memory you know
we're here to learn about rust so the
easiest way to do this is kind of a
rosetta stone way and we'll take a look
at some JavaScript and we'll take a look
at the equivalent rust and understand
kind of how to transform them so let's
start with functions so here's a very
simple hello world function in
JavaScript and then here's the
equivalent rust version so in rust FN is
how you declare a function rust has a
linter built into the compiler which
will comply complain at you if you
don't kind of do things the rest way
which is snake casing your variables and
your and your function names and things
of that nature you can turn that off but
it's it's kind of nice to have
consistent looking code every function
returns a variable or returns a value
remember there's no undefined or null in
this case this function will return an
empty tuple we'll talk about what tuples
are in a minute so variables in
JavaScript here are three ways to
declare a variable in JavaScript and a
couple of es6 ways and then the normal
way here's here's how we do it in rust
so let is the only keyword to declare a
variable
the first one is immutable we can never
change that X the second one we can
change that X to whatever we want
anytime later
we can't change the type of it though so
if we try to do 22.0 it's going to
complain and say hey x1 is an integer if
we want to do that then we can declare
it like Y where we give it a type
specification which comes after the
variable and we'll tell it hey this is a
float64 even though it looks like a an
integer so flow control so JavaScript
has some has an if statement right so we
have if this if you know ax do this else
do that we also have a ternary which
lets us be a little more terse if we
don't have a whole lot of stuff because
you know typing is the hard part of
writing software I guess Soho in rusts
we still have the if but ifs are
expressions so rust is an expression
based language so almost everything is
an expression almost everything can
return something or does return
something in this case if you look at
the second one it's the equivalent of
our ternary if we don't put a semicolon
at the end that last line is what will
be returned so in this case it's setting
X 2 or G 2 1 or 2 based on the value of
X
flow-control in JavaScript we have
switch statements in
rust we have match statements matches
are a little more powerful than switch
statements we can do a little more
checking after the after we you know
have the one or some something we can do
a little bit more a little bit more
analysis before it it picks this you can
read about that in the rust book but for
this purpose I didn't really write that
up the the default is the underscore and
that'll that'll match everything
oops too far so looping in JavaScript we
have while do and for very similar in
rust we don't have a do-while in rust we
only have the while loop
we have for with the but for isn't a
like it's a not a counter it's more of a
like a collection like I'm gonna take
one of each in in this case if we want
to do a count we can use a range and a
range is defined by in this way we have
0 10 so it'll it'll do you know 0
through 9 and then if we have a normal
collection we can just grab thing from
from the collection and do something
with it and then loop is kind of a
shorthand for a while true so types and
JavaScript yeah
rust again is strongly typed it has all
the standard types boolean Zinta jurors
floats unsigned signed it also has
arrays and strings as native types
arrays and strings are fixed in length
unlike javascript you can't push or
strip from an array or anything like
that a slice is a view into a string or
an array so you that's how you kind of
get a part of it and you can operate on
part of it a tuple is you can the best
way to think of a tuple is a typed fixed
length array so I can say this is an
array of and in 64 a float 32 and a
string and so that kind of tells you and
you can access those very much the same
way you would like if it was it's dot
zero dot one dot
to text to view into the tuple but it
basically gives you a way to say this is
a group of variables that's fixed in
this way vectors and hash maps are kind
of how you push in and pop from an array
a hash map is very much like a
JavaScript object so packaging yarn
obviously NPM other things rust has
cargo cargo Tamil and cargo lock are
very much the same as package JSON in
rust we use use not import or require
it's okay so let's solve a problem and
we'll we'll get into kind of how to use
rust to do this so given two large
numbers let's find the least common
factor of those numbers so the world's
easiest tool chain to install all you
just go to rust up dot RS and click
through the steps it's it's pretty nice
install experience once you have it
installed you can go into a directory
and type cargo new and give it a name
cargo will generate all of the assets
for you that you need to get started by
default this will create a library
libraries are hard to debug so it's
useful to sometimes create an app and
then remove that little app wrapper once
you're happy with your code in order to
make this a library a library that we
can load into javascript we want to use
a dynamic library rather than a
statically linked library that that's
default created so we'll add this line
add these couple of lines to our cargo
tamil so let's go to the JavaScript side
write some JavaScript code and then
we'll see how it differs so the first
thing we want to do to prepare our
JavaScript side is installed the FFI
rust can work with other ways that you
link up javascript and external
languages but FFI is convenient easy
nice to use and and that's what we'll
use today so here's the javascript
version of an LC f function takes two
numbers it figures out where to stop and
then
it loops through and checks each one to
see if they have a common factor returns
the one that if it finds one otherwise
it returns zero here's the equivalent
rust version so one thing you'll notice
is if we remove the the compiler
directive they're actually the exact
same length that compiler directive hash
no mangle is a compiler directive that
tells the compiler don't change the name
of this function by default rust can
rename functions and things of that
nature for its own purposes we don't
want that to happen because we're gonna
bind to this function by name that first
line looks a little scary let's go over
that so pub extern pub means this is a
public function by default things in
rust are private again safety first so
we have to declare that this is going to
be externally accessible from our module
that's what pub does extern is a keyword
that means use AC call stack it's a bit
technical but basically it's how things
are laid out on the stack how return
values are returned and how parameters
are pushed and things of that nature and
this says you we're gonna we're gonna
commonly agree that we're gonna use the
C standard FN LC f again this is how we
declare a function in functions when you
pass variables in there's no type
inference you have because rust can't
tell like how you know you have to tell
it what the variable is going to be the
arrow there is there it is how you would
specify the return type so we're gonna
use int 64's remember our turnery from
the previous one this is the ternary
equivalent which is let's stop equal the
if and then remember notice there's no
semicolons at the end of those at the
end of those braces and that lets rust
know hey return this value and then
we'll store it in the stop again we
don't have the for the let check we
just have for check-in I to stop
we will check each variable with the
modulus return the check or return 0
again room again notice that we can
return early with the return keyword or
we just have the 0 by itself as the last
line with no semicolon so that'll be
returned if it gets to that point so now
that we have now that we've written our
rust code we will compile it so we use
cargo again and we'll build and we need
to build a release version so we'll once
we're done with that we should have in
our target release folder a Lib that
that we can then link into JavaScript so
now let's connect the two so here we
have we require our FF I ref is a
library that gives us types in
JavaScript it lets us marshal these
types back and forth so we'll declare an
n64 which we'll get out of ref types and
then we'll let the will tell the FFI
library where our native code is and
what functions we want to pull out so
it's function name and then it's kind of
backwards its return type then
parameters or it feels backward to me I
don't know if it feels backward to you
we so we have our return type and then
we specify an array of our parameters
and then we can just use it just like a
normal normal function so you'll notice
that console.log just calls it as if it
was a normal javascript module so let's
let's make this a little more
complicated let's add some threading to
it and end at a callback so this this
looks a lot scarier but I promise it's
not it's not that much worse so we need
to add these three libraries so that we
can create threadings and threading
threads and move variables around
we need a callback function so we'll add
that to our our rust code here and that
that this just declares that hey we have
another C function
that will take and in 64 when you're
done arc is atomic reference count
atomic reference counting it lets us
share this across thread so remember I
talked about there can be only one owner
so arc is gonna take ownership of our
thing and let us see it and it will
manage changing it so that we can share
it across threads but still only have
one owner anytime you see an exclamation
point after a function that's a macro
and macros are really powerful in rust
I'm not really gonna talk about them in
depth here but you can read about them
vac is a macro that creates a vector
given an array we're just giving this an
empty array so that we can get an empty
vector and notice we declared a mutable
so that we can push things on to it if
we didn't declare it mutable we'd be
stuck with an empty array that we
couldn't do anything with I'm not
particularly useful so as we move along
we will clone the variable r 'k variable
that we have and put it in a local
variable that we're going to give to the
thread so thread spawn is how we create
a thread that double pipe is a is not a
is not a bully and it's a closure so the
move keyword in front of it means move
ownership of this thread LCF that i've
that i have in the closure to the thread
so if i tried to use this after after i
declared the thread i'd get it i'd get a
compiler saying hey this variable was
moved to this other thread you can't
access it anymore
so once i have that I'll just call my my
least common factor function from that
thread and we'll take a look at that
function in a second and then I'll later
I'll join the threads join basically
says wait for this thread to finish then
call me I don't care what it returns
because my variables stored in the in
the clone thing that we made and then
once it's done I'm going to call the
load function that the LCF provided with
with the value ordering relaxed means
that are the done function rather or
during relaxed means I don't care what
order this happens in in rust you
specify in the thread on a shared
variable like this what order to resolve
the resolve conflicts relaxed means I
don't care and the reason I don't care
is that I've only got one thread that's
ever gonna write to it and if another
thread reads it after it's already
written it's gonna cost me one loop
which doesn't matter
so single threaded LCF let's take a look
at this one so the additional parameters
here are basically the start point and
the step size because I have multiple
threads running I want to have a stride
where I where I kind of move along the
start is kind of like okay I want to
start at number 1 2 3 whatever right
however many threads I have and then the
LCF is that reference counted variable
that I share across my threads really
the only two lines of substance that are
different are this LCF store and load
and that's how you access that shared
variable so if I find one then I'm gonna
store it if I and then I'm gonna
continue if I load it and I find that
somebody else has already found it I'm
gonna return if I do a store and then an
immediate load I'm gonna find that I
found it and I'm gonna quit there's no
there's no return here notice there's no
like final 0 because this variable was
initialized at 0 if nobody finds it
nobody's going to store anything and
it's just gonna stay 0 so now calling
both versions so we will add our entry
here you'll notice I did something a
little different in the MT LCF I
provided strings for the types that's
another way that you can specify the
type either it'll use ref internally so
if you don't want to you know have the
safety of the variable if you don't care
about that as much of the variable name
so you don't end up with the typo you
can use this manner of of finding the
types for convenience the callback we
write we have to tell the FF ID that we
have a callback we have to provide that
callback in the in the FFI wrapper and
then we can just call it exactly like we
would a normal a normal rust method that
takes a callback or sorry a normal
JavaScript method that takes a callback
so how fast is fast so I did some tests
on my laptop and this is kind of the
results that I found for slow j/s I
wrapped it in a try-catch to prevent the
compiler from optimizing the code so
it's nine point two times faster for the
multi-threaded rust versus the slow
JavaScript if you do standard the single
threaded rust versus the compiler the
optimized JavaScript because we're
running multiple times it'll get it'll
get optimized pretty quickly and it's
2.1 times faster even there if you do
the multi-threaded where I had I gave it
four CPUs or four cores rather it's
seven point three times faster if you
gave it more cores and obviously larger
numbers it would go even faster but
that's kind of the the long and the
short of this the speed boost so when
should you use rust so if you need to do
things that are heavily computational
like finding the so there's there's a
reason that I picked I don't know if you
guys can see that in the back these very
large numbers these are the sums of
primes in the millions
and the reason I did that is so that it
would spend some time looking for them
or the fact that the the multiple of the
products of primes the millions so so
again doing you need to do something
heavily computational if you need access
to hardware like the GPU it's a good
choice
also if you want predictable performance
and that's critical you don't you can't
have it pausing on a GC cycle or
something like that
rust is actually a pretty good choice
for that a predictable memory footprint
again no GC cycle means that it's not
going to build up and then teardown and
build up and teardown
what's the downside of it FFI isn't
cheap so if you're adding two numbers
together FFI is going to be
significantly slower than just doing it
in javascript there are faster options
like a C++ bridge which you can write or
neon but they're much harder to use so
you know you're always trading kind of
complexity for speed passing complex
data structures can get a little hairy
so you want to avoid it for for that if
if possible make your data structures
simple having code in two languages
inherently more complex than having just
JavaScript you have to have rust
expertise on your team so that again
makes it a little bit a little bit more
difficult so if you're interested in
learning more which I hope you are
here's a short list of resources to get
you started all of the code and the
slides for this talk are available on my
github rust by example is an amazing
resource to learn rust
it's got exercises and things like that
that you can follow along with the node
FFI tutorial is a really good place to
learn more about FFI if you're
interested in that and if you're if
you're actually going to use it I
strongly suggest taking a look at it
neon bindings are great for higher
performance and if you need to construct
JavaScript objects in the rust neon is a
great way to go
it's it's more complex obviously than
Java than the FFI but you know obviously
more powerful also I'm a you seen again
on Twitter and all the other things in
case you haven't had enough of me that's
my talk and if you guys have questions I
think we have 47 seconds so debugging
the rust modules in JavaScript is very
difficult what I would normally do is I
would normally create an app and debug
it that way using the rust debugger and
then once you're satisfied with it
then build the Lib 25 seconds
all right cool thank you very much I
hope you hope you guys learned something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
