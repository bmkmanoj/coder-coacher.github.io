computers are coming my name is Alistair
Collinson I'm a senior software
developer for zendikar technologies and
blah blah blah you don't really care
about any of that do you okay so what is
a quantum computer let's get started
with a very basic term and the easier
part of that is what is a computer well
this is a computer rather older than
what you probably use I hope this one
could argue is the first computer ever
at least the first electronic digital
programmable computer that Souza's eight
three and digital or binary is a big
point there when we think of binary we
normally think of zeros and ones but
that's not really true is it
we don't have zeros and ones in our
computers we have two distinct States
and for we care about it could be a
green circle in the red triangle as long
as they are distinct that's fine now
computers nowadays work with transistors
well smaller than those more like this
here built into small trips and the way
that transistors work is basically that
depending on their input they either let
a current go through or they don't two
distinct States wonderful and this is
great for loads and loads of problems I
mean the fact that we are where we are
with computing technology nowadays is
due to the fact that this is such a
versatile versatile tool but it's not
great for everything and I'm going to
show you an example of something it's
not great at as nerds you may be not
that familiar with this but nature ok so
nature is not binary let's have a look
at a close part of that and try to try
to determine where we have forests so
this part that's clearly forest
part clearly isn't forest but what about
that part I mean you clearly have some
trees there right but most of it is
grass
so where do we draw the line when do we
call it a forest and that question where
do we draw the line we have to draw an
arbitrary line we have to decide how
much say trees per square kilometer or
whatever counts as a forest and when we
have to draw such a line when we have to
make a decision
we are artificially making our world
binary binary problems are great for
computers non-binary problems not so
much okay so that's the computer part I
think we're all up to speed now the
quantum part so quantum as you may have
guessed is based on quantum mechanics
quantum mechanics was first introduced
by Niels Bohr and Karl
van Arkel Heisenberg they worked
together in the 1920s came up with
quantum mechanics and what they called
the the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics named after the city
where they work together now I am NOT
going to explain all of quantum
mechanics partly because as I said I'm
not a physicist and partly because even
if I were we would need more than the
time we have available so I'll give you
an example and the example is imagine we
have an atom in fact we don't care about
the whole atom all we care about is the
nucleus here and let's say that our atom
is radioactive
what does radioactivity mean it means
basically that at some point it will
decay which means that part of it will
radiate away this radioactive particle
and alpha particle in this case will
leave the nucleus and what remains will
be some other element so assuming we
have our particle
our atom and we wait for a certain time
if we look at that particle there are
two states we could imagine it being in
either it hasn't changed at all or it
has decayed right according to the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics it can be both at the same
time that is it can be both at the same
time until we actually measure it now
don't be confused by those eyes I'm not
stating that there's any connection
between consciousness and physics
looking is one way of measuring it but
anything that relies on its being in one
side or the other counts so nevertheless
this is a really really weird thing to
imagine how can something be in two
states at the same time and so
Schrodinger here in 1935 he thought
there was this was pretty weird so he
came up with a thought experiment
showing how absolutely weird the the
interpretation was that Heisenberg and
Bohr had come up with in this
experiments which you may have heard of
he has a cat and this cat is totally
fine it's healthy it's not likely to die
within the next hour of so of natural
causes
and he puts this cat into a box the cats
however is not the only thing in the box
what else do we have
well we have a radioactive source of
some kind this is very similar to the
radioactive atom we had previously it's
just more of them and this source has
been chosen in a particular way so that
if one hour passes the chance that any
of it has decayed is 50/50 okay what
else do we have well there's also a
flask filled with cyanide gas in there
cyanide gas of course highly poisonous
it's better if the gas stays in that
flask
but he added a 1/4 thing he added a
construction which consists of a Geiger
counter that if it measures any
radioactivity will use that hammer and
what will happen there well dead cat so
if we again imagine an hour passes what
are the states that we could have well I
thought the radioactive isotope has not
done anything it's not decayed in any
way and the case is fine or well the
cat's dead two possible States and
according to the Copenhagen
interpretation we could have both of
them together we could have them at the
same time how can cat be dead and alive
at the same time right Schrodinger
wasn't thinking of zombie cats as far as
I can tell but it's definitely a weird
concept and so he came up with an
alternative interpretation because he
did believe that the maths behind
quantum mechanics was correct he just
thought that the Copenhagen
interpretation was nonsense and the
interpretation he came up with is called
the many-worlds interpretation now
before I get into what the many-worlds
interpretation means I have a small
disclaimer for us for our purposes the
many-worlds interpretation is a model it
helps us understand certain aspects of
the topic it's really good at that if
it's chosen well but models have
something else often models are wrong in
many ways and that's fine as long as
they're wrong in ways that we don't care
about and the many-worlds interpretation
for our purposes
is right in where it counts it may or
may not be correct in all of all I don't
know I'm not a physicist and I think
even physicists are unsure about this
it's certainly right in the ways we care
about okay with that just came out of
the way what does the many-worlds
interpretation say well it says first of
all take everything that is the world
the galaxy the universe it couldn't find
a picture of the universe but the
galaxies here will work and in this
universe among other things you have
your cat now when this radioactive event
happens this quantum event so to speak
you don't get your zombie cat situation
rather what happens is that you get two
universes and basically they're carbon
copies of each other with one exception
and that exception is the result of your
quantum event and everything that
followed from that so in one universe
you have a live cat in one universe you
have a dead cat and of course this can
happen again if you have another
radioactive event quantum events giving
you four universes and again giving you
eight universes you get the picture now
one thing you may notice on this slide
is we have rather many dead cats and
well that's not that Pleasant thing is
we have this situation because of
biology in our universe at least and
probably in all other relevant universes
if you have a dead cat and add more
cyanide you don't get a live cat that's
not how biology works or chemistry or
anything luckily for us cats and quantum
computers are different in that aspect
so now we're getting to the actual meat
of the matter what we see here is called
a Blas fear and it's a representative
representation of a qubit a quantum bit
that's the equivalent of your zeros and
ones your bits or your there is a
current and there's no current your
green circle and your red triangle this
is the equivalent in the quantum
computing world so what states can we
have in there well first of all you can
have a zero state which is represented
by your vector pointing to the top there
you can have a one state which is
represented by pointing to the bottom so
that's simple enough but you can also
have something that looks like this
now this isn't zero and it isn't one
it's not really between the two either
at least not in this visualization it's
somewhere on the sphere and
mathematically speaking this is actually
a combination of the two base values
we're using now if that math confuses
you because I mean zeros at the bottom
at the top ones at the bottom how can
some of that be somewhere else
ignore the math we don't need it for the
rest of the talk it is a combination it
makes sense in the mathematical model
the Bloch sphere is a three-dimensional
representation of four-dimensional space
it gets mathematical we don't have to
care about it what we have to care about
is okay assuming we have this qubit what
can we do with it and if you want to do
something with a qubit you need a
quantum gate so let's go through a few
quantum gates first one I want to show
you is the so-called Hadamard gate so
the Hadamard gate operates on a single
qubit and basically it imagines that
there's a further axis between the x and
the z axis and it then spins our vector
around that axis now if you are
measuring a qubit if it's at the zero
position it will give you zero all of
the time
binary value if it's one it will give
you one all of the time if it's
somewhere in between it will give you
zero and one with certain probabilities
so if we were to measure measure its at
this point in an ideal quantum computer
at least you would get 0 and one each
with 50% probability this state where
you can have 0 or 1 as a readout is
called
quantum superposition and we'll need
that very soon another gate I'll corner
I'm going to show you is called the
power Li X gates now the X gate is much
much simpler to understand than the the
Hadamard gate because basically if you
have it at 0 and apply an X gate it just
takes the x-axis and spins it around
there by a hundred and eighty degrees
giving you the opposite value so this is
basically just a knot around the x-axis
naught is easy enough to understand
right but it gets more complicated if
you go to another gate which
incorporates part of what you know from
the x gate now so the conditional not or
C not gate is where things get really
exciting and basically this operates on
two qubits we have the the control qubit
at zero here and we have the target
qubit and if we apply a C naught with
the control qubit at zero well nothing
happens everything stays the same if we
have a 1 on the control qubit and apply
the C naught it will flip so basically
this is the behavior we know from the ex
gate but what happens if our control Q
gate is in super position if it could be
measured as 0 or 1
we get something like this so we now
have two arrows in that second qubit
basically it's a bit like this because
if you were to measure either of the
gates you would get the value of both
gates they are combined they are locked
together if you have zero in the first
one you'll get zero in the second one
because nothing happens if you get one
in the first one you'll get one in the
second one because everything happens
this is the situation we had with our
radioactive isotope and our cat earlier
this is quantum entanglement and quantum
entanglement combines with quantum
superposition is what makes quantum
computers and quantum mechanics in
general tick now we don't actually have
this until we measure before we measure
we basically just have both in
superposition and as long as they're in
superposition we can do some really
funky stuff with these qubits now I've
shown you a few quantum gates namely the
Hadamard and the clone see not gates
I've shown you one of the three power
gates there are y&amp;amp;z paola gates as well
they just spin around their axes by 180
degrees those axis just being wild said
there's also stuff like the identity
gate which is the most boring gates ever
because it just does nothing there are
phase gates which are pretty exciting
you can do some pretty neat stuff with
those I'm not going to get into the
phase gates today but you can read up on
them if you like I'll have some material
some links for you later
and there are many many other types of
gates you can imagine so ok we now know
roughly how it works
why do we need this what are the use
cases and there are quite a few use
cases actually for example the big one
that if you've heard anything about
quantum computing you've heard about
this it can break encryption and it can
break encryption because at least in
theory it can break it because it's
really good at prime factorization
quantum computers can factorize numbers
much more efficiently in theory at least
then your regular binary computers can
do it if you want to know more about
that check out Shor's algorithm
something you may not have heard of
various companies including Google and
Fox wagon are using quantum computers
now to assist them in engineering tasks
you could simulate molecules and atoms
on quantum computers you actually have a
quantum states there so you can easily
work with quantum properties and this
can be really useful in research in
physics and chemistry and medicine of
course so this could be really really
exciting other than that how about AI or
machine learning there are quite a few
attempts to use quantum computers in
those areas and I think it's pretty safe
to say that those will be some of the
first fields that will we as developers
will really meet quantum computers at
least in the wild then you can use it
for weather prediction you can use
quantum computers for pretty much any
field that is nowadays aided by
heuristics because heuristics are just
the shortcuts because you are unable to
calculate everything but quantum
computers will allow you to calculate
well not everything but much much more
then you can nowadays for
sure fraud is another use case that some
people are looking into again a field
where heuristics is large NASA is using
quantum computers early quantum
computers and admittedly in their
engineering tasks so that's similar to
the Volkswagen case and just to jump on
the bandwagon quantum computers could
Drake Bitcoin so if you have bitcoins
you'll probably save for a couple of
years until we have quantum computers
that are powerful enough but don't wait
too long to sell them okay so these are
interesting use cases I guess but
there's much more that could be done now
most people who nowadays are into
quantum computers are scientists
physicists as I said engineers etc and
they come up with solutions to the
problems they know we are the ones who
will have to program them eventually so
we need people who are in the
programming field who are in the
software development field to have a
look at quantum computers try them out
work with them see what they can do we
will come up with other use cases use
cases that so far nobody has thought of
and this is basically why I'm doing this
talk today because we have to get into
quantum computing and we can so that's
why we as a community should get into it
why should you personally get into it
well there's this wonderful quote from
Venkat basically if you want to learn
something you learn something that's
totally different from anything you know
because it will help you think
differently it's a wonderful quote and
believe me quantum computer programming
is different from what you know so I'm
going to show you two examples
today of how you can actually today
start programming for quantum computers
the first one I'm going to show you is
the IBM quantum experience
so IBM has built real quantum computers
early prototypes but they are real
nevertheless and they're basically
offering the as a kind of quantum
computer in the cloud service how does
that work well first of all the
computers they built look something like
this and if for the moment yes I hope
they'll shrink considerably actually
this part here most of that is a freezer
but a cryostat but basically a huge
freezer the trip itself looks something
like this this is a seven qubit chip
those are the qubits here and it has to
be cooled down to well basically as cold
as it can get because they are based on
super conductivity and super
conductivity well it works best if you
have really really cold states now you
can use this quantum computer well not
that specific one but once that they're
providing via their website this is the
entry science to the quantum experience
they have great learning materials there
by the way so if you're interested in
this later you can check it out it's
great once you log in what the place
you'll spend most of your time probably
is this this is called the quantum
composer and up here we have information
about the quantum computers that you can
use they currently offer for free by the
way two different five cubits computers
that anyone can use they also have in
their quantum experience in theory a 20
qubit quantum computer that's only open
to their partners and it gives you some
information about those computers now
think it's difficult to read but the top
quantum computer it's cooled down to
0.01 to kelvins that's colder than out
of space that's why they have this huge
cryostat that
huge freezer and as you'll see very soon
that's still not really enough so the
main parts however is this part the
composer interface and it's named so
because it looks like you know a musical
score and you do call the programs often
quantum scores also you have here your
cue gates now you'll recognize some of
them they're ours the h4 Hadamard
there's the the plus symbol that's the C
not you see the green X that's the X
gate and there are some other ones as
well so let's say we want to implement
an algorithm in this and we'll go with
something we already know Schrodinger's
cat very simple algorithm to implement
not much logic logic in it but it's a
start so what do we need apart from the
cat well we need our radioactive matter
we need our modified Geiger counter we
need our cyanide and all of those have
to be linked in some way they have to be
entangled and if we lay that out in our
quantum composer it would look something
like this
so the radioactive matter we already
learned that is in quantum superposition
so we can achieve that through the
Hadamard gate we then link all of the
other items so the the Geiger counter
and the cyanide and the cat through see
not gates cause basically if if the
halima treats out as one that means that
the radioactive matter has decayed and
in that case all the other qubits should
also flip they all start out as zero and
if the first one flips everything should
turn to one and looking into the box is
basically this pink symbol here the
measurement gate in fact let's measure
all of the gates we are modifying here
and see what we get
now you can run this as I said on a real
quantum computer it's sent to their
quantum computer there's a schedule
system etc and after a while you get
back your result and your results what
part of the result will look like this
so what does this mean at the bottom we
have the various measurement values
ignore the first value because that's
the qubit we didn't measure and what we
see is here this is the case where
everything 0 nothing happens so that's a
big peek back here we have the case
where everything happened everything's a
1 cat's dead
and each of those two results come to
about 30% I think I've run this test a
thousand times and you get 30% each
which leaves 40% of these results so
what are those well those are
measurement errors see this is still an
early prototype and it makes mistakes
and quantum error correction is actually
a huge research fields right now things
are getting better but you do have to
keep in mind that you can't believe all
of the results at the moment that you're
getting there is some randomness in
there basically due to the fact among
other things at least that it's not at
Absolute 0 it is those you know 21
millions above zero which isn't much but
it's still a bit too warm so that's the
quantum experience the other tool I
would like to show you today is the
Microsoft quantum development kit now
this the the IBM quantum experience is
basically a drag-and-drop editor you can
write regular code as well they have a
programming language and it translates
back and forth between the graphical
interface and that language in most
cases at least for learning purposes you
will
we use the graphical interface the
quantum development kids by Microsoft
comes with a language called cue sharp
this looks much more like in the code
we're used to and as I said it's from
Microsoft so initially it was only
available for Windows and I thought
during the preparations for this
presentation I'd have to tell you well
if you have anything but windows tough
luck but about a month ago they said hey
it's now available for linux and mac OS
as well so everyone can download it
everyone can start playing around with
it yes ok so you can do it let's have a
look at what it looks like if you
actually do do it so the language cue
sharp is heavily inspired by other
dotnet languages as you would assume and
it does actually run inside a dotnet
environment here we have a very simple
program most of its blurred out at the
moment it's not something about your
eyes it really should look like that and
we'll go through the program step by
step so what do we have first of all
here we are applying a Hadamard gate to
our isotope H isotope and then we apply
the C not to the isotope and the Geiger
counter and another C not to the Geiger
counter and the cyanide another C not to
the cyanide and the cat you know this
and it's just written down as code it's
the same algorithm as we did before what
else do we have because there's
obviously more code well first of all we
define a mutable value what we would
call a variable in most languages most
things in Q sharp are immutable
by default we want this to be mutable
and this variable is supposed to
represent the state of the cat is it
alive or is it dead this is a simple one
it's not
cubits value this is a binary value here
we check in the box whether the cat is
alive or dead M is the measurement value
this is the pink thing you saw in the
quantum experience same concept and then
at the end we return you know is the cat
alive or is it dead okay simple enough
what else do we have
we have boilerplate basically so here we
say this algorithm needs for qubits
we have to state explicitly how many we
need they will be provided by the
language then we give them proper names
normally you have an array of qubits and
that's fine initially but you can't
throw best practices out of the window
just because we have a new language is
language here we do have to give the the
qubits names so we can understand what
we're doing then we initialize them all
to zero the quantum experience did this
for us
everything was initially set to 0 Q
sharp does not do this for us we have to
do it manually and at the end we're
setting them back to 0 now the reason we
have to set them to 0 initially and at
the end is basically decay quantum decay
means that a qubits will always strive
to some kind of equilibrium state we
want to make sure it's not in
equilibrium but rather it's in a defined
States that we can work with and you
could leave out language-wise
the initializing to 0 then with you
would just get random results q sharp
forces you actually to set them back to
0 when you're finished and that's
basically all of the Q sharp code now
this runs in the dotnet environment
which means we can access it from other
dot net language
and so here we have a few lines of
c-sharp code which basically say what
here create a quantum simulator to run
my algorithm in run the algorithm in
that quantum simulator and then tell me
what the result is and you can run this
code on your computer it runs it just
this once
in this case and it'll either tell you
the cat's alive or the cat is dead and
that's it this will run on your computer
so we have quantum simulator here and
that may beg the question then why don't
we just simulate it white do we need a
real quantum computer it obviously works
so why don't we just simulate everything
and don't have those measurement errors
that have the hassle it's a huge
financial investment that companies like
IBM for example and many universities
are taking on why do they care and I'd
like to go back to a previous slide to
answer that question remember this slide
now in theory the slide is designed in
such a way that when I press my button
here it will have a smooth transition
from the dead cats to gravestones I
clicked that wasn't smooth my computer
is having difficulties with PowerPoint
and what stress would a quantum computer
put on a binary computer well IBM
actually looked into this issue and they
published a paper last year they had two
quantum computers that they simulated
one of them was a 49 qubit computer and
they needed to fund a half terabyte of
RAM one of them was a
56 cubed computer and that needed three
terabytes of RAM
note that this wasn't the same algorithm
and maybe the algorithm they used for
the latter was more optimized it's still
much more than we have on our
development machines there are computers
with that kind of memory available of
course but you don't have them sitting
at home I would assume if you do let me
know I might come by so this was a huge
success and you'll see why it was a huge
success with this line here previously
those kind of simulations would have
needed eight petabytes of RAM for the 49
qubits machine and an exabyte of RAM for
the 56 qubit machine let me repeat that
one exabytes of ram can you imagine how
much an exabyte is probably not so let
me break this down for you one exabytes
is a thousand petabytes which is a
million gigabytes terabytes re which
depending on whether you speak British
or American English is a mill yard or a
billion gigabytes that's ten to the 18
bytes of RAM so intensive hits CD 18
bytes that's hard to imagine our
universe according to current estimates
is thirteen point seven times ten to the
nine years old
that translates to four point three two
times ten to the seventeen seconds
that's less than half the amount of
bytes we have in an exabyte so the
improvement that IBM made thereby
getting it down to the terabyte range is
astonishing but as the number of qubits
grows that you have to emulate or
simulate and as the algorithms grow that
you want to simulate on those
simulations of quantum computers things
will get well even more unrealistic than
they are right now
so at least for the time being we are
stuck with
actual physical quantum computers now
this here is a 50 qubit quantum computer
that's IBM built and until recently I
thought this would be the largest
machine I'd be able to show you about
two weeks ago Google came along and said
hey we have this thing here we call its
Bristlecone and it has 72 qubits and
apparently very low error rates now when
they announced it the testing wasn't
fully completed so we can't be
absolutely sure what the error rates
look like but it's promising note the
the 50 qubit machine I showed you I
think that was from earlier this year
this is from two weeks ago things are
moving really rapidly and IBM and Google
aren't the only companies in the game
here for example Intel is also working
on quantum computers at the beginning of
the year they introduced a 49 qubits
quantum computer after some previous
iterations the largest one in the
picture is the 49 qubit one and Alibaba
the Chinese Internet giant's announced
in early March that sir they were
offering a quantum computer in the cloud
similar to what IBM is offering now as I
said earlier IBM to certain partners
offers a twenty cubits computer this
here offered by Alibaba is an 11 cubits
computer which is the second largest one
available at least it's available to
some people I registered with Alibaba
looked for anything and I could only
find this announcement so apparently it
is available in theory but only two were
probably members of the university with
which they are doing this or the
research institution I should say but
things are gonna happen quantum
computers will become more and more
available in the next months and
especially years and
so this is the breaking point this is
the point where people like us have to
get started and can get started with
quantum computing so if you want to get
started what can you do well as I said
earlier there's the quantum experience
you can register there it's all free
and they have great learning material
here's the URL I will make the slides

Stack Exchange who run this tiny 'lest
site called Stack Overflow you may heard
of they opened a private beta for a
quantum computing site now it's a
private beta so you can only join by
invitation if you want to join let me
know I can I can get an invitation to
you and that's well the site is at this
address of course my invitations aren't
but just let me know
and well apart from that I would say
it's time to explore try these tools
play around with them read the tutorials
there's much much more than I got to
cover today in the information material
provided by for example IBM and
Microsoft and of course other sources
play around with it and hopefully we'll
get some really cool results
and now ask your questions that case
