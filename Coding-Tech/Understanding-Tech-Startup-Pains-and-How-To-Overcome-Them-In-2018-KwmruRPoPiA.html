guys are doing something amazing is
anybody doing anything amazing in the
audience I have one two three few people
okay sometimes to do something great in
life you guys just need to believe in
yourselves right so there is greatness
you can achieve if you just believe is
there a song Jay - if you believe Josh
Groban song yes Jay is my age jukebox so
when you believe in yourself and your
ideas the four people who raise their
hands anything is possible and those of
you guys who actually have the courage
to do so are ultimately the ones who do
end up changing the world and I think
that's a really really beautiful thing
if you have ever thought to yourself
about the product that you're building
and what can actually do I mean to think
that you can build a product and it can
move an industry forward that you can
actually gain a few percentages of
market share that is that is something
really really really powerful right and
again those of you guys who have the
courage to actually do so are going to
be the ones who lead the markets forward
and you all and us everybody are our
future leaders so if you're sitting
there thinking no how can I change the
world that's impossible I'm just a
person doing something random you are
absolutely wrong and I think one of the
the biggest disservice is you can do in
your life the biggest faults you can you
can have in your life is by just not
even trying not even trying to do so
because you never know you have to test
yourself figure it out see if it's
actually true and when you do finally
get started if you haven't already
there's gonna be a lot of growing pains
in startup right but I guarantee you
they are all worth it amend so that's
what I'm going to talk about today and
to talk about a few common start of
pains that I experienced when I was
building a well at a bunch of startups
and some of the things I've seen as a
board member and a mentor and advisor to
different startups my name is Tracy I'm
a serial entrepreneur I've started over
ten companies in the past 15 years I'm
an advisor to several startups I've sat
on several boards before
last December I sold my last company and
there I was CEO and I focused mainly on
sales and marketing so today I am a
speaker and a Google developer expert
I love JavaScript so I do things
development related to ember angular and
react I'm a co-founder of this dot media
and this dot labs I love writing about
technology and I'm also a podcaster on
modern web and I'm a mentor to a lot of
junior developers so when I look at all
the trials an entrepreneur goes through
there's sort of five large categories
that I feel like really affected my life
as a founder and for the growth of the
company first one was sales and
marketing how do you gain awareness for
your company how do you grow the revenue
managing technology how I approach this
and I how I approached my team managing
the growth and the culture of the
company I wanted to build zeroing in on
what to focus on and just general
growing pains of being a founder it's
hard so let's jump right into sales and
marketing I think one of the one of the
first things is and Jay and I talked
about this during our backstage track if
you're waiting for your brand to be
built you're waiting for a logo you're
waiting for a new website something
you're just waiting you're really
actually just creating excuses for
yourself right it is absolutely much
more effective to do something valuable
today then hope that something or
something else is going to do it for you
and when it's time to dig in and
actually execute on your sales and
marketing and you've launched your
company things don't actually get easier
so whether you're doing sales and
marketing yourself or you're hiring
somebody to do it
ideas are easy but implementation is
really hard people can come in and they
can tell you about all these amazing
things that you should do as a company
but unless they're able to actually
implement those things and achieve
results then those things actually mean
nothing right so usually when you're
thinking about sales and marketing you
again or somebody else is coming up with
these grandiose ideas of how you're
going to go to market differently how
your product is drastically different
but I have
say it's very easy to be different it
doesn't mean it's right it's extremely
difficult to be better so if you look at
Chrome or Firefox right like they're
there they're basically the same thing
they're addressing the same need but yes
they are trying to differentiate
themselves in what they focus on and
what they offer but I think one of the
things when you're starting or even as
you're building a product is you really
have to be humble and think about the
idea that you know your idea usually is
going to compete with somebody else's
idea so don't get lost in thinking
you're different just because of one
feature because you're probably not that
might be sad but it's true
um I think also remember that when
you're building your business and you're
thinking about sales and marketing
there's these traditional methods right
traditional sales traditional PR etc you
have to remember that these traditional
methods are traditional for a reason and
it's because they've been proven before
so a great example is if everybody in
your market is doing paid advertising
you should probably be doing paid
advertising because they're probably
doing it for a really good reason the
traditional route of building a business
is really going to be the foundation and
your key to success because if you can
master that then it's really easy to add
on a bunch of like spice and excitement
right
there's gonna be plenty of people in the
market and they might do flashy awesome
things and you might think like wow this
is so cool but don't get caught by all
the flashy exciting things that you
actually see you should be really
thinking about okay what are the things
I'm doing and how are they going to
achieve our why for me so if you see
your competitor doing it really take a
second to think about it before you run
off and jump off a hill because
everybody else is doing it right it
might not be the best idea for you after
you've built your foundation for a good
business then again it's really easy to
add on top of that and find your
competitive advantage and compete better
than your competitors so spending money
spending money is a touchy thing
especially when you're doing startup
I think when you are building startups
you feel like you have to conserve money
because you don't have a lot of it and
it's also hardest I think for people to
spend money on things that they don't
understand so probably you know a lot of
you guys in this room aren't developers
and when you don't understand a sales or
marketing process you're scared to make
that decision right like okay these
people are telling me all these things I
need to spend money on this but I'm
going to delay because I don't actually
know if I'm making the right decision I
feel like business people feel exactly
the same way sometimes when it comes to
technology if they don't know and it's
just sort of scary to them they don't
actually spend time investing in it so I
encourage you guys to think about these
opportunities and these investments that
you need to make in your business and
sort of incremental phases if you need
to hire somebody let's say a sales and
marketing person and you need to pay
them one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars a year that sounds like a lot
and that might be you know twice as much
as you're paying anybody else when
you're getting started right but this
person could be so amazing but oh my god
$120,000 how do I even afford that when
you think about things like that
you should be thinking about it more
from an incremental perspective so one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars
really actually means you're spending
ten thousand dollars a month so if you
hire somebody and for four weeks they
work for you and they don't work out
you're making a $10,000 bet so don't
psych yourself out right just make
decisions trying to dive ideas take risk
where you can and not everything is
going to work but you really shouldn't
fail before you actually even try this
is one of my favorite quotes the best
way to predict the future is to create
it I love this group because this is
sort of how I approach my entire life so
anytime I enter a market is what
surround me and if there isn't what I
need to be successful I create it so if
you're building and you don't have a
place to find customers create one if
there's not a forum to gather industry
leaders create it by putting your
company in front and leading by creating
exactly what you need you're going to
become a leader just by default
right so I think one thing to remember
is you never actually start off as a
leader when you enter a market but if
you're not the leader today so if you
start today you're going to be the
leader by tomorrow sales and marketing
might still seem like something that's
hard or magical right because I don't
know I'm assuming most of you guys have
developers in the room but this is kind
of how I feel about some types of code
so AI stuff or conflicts algorithms you
know seems hard seems like magic but I'm
always really surprised by every time I
sort of peel something back like Ori and
I paired on some IOT stuff with angular
and rxjs the other day actually
yesterday and you know once he taught me
sort of how to configure the Arduino and
things like that I realized it was so
easy right and I'm sure you guys feel
that way a lot about code but I think
one thing to remember was sales and
marketing is it's not actually rocket
science much like code is a simple
process right setting up your
environment building features you really
should look at sales and marketing the
same so let's get into one of my
favorite topics which is managing tech
when I first learned how to code this
this was a life changer I realized all
the things I was doing wrong
so how many of you guys like to
prioritize features yeah nobody one
thanks Jay now so there's always like 50
different features you want to work on
right and it's really really really hard
to sometimes prioritize those things but
I would say that when you're thinking
about features you should be thinking
about it as what am I going to build
today to build for value or build this
week for value what is the one feature
that's going to help me be successful in
my company or if I'm spending money
developing what's the biggest pain point
within the company and how can I build
software around that to solve that
problem so this is like probably the
best and like only way
you should be prioritizing features
another huge disagreement between tech
and business people is meetings who
loves meetings
I hate meetings now I used to love them
so let's look at it from a business
person's perspective right a business
person let's say you're a CEO of a
company your job is relationships and
you build relationships by having
meetings so it's really normal to
project that type of thing on to tech
people right like you feel like okay for
not in meeting isn't hat like building
relationships
how are you productive you're not doing
anything with your day and we know
that's not true
and CEOs and business people just love
to hear updates what's going on what's
going on um initially I thought it was
really great to have my CTO in meetings
I felt like he was more productive
because I was communicating with him and
he was telling me what was going on and
I was packed with 12-hour meeting days
and he was packed with no meetings cuz
you know his job is to code right but I
think one of the biggest mistakes I made
was I saw his calendar he has nothing on
it so you know I could scatter meetings
like okay ten o'clock twelve o'clock
1:30 four o'clock it's gonna be great
you have nothing else going on right
once I finally started coding I realized
how wrong I was so I think technical
people you know we need your help you
need to teach business people why
meetings are destructive to your
productivity and help people create a
structure business people especially
create a structure in which meetings are
okay because you have to have meetings
but do it based on a specific time of
day so that you actually have enough
time to get things done really really
really key tech debt who loves tech debt
I don't so you know the first time tech
debt was explained to me
I understood the concept like okay yeah
tech debt that's that makes sense
and my CTO would ask me to wait on
options he'd say okay Tracy if you need
this feature tomorrow we're gonna incur
some tech debt do you want to wait a few
days
you know to like do it the right way and
so I would make these decisions right
but the problem was yes tech debt sure I
never actually understood what tech that
really was so it was this intangible
thing and I was making decisions and I
wasn't actually making good informed
decisions so tech people when you say
tech debt to somebody um it sounds like
something they can't see or feel or
touch right so you know this is a very
painful process but if you sat down with
somebody and you said alright you want
this feature I'm gonna coat this feature
right now
the way you want it I'm going to show
you what I have to do to refactor it is
that meeting five hours two hours
whatever you know it's going to be a
very frustrating process for you but I
guarantee you that it's going to help
you in business and in your startup if
you're leading a startup business people
trust your team when they say a tech
debt if you have it you really have to
allow time to refactor clean up tech
debt because I think you know you don't
want to have a feature that all of a
sudden in the signup window takes a week
because your code is just really scary
it's something really important to
understand so another big impact area
when talking about growing a start-up is
talking about how to manage the growth
of your startup and creating the culture
you actually want
I think the first things first let's
talk about team dynamics so especially
as co-founder you really have to
understand that it takes two fluence to
make a fire right so when there's issues
a lot of times we as humans jump to
specific conclusions or we side with
people specifically or you know this
person isn't performing so I'm gonna
fire them but you really have to take a
step back and be introspective because
if there's a problem and you do need to
fire somebody you should actually be
thinking about what is that problem and
how am i a part of that problem and if
that problem continues is it me or is it
my team right like that you need to sort
of really be humble and actually be
asking yourself those questions I think
the other thing is if there's conflict
within your organization don't jump to
conclusions right based on whatever it
is
but take a step back to reflect and then
act accordingly so that that's a hard
one but this is like really really
really important when you're growing
your company
I think another part of growing a
healthy team is just being a full nerble
you have to teach your team to be
vulnerable too so opening lines of
communication to like create this
dynamic in which your team feels
comfortable talking to each other asking
for help
I think as leaders founders or even just
as team members in general right if you
ask for help you ask questions you show
you don't know all the answers it's
gonna create this sort of dynamic where
autonomous structures are going to be
created within your organization and
those people who want to rise who want
to help who want to do amazing things
are gonna be able to rise up with these
opportunities to shine and that that is
like a really really really good culture
you want to build within the company so
your startup may grow from five to ten
to 20 to 100 people right maybe even
more at dish crawl I suddenly had 250
people under me in a matter of six
months I went from working out of my
apartment to having 20 people in the
office maybe in less than three months
as you grow especially from the five to
the twenty there's a few things to keep
in mind one thing is conversations
between co-founders right so two people
working on a problem can have a very
different dynamic then you having to
have let's say five people in a room
making a decision so if you're fighting
with your co-founder and you guys have
that sort of dynamic it's really
important to adjust those conversations
over time and build productive sort of
dynamics and relationships one thing I
remember so my co-founder was amazing
when I was wanting to build this product
I posted something on reddit I wanted a
designer to design five mock-ups for me
for three hundred bucks he called me and
told me that I didn't need a designer so
what
who is this random guy telling me that
and then he proceeded to tell me what I
actually needed and then I said okay
you're crazy enough we're gonna sit down
he built me the product in about two
weeks and then we
we work with founders for the rest of
the time so that dynamic carried on
every time I had a vision of the product
it would start with a fight that wasn't
really fight owes more like a
brother-sister relationship of hey I
really think we need this and you know
he's like no I don't probable and you
know what he really wanted to do when we
ended up doing was spend like six our
Trello boarding the features and in the
end we obviously agreed to everything
but as we grew to five people and we
started bringing the other people into
that process we were scaring our team
because like you can't argue with your
co-founder in front of other people
right it's kind of like whoa you guys
are demented or twisted so I really wish
that I had been able to adjust those
conversations sooner and realize that as
I was growing purses like this you know
okay we're in the situation okay we need
to take a few weeks to fix this thing so
another huge consideration for culture
is diversity this is Ben's favorite
slide yes so we all talk about diversity
right it's a very common topic in the
JavaScript world but it's it's really
important and the reason it's so
important it's because you you want to
hire like-minded people but you also
want to be able to have different
insights and how to grow a company and
we tend to be attracted to people like
us and we also tend to attract people
like us so this is a problem because
when you're hiring it's very easy to say
like oh I don't feel like this person's
a culture fit but what does that
actually mean
right like you should actually be taking
emotion out of it thinking about who's
the most qualified based on the
discussions and then hire those people
at dish crawl I had my Director of
Operations Amy and we were in our late
20s and she was building the initial
team the operations team and so you know
we hired one person she was great we
heard another person by the time we
ended up hiring maybe about five girls
in the office it sort of turned into
this episode of Mean Girls which was
like my worst nightmare
but the problem was that like we hired
all the same type of people right
because they were kind of similar to us
I probably reminded us of like ourselves
a few years back or something like that
and I think the best way to describe
this is if you have a bag of red marbles
do you want a blue marble no if you have
a bag of rainbow marbles from the very
beginning right you're totally down to
add as many colors as you want so like
this idea of diversity especially in the
very beginning is so so so so so
important and once you have the problem
it is much harder to fix because again
you don't want to mess up a bag of like
single colored marbles with a marble
that doesn't match the color keeping
your people happy this is so important
and I think that as people we sometimes
project feeling it's like oh I feel so
excited like you know for example I'm so
excited about an exit well you might be
freaking out the person you're talking
to and they might want to leave the
company because they don't want an exit
right so one of the best questions to
ask people when you're working with them
is what do you want out of life and I
ask this all the time because I really
want to understand what people are
motivated by some people are motivated
by Fame some people are motivated by
getting to a large exit some people are
motivated by building a huge company
that lasts forever
some people are motivated by just
feeding their family right if you don't
understand those things then as you're
going through a startup journey which is
extremely difficult
you can't help other people achieve
their own goals and you can't also have
conversations with them that actually
motivate them in a way that's productive
to you I think another thing is your
core team so there's key people that are
going to help you build your company and
if you can't keep your team the constant
strain of retraining people is going to
be really hellish for you so at dish
crawl I had my right hand Amy she did
operations for me and then I had my CTO
Jeff if I had lost either of them it
would have taken six months to a year to
maybe the company would have died if I
didn't have these key people right so
it's really important to listen to those
people and keep rapport with them
structure Wow
so people need and love structure who
knew I didn't one thing I failed to do
in the beginning was I would hire these
people and I'd be like yeah just go do
it right like figure it out and I think
we tend to do that especially in
start-up like yeah yeah just figure it
out people who like to know what they're
doing do it and then be rewarded that's
like job satisfaction right and once I
realized this because I mean if you if
you're handed a task and then you fail
at it like do you feel good no not
really
um so what I would do is and what I do
now is every time I give somebody a task
I think about it I think about where it
needs to go I write down a process if it
needs a process and then we implement it
so that helps me scale out of a
situation so every time this task comes
up again they don't have to talk to me
about it and then the other thing is as
you're growing it helps your team and
other people coming on pick up a process
easier so it prepares your team to start
thinking about okay what do I need to do
to prepare myself to be the manager of
the job that I'm currently doing so I
mean you guys can think about it as kind
of like writing a test right like make
sure when you add in features you need
to have tests so that existing features
don't break this is sort of the same
thing when it comes to structure
work/life balance uh yeah I still
struggle with this a lot so especially
as owners of a company or even working
on a team right like sometimes I'll work
a lot and I burnt out I burnt out
earlier this January it's important when
you when your team is working hard and
you know like yes we're more than for it
yes this is so amazing
but you need to say hey take a break off
you also as yourself need to set an
example so it's not amazingly healthy if
I'm emailing my team from you know
midnight to 5:00 a.m. all the time I
mean once in a while it's okay right but
you shouldn't expect that of them and
you really need to like
start up as long it's not a sprint so
making sure you have work-life balance
is really important so let's talk about
firing firing is a really difficult one
and I think nobody really likes to talk
about it it's always a touchy subject
but you really need to have a plan for
it so everybody feels tension and
startup and if there's a bad seed you
need to get rid of that immediately one
time I had a bad seed I was afraid to
fire her because you know again I had
this sort of Mean Girls thing happening
in the office sounds like oh my god if
one of them leaves all of them are gonna
leave they're all the same right so it
sucked and I didn't fire this person for
about four weeks and what I realized
after I fired them the one that there
was this one person that I thought was
going to leave like I was really scared
that this person was gonna leave if I
had fired this other person but she came
to me she's like oh my God thank you so
much for firing this person they were
weighing me down I wasn't able to do my
job and I had to like be a friend at
work and like wow that was interesting
right so get rid of those bad seats
immediately
I'm also be transparent so when you're
hiring and firing um I grew really fast
right so I had 250 people under me just
it almost immediately and since we were
getting so big I let my HR manager let
go of a few people and I thought this
was the right professional way to do
things but I think when you're fired and
you don't know why you're fired
you get really stressed out and then
like you feel like for me for example I
think that people I had to let go didn't
feel like I was listening or didn't know
why so they decided to post all these
things on Facebook and like freaked
everybody on the team out and it sucks
but this was because they weren't able
to talk to me personally right and so
it's really important to just like think
about that when you're doing things like
firing and hiring so that your team
understands so that it's not like ma
just doesn't become a hot mess so let's
talk about focus focus is so essential
right Jay and I again talked about this
in our backstage track when you focus in
a company in a start-up you should be
focusing on the good not the bad think
about what's working and then make
to double down on it so one example we
were in so many different cities but we
were trying to get more cities and
maximize revenue of all those cities it
took us a few months to really realize
that oh hey certain cities are doing
five times better than these other
cities and then once we focused on those
cities and sort of double down on them
our revenue drastically increased right
and this was really great so think about
the great stuff not the bad stuff and
hopefully that helps you a little bit I
think another thing is incremental
progress so sometimes when you're
building a company you think things
should be big and flashy all the time
and in the beginning they are because
it's like we didn't have a product we
have a product oh my god somebody wrote
about us oh my god I'm making a first
hire right but as you get more mature
you realize that not everything is
magical every single week and focusing
on continued progress and incremental
progress is what is going to help you
succeed so when you see things in the
media like you know uber being so
successful it took them a while to do
that right you just didn't see all the
incremental progress customers yes you
should absolutely focus on learning from
your unhappy customers but again I think
when you when you focus on problems and
you look at the squeaky wheel you want
to fix the squeaky wheel you have to
take a step back sometimes when you're
stuck on a problem and just think about
like do I really want to solve this
problem does this really matter or not I
mean obviously make sure that you're
leaving your customer in good hands or
giving good explanations and treating
them well but at the same time if your
customer is like not using the product
the way you want it to and you don't
want to focus on it you sort of need to
let go of that problem and focus on
other things the last topic we're going
to talk about is being a founder and the
struggles you go through with this so
sometimes the only thing holding you
back is yourself it's always the right
choice to move forward in a business
instead of delaying for some concept of
perfection things should always be good
enough to release and then be released
because if you never test the market or
your ideas you're never going to figure
out what actually works another big one
is taking ownership of key processes if
you don't understand
thing well if there's a key process and
you're not managing yourself or figuring
it out yourself or somebody from your
core team isn't doing it then I
guarantee you you're not going to be
successful because if you don't know
then you can't manage right if you can't
manage then you don't really have
anything so you can compare this to code
review it's like if I'm code reviewing
webassembly uh-huh I don't know I mean I
have no idea what to do with that
information right so as I was building
out my sales process
I knew marketing but I didn't know sales
and so I wasn't able to tell somebody
was doing their job and by the time the
time had passed it was too late right
and I had to let people go so um god I
talked about firing a lot of people but
I mean there's turn and startup so I had
to go through four key sales hires to
figure out what was working and what was
not and it wasn't until I took ownership
of that sales process and figured it out
myself that I was successful and it was
one of the most frustrating parts of the
company for me and building the company
but it was also definitely to this day
one of the most rewarding things and one
of the things I use like finally
figuring out sales to build my companies
so please do that people people are so
important I think my philosophy is
always you should leave people better
than you found them so back to my
comment about figuring out what people
want to do with their lives they're on
this journey with you they're building
this company with you right it's so
important to understand who they are and
how you can help them along in their
journey for life so that you can have a
meaningful impact in their lives because
startup you know your starter is gonna
fail or not right but those
relationships you build and being able
to make a good impact on the people you
employ or your co-founders or whoever is
I feel like more important than just
building something feedback if people
tell you something's wrong don't get mad
at them so if Ben told me Jay was mad at
me I think ice on the bones I'm just
kidding but if Ben was like hey Tracy
Jay is really mad at you I I have I I
can say Ben
what the hell like why are you talk why
why are you causing drama within the
company or like Jay what the hell why
are you talking about me why didn't you
come to me right I can do those things
but it's really destructive how he
should actually react is oh my god this
is so great you should be really
thankful that Ben is willing to come to
you and talk to you about a problem
because now you have a problem you know
there's a problem and you can fix that
problem right so these back channels
that are created within your company you
should listen to and I think you need to
not be confrontational but you also need
to show your team that you're willing to
help solve those problems and you're
willing to change like you're willing to
take feedback and fix it right but also
Stanground would need it so this is this
is an important thing for being a
founder we went through a bunch of
things today obviously a sales a
marketing managing tech growth and
culture focus being a founder I think
one thing to remember is that startup is
simply about taking the first step right
if you have already taken that first
step but you should make sure to thank
yourself and be nice to yourself for all
the hard work and the courage you've had
to actually do so when you're thinking
about what you're building or what
you're about to build I think some where
words of advice from aaron levi who
co-founded box he said the product that
wins is the one that bridges customers
to the future not the one that requires
a giant leap so time a time again I've
said this a few times is we hear quotes
from entrepreneurs is make incremental
progress to push your life and the life
of your startup forward versus waiting
for those big things that happen I think
one of the most important things in life
right is just growth if you have growth
and you have progress for your own
personal sake or for your company's sake
that should be enough for you and I just
want to leave you with that so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
