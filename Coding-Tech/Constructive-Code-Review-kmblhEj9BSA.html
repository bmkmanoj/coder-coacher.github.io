big room this is gonna be about how to
run code reviews so you build the best
possible product but also build people
up and build yourself up while doing it
so code review is to have this
connotation of sitting in a stale
conference room pointing at stale code
with stale long sticks modern code
review is still stale but generally
asynchronous and web-based and so we
can't we have all these advantages with
it we can take you can take your time
and do it whenever you want but then
there are still some disadvantages like
we use that we lose rather the ability
to build rapport or face to face I'm
gonna offer some suggestions on how to
overcome this and other disadvantages
and get the most out of a very valuable
practice I've been through hundreds of
code reviews both giving and receiving
I've worked my whole career almost an
open source of various kinds where
reviews are not we never stop arguing
about code you may recognize my name
from such open source libraries as
parsimonious more itertools blessings
we're all learning about code on those
things I've been with Mozilla for seven
years where everything we do is open
source and goes through code review so
I've also spent a lot of time mentoring
interns junior devs showing them how to
review and be reviewed the goals of a
good review are three build a good
product and this is a code review kind
of fills the role of ensuring that the
thing works beyond what our tools and
our tests can tell us by rubbing a
second brain over it rubbing a second
brain over it also ensures that the code
is understandable to people who didn't
write it second we build excellent
programmers we spread knowledge of the
codebase like well your reimplemented
this but there's a routine over here in
the utils module that does it
we spread raw competence like hey did
you know about generator expressions and
we can make this lazy and not concretize
the whole list all at once and we spread
the love of the craft of programming I
mean really what an amazing privilege it
is to program what could be more
creative than not only authoring a thing
like a an author of human text does but
having it run with a life of its own
Wow I want to spread that joy to as many
people as possible and then third in
code review you build yourself whether
it's
working with volunteer contribs users
clients are paying customers it's easy
for their demands to build up and make
you feel like you don't control your own
time like you're just guilty all the
time I should really be working harder
and harder and I'll give you some tools
to avoid burning out on that now of
course the opposite of these good things
can happen you can waste time nitpicking
you can tear people down or you can burn
yourself out through failure to set and
enforce personal boundaries and this is
a real problem because coding is
creative work and creative work is
powered by enthusiasm this is
particularly true of open source even
when it comes with a paycheck
we we are an intrinsically motivated
crowd especially the kinds of people who
come to PyCon right and kind of open
source people I make my living doing
this but I don't get paid to program I
see it as I get paid so I can spend my
time programming rather than getting
money some other way now the creative
spark is a fragile thing and it's all
too easy to snuff it out in people
if you're lucky and this is the best
case they'll quit if you're unlucky they
will hang around and they'll write bad
code so how do we preserve or even fan
brighter this creative spark we do it
through equal parts truth and kindness
you'll see that everything I say today
is gonna be motivated by one or the
other of these because after all the
thing has to run on a machine made of
metal can't argue with reality but on
the other hand we're all these squishy
emotional beings and we need to lift
sometimes so let's start with some truth
the clarity of explanation as you're
looking through the code what did you
find this comment is self descriptive a
better comment would have actually
explained what happened okay well like
this could happen temporarily and that
moves to the next thing and it goes
through this routine it gets caught up
in the gears and we ended up with a use
after free and we could have a security
hole now specific is good but not
sufficient we also need to be durable
our comments need to be durable over
time and over code based change so if I
were to have a link in there and point
off to some thing in the master
and we did this review a month later the
master branch has moved man those lines
of code they're all over the place now
people have added people deleted if
you're gonna link link to a specific
commit we also have to be durable over
what time they're gonna be looking at it
I mean so that month has gone by again
if my comment said hey you remember when
we talked about yesterday yeah do that
not helpful
remember last er day we talked about it
in the chatroom maybe also not helpful
if not everybody keeps chat logs see
what you said in the chat room maybe we
talked about that thing and the free
after whatever and then would be good in
fact heck if somebody comes back to me a
month after I made a comment and said
hey what did you mean by that
so most review systems are web-based for
better or worse so why not at least use
the affordances that the web gives you
most of these systems have code for
formatting for code snippets so learn it
and you can use that same thing to paste
in a repple session this Python has a
lovely interactive interpreter you can
paste stuff in there you can say well I
ran your procedure on the number three
and it exploded and look see you can
have links after all this is a big
hypertext links to specific commits
remember links to relevant documentation
and these kinds of more specific again
but language neutral comments are really
nice because for some people English is
not a first language some people don't
know each other well and can't can't
interpret your hand-wavy comments or
take your sarcasm some people are new to
the project and need the extra context
if these pointers provide and some
people just haven't had their morning
coffee now sometimes in the course of a
review comments go back comments go
forth and you find yourself talking past
each other you're just not getting your
point across in those cases you can up
the game to a higher bandwidth medium
like a video call or an audio call or
having for bid pick up the telephone if
they still know what those are and don't
just do it any old time and interrupt
them out of their engineering day agree
at a time in advance and make your call
sometimes your time zones are different
and whatever you do afterwards be sure
to write down the results because some
people are not in the conversation and
it gets worse as time passes and no one
remembers the
conversation clarity of explanation has
a little brother clarity of expectation
be clear not only about what you found
but what you're asking the person to do
about it and how much you care not such
a great comment yet again but if we say
all right I like to do this but it
doesn't need to hold things up it's not
a showstopper that's that's great
in fact I bias toward merging things in
quickly and not continuing to nitpick
and nitpick and nitpick because after
all if it's better than it was why not
let everybody enjoy that better you can
almost put off the polish unless it's a
security hole or it's a typo they take
you no longer to file than to fix what
other wonderful things do we have we
have the wonderful github reviews which
are a relatively new feature and they
lets you be more kind of enumerated lis
explicit about I'm just saying or do I
actually require this change in order
for me to in good conscience approve
this bias toward I'm just saying it's my
opinion and then at last when I'm done
reviewing a patch I like to be even more
explicit about my expectations by saying
that's all I see with those changes I
think this is ready to merge that lets
know I'm done lets me know I'm done if I
come back and look at it later and it
ends with a little note of encouragement
a little bit of kindness once we have
those two great truth bringing clarity's
in place we can move on to some kindness
now none of us likes to be criticized so
code review is this really kind of
unnatural act you're asking for critical
feedback it's a really bizarre sort of
thing and our human tendency when when
critiqued is to react to it and if you
scan somebody's amygdala you find it
reacts in the same way is if you had
thrown like a vlog at their head it's
like a physical attack oh don't don't
critique my code I love my code so even
when you don't take the time to really
softly wordsmith things it's easy for
people to take offense and things to get
out of control and you have you have bad
faith going back and forth and so since
nobody does have time to wordsmith
every little comment here are some quick
hacks that impart tack without requiring
you to be shakespeare the simplest of
these is the humble question mark Thank
You dr. evil there is no point returning
path results when there's more than one
term a little Stern maybe a little
arrogant verses can you remind me of
some use cases for returning path
results when there's more than one term
yeah a little a little more inviting a
little more open and this is an actual
review that I did with my my intern a
couple of summers ago and in this case
there was a little bonus in that it let
me save face because there's totally
used cases for that they're really
prominent a second bonus is oftentimes
the question mark will activate the
Socratic method
imagine a review would say hey what if
we had another thread going here the
road to this variable Oh says the other
person maybe we could have a race
condition and then maybe yes I see but
then and then what if there was
sensitive data and okay I'll go fix that
so now maybe you've got your point
across
maybe you've taught somebody something
and you've done it together you we in
this so if you say you a lot it feels
like an attack alot if you do it this
way you're gonna mess it up you idiot
first as if we are doing it we're
building something together you know if
we divide it by four we have two in
every textbook II kind of way and if
that's too textbook II for you you can
always keep it about the code and say
well this this casting will behave thus
tack tack number three is the good old
compliment of course there's the old
trick if you're gonna say if you have to
say something critical say something
complimentary before and afterward
compliment sandwich that helps cushion
the blow the best time for compliments I
find is early to set the tone and I like
to compliment the spirit of the patch
before I look at it I like to say oh wow
look at this feature you implemented I'm
really excited to get it I know yours is
gonna be excited let me take a look and
I'm able to make this this
positive comment because I haven't seen
the code yet a favorite of mine is hell
thank you so much for refactoring that
scary mess that I wrote last week and
compliments can of course go both ways
hey thanks for catching that reviewer
good catch you eyes didn't snow what
about that oh you saved a big bug good
job tactic number four is humor a couple
of cute kitties always improve
somebody's day Mozilla's reviews in
particular seem to be awash in animated
gifs lately and it keeps things
light-hearted and fun and this should be
fun right we get to be creative we get
to make stuff we get to sit in a comfy
chair and press buttons all day in an
air-conditioned room this is a good gig
so question marks you we this
compliments and humor these are some
tactics we can use to soften our
critiques now aside from being harsh let
us see some other anti patterns that
reviews could fall into
have you ever submitted a thousand line
patch have you ever gotten this in
response
the only solution to this is to make
these long patches somehow less dreadful
because somebody looked at this and said
it's fine it's fine the best
contributors to my projects the ones
that I end up hanging handing the reins
over to eventually submit patches that
are a pleasure to review even if they're
long and the way they do this these
champion committers is their pull
requests comment you're the one that
encompasses the entire patch here's a
couple of paragraphs long it's like the
abstract to an academic paper it says
here's the problem I approached I
thought about this alternative in this
alternative and I chose this alternative
because of this okay great that's
totally easy for me you took another
five minutes and save me reverse
engineering the state of your entire
brain and getting it wrong so good use
of time team time and they have long
commit messages to these long commitment
I've so a more inner tools project is
you know eighter tools these things so
performance matters and some of my
champion committers have put benchmark
results right there in the in the commit
message like wait look it's 5% faster oh
okay great I can just hit merge I can I
can run your example and say yes there
commit sir are small and logical they do
one thing at first I fixed the
formatting and then I added this routine
I needed and then I implemented this
user-facing feature using it and finally
they the comment code where they
couldn't make it clear in a different
way they have great doc strings on
everything because nothing's ever
obvious may think it's obvious that's
totally not obvious and they named
things well routines and objects and
attributes and such when you get a
thousand line patch without these things
do not by any means feel guilty about
asking for them it is gonna take less
time I promise for that person to clean
it up then it would take for you again
to try to get inside their head
magically and figure it out and of
course the opposite is also true when
you submit a patch do you this is a
checklist now sometimes you're in the
heat of a good hack right and you're not
really proceeding block-by-block from
small structured commits to small
structured commits that's just not
reality sometimes you need to make a
large sketch of a big portion of the
program just just a reflection idea out
or see if something is even plausible
and in those cases you can use a tool
like get X this is the Mac one is there
get K does similar things it's gtk base
2 runs anywhere and I'm sure there are
others and these let you and get anyhow
stage not use the jargon they let you
break up changes after the fact into
commits these lines go in this commit
this line goes and that commit these
lines go in that one this is the thing
called interactive staging if you want
to read about it more and there is a
command-line interface to this but it is
horrible and should be avoided because
it's this nivel 20 questions thing
that's hard to back out of it's very
modal just get the clicky thing you'll
be much better off the other thing these
tools help with is they show your diffs
you should totally read your diffs every
time before you submit before you commit
even I mean who would give somebody a
non-trivial piece of writing without
ever proofreading but that's that's
silly pulling will do that caught so
many print statements and debugger break
points with these things it's not even
funny
and because we spent so much of our time
looking at disconsolate Lee it's hugely
worth it to get a diff viewer that you
like I find the unified DIF red and
green Christmas tree kind of distant I
find that kind of hard to grok after it
gets past a certain complexity I have to
use a part of my lexical brain to say
well red means deleted in green and
that's brain power I don't have anymore
to think what the code means so I like
something like a file merge on the Mac
and this is a free thing it comes with
Xcode I love it because of the Bezier
curves it's a little thing but it has an
outsized effect on me like this line
balloons into those lines and these
collapse into those and I don't need to
use any electrical power at all
all this old next-step stuff is great
from 1996 and a whole different
operating system it'll different IRA
directory trees for you it wires nicely
into your version control system you can
do merge conflict resolution with it
you drag that bottom little handle up
and you get a third pane where you can
do freeform editing if the back and
forth isn't enough great tool it's not
the only one like this go shopping and
find something that fits your brain so
those are long patches little patch did
this ever happen to your one-line patch
yeah people just felt like they had to
say something didn't they
so nitpicks by definition there's small
things but they can add up to a big
effect it's a continual pitter-patter of
discouragement it makes it hard to move
fast and discourage you from making
small fixes I've even left a team
because of a nitpicking culture in part
and because it's a cultural problem
it needs a cultural solution although
this stuff comes down to interpersonal
stuff nitpicking often comes out of
people groping for status trying to
justify their existence because they're
insecure or I found something wrong with
that big fancy coders code so now I'm a
big fancy coder like really and when you
get into second grade so the solution
for this is self confidence and I'm
sorry to say that because self
confidence is tricky it's almost a
misnomer because you can't give yourself
self confidence you can't go and sit in
the room and like gin it up but
fortunately it's easy to give other
people self confidence and you should
practice this in your team all the time
and I say team loosely whoever you're
working for is if you're on the same
team you're not working against each
other be generous be frequent with your
compliments give credit where credit is
due
often and in public right always give
your compliments in public and give your
critiques in private and code remix that
really hard but nobody's reading your
review of that involved in who wants to
read extra reviews right what else we
got
yeah remember what it costs to sit there
in that chair per hour remember what
they're paying you what your client is
paying you and throttle accordingly
right do you want this really worth long
per hour is it with that per hour for
them to address it and if you do all
this stuff consistently you'll see half
of these nitpicks just evaporate the
other half of nitpicks have a semi
mechanical solution do you have a style
guide for your project you should have a
style guide and this lets you have every
argument about style only once these are
great places to start if you're not
familiar with a Python enhancement
proposals these peps Google pep 8 talks
about whitespace and spelling and other
such glorious things pep 2
five seven builds on that talks about
docstrings the phrasing the formatting
there's the Polka style guide that I
like Armin reinecker and his his buddies
put that together and it kind of fills
in the holes where that leaves off and
then finally we have Sphinx formatting
that I use for argument function
arguments which the rest of them don't
talk about and it's a nice terse syntax
and it brings with it the advantage that
you can run the Sphinx documentation
tool over your code afterwards and get
nice talks out why not now once you've
chosen a style guide you can automate
the style checks using a linter who
knows about linters everybody knows
about linters long winters okay
a popular linter for python is flake
eight it's fine but be careful because
overzealous linters hurt the
understandability of your code code is
for humans I would pause it and if you
end up with these little these linter
turds everywhere
and they get longer - those are short
ones but I mean they get kind of crazy
and if you have them all over the place
you need to turn that stuff down cuz you
have to read past it all the time you
think oh come on it's valuable no no
it's for a computer and your tools
should serve you not the other way
around with a healthy culture and
mechanical support turn to a a you know
rigged so that it only enforces what
everybody agrees on all the time you
should be able to spend your review time
on things that matter not little
nitpicks here's another thing that stops
up a lot of projects have you ever made
a change to a function and then someone
comes along and says oh can you fix the
rest of that module while you're at it
it's been a mess for years we have a
joke at Mozilla which is kind of a haha
only serious that if you touch a
particularly icky bit of code you now
own it forever try to keep that in the
realm of haha or there becomes a
disincentive for fixing broken windows
right and the idea after all is for the
codebase to be continually getting
better not being perfect
so yes point out problems if it's not
going to distract
but don't block an unrelated patch on
them or distract the submitter by you
know jumping into the middle of a
relevant thing with the Nero relevancy
and as I said my rubric for merging to
master is just better great Mergent and
if you pull down the slides afterwards
these are actually links up to the c2
wiki the original wards wiki
particularly good entry points any time
wasted reading words wiki is time not
wasted it is energizing to your patches
turned around quickly and the opposite
to get them turned around very slowly so
even if you aren't able to be
comprehensive right now you can say I
see this in this at a glance looks
pretty good otherwise I'll give you a
full review in a couple of weeks or I
don't know what I'm gonna be able to get
to this somebody else could feel - feel
free to jump in and finish it don't feel
like you married a patch just because
you said something on it also because
stuff falls out of working memory very
fast and is expensive to load back in
for the patch submitter it's important
to address it while they still have
still remember what the heck they were
thinking the other time it's really
important to turn around quickly is if
you have to say no to somebody if you
have to say this is philosophically
against our project or you need to
rethink your approach or there's a big
thing going to land and just obliterate
this in a minute it's best to do that
quickly so that they don't waste their
time waiting around for Santa Claus or
building more castles on a sandy
foundation so so far I've been giving
very specific cases but now I want to
talk about the more general emotional
issues behind them
for instance insecurity is probably my
least favorite human emotion I think
it's called caused Wars and it's just a
kind of fear that's all it is
what are we fearing when we're insecure
we're fearing at the time that people
will find out that we're incompetent to
some degree almost everybody feels this
doesn't really go away impostor syndrome
that's what this is I read a little
long-form tweet earlier in the week by
the author Neil Gaiman he was at some
kind of awards banquet for Wolfer
various things and he ended up in the
back of the room and he hit it off with
another guy who was there because both
of their first names were Neil and
the other guy was was complaining to him
he said I hate coming to these things i
this room full of creative people who
made all these wonderful things and all
I ever did was go where I was sent it
turned out the guy was Neil Armstrong so
if it's good enough for the first man on
the moon it's good enough for me right
realize nobody's judging you because
they're worried about you judging them
they're all wrapped up in their own
thing thinking about you at all but
they're not thinking about you at all so
hey you can just go ahead and do the
best job you know how to do worrying
about nothing but your own concept of
good work likewise don't take it too
hard when somebody does find something
to critique in your code sometimes it's
just having a fresh set of eyes we all
have that sometimes they genuinely know
something you didn't in which case
you'll know it afterwards so really you
win either way
nobody should lose in code review it's
not a game the final defense against
insecurity is to notice when you're
feeling a strong emotion notice it and
name it I'm feeling anger I'm feeling
disappointment I'm feeling fear why am i
feeling that way is the next question
and sometimes you will not be able to
answer that question and it'll be
because you skipped breakfast
or because your dog is sick in which
case it's pretty easy to dismiss these
things sometimes sometimes it's for
because you actually do believe
something that isn't true like boy it
really matters that I can spell this
variable the way that I want or it
really matters that I win on my team for
some value of win and you can refute
those a little cognitive behavioral
therapy you can even say it's not true
and kind of let go with that stuff a bit
but emotions once you feel them take
some time to clear have you ever had a
dream that really hit you hard and
you're really sad in the dream really
afraid in the dream or and it kind of
stuck with you the whole day long and
all day you felt yourself easily falling
back into sadness or whatever the
emotion was there's this chemical
persistence that happens with emotions
it's these chemical sponges these
neurotransmitters get out of the gate
and they attach to things and they
literally take about 10 minutes to be
reuptake
and filed away so when you find yourself
feeling a strong emotion and it's and
you don't want to speak out of it
because I almost make bad decisions when
I'm doing that it's a great time for
lunch that's what it means it means it's
time for lunch
it's time for a walk jump up and down
get the blood flowing get those
neurotransmitters back in the box and
you won't regret what you say
speaking of emotions one way I often
feel is short on time anybody else
nobody feels that way he'll skip this
one so there will always be more to
review than can be reviewed there will
always be more to do than can be done
broadly in life in general for a period
of years I would be viscerally repulsed
by the pile of poor requests stacking up
on my open-source projects as they would
stack up I would feel even worse and
become even less likely to look at them
say it stack up even higher and just
goes around and around and around and
finally I had to come to peace with the
fact there's always gonna be more to do
than I can do in fact if we were to list
out all the constructive things that we
have the option of doing at any one time
it would be a couple of hundred hours of
work even if you were to take a couple
of weeks off you would never catch up I
mean you maybe you get some of those
things done but they keep on coming in
as of two days ago my list of things I
could be doing was a hundred and
sixty-one items long I keep a list and
so we only have three options open to us
we can lower our standards and probably
still not get everything done we can
give up on sleep or we can choose just
to do the most important things so then
the only question is what are the most
important things how do we determine
that six years ago my coworker Chris
wandered by my desk with a stack of
these getting things done books and I
said hey free book and I took it and it
sat on my shelf for six years because
some business starchy guy talking to me
about how to run my life and making it
overcomplicated strict system
I'm afraid of free spirit man right so I
spent years feeling guilty instead as
those thoughts magda me you should be
doing this over here
not that Oh
you should be doing this over here Oh No
and that's why it's not my life it's
really obnoxious so today though I have
almost no open-source guilt I've been
more responsive as many contributor can
tell you and I've been an inbox zero for
a year both personally and
professionally and it's easy crazypants
I can't tell you many times I've tried
before that so I made a one slide
version of this book so this looks like
a lot but it's just a couple of branches
it's only a couple decisions in this
tree now so when you're doing one thing
and that nagging thought comes in maybe
you should be doing this other thing
instead of having it go around and
around in your head and distract you
you write it down an index card throw it
in a bucket write a text file throw in a
folder whatever you want to collect them
and collect them in an inbox of some
kind then go back to what you were doing
and you'll feel you'll feel at peace
because you know it's not gonna get
forgotten you don't rehearse it your
brain knows that once a day go through
your bucket and then push those each
index card down through the rest of
these this decision tree so let's say oh
I should take a vacation to Europe this
summer summer is coming up ok write that
down and later when we go and see it we
say ok well let's see is it actionable
yeah I could totally start working on
that I can start researching for example
so we go down that left-hand path what's
the next action maybe go TripAdvisor and
see what people like all right will that
finish it well no I still have to book
travel and do everything else so if
that's actually a project and a project
is a multi-step to do and so what we do
is we write go and be good you plan a
vacation to Europe at the top of the
index card and then once we do that
action and it's empty we know well is
the vacation to your plant no ok so I
know but I had a new thing it's a
prompting to add a new thing later on
let's take another example I have a
staircase in my house and I have a
filing cabinet at the top of the
staircase which is a stupid place for a
filing cabinet that's where it is and so
what actually happens is the stairs
become the filing cabinet and I would
walk through my house I work from home I
walk through the house and I see the
stairs and I see stuff on the stairs and
I said I use lesan I'm so futile I can't
even get the stuff off the stairs how am
I gonna get any work done and so hmm
there's stuff on the stairs hmm well it
goes into the inbox is it actionable
yeah what is the action put the stuff
off the stairs and file it will it take
less than two minutes heck yeah just do
it right now don't even write on the
index card the two minutes yeah just do
it and the stairs have been empty for
the most part I'm not perfect the stairs
have mostly been empty and when I pass
the empty stairs I think I'm a useful
person I can get stuff off the stairs
maybe I can even do something else and
it tends a cascades into the next thing
and you get rolling so when you're like
stuck in your work do something stupid
wash the dishes and see if it bleeds
into the next thing more than often more
likely than not it will if you take
nothing else from this slide if it's too
starchy for you just take the two-minute
rule it is the best part of the book it
will handle 80% of your email by itself
it will ass wage 80% of your guilt and
and let's do the other example of stuff
do the else okay PR to review right so
if this PR and it's actionable yeah so
so what do I do with it well I can
delegate it to somebody else I don't do
this much if your manager you do it more
if you're married you can tell you it's
tough to each other you want to take the
car for the oil change or not okay I'll
do it
calendar it can go in your calendar but
only if it is something that has to
happen at that one time it can happen to
no other time I have a haircut
appointment from noon to 1:00 on
Wednesday that's yet if I don't get it
then the appointments up and it'll take
me weeks to get another one otherwise it
goes on to the next list and that's the
one with 130 things those are all the
things that I've decided to do I decided
they're worthy of doing and I can choose
to do at any one time I go through that
every day and I make kind of a little
today list like to do today so and the
reason this whole thing works is by
logarithms which I'm not getting a
little head of myself first let me show
you the other the other branch up top
let's say we have a pull request to
review that it's not actionable because
it's a second-round review Sally made
some code I made some comments Sally's
gonna go address those comments and then
we'll do the second round review but
Sally's not done yet so you know in came
the github notification email that she's
made some changes but she's not done yet
so that
No well is it something we put in
reference like my personal wiki or
electronic filing cabinet for later no
not really
let's see if that gets better is it
something we should defer until another
date yeah quite possibly maybe I have my
little computer system say I bother me
about that in a week and until then I
don't want to see it or maybe it goes
into a someday list if I don't even know
when I want to be notified about it and
I think if this is a someday maybe list
like someday maybe I'd like to go see
the pyramids but I'm not committed to it
so I'll just kind of throw it in that
bin and then what I will do is I will
review it every week that's the other
piece of glue that holds this whole
system together the weekly review every
week you look at your someday list you
pick things out of it and promote them
to the next list you look at the next
list you say I don't really want to do
that after all it's no longer important
to anymore and you push it back into the
sunday list or you look at things on the
sunday list and you say I don't know
what I was thinking there that no longer
applies she goes into the trash and so
what I was thinking bout logarithms
logarithms and we know about trees right
as programmers the reason this whole
thing works is it's order log n every
week we look at the sunday list and we
you know take some parts of that big
list and put on the next list every day
we look at the next list which is
smaller and take parts of it put on the
fidei list
now that dabei list is only you know 10
or 14 things long and we can linearly
scan that all day long without going out
of our minds in fact if you have you
know I have maybe 200 items in here but
if you have a thousand if you have
really you'd have to have about ten
thousand to a hundred thousand to to
justify this but you could add another
you can add another level I actually
have a double someday for stuff that I
don't review every week I look at it
once a month I don't need to decide
about the pyramids every every week and
that's really the whole book that's
really it and as a result I don't feel
guilty anymore I don't forget stuff
anymore and let me give you a little
word about inbox zero and why it's in to
be it inbox zero and I don't I don't
think people talk enough about why it's
important and it's really important
because inboxes make a crappy UI for a
to-do list right if you let your if you
let your email box be a to-do list
it's a to-do list that somebody else
that's the priorities on without
thinking it's always the latest thing
it's at the topic is that the most
important probably not because the email
box is a nexus of lots of different
things coming together you end up doing
this repeated linear scanning through it
all the time there's not a plane I
didn't know what was an appointment
appointment on your calendar well is
that where's that reference material I
need it was in the mail box because it's
not in the reference database where it
should be what should I do next look at
my to-do list look at my patch queue let
me look at the email box and you end up
scanning through each of these emails
more than once why should you ever read
an email more than once
unless you enjoy reading it you
shouldn't that stuff goes right into the
inbox I triage my email maybe once a day
and I do the same stuff with it the
appointments go in the calendar the to
do things go in the next list and the
reference material goes into reference
and frankly most of it goes into the
trash aka archive oh the other thing of
course if you look at your email box
most of these things you can only see
one or two dozen emails at the most at a
time and once something has fallen
behind the below the fold no matter how
many flags you've applied to it you're
never gonna see that again and the whole
thing adds up to no longer dreading
looking at your mailbox don't you hate
that you have something you're supposed
to do like my mailbox was my papers on
the stairs every time I would hit f9
bring my mail program for it that feels
bad let me avoid that work it's usually
not by doing something better usually by
reading flash dot or something looking
at an empty email windows is there a
nice boost another outworking of this
system is that I've taken my pour
requests and I've batch those kind of
like like a batched
inbox I used to have this continual
pitter-patter of guilt as SPRs hit my
box like oh I should I should be working
on parsimonious and they found a bug and
I'm never gonna get to that Nate stack
up so instead now what happens is I
filter all those open source requests
for all my projects into a an open
source requests mailbox and I look at it
once a week I look at it every Wednesday
every repeating to do says hey look at
that and what do I do when I look at it
I push it through that whole diagram
again and I triage
and you know 80% of those males get
answered because they take less than two
minutes and people appreciate that and
my projects have picked up even though
I'm not really doing any more work
champion committers help I do have one
of those on one of the projects what
other good things are there so there
yeah there are still things that are not
2 minutes we have things that I dread so
much that it takes me a month or two to
get to them and that hasn't changed it
was always going to take me a month to
get to them it takes me a month now but
now I don't feel guilty about it and the
guilt doesn't do anybody any good
so why not just accept it the other time
we can feel short on time is when
dealing with newcomers and newcomers are
great we must embrace newcomers unless
we plan to live forever and work on the
same projects for ever and ever and who
wants to do that right yeah so but it's
easy to feel like we're getting a bad
return on investment bringing them up so
I don't spend much time on new contribs
the moment they show up I think that's
well that's okay instead my investment
kind of parallels theirs I think that's
I think that's morally good when they
first show up they're at level one they
don't know where to start maybe they
don't know the language the Python or
HTML or whatever it is and so what do I
do I say well here's some Docs you can
you can learn that here's a tutorial in
a book whatever it is I like here's the
list of good first bugs you might want
to try after that maybe I think this one
is particularly appropriate to your
interests and have fun and off they go
sometimes they don't come back and
that's fine but the self driven ones
self-select and they come roaring back
with a patch and it's nasty and so what
do I do I fix the patch I fix it for
them I put commits on top of theirs I
leave there's their so they get their
face and github and get to feel good but
I fix it up better it's some tests and I
murdered and I say thank you so much
please come again
the second time they come back they're
at level 2 this time I don't fix their
stuff I say could you fix that and I see
this and what do you think of this over
here and they fix it up and they learn a
little more version control and they
learn the code review skills
maybe I'll write their tests for them
and then we merge it in and then the
third time I require them to write the
tests - and they're a full fledged
developer better but at least they're
doing all the things now trust Trust is
such an important component of the
mutual respect that we need in order to
do good code review the Trust Bank is an
idea that comes out of horse training
right the more you feed the horse some
sugar cubes and then you have to hit the
horse with the horse City thing later
the horse won't take it out on you we'd
be able to take it cuz he knows you know
me mean well it'll give me the benefit
of the doubt so the trouble is it's
easiest to build trust between humans
face-to-face for whatever legacy reasons
so if that's funny but it always is so
if your remote your remote worker like I
am when you're in person with your team
if you're lucky enough to be make a
point of establishing good relations
with them you know throw the frisbee
around have a meal tell good hundred
jokes and then when you have to critique
each other later or talk on a low
bandwidth medium like IRC you'll know
how to take each other you'll built up
some defense against a fence if you will
and then finally you have these other
feelings you don't know what to do with
like when I look at a patch I don't like
it it feels too icky to merge but I
can't really articulate why at least at
least I can just fall back to
articulating my emotions I'm worried
about this especially right here I can't
really put my finger on it but something
about this destination program the
global right lock and feel like it's
messy what do you think you don't have
to be definitive decisive or
authoritative all the time you just
treat everybody like adults and invite
them into the conversation and and you
dialogue and and hopefully you come to a
better solution than you would have
yourself just kind of just sitting there
ignoring it remember you are never alone
in a code review take advantage of that
fact so next time you are in a code
review keep these principles handy and
let them help you to build your projects
and build yourself and build up each
other thank you so much
we have time for a few questions
if you come up to the microphones if you
have any so if the people were reviewing
feel insecure how do we make our
comments sound sincere as opposed to
this is something I learned in a talk
and so I'm doing it right now
so make sense I mean always be sincere
never never what is the word pedantic is
not it never talk down to people I mean
always be honest but always be kind as
well so that's that's the knife-edge you
want to walk these are mechanistic
things for giving you ideas if you're
just like I'm busy I can't think of a
way to do this and the alternative is to
be mean the question mark is my favorite
I'm agree phrasing is a question that
doesn't make it any less sincere but it
softens it any others yeah how do you
deal with nitpickers on your team it is
nitpickers well I don't have the problem
of nitpickers right now because I'm kind
of a lone gun lately and the people in
my projects don't seem to be nit pickers
but look it immediately comes to mind is
I can say is this something we need to
block the patch on or can we push it
ahead into a different file it is a bug
and come back to it later or we can say
is there way we can automate this so
that you don't have to pick that in it
next time but really I think that the if
those don't work and then really the
base thing is to establish a good
relationship with the nitpicker take the
nitpicker to lunch not just one on one
because it's kind of weird but at least
go with three people and build a
friendship so that then you can say
really really and they give you the
benefit of the doubt yeah generally if
you're going to have to if you have to
argue with somebody argue out loud
because as soon as you write it down it
gets
much much louder hi thank you for your
talk I really liked the sort of managing
your workflow and I was curious what
tools you use to do that
yeah I use the things app on my iPhone
and Mac I use it because it's not
cross-platform other good stuff is the
todoist I think you have to rent that
one there's to do number two do I think
those are some of those are web-based
those are both good though you can
totally do it on paper oh oh that's in
that whole flow chart that's just lists
it's just lists have you ever used
Trello I have not used Trello yeah I'm
thinking of doing okay getting things
done open space later on so if come up
afterwards find me I'll kept getting out
of the way and if enough people come up
I'll actually do it thank you very much
for the talk a lot of this stuff seems
to apply in teams but you know if your
team of one how would you adapt this to
you do you remove yourself oh yeah do I
personally know yeah tell me tell me how
you how does code review apply to your
lack of a team I mean I work in a team
right but like I can imagine if you're a
solo developer working on your own
project maybe you have a hobby thing
that you're doing in your in your off
time right how do you apply this like to
yourself well I mean what happens to me
so I was a solo on all of my open-source
projects that I started by myself and
then people came in later and did a
better job and I did what you don't get
if you get if you don't get
contributions and I do you do get
support requests and you can treat them
with this many of these same tools the
same kind of you know time-saving
workflows the same kind of interpersonal
stuff because they're people too even
users or people I know it's a
contentious issue but I'm staying by
that that's all we have time for thank
the speaker again please thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
