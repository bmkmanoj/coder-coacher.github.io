there are two sides to the story there's
the technical side of the story and
there is also the leadership part of the
story and unlike my diagram these will
never be balanced like equally on each
sides I hope to provide some tips for
both of these we're going to start with
the the technical parts but just one
warning like any leadership function a
bad technical lead can make things worse
so with these tips I hope to prevent
that so the first tip is be an advocate
for change so that means that you create
like an atmosphere a culture of positive
evolution so when you notice that a
certain process is slow or cumbersome or
maybe it's just stupid if you have ever
worked for like a large corporation you
have seen stupid I'm pretty sure that
you have you should embrace that you
should seed it and we will try to make
it better now that's pretty easy to say
but how can we do this how can we
advocate for change and one way that I
particularly like is a pattern called
double Oda it's called observe orient
decide act actually call also called the
the Deming cycle now what is this mean
in the observation face you will be
looking at from within the project
what's happening in the projects for
example you have tests that like
sometimes they fail then run the test
again and they don't fail anymore or
bills that sometimes fail that's like
it's an annoyance in the orientation
phase you will use your experience or
the experience of your teammates to look
at that particular problem why are these
tests sometimes failing it might be race
conditions at things like that so when
you have identified the the cause of the
observations that you made you should
make you should decide on how you're
going to solve this maybe you need to
appoint someone specific to look at okay
this is the errors that are being caused
by the bills you will look into that and
that also might be technically of course
and then if you made a decision of
course you need to act upon it I was
really cool about the Deming cycle is
that it's a reentrant loop so if you do
certain actions it is perfectly possible
at least in new observations so maybe
the test that was failing in the past
doesn't fail anymore but all the other
tests are failing so then you should
probably have
taking a different decision how can you
achieve this by experience the same pain
as everybody within the team a technical
lead should be part of the team it's not
somebody that comes from outside and
just looks at the problem maybe once a
week you should be in the team and
experience everything that everybody
else is experiencing and I personally am
a big fan of this via continuous
evolution and continuous evolution also
means like changing the name of your
presentation when you have already
started so welcome good morning to my
talk called 11 tips to become an awesome
technical lead so the second one is work
to failure and success things will fail
you need to prepare for failure bills
will break new pointers will happen it
will happen but when these happen don't
finger point and just look for the
solution and take ownership stay
accountable for what you're doing and
also learn from this failure something
that I always try to tell the the people
I'm working with don't fix the same
birth twice
you need to have unit tests or
integration tests to make sure that
whatever cost your replication to go in
states of failure that it doesn't happen
again
now if we say that things will fail it's
also very important to like celebrate
successes and I will share a personal
story about celebrating success because
I think that you should celebrate
success often and early so if you have
finished a sprint or a feature is
complete then maybe do something fun
with the team like happy hour drinks
team-building things like that
because the team will be very motivated
and it's just a plain fun and now the
personal story a couple of months ago I
was working on a project in Belgium for
a customer and we finished the project
we were and time surprisingly because
that does not happen very often and we
do a demo to the customer and the
customer looks at what we're doing and
he is really happy but after the demo he
told us both management has decided that
they are going to a completely different
routes so the project never made it to
production and if that's the particular
moment in time that you're waiting for
to celebrate bullets that's like really
not very very fun that's really
disappointing especially since the team
who did most of the the work worked very
hard and in making
that it was successful projects so
congratulate the team when a sprint is
successful but also congratulate
individuals so you've been at the
conference for two days already you've
seen a lot of cool things when you go
back to to the project that you're
working on you say are this new feature
maybe we should try to implement it has
added value for us if that idea if it
delivers then you should also be
congratulating the individual person
because it will lead to more creativity
it will lead to two innovative IDs state
technical I think this is very important
tip since there will be a lot of
responsibilities and things that you
need to do so technically it has
non-coding responsibilities but I
believe that you should still keep on
writing code you should do code reviews
you should have your code reviewed as
well of course and I believe it will
probably be the case that you will have
less time to write code then than other
people and the team but that doesn't
mean that you should not be doing like
proof of concepts maybe look at what can
be reused identify interfaces that might
be useful to split off etc I already
talked about code reviews and I also
think it's very important that a
technical vision for your project exists
and this technical vision needs to be
shared by the team if it's only in your
heads then it's not really very useful
but I also believe it really works if
you share how you guts do that technical
vision with the team and maybe try to
encourage them to work together with you
on the technical vision adoption will be
become a lot easier and then the last
part is also the evolution of the code
at a certain moment in time you will get
like a lot of confidence in the team you
will trust their decisions but that
doesn't mean that you need to be looking
at a constant evolution of the code
because there will be other
opportunities rising arising from
looking at the codes and now in general
most developers they're pretty keen on
looking at frameworks or new versions of
things or new ways of working doing
microservice doing G RPC but these
topics like networking security
deployment and consistency of the
codebase there are lost lot less like
sexy topics yeah well networking
somebody else will probably figure it
out so also pay a lot of attention to
points and I sometimes find it kind of
strange that so many people don't really
are blight obsessed with deployment I
mean we're building distributed systems
there have been I had tons of micro
services talking here yet the deployment
stops whenever it's running in docker on
my machine that that's absolutely not
true it's it's worthless if it doesn't
go to production tip number four always
available this actually pretty difficult
tip I believe that as a technical leave
you should try to be always available
for your team for questions for remarks
for guidance for resistance and things
like that but since you also have other
responsibilities this is basically about
time management and what I tend to do
and what works for me is I have four
charts technical design business project
management and code and I try to assign
a value a percentage of my time that I
want to be spending on these topics now
you do this upfront before you start
with the project and it's most of the
time it looks like this with me but when
the project is ongoing you should also
like fill in but but is the actual
amount of time that you're spending
because that's something that you will
learn from if you're doing project
management's all of the time then you're
not doing the other things you're not
talking to your business now that
doesn't necessarily need to be a problem
if you have a strong team if you the
other roles are fulfilled but I think
very important that you know about this
be realistic you don't need to be able
to answer every question I talk
sometimes it's just okay saying ok
that's that's a really good question I
want to take some time and look into
that maybe look at alternatives this is
also really forms works really nicely
with the double Oda but what it's very
important is that you come back to the
initial person who asked you the
question it's just a sign of respect a
sign of showing okay you came to me with
this problem this is what I've thought
maybe we can work on it together and
also be very aware of your team and
other people might have faced a similar
problem so you just might need to be
connecting people this is especially
true when you're working with with
larger teams in this time management
it's not easy but but believe me over
time you will get better
in its be a mentor for your team I have
a couple of soup responsibilities from
mentoring so the first one is a the
mediator role you should facilitate
discussion and also bear in mind that
when people disagree with you or
disagree with each other that's actually
a good thing because it means that
they're passionate enough about the
project about what they are doing to
come to a good solution so try to make
sure that everybody in in and in the
team can can participate in the
discussion and that the decision is
formed at the ends unfortunately if
there's like no way of coming to an
agreement that maybe should Park the
problem and if you need to make it a
decision then you are accountable to
take that decision the next one is
mentoring and like I said earlier and be
a teacher and I personally do this in in
the same fashion all the time at the
beginning of a project or when new
people arrive at the project I will
virtually review every commit that they
do I will write tests that make their
code fail this will not make you very
popular but when you explain to these
people why that you're doing this and
and the reason that it should be changed
they will adopt it they will say okay
but it makes a lot of sense because this
situation it's it's a real situation
it's not some some isolated thing that
will never happen and people will start
picking that up and then you buy
yourself some more time to spend some
time to spend time on all these things
effective delegation you do not need to
do everything yourself it will become
easy to identify who are like the the
the the people who are more strong when
it comes to to database related things
or when it comes to queueing and you
just delegate to to these people if you
have these kind of problems so do not
try to own all the responsibilities just
make sure that these responsibilities
are taken by someone matching goals
every individual developer every junior
developer they have certain goals maybe
they want to become a technical leads or
maybe they want to do something related
to to certain new technology and you
should like what I call specifically
target that's dynamic coaching so
specifically target that means it is for
the individual what does he or she wants
to do and and dynamic it means because
it will change I'm pretty sure that when
you leave the conference here there will
be
things that you saw why absolutely want
to learn acha or whatever so
communication is always very important
but even for like matching goals it
becomes more important because it shows
that you value the people in your team
and last but not least optimize for the
group you're working on a project as a
team it is important that you spend a
lot of time with the individual try to
make sure that he or she feels happy but
in the end it is about building a
project is about the group so I know
this is going to sound a bit corny but
when the when the team is working good
when the team is happy then all the
developers will be happy as well
so summarize no one to give in but no
one to make decisions but also important
no one to take step back surround
yourself with other technical leads I
was asking the question at the beginning
of a talk if you have ever worked with
other technical leads and this is
surprisingly that there's more people
who are a technical lead but they have
never worked with other technical leads
and actually I think that is very
valuable if you start surrounding
yourself with others technically within
your company within your project but in
your customer I mean just surround
yourself with these people and look at
how they are doing things so what are
they spending time on how do they do
their time management how do they gay
they give feedback or input when
something happens without like coming
across as very dominant because you
don't want to come across as very
dominant most of the time but listen to
them and learn from them don't just
blindly adopt whatever they're saying
and because every project is different
every team is different but I think it's
very interesting to to learn from each
other this is on a personal level but
there's also like the organizational
level and are there any any any grand
objectives within the customer that
you're working for is there like a
clearly overarching objective of the
software at your building maybe there is
an architecture that you want the
different teams to be working on
together and also like interoperability
and dependencies and dependencies is
also a very important one because there
is dependencies on on resources like the
server needs to be available but there's
also dependencies on teams so imagine
that you're requested to do something
like 2-way SSL but you have knows no
idea how security works
but that other guy like Tim from the
other project he's just the guy give him
one day and it will be implemented so
you have a dependency on other teams and
dependency on other projects is also
possible is something that I have
experienced earlier this month there was
a project that went to production and
they have a dependency on us we have
actually zero production environments so
that is kind of an issue you are not
alone for technical leads it is very
important to develop sound networking
skills as well so when you see somebody
struggling with a certain problem go to
them speak up to them try to come to a
solution together even if that
particular person is not even working
within your company already in your
customer this is really valuable if you
can like help each other ok leadership
these are the less technical tips and
one thing that I value a lot is
interviewing new people and you can
interview new people for to work on the
project that you're working on but you
can also intervene new people to work at
the company and those are different kind
of interviews so I'd like to give some
tips on how you can make sure that you
hide the correct people it's know your
goal
I mean prepare for the interview I
really hate it when someone from from
from human resources come up so do you
have five minutes we have an interview
absolutely not I have no time for I have
no five minutes for an interview what
are you trying to achieve are you
looking for somebody who will join the
company for a longer time or are you
looking for somebody who's just going to
increase the bandwidth of the project
that you're working on right now now for
the people who've read the the mythical
man-month by by Fred Brooks you know
that um two women will not be able to
deliver a baby in less than nine months
so be very realistic when you do any
interviews and also I think resumes are
interesting as well
but you should be worried about what's
useful about resumes you should like try
to look for patterns so for example does
the the person that you're interviewing
does it normally do a project for a long
time maybe like shorter assignments I
mean both are possible and both are good
as well but when you're looking for
something in particular and you know
that because you have prepared
then you know if there is going to be
myths mix-and-match if it's going to be
something that they can offer to to the
people and you should just be upfront
and talk about it I mean we are going to
we're looking for somebody for like
three months we don't have more time
than three months you'd like to do
project at less for two years we cannot
offer you that then you have a very
almost discussion I don't really think
that you should we focus a lot on
tooling especially when you're looking
for somebody for the longer term
I think it's more important that you try
to identify if the person in front of
you is like the mindset of a developer
and Willie address problems logically
and Willie start talking about the
latest spring framework or the latest
release of akka ori will he be looking
at the problem at hand again this really
depends on your goal if you're just
looking for somebody to increase the
bandwidth to go faster then the Tooley
becomes more important than when you're
looking for somebody for the longer term
and I also really care about the
eagerness to learn because new tools
will appear new frameworks new libraries
we are in a really evolving profession
very important do not use sac overflow
to find questions you should try to do
this actually if you look at Stack
Overflow it look look questions for
senior developers that makes no sense
whatsoever I mean if you're not
implementing bubblesort
every other day then don't ask people to
drive bubblesort on a whiteboard now US
Customs do this and it makes zero sense
just look at a problem that you're
facing within your project I mean what
are you trying to solve and it's very
easy to say what you should not be doing
but I actually have a pattern if this
thing works on how to do technical
interviews I always start by comforting
the person who is doing with taking the
interview because in general people will
get a bit nervous they are a new company
they see new people they're there for a
job opportunity so they will get a bit
nervous and comforting I do this by
asking like very simple questions to
start with so one question that I always
ask and some people in the room will be
able to to verify that it's true it's
explained to me what is the difference
between an abstract clause and an
interface now this is very simple
question everybody should have some idea
on how to explain this but it's really
surprising if you if you notice how
people are sometimes having trouble to
cope with that question and that's why
the second tip is very important it's
about offering options so some people
like to draw on a whiteboard some people
like to give a theoretical explanation
other people just want to implement
something so when you prepare for an
interview make sure that you have a
whiteboard available maybe have a laptop
available so that you can comfort them
and eat them in in their way of
responding to your questions because
there is no wrong or right way when they
do a good job you should also be
building on their response on their
experience because like that you can go
to more difficult questions again
focused on the program that you are
trying to solve within your project and
show interest so a genuine interest in
people because it will make them feel at
ease it will make them loosen up and
they will give you a lot more and then
you can make sure okay this really is
the the guy or girl for our problem and
I would always what I like to do is ask
like a bonus question so um what was
happened what happened during your
project that was really really really
complicated it took you like weeks to be
able to solve them and also tell them
there's a front sound like it's okay if
you don't you not able to answer this
question I mean we were unable we took a
lot of time and if you have somebody who
comes up to the team and just like can
immediately answer your question you
know this is like match made in heaven
tip number eight embrace cultural
differences so I was really curious to
see how this is going to show up that
little green dots to the left
that's Belgium that's where I live and
the bigger green dot is Poland and if
you see the entire world it's still very
poor small part of the world what am i
what am I trying to say about that is
all people all different we all go to
home to different to live different
lives some people are married some
people are not some people have kids
some people don't and this is something
that you should really try to embrace
because your users your customers
they're not like the the geeky
developers that you're working with
every day all your users are different
as well
so this is really really valuable an
opinions matter when people have
different opinions I touched on this
briefly before that's really good
discussions are good because it means
that they're putting their energy in in
discussing with you and looking for
alternative so really try to embrace
this especially with all these different
kinds of mindsets that people might have
very important because in the end we're
all working toward the same end goal
which is a working system this is not
about egos is about the working system
and having a good time in what we're
doing so try to keep in mind that you
have a shared end goal and try to
surround yourself with passionate people
try to surround yourself with people who
have like that the developer mindset and
then that that really brings a lot of
value to the project I'm very curious
what's your response to this will be if
you have worked with offshore you're
going to notice that that it might
sometimes become more difficult there is
like the time limitation if you work
with somebody who is in a completely
different continent it might be that
when you're working he's sleeping or
she's sleeping or vice versa and that
can be a positive thing because work
will get done while you're sleeping I
mean that's it like really good thing
right but on the other hand it will make
communication a lot harder if you're in
that particular situation I think that
maybe sometimes as a team you should
take the night shift and and also vice
versa because then you will show the
respect to them saying okay we can work
on it better together that really will
create some kind of bonds you know
Indians developers are are people work
best at night anyway so this is a good
way of communicating and communication
is really key because some words have
different meanings in different areas of
the world so if you if you just look at
the word yes it means something
completely different in Europe or for
example in India and that's actually
something that you can cope with as
evolved you just say what are you saying
yes oh yes I understand that that
interface needs to be whatever so make
sure that you make the communication
clear and one thing that also really
works is just instant messaging it is a
lot easier if you have a chat room for
your project and just can ask questions
over there it's it's easier than to pick
up the telephone at that for small
particular amount of time that you're
about to wake so just have a message
use it like that integrated with your
your CI CD integrate it with your your
ticketing system and things like that it
also is a benefit of that assist when
there are more people in the room it's
easier to help each other as well so
definitely something that you should
need this of course it also works for
for onshore I think most people right
now are using some kind of instant
messaging really specific for their for
project maybe that's an interesting
question who we hear in the room is not
using instant messaging in their day to
day work awesome I will skip this from
the slides next time so the next thing
that I want to talk about is preparing
work because in general when you work
with offshore developers they will not
be have the opportunity to talk directly
to the customer so you should maybe do
like a technical design or or make sure
that the user stories that you've
created or are very clear because it
will be their main point of
communication and with your projects I
would do work that they need to be doing
and then the last one is very important
everybody is part of the team I've
worked with project managers who really
see offshore development as like cheap
labor and I really hated that actually
personal story I've worked in involved
in wood with like a group of a Polish
developers and some of these guys were
up until this day one of the best that
I've ever worked with
so everybody is the same everybody
should be a part of the team and but
this goes all this goes all the way so
don't make sure that this is not the
only takeaway that you get from from my
talk but you can also be pretty angry at
somebody over instant messaging and so
everybody really should be part of its
estimating I'd like to start with a
quote by Douglas Hofstadter saying
Hofstadter's law it always takes longer
than you expect
even when you take into account
Hofstadter's law estimating his heart's
when you do it more often
you will get better at it but just like
with interviews you will still get it
wrong from time to time mastering
estimations is really like a love a
lifelong journey but this is also
something that will like set you apart
this is something that people in general
or stakeholders in general associate
with like profession
if you can make the estimation really
good there are a couple of ways of doing
this so one that is called planning
poker so if you're working and annonay
gel or scrum or Kanban or whatever wave
working at planning poker is used very
often and with in planning poker you
first need to define a sequence and you
get some playing cards like you see on
the image and each point of the the card
represent like an estimation of what
you're trying to achieve so there's like
somebody who is explaining the user
story somebody is saying okay I'm going
to count down one two three and then you
play your cards and if everybody in the
room play something very similar then
you can be quite confident that the
estimation will be good enough but when
people are playing something very
different okay then then you have
identified a potential problem that
that's good as well and you should like
do re replaying and allow people to be
reason so maybe the the database
specialist knows that it's like data
model from hell I know you just want to
do cross on that particular table but
you need to have ten views and data
model from hell and then you can play
again and you will see that eventually
the estimations will like come together
nicely and this asserted it is normal
when you are integrating for example a
third party service and their
documentation is really bad and you
actually have no real clue you'll even
know whether it's the rest or soap or
something else then you will need to
play higher cars because there's
uncertainty and there's two ways of
coping with uncertainty so the first way
you you delay what you're doing and look
at like doing more technical design
looking out what's the protocol that are
using what is the communication
mechanism what kind of messages do they
expect but it might be something that's
that's right really a priority business
wants it right away and then business
needs to accept this uncertainty and if
you communicate about this very openly
they should listen to what you're saying
as a technical lead you will probably
also be doing something that I call
solutioning so that means doing
estimations before the project actually
starts or doing estimations for like a
contract women governments or banks
want to have do large projects they in
general day they submit a request for
proposal and then you need to send them
customers can't sent their proposals to
this bank or government and then you
need to estimate what exactly it is that
you're offering and one way of doing
this is with the above formula where you
do a it's called three tier estimates
where you do an optimistic estimation
you would do a best gas estimation and
you do a pessimistic estimation and then
use that formula then if some like of
weighted mean and then you give see you
in general a good idea of what you're
doing and it also gives you an idea of
the search in that you have so if the
difference between the optimistic and
pessimistic estimation is like huge then
you know okay this is this is a project
where some risk is involved as well
something else that is important are the
unknown unknowns due to the nature of
estimation you're not doing something
hands-on so you are all the time facing
unknowns and there will also be a note
that you just have you have no clue that
it was going to be a problem so then you
will come across this and I think it's
very important that if you make certain
assumptions that you document your
assumptions then nobody else will ever
be able to tell you oh but you said it
was going to be a week of work and it
was five months yes but please look at
the estimations at the assumption excuse
me that I have done and then at some
time for testing debugging etc because
you're working on a real project when
you do an estimation you're estimating
for the team not the the best possible
the shortest possible time that you
personally can do the the project and in
perfect conditions because first and
foremost perfect conditions don't exist
and you're not writing something for
yourself this is like realistic this is
somebody people will be paying for what
you're doing so just at a percentage for
documentation for like the I don't know
if you can say polish so with
the water moments I did it twice
anyway so and also be sure that you know
what your deliverables are if your
deliverable is also a documentation or a
manual then you should also factor these
in within the estimations
so any estimation is better than no
estimation even even if it's is
completely off or or your peers really
disagree what you're saying and it
sparked some kind of discussion that's
already a good thing because then you're
working towards a better estimation
don't forget the bigger picture people
are in general have it can make
estimations easier when they're focusing
on smaller parts of the problem but
never forget like the bigger picture
sometimes just like a very high-level
estimate can already be good enough to
know if you want to go in a certain
direction I think this is pretty obvious
to share your estimates which are
colleagues with your business with your
stakeholders
so that they can give input on them as
well and if you want to become better at
estimating just also review your
estimates this is not the most pleasant
work out there and but if you look at
what your you did before the project and
after the project then you can see where
you made the mistakes and become better
in the future
interfacing with the outside world since
we're nearing the end of the talk I
thought I should add a picture of
kittens and it also always works so most
people here in the room they're pretty
have a sounds technical background but
in when you're working with business and
they will not have that background and
that's that's a good thing and a bad
thing at the same time you should try to
look for analogies for for making sure
that when you're communicating with them
that they can relate to what you're
explaining so maybe you use other terms
to make sure that you're in the same
page and work very closely together with
your business because they will have
requirements and they will not
explicitly state what their requirements
are but you should always be looking for
for what they're trying to do I'm always
trying to make sure oh but he is talking
about this and maybe wants to be that
it's like what the Japanese call like a
Kaizen state of mind that you're always
looking for opportunities always looking
for information and then making sure
that the evolution of the project goes
goes very well be the go-to guy or go-to
girl for management's the customer and
other stakeholders I don't think that
you should be like the single point of
contact for a project because then when
you will become a liability
but be maybe be the first point of
contact because when you're working on
something when you're in in the code
you're focused on one thing only you
really don't like the interruptions but
you should also try to make sure that in
some discussions some people of the team
are integrated as well and that is
documented very very nicely as well I'm
another personal story I used to be
working at the government in in Belgium
and I was working on a fairly easygoing
project we had a large code base with
some really cool algorithms doing a lot
of mathematical stuff but it was it was
we had a small user base the customers
really happy what we're doing is like
not really really a lot of stress but it
was a very large code base and it was it
was very mathematical so at a given
moment in time I get the opportunity to
start working for different projects for
the same customer for governments and
this was like really like the fairytale
project they had the best tools they had
the best people they had really large
budgets so I applied for that function
and I was really happy because I got it
yes I going to work on the fairytale
project and as it turns out I was not
allowed to go there because there was
nobody who could do the work I was doing
on the previous projects which is was
again this is a very very annoying
situation so again don't be the single
point of compact but maybe try to be the
first point of contact no I was really
aiming to have the slides with the least
letters on it for the entire conference
I think I might have done that more is
no is that the the magical word in
general people tend to think or
developers name two things I can build
that yes we can we can deliver yes we
can do everything and that's good
because it really shows that you're
motivated that you care but as a
technical lead you're sometimes making
decisions for the entire team and know
is something that you really should like
try to say more often when when customer
comes to you with with unrealistic
expectations and say okay no we cannot
do this an example for what when when
you look back at the estimation parts
and when a customer comes up to you see
oh no these estimates no I know a guy
and then my my nephew we can do a PHP
much faster than what you're trying to
do make estimates smaller just say no
I'm being a professional this is the
amount of time I believe that is going
to take
so it's not realistic just say no lost
tip facilitates
a Jo thing work so here in who here in
the room is using some kind of a job
wave working so maybe scrum or Kanban or
who is not okay okay some people are
still doing a waterfall and maybe that's
not not even a bad thing or have no
methodology that's that's probably a bad
thing no this is not a talk on a gel but
I believe that when you facilitate a gel
as a technical leach that your project
will have more chance to be successful
so I think that you should create the
backlog and the backlog is like like
your garbage bin for everybody the
products over the team members somebody
is just passing by everybody should be
able to add stuff to the backlog and
there's only one rule for the backlog
needs to make sure that it's a user
story it's from the users point of view
it not some some technical requirements
like resilience that's not a backlog
item I mean that's that's that's a nice
word but its capability since your
backlog is going to be your your garbage
bin you also need to have a prioritized
backlog and in the prioritized backlog
the technical eat and the team business
product owner everybody sits together
and start deciding okay we have certain
budgets to do something what will be be
working on when the prior has been
backlog is prioritized you can do a
sprint plumbing together with your team
and looking on who will be able to do
what what information is available it's
like the classic classical definition of
having a definition of ready use burned
our charts do retrospectives I'm
standing on the cable because these are
really these feedback loops and again
this is not a talk on a gel but
feedbacks loops short development life
cycles that really will facilitate a lot
of things if you're not doing a child's
make sure to facilitate an awesome team
we really have one of the coolest
professionals out there should just try
to have some fun
give ownership show trusts
just make sure that you're having a good
time and that was all for me thank you
if you do you have any questions it's
really difficult to see from here
questions no questions okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
