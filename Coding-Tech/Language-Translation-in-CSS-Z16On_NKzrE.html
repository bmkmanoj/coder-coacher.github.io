translating text and CSS and when I say
that I don't mean this that's not what I
mean I don't mean transform translate
I'm talking about translating text and
before I can get into that I want to
talk about the current translation
methods and what I'm gonna show you
today is probably going to be pretty
controversial but I think it's worth
looking into as one of the techniques to
translate especially if you have a
single page without any complex server
configurations and it's actually pretty
cool so I hopefully you guys will find
this helpful so this is something you
guys probably see a lot on lots of web
pages and this works perfectly fine you
can have a Google Translate button to
change the language and your viewers may
appreciate that if you are catering to
more than one language this works
perfectly well and but the problem is
that sometimes these translations aren't
too accurate and if you want to be
really you know prudent about your
translations you're going to get a
translation team and manage those
translations another thing you can do is
you can use the XF language header now
this is kind of the de-facto solution
you check the HTTP request this is
included with HTTP 1.1 specification and
we can obviously check the language this
is this goes to the configuration that's
set in the browser so that that is the
language that would appear here
we can also do it with IP sniffing and
you can see here this is this was
geo-located to France this is my IP when
I was at Meijer B&amp;amp;B and you can also use
JavaScript and then you can just set the
Lang this way but this is basically the
same as the accept language very similar
and this is actually something I'm going
to be showing you guys how to use in
conjunction with CSS of course and
there's the content language but don't
use that so this is another thing you
often see you see domains with like
English French Spanish Chinese you have
sub domains that are redirected and that
works too but the problem with all these
is you still have to refresh and I know
about you guys but I freaking hate page
refreshes waiting for a response here
anyway so yeah that's one of the
problems there's another problem too you
might have to configure your your CDN
you might have to do all kinds of
configurations maybe the CD on your
using doesn't support that so the first
I kind of
parked on a journey here to see if I
could do this all in CSS and my first
approach was using the check box hack
and it just basically tabs so this is
what it looks like you just go between
the tabs here and that seemed okay but
there's a couple problems with that
first you have to repeat all languages
potentially hides the body yadda yadda
yeah many many issues with this so I
didn't really like it and then this is
the second approach I took this is using
the adder so using a check and then you
can use before and you can just append
the data as if we were all in attributes
but there's another problem with that
and basically this is what it looks like
it's exactly the same but there's a
problem if you noticed you can't have
any nested elements like a tag span tags
and so forth so close to the page and it
still requires a rule for every language
which is problematic so this is my final
approach I think this is pretty cool so
basically this is us this is stylist
code and basically what you do is you
just add your the translated text side
by side and then you can just this is
just a loop using stylish you go through
the languages and then you just go and
fall back to the display initial that
allows you to cascade properly and this
is what it looks like in the final
result so you can just click on the
French or English and it automatically
translates everything so this is using
the JSON selector so not not just
adjacent but any subsequent elements
that follow this pattern will allow you
to translate your text just as if you'd
normally have just translate text but it
works seamlessly and you don't have to
refresh the page so this is super great
if you want to just do small bits of
text and translate and it also there's a
great user experience but does kind of
poor for rich text but awesome if you
just have small bits of text on your
page so hopefully you guys found that
helpful this is my contact information
and hit me up you guys have any
questions thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
