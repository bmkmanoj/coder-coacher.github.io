of a very cheesy title and I realized
especially here in Berlin you have a
very positive hacker culture so
essentially this but that's a very long
title
so my point being when you talk about
reverse engineering stock for website
pictures this is what happens when you
search for hacker this is what happens
when you search for malware analysis
these fantastically cheesy images which
I absolutely love
especially this guy with his balaclava
on tears his laptop probably because he
doesn't want to put tape over his webcam
and he's trying to find a cd-rom drive
on his macbook it's good luck and this
guy which apparently this is malware if
only it was that easy but yeah so you
get a lot of this kind of stuff when you
talk about reverse engineering you know
essentially that the idea is this for
malicious purposes or maybe it's for
trying to stop malicious purposes and so
the point I'm kind of wanting to make
here is that actually it's something
that all developers should do a lot more
because it's actually useful for a lot
more than that so why should we take
things apart this is a CMS detector at
CERN and it's designed to see a range of
particles and phenomena produced from
high-energy collisions firing protons
great speed smashing things apart to see
what they're made of to see to see
what's what's underneath and by the way
these guys do open days and if you get
the chance this as well that's kind of
see but basically the point is if we
want to understand how things work we
take them apart maybe it's to fix it
maybe we just do it for fun just just
for an illumination and illuminating
educational experience and that's from
for everything whether it's cutting edge
of science or if it's I don't know
disassembling a washing machine or
something and it's how we learn how
things work so
maybe you want to know why an app uses
of specific permission and for some
reason this notes at once access to my
contacts why does it need this I've got
a photography app and for some reason it
wants the ability to send SMS well so
forth
maybe this app is crashing you're
running an in preview you're a developer
and and some app is not working you like
this app you you you want it to work and
maybe you don't want to wait just
submitting bug reports and saying
doesn't work because you're a developer
maybe you can actually help maybe you
could submit more info you can get this
fixed sooner or maybe maybe it's your
app but you've used a library and that
library is maybe it's an ad SDK or
something like this you don't have the
the source code for this this library
and the code quality on these libraries
is not always the highest code quality
that you could find so you might be able
to find out why that thing is crashing
figure out workaround so that you can
use it in a different way
maybe yeah as I said it's not your app
but it's crashing on your device maybe
you're running a custom ROM and that's
causing it maybe you just want to know
you see something cool and you just want
to know how they achieved that it's got
some fancy little visual effect or
something it does something that you
actually thought was kind of in the
realms of magic somehow they managed to
use the camera API and make it work on a
samsung device or maybe you're just
trying to choose a library and you know
you're not sure whether you want to go
for this implementation or this
implementation is like 15 different
libraries to choose from for this same
thing and you could have a look in the
Play Store look at some successful apps
see which ones they use people don't
tend to talk about their complete
library list but if you reverse a lot of
apps it's actually trivial to see which
libraries they're using and that might
inform your decision so essentially
you're not pulling these things apart so
that you can steal their code
but just because you're writing your own
it doesn't mean there's not a point to
having a look at how somebody else did
it first and you can learn from that so
hopefully I convince you so the first
thing you want to do is get the apk off
the device it's pretty straightforward
this for instance is a nice little
one-liner that will list all the
packages that have been installed the
the three stands for third-party so it
basically means installed on the device
and it will tell you the the file paths
for them that's what the f does and then
you could easily pull one of these back
with something like this little
one-liner it's a bit messy
I admit this is largely because a DB
line endings and stuff and it has to
basically convert them it's kind of
fiddly but this could pull you given a
package name that would pull the apk off
of your device it's a nice easy way to
just pull it onto your computer and then
you can start having a look you could
also get them from various other sources
there are places on the web where you
might be able to download an apk but do
bear in mind that if you do this I does
this conform to the terms and services
of your agreement with the Play Store
and all this kind of stuff I'm not a
lawyer and and secondly if you're
downloading ap case from shady websites
maybe don't run that on your phone
you're kind of asking for trouble like
there is no real guarantee you could
check the certs and so on make sure the
signatures are okay but without taking
extra steps there's no real guarantee of
what's in that apk and that it is the
legit one so do be careful so I would
suggest honestly the easiest ways just
pull out for your device and so you pull
it onto your your computer you want to
have a little look at it first thing and
you probably want to do a apt this thing
is part of the Android SDK you already
have it on your machine if you've
developed apps if you've even played
around with the emulator or whatever
you've got this and this tool does a
heck of a lot it's it's got like it's
actually this is all the kind of stuff
it does
loads and loads of stuff but this is the
bit of interest if you're wanting to
have a look at an app just there's a
quick kind of initial thing
what is this app what does it do what
permissions is it got etc so with this
tool you can you can dump things our v8
the apk this is the thing that kind of
put them in this can pull them out so
you like what you could dump the badging
this will basically give you the kind of
initial info you might want to know
about the app just give you a kind of an
overview what permissions it has what
activities and so on how the thing is
kind of roughly put together
it's a top-level view of the application
so you though configurations permissions
and so on you could dump the strings
from your application this is actually
kind of fun you grab a bunch of apks
from the Play Store dump the strings
some of the things you'll see that
people don't really think about the fact
that they're just there this stuff is
readable with a simple little command
it's very readable so maybe if you're
using a private key for your API or
something have a thought about how easy
it is to dump these strings and you know
maybe take steps to actually obfuscate
that stuff just a bit
you can view one of the binary XML files
that's been packaged into the apk very
easily with this so Francis this will
dump the manifest and so on this this
this tool is very versatile and so you
got a lot of stuff in the apk in case
you don't know many of you probably do
but I'm just going to quickly run
through this and in the meta and
directory you've got the certifications
signing stuff so basically you can you
can use this if you've got an apk from a
third party to to see what the
signatures are the certs of what it was
signed with and verify that versus an
official apk and make sure they're the
same and so on there's also
interestingly you can put a whole bunch
of stuff in here that then doesn't get
included in the signature some malware
uses make some Tex advantage of that
you've got the manifest which although
it says it's XML it's binary XML hence
you would have to dump it to actually
read it
if you've got the the resources
basically just all compiled into one big
file and you've got your resources are
not compiled so if there's any that are
not bundled into that bundle then you'll
find them in there you've got an assets
directory this would well to be honest
this could be all kinds of things and
actually again is somewhere where some
malware will package things that look
like the images and so on where it's
actually dynamically loaded code you
could you can put kind of anything in
here that you don't want to be processed
most of interest to us really disparate
classes.dex obviously the dalvik
executable by code when you're putting
apks onto your device nowadays and
you're installing them obviously there
is some you know a pretty compilation
that's happening obviously we've gone
towards doing that up front within and
sorry before in and then within we kind
of come stepping back from that a little
bit again but but either way you
basically got this dalvik bytecode there
whether it's what is being used or not
depending on how its compiled this is
essentially the code that's running and
finally in the Lib directory you've got
your native code I'm not gonna go deep
into that because reverse engineering
native code is a whole other level of
stuff and this is pretty much just kind
of casual easy stuff to look at so oh
and finally other this is this is also
very interesting because sometimes
you'll find you grab an apk from the
Play Store or something open it up and
you'll find some files in there you
might find a file from a developer's
machine or you know just random stuff
that was just left around in the build
directory when the APK got created and
all sorts of stuff sometimes ends up in
here accidentally so it's worth having a
look at your own apks just make sure
um so how could we start to look at this
I used to use something like this which
I wouldn't really recommend as a way to
do this nowadays this is way out date
but it was just you know kind of unzip
the thing run a bunch of different tools
on it things like Dexter jar and so I'm
kind of pulling out like the Dexter jar
stuff to get to get a kind of a jar of a
jar but it's actually not ideal back
smiley and smiley to kind of pull out
the smiley which is like the Java
assembly if you like and and you know
just just kind of get something in
various forms so just have a quick look
at but to be honest nowadays this thing
apktool probably a lot of you heard of
it used it even this will do all of that
it's it does all of that in fact I'm
gonna give it a better entrance because
it's pretty amazing and it's pretty good
right so so what does it do so for
instance if I just run that just one
line simple little the D stands for dump
I think on an apk then bingo it will do
all of that there we go I've just got
all the same stuff we've got the
manifests got the resources I've got the
XML stuff I've got that you know back
Smiley's running here so it's pulling on
the smiley out of the decks um so just
as an easy quick little way to have a
look at what's inside an application
this is like your first step it's simple
and sometimes it has trouble with apks
that have been processed in a particular
way maybe that were packaged up with a
custom build of a PT or something
specifically to make them harder to
reverse
there are ways and means around that but
but to be honest most apk is if you just
want to have a little look to learn
something this will probably work so you
could use this for instance just as an
example some of those questions I said
earlier like how's this thing dump I see
on this application they've got a nice
little thing in their layout it's got a
nice little round kind of image and and
how it
are they doing to do that oh well okay
look here's the layout file and I see
they're using a rounded image you okay
great
that's the library they're using cool oh
maybe I'll just go use the same one I'll
see if it's any good that balances that
question easily without me hunting
around and trying to find a library that
doesn't or trying to implement it myself
when they're actually just using a
library maybe I want to have a look at
the code merely this code is not the
best thing to look at but it could ants
it could be enough to answer your
questions this basically is that as I
said it uses smiley and back smiley so
it's reversing this stuff but it's
reversing it to essentially Java
assembly code which is not the nicest
thing to read but could be enough like
you probably don't want to do an
extensive amount of programming in this
but you know you can you can maybe
quickly see how they're doing something
there are better ways if you actually
want to look at Java code which I'll get
to but it might answer your question and
maybe I just want to see what other
thing was crashing or I want to be able
to debug this app this won't always work
but it's it's a it's worth a shot
you couldn't basically open up the app
like this rebuild it pre sign it and you
can rebuild an app so that it's actually
debuggable on a normal device my as in
not just on your rooted device or
emulator or whatever this would mean you
could put it on any old device and it's
actually now a debuggable APK and now i
could run it and attach a debugger and i
can use the the smiley that with the APK
talk dumped out as the source code off
the app because it has the line numbers
and things and it is possible to step
through this I could set breakpoints and
yeah dynamically analyze the application
next all I'm going to mention and regard
now if ap if ap caters good this one is
amazing
so even more spectacular entrance and
this is essentially it's not one tool
it's a collection of tools they're all
it's python-based it's a whole bunch of
little scripts and all just do one thing
do it really well so yeah it's kind of
modular and and there all sorts of
things plug into this there's a bunch of
tools that use this provide a GUI on top
of it or whatever it's also got this
really cool little thing an interactive
Python shell or ipython shell that's the
script and realize and you can use this
to kind of browse around inside an apk
and have a look which is quite cool it's
got Auto completion and so on and it's
got a big compiler built in which means
you're not using things like Dexter jar
which yeah great early on when Android
was pretty new it was it's a way to do
it it was trying to convert into Java
code but we're not dealing with Java
code we're dealing with dalvik code and
the bytecode is different so it's worth
using a dalvik decompiler not a java
decompiler this thing has one built in
it's pretty good
the SOI it honestly it looks like the
tool is not maintained anymore but you
if you look on github you see the this
this gets commit still it still kept up
to date so basically is it something
like this
you can just run this and this will
start an interactive shell so you'll get
a little little prompt and as I said
this has like tab completion and
everything so I can run something like
this and this essentially will analyze
that apk I give it I can also pass in
things like Dex files to this or various
other formats and this will produce a
few kind of results like these three
objects here and basically those three
objects are we've got like one file that
represents like the one object that
represents the apk the original apk that
I passed one that represents the the
actual dalvik like the the the Dex the
the stuff inside and then one that
represents kind of a metadata object
that's got a whole bunch of just
interesting stuff on it
so for instance I could take the first
one and just say well what's the main
activity on this apk and it will tell me
that's the main activity I could say
okay in the Dex file I want to look at
this class this is the the path of the
thing and as I said you can sort of do
tap completion here so you can kind of
go comtab and so on pull tab and and I
could just ask for the source and it
will on the fly just they compile that
and show me Java or you can do basically
smiley or Java from this quite easily
and and you don't waste time decompiling
the entire thing you just browse around
and basically look at the little bits
you want to look at as you want to look
at them and because you're there in
Python you can script all this stuff
which is kind of fun and it's also just
got some general purpose kind of
functions like if you'd say will show me
the permissions of the app so this is
like if you like this sort of Java doc
not the Java doc because it's Python but
the documentation for this for this
method it will show you the permissions
in an application this is a bit
hit-and-miss
like if you try it actually kind of
gives you a whole bunch of stuff here
but basically the idea here is for
instance I might say well that the read
contact is being used where it's
accessing a contacts contract no maybe
this you know it like this bit it's kind
of obvious but this gives me some kind
of idea where I can maybe go the class I
might want to start looking at if I want
to see why that permission is being used
and what it's being used for some sort
of entry point and I can do a whole
bunch of other stuff and it's very good
tool by highly recommend it
and talked a little bit about some other
tools because there's a whole bunch of
tools here but I don't want to go too
much in depth in all of them
klasky shark obviously this is a
relatively you know recent niche kind of
edition from actually well it's the
Google supported one now it's a real
official thing for having a look at your
apk and and you know it does a bunch of
stuff for you like it's got a basic GUI
there it actually can also be used from
the command
which a lot of people don't necessarily
use it from the command line but you can
you can plug this thing into your build
for instance if you want to keep an eye
on something like well actually there
are there are other plugins that will
tell you method counts and things but
but it can do that and other stuff as
part of your build it can be used from a
command line so it's kind of useful
scriptable um and it's very easy to just
open up your apk with this again and
just have a quick look obviously one of
the things that's usually recommended
for is looking at the like dex method
counts and so on what libraries are big
and so on but it's a nice easy way to
browse an APK and just have a quick look
see what's there what the package
structure is and it can open an
incredible amount of things you can pass
this index and then IAR like your
libraries even native libraries and it
would like the Esso files and it will
actually show you information on those
which is comical and so yeah but this is
you know it's free it's pretty easy to
use this is a useful tool to have code
inspects was actually presented here I
think a couple years ago or a year ago
and it's a it's a work in progress thing
is a academic thing and it uses a so I
mentioned like Java assembly and formats
this one uses a slightly different one
from the one that most things use a lot
of things use like jasmine this uses Jim
Poole which is just another way of
viewing decompiled Java code and and
that's because he actually uses a single
suit which is a static analysis
framework which has been around forever
and it builds upon that adds a lots of
there's lots of little tools and
analysis things on top of it and it's
it's good because basically it's like
it's an idea essentially you can debug
an app and you can perform runtime
analysis on it and as you navigate
around and these are usually very
premium features you find you can start
to rename things and change you know as
you start to understand the application
the only downsides I would say it's
based on the eclipse framework because
it's a nice easy way to build a kind of
IDE type
thing which you know not my favorite
thing and is an alpha thing at the
moment and basically you just have to
write them an email something so you
want to evaluate this thing you want to
try it out I don't know what plans have
got for how it's going to be used in
future but it's worth having a play with
and they're very kind of interested I'm
sure in hearing people who are
interested in it and yep that's code
inspect what else we got this this is an
interesting one because it run on your
device you can have this on your phone
it's the UI is a bit basic but it
started out as a hex editor and ended up
this massively scriptable framework for
reverse engineering and it supports lots
of architectures like x86 arm etc and
again it's one of these tools it's
actually much more broad than just for
Android but therefore is useful for this
too and and can be run on your device
you know not just on your desktop and it
is open source again so you can go check
out the source contribute whatever and
yeah and as I've said multiple times
actually yeah it will run on your device
as possible it's kind of useful it's on
the Play Store and there are a whole
bunch of other stats that on the Play
Store things that will just very simply
just kind of you can give them apk and
some of them are a little bit old like
jad X I don't know how that's exactly
supposed to be pronounced but it's it
still kind of works there's another
thing show Java which actually will use
that other app to do the decomposition
or it can also use CFR which is a
popular java decompiler
and there's Explorer this is another app
you can just browse around if you just
want to have a look at the apks assets
and so on so particularly if you'd if
you root your phone or anything like
that then basically if you I'm not
suggesting you do root your phone mother
I'm not endorsing that but if you do
have a really phone then you know you
can just on your phone I go and open on
the other apk and have a look at it it's
kind of cool
and this is a popular distro of Linux
which is used for a lot of sort of
security based stuff and reversing type
stuff and you can get an ISO for this
and you can you can boot this as a
virtual machine but to be honest also
just looking at there like it's a
bootable well I've been to Lubuntu
light light version of Ubuntu Linux in
environment and it has all these tools
just pre-installed which is kind of nice
you don't have to spend ages downloading
apktool and and regard and all the rest
of it and but also just if you look at
like the tools that it actually comes
with that's essentially your good
starting list of what tools you might
want if you want to start playing around
and opening up there because they're all
installed on this thing so that's the
list of stuff you probably want to get
if if you don't want to run this distro
finally there's also if you're kind of
rich and there are things like I di Pro
which has been around forever
this thing is it's called the
interactive disassembler and this thing
like yeah goes way way back it's more
known as a general reversing kind of
tool it's very expensive and but it has
like a fully featured disassembler and
debugger and and it's it's always
supported loads of stuff you know x86
type stuff but it actually supports
dalvik since version 6.1 and so you can
you can use this on android apps but you
probably have to be kind of serious
about doubt about it to start using this
because it is a commercial product and
it's not particularly cheap this one
also Jeb or now Jeb - similarly it has a
dalvik to Java source D compiler that is
their own proprietary one and can do
interactive D compilation and navigate
and rename things and so on which is
kind of nice if something's obfuscated
and you start to make sense of it
yeah similarly to I do this can sorry
debug dalvik code and also native like
code you can kind of go into each but
again this is a commercial thing in
subscription so if you have the money
and you're very interested so that's a
whole bunch of tools yeah hopefully
there's some useful stuff in there um
and I probably should address security
just a little bit because if you're
talking about reverse engineering and
it's kind of necessary it's kind of the
counterpoint and so obviously I've said
several times how easy it is to open up
these apps and you know go on the Play
Store and get the top ten apps and open
them up and most of them actually use be
surprised and a lot of them aren't even
on for scared which is fantastic because
it's a really good learning opportunity
it means you can go and you can see how
these apps are built you can pretty much
read their source code which is
fantastic if you're wondering how to do
something that's kind of my point you
should go and go and look at this stuff
but you know like in an entirely legal
way I'm not a lawyer and but basically
the funny thing is it's really not that
hard to the very least turn on
obfuscation and to think about security
a lot of people don't think about it at
all
you know you finish building your app
put it out there done but you kind of
need to ask yourself like is there
anything in your app where you don't
want someone to be able to find that
thing out because you know what what
basically needs to be a secret and how
secret is it is it sort of the level of
well you know it's it's a it's a key to
use our API but we don't really care if
someone pulls out the key and starts
using the API because we'll quite easily
be able to spot those ones and we just
bought them that's fine okay maybe we're
not too fast maybe we'll just put in the
app but it's got a very basic
obfuscation if it's really really super
secret honestly it shouldn't be in your
apk because if it's in there it is
possible to get it out there so
if it's something that really has to be
very secret it should never leave your
your back end it's it's not something
that should be packaged into your
application and sent out there and
anyway this this is always kind of a
trade-off thing and it always comes down
to the how much effort you want to put
into securing something this is how easy
it's gonna be for someone to pull out so
you don't want to spend forever and
ever-- obfuscating the hell out of you
the whole of the structure of your
application because it's going to make
development difficult was going to make
maintenance difficult and and it's gonna
take a lot of time and then if it's not
that important that if anyone opens up
your app and has a look at it then let
them you know they're gonna learn from
it so it's great but maybe just takes
the base the most basic steps you can
just to basically protect things if it
doesn't take any effort on your part so
for instance turning on things like well
essentially would be ProGuard but now
you know it's just kind of classified as
general minification obfuscation within
the build process it's very much a
first-class citizen something you
probably should switch on unless you
have some really good reason not to
because it's just there and it just
works it's easy but also in
interestingly look at what it does
because most people just switch this on
and then that's it forget about it
I switched it on it built cool it must
be fine now and I won't look at the
output and I won't see if it's doing a
good job which I will show an example of
in a moment and if you are you know
pushing a commercial product and you
really do have stuff in there you rather
people couldn't look at quite as easily
there are things you know other tools
you can use like this dexguard it costs
but you know this is this is the guy who
wrote ProGuard they they know what
they're doing and dexguard
understands Android apps whereas
ProGuard was just originally for Java so
this thing can do a little bit more for
you you can obfuscate things a little
bit more and make it a little bit more
tricky for people to open up your your
application particularly things like it
obfuscates resources and and and class
names and uses care
cuz that wouldn't necessarily be valid
with the standard Android SDK tools
which means that you try and open these
things up and everything just blows up
which is you know it uses various
devious tricks like app and you've got
sequel cipher which is a you know kind
of wraps your database and encrypts that
stuff there's a whole bunch of these
tools and again it kind of just comes
down to scaling to what you need what
you need to keep secret and how secret
but crucially do actually look at the
results of this if you're paying
especially for something like Dex card
or even if you're just turning on basic
obfuscation and minification look at the
output open it up grab a bay apt dump
your strings from your own application
that you built see what's in there see
if there's anything in there that you
wouldn't want people to be able to see
that easily or see if there's your
package structure is actually kind of
ruined by your your obfuscation isn't
doing its job for instance this is alpha
skated app but you can kind of see like
everything about this app even though
you know sure I've turned all the class
names into ABCDE great but they're in a
package called preview so I pretty much
know what these all relate to and I can
see that this feature is is where the
services live and this is where the
settings are in a splash screen this
isn't very hard to navigate at all it's
got obfuscation switched on but the
obfuscation the whole benefit of it is
kind of undone by the fact that and this
is actually a very popular way to
arrange your apps packaging things into
packages by feature and and honestly I
like that organization of applications
but maybe think about putting things
that are gonna be obfuscated separate
from things that are not going to be
obfuscated because if I need to preserve
the whole name of this activity here
this class name and its entire package
then everything along the way - it has
to be not obfuscated so now everything
in this package is clearly in that
package and I can navigate this very
very easily
it kind of just undoes the whole purpose
of obligating it and this is why I say
it's not it's
it's about just basically looking at
what your efficient does or any of the
tools you're running and just seeing if
they're really doing their job and if
you're happy with that I mean this could
be very easily fixed by just putting say
all the activities into a almost
identical package structure but just
separate slightly just one one name
different and their package structure
and then basically this wouldn't happen
this is very easy to avoid but you
wouldn't know unless you actually
reverse your own apt so it's worth
having a look as I say you can group
these things into a different structure
which might be a mirror structure but
it's just on site and so have a look
just finally a few other useful bits and
pieces this book at the top this is a
fantastic book about all this kind of
stuff I highly recommend that I didn't
write it nothing to do with me but it's
very good book and this was a talk that
was actually given here last year
dismantling droids for breakfast
this is this was fantastic another what
was given at DEFCON about reverse
engineering and finally the the
documentation on hand our guard is very
good it just kind of gives you a good
guide of how to use it and all the
things you could do with the tools it's
very versatile so there's a lot you can
do and it takes you through everything
pretty well I all the links will be in
the slides so don't worry too much about
trying to get the links from there
because obviously it's a bit difficult
to get the URL off of that and and yeah
if you're interested then that's a bunch
of stuff you should probably have a look
at so I think that's about everything
yeah cool thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
