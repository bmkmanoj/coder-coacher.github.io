plugin mastering webpack from the inside
out and so the point is is that I want
you to understand how web pack works not
just on the top level but how it works
under the hood and how you can leverage
it to do so much more than you think is
already possible but before we begin I
want to talk about this library that we
wrote called tap a bowl and who here
knows what a pible is maybe heard of it
before okay so one person two three
so tappa bowl is the backbone of the web
pack system entirely it started out as a
two hundred two hundred thirty five line
plug-in system and like I said it's the
backbone everything that makes one pack
possible is powered by tap Abul so what
does it do so as you can see here it
allows you to extend a class and then we
get all these fancy methods on that
class called apply plugins who here
writes for node and has ever used event
emitter so this is a fancy version of
event emitter and as you can see here
each of these special hooks allows you
to perform functionality well web pack
is made up of hundreds and hundreds of
plugins that hook up into this event
system what you can see here is the most
simple example of a plugin I like to
call them classes we consider them
technically instances but this is the
easiest way to make your own web pack
plugin the only rule is that you have to
have an apply method on the prototype
chain and then web pack once you
register it will give you access to call
these methods and hook into specific
events like make so you can see here you
have some plug-in and it's registered
and it's applied and then the actual
event on the emitter happens and then
custom functionality is performed with
inside it so you might hear me say what
is it a pible instance and it just means
a class or object that extends tap apple
or something you can plug into or write
a plug-in for
and it goes even deeper than that so we
have this compiler but if you want to
access other tappa belen senses you plug
into a top level and then receive other
instances that you can plug into so this
diagram kind of shows a really primitive
example of what kind of happens in
webpack where we plug into the compiler
but it makes a compilation and there are
hundreds of plugins listening to events
on the compilation itself also so what
I'm going to talk about here first are
the 7th a pible instances in webpack
that you might want to know about so the
first is a compiler who here kind of
knows what a compiler is or what it does
ok
now this is really the top level
abstraction for webpack it is kind of
what you tell it to start what you tell
it to stop it's even exposed in the node
API so if this trivial example you see
here is how you actually use the node
API for web pack you get the compiler
instance and technically you could do
compiler dot plugin and write a custom
plug-in right there and then the second
is the compilation and I say it's the
dependency graph so I also consider kind
of the meat like really the meaty part
in the brain of how web pack is really
doing most of the work the compilation
is created by the compiler but it also
contains really important pieces like
the dependency graph algorithm how does
a dependency graph even get created and
we're gonna find out and then we have
the resolver I don't even know why I
called it the bloodhound that's so weird
but a resolver it's one purpose is to
resolve to find and make sure something
exists so a good example here is in web
pack we have an instance called the
resolver that we take a partial path
let's say like an entry point and we
pass it the resolver and we say go find
it does it exist and if it does is it
provides back an amount of information
that can allow us to do more powerful
things
and if you've ever looked at our source
code you've seen a library called
enhanced resolve we've actually
extracted the resolver out so that you
could use it yourself outside of web
pack and it has a whole bunch of plugins
that are already hooked up into it that
map to the configuration and then we
have something called a module Factory
so if like you've ever written Java or
did some angular you probably know what
a factory is then right yeah so you know
a factory raise your hand factories kind
of make sense returns instances or
objects so a module Factory is going to
take a successfully resolved request and
create a module object and return it so
we have all this new information we got
from the resolver we pass it through the
factory it then collects the source
information and populates a module
object wow it's so beautiful and then we
have the parser so who has ever worked
with a parser or written a parser or
knows what an ast is who uses Babel so
youyou yeah you've used a parser so an
ast is just an abstract syntax tree but
it's a representation of a source file
of your code that's easy to traverse and
identify different pieces of syntax so
webpack has its own parser that we take
the module object and the source that's
inside of it we create an ast from it
and then we traverse that ast and we
look for what we call dependency
statements or dependencies so that's
every require use it's every import you
use that's every dynamic import
statement it's the AMD module statements
and you can see right here here's a
perfect example of the kind of syntax is
that we're looking for we use the Acorn
parser and so if we traverse a file that
has an export default in it
that's the export default declaration
statement we look for so like if we were
to diagram this we take the module
object that we've created and we scan it
through the parser our little parser
glasses
and we find dependencies and we create
these objects and we attach it to that
module following me so far and then
finally the seventh capable instance is
called the template who here uses a
template in their UI code handlebars
angular view even JSX is templating
whether you like it or not it's
JavaScript but it's also a form of
templating so you all understand how a
template works and what its purpose is
it's data binding for your view well in
the same way web packs templates or the
template instances are data binding for
the module and the dependency graph that
translates into the code that you
literally see that's generated so we
have all sorts of abstractions that
you've seen so far we have module we
have these dependency objects each of
them has a little bit different flavor
for the type of dependency and what we
do is we wrap them up in this container
called a chunk well every single thing
that you see here has a template that
matches it because we can't just take
the code that you have there and ship it
to the browser it doesn't work web pack
lets you write modules that work in the
browsers we have to translate it and
bind the data of your modules to actual
a representation that does load and so
you can see here it kind of resembles
what your web pack bundles look like if
you look at the source code so like if
we were just to recap this for a second
we start off with a compiler it reads
options and we read the entry point as
you can see there and it goes through
the module Factory and we create the
object we're getting ready to when we
say resolved or go find it if it exists
we create this normal module object with
the data that we've collected and then
it goes through the parser and if it's
not JavaScript we run loaders we run it
through loaders and transform it to
JavaScript but then for each of those
dependency statements we attach it to
the module but wait those dependencies
aren't resolved yet
it's like import foo from backslash food
yes but we don't know that exists so
then we repeat the entire process over
for every dependency so we are
recursively creating a graph of your
entire application or your entire
application code base so I kind of tried
to make a comic out of it so that it
makes a little bit of sense so mmm hey
I'm a module I cannot wait to work in
the browser don't you ever get that
feeling whoa oh they are cool your jets
we need to really get you into shape
before you're ready for the big stage so
first I'll need you to jump in this
container call the chunk that way when
we throw a lot of plugins and changes to
you we don't want to lose track of you
and almost there but we have a problem
those required import statements have to
go the parser gave us special
instructions for rendering these
dependencies that you have there
these are dependency templates and
dependency factories and whoa look I'm
finally rendered here I come browser
lands and there's the generated code so
you you all a thousand of you just learn
how web pack works entirely under the
hood that is it oh there's more but you
just learned how it works entirely under
the hood the box has been opened yes
that's how I felt the first time and I
still sometimes feel that way because
it's a lot simpler than it seems on the
outside so you mean by like Shawn why do
I care what what does this matter well I
also want to talk about what's new in
web pack four because this architecture
is really important to understanding why
we are making the changes that we are
for web pack four so the first thing is
that tappa begin system it has some
flaws and we recognize it who has ever
tried to write a web pack plugin
what are the first things you probably
ask like what hooks can I actually use
or is this a sync or synchronous like
ass check Tom Dale's like Twitter and
see him complain about it sometimes
we're solving it for cases like this so
we're converting it into being a much
more statically analyzable and typing
friendly more performant
backwards-compatible syntax so now you
could plug into an instance and say this
dot hooks and see everything that's
possible not only that would its
monomorphic and it's more performant
we've worked with the v8 team and other
JavaScript engines to ensure that this
can be optimized to the best possibility
and so a great example is what you see
here your plug-in system could look this
easy my car dot hooks dock calculate
routes some some hook that's going to be
called and not only is it going to
support callback so it will support
promises and async/await so our source
code is going to look a lot nicer and
your plugins are going to look a lot
nicer but also we're going to allow you
to do things like pass asynchronous tags
for any of your assets so now you don't
have to worry about one script relying
on another when you create multiple
chunks or code split or use common
chunks so now you can be more performant
and ship your JavaScript faster and it
can be parsed and evaluated in parallel
or asynchronously and then the probably
one of the most important features and
is the most relevant to this talk is
that everything used to be centric
around JavaScript our parser is a
JavaScript parser our scaffolding system
is a JavaScript scaffolding system we're
making templates and code gen that you
know turn out JavaScript bundles but
there's a limitation in that who here's
used extract text plug-in yeah that's a
hack because JavaScript is the only
first-class citizen and so we worked
with Mozilla and we identified that web
assembly could be the next best
first-class citizen so right now as we
speak when we release web pack for your
have automatic experimental support for
webassembly as a first-class citizen so
you could not only load a web assembly
module but you could write loaders that
return web assembly modules and on top
of that you can see that down there at
the bottom that even CSS could be a
first-class citizen
what if we could lazy load CSS the right
way what if we didn't need extract text
plug-in what if you could write your
code like this you could just import a
Wisie module and look you instantly get
code that's ten times faster you
shouldn't have to worry about the stuffy
API that's around web assembly we can
take care of that and then who loves
rust like I've read up I read the rust
book on the plane if you haven't checked
it out check it out it's great but like
I said if another type of module or
asset is a first-class citizen then
loaders are completely even more
dynamically powerful so now we can write
a rust loader so that you can import a
rust file into your code and use it just
like a JavaScript module you shouldn't
have to care whether or not you know you
need a special compiler chain or if you
need a special API to wrap it into the
web you should just be able to write
code the way that you're used to writing
code and we can take care of the rest
and then finally probably one of the
most important ones is side-effect free
who here uses angular and loves it
angular was my first love so if you're
using angular 2 or angular 5 or whatever
they're at now this will be probably one
of the most impactful versions of web
pack and you can see why we now support
what's called side-effects
we had to operate to spec initially
which would mean that if you re exported
modules well we would have to include
them in the case that they might have
side-effects well now your favorite
packages and we've been working with
these authors to be able to make sure
that they're shipped beforehand d-33 j/s
lodash rxjs all of these supporting
libraries that you love to
use will now add a field that's called
side-effects false that tells us that we
can actually remove all of that extra
code that used to have to be evaluated
for us to operate the spec so as you can
see here doing one import from lo - es
used to be we'd have to include as many
modules to get 223 kilobytes now - 3
kilobytes of code and then finally the
ecosystem so one of the things we
learned from what PAC 3 was that when we
released it we only had about a week
between the release candidate and the
actual final release but a loader
authors and plugins were scrambling to
catch up as we all know open source is
not our primary job maybe it should be
someday but for now it's hard to keep up
and so we respect that we empathize with
it and we understand and so we're gonna
wait and we'll have a month between our
RC in the release and you're like Sean
why did you talk to me about this
because not only does this make you
better wield your build system that you
all love that you almost all use but it
helps you understand how you can do
things beyond that and even finally we
want you to be a part of our ecosystem
and contribute you are already
what makes webpack amazing and so we
want contributing to our project to be
fun and enjoyable and for every single
person here and if you have the tools
and to understand that it is easier than
it looks
then you can help us innovate and make
awesome things and belong so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
