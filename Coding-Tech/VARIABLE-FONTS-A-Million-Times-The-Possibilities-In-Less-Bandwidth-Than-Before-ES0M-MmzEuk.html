really a CSS person so what am I doing
here I come from the font world and I
want to explain how that links in to
however it relates to the world here so
this is how typography used to be in the
olden days we had type foundries on the
left they made fonts are led
we have typographers who understood how
to use this printers who made final
products for readers typographer and
printers sometimes were the same person
they always were in the early days then
they separated desktop publishing area
things changed where we had our font
makers these were digital type foundries
we sometimes call them rather designer
design anything for readers the printer
sort of when did stir into the
background we didn't really need to
think about that the printer too much
now it's come back again though the
person implementing the final product
really talks to the designer a lot font
makers still the same place and users
they've replaced readers I'm from this
world on the left so we need to talk not
just to the typography guys too but to
the CSS wizards to this crowd as well
and so I want you to understand why I
think this is the most exciting time in
typography for over 20 years I want to
first mention four eras of web
typography on the left before 96 let's
call up prehistory after 96 we had
that's prehistoric so type on the web 96
to 2010 we have Microsoft's core fonts
for the web this is a great initiative
by Microsoft it gave us 10 type families
Wow
though you could rely on we've pretty
much rely on them being in all on all
the computers five of them for text five
families in 2010 the web caches up web
fonts that's the syntax on the left you
know well on the rights and the command
line tools to build the fonts and some
suppliers and companies
all of your web fonts that's great and
it allowed you to books like this be
published web typography is a real thing
for the first time bandwidth hmm network
requests if you want several forms on a
page there are some down sites which in
2016 were addressed in a really
significant way what happened at the
HIPAA conference in Warsaw just over a
year ago monotype Adobe Apple and Google
came together and presented this the
open type of specification 1.8 and the
thing that everyone's really excited
about that's in it is variable fonts but
before I talk about that I want to go
back a bit and talk about the type
family what is a type family that's a
simple type family Roman italic bold and
bold italic more often though type
boundaries the real interesting ones are
releasing things like this this is
toughy know I've got a tweet about this
just a couple of days ago new family
with 74 fonts so if you buy into this
family you've got a really big palette
of stuff to choose from you can use it
for lots of stuff in your in your in
your layouts this is a sharp grotesque
259 fonts now that number starts get a
little bit scary how do you install 259
fonts what the hell
Dropbox used it in recent branding
redesign and they're using all those
different widths to look at the type on
the bottom left there how it's as the as
the browser gets narrower is swapping
out to a narrower type really responsive
type cool stuff it's not yet variable oh
so how how how can we make things things
variable I can look at a typeface called
winner this is the default weight of
winner in the middle there the letter B
I'm gonna add what we call a weight
access to it what that means is adding
two extra master design so the regular
we regard as the first master the on the
Left we have the super thin master on
the right we have the super fat the
black master we assign those positions
on this so-called axis all the gray B's
you see in between there automatically
generate
by linear interpolation so just all
these three masters in a typeface and
then you name you give these things in
the middle names the thin has weight 200
the light has 360 the regular 570 bold
750 and the black 930
so these ones you put into the form the
black let's use the 930 value and again
is automatically interpret interpolated
then let's think about adding a width
access to the same font so from the same
master outline same regular we add a
super narrow at the top we have give
that zero on the width axis super wide
we give it a thousand combine them we
get this the axis combined together
their effects so you see we had a super
bowl to be wide on the right
super narrow super thin on the left we
can add more masters to fine-tune you
see on the top right there the the the
counters in the B have closed up we can
add a new master there we can add as
many masters we like just showing you
how the the designer has chosen some
points in two-dimensional space now to
specify his weights as their as the
widths as they get wider so this is what
we're doing this is our terminology in
the font world we're interpolating
between master designs in a multi
dimensional design space I just showed
you a two dimensional space if you're
from the animation world I think maybe
you'd like maybe prefer these words
tweening between keyframes but in a
multi dimensional design space not just
one dimension time
multi-dimensional how many we talk about
axes how many axes can we have quite a
lot to to the power 16 but they're small
don't worry about this they're very
small things that's the one the main
reasons the companies are behind them we
only have five outlines stored in this
font and those four green ones are just
stored by their offsets from the points
as defined in in the regular so these
things are super small they're even
smaller because we use key points to
define these things on the right we see
how you might imagine the B is defined
from regular to bold as you see the
green arrows show the movement of each
point on the left is how we can actually
define that in the form we only move
to have to move the points in between
get to come along for the ride so it's
only moving 14 points out of around 30
so that's half the size you might think
it would be we then use off to
compression this is the super
compression using a algorithm called
broke Li if you're not using woth to
compression on your fonts you really
ought to be these fonts are super small
so where can we play when this
technology was announced I didn't have
anywhere to play with them so I wrote
one I wrote something called actors
practice how many of used access
practice in the room can I see a show of
hands okay I would love you all to try
it out give you a little live demo here
this is what the page looks like are you
can this is a specimen I've divided the
whole the XPrize into specimens so here
we have lots of variable fonts used we
can use this slider to mess around with
the axes I'm using a weight axis there
on those item font optical size axis
this let's increase the width of the
gimlet font there this one's rather fun
this is this is from those icon font
which was actually designed in the mid
90s this technology is actually a
revival of a knot of an apple technology
lots of cool stuff there so let's see
what that one does wow that's nice same
same fonts no because i conformed this
fit typeface has this incredible array
of its width axis so it goes from Super
Why - Super thin this just this is just
one font used for all of those things
after I launch to access practice I was
really delighted that people started
sending me fonts because I had a
drag-and-drop option on it so he could
drag the fonts from the desktop this is
beef on developers dragging it from the
desktop onto this area here and they
could play with their own fonts it
wouldn't upload them to my website it
was just for testing so I've got some
nice fonts on the left here there's a
Chinese one Chinese are really
interested in this because a whole of
CJK the Far East because of the effect
on font size here we have we are nice
you know Buffalo gal that's a fun cowboy
one some of the effects are rather
subtle so I I wrote a CSS loop to zoom
in on some of these things yeah yeah
just using a transform scale that's
Dunbar's rather nice has an x height
axis as well as weight you know what
weight does there's fit that I showed
you before but feel free to play with
these they're all on access practiced
org there's there's icon font all this
cool stuff it even does some rotation
now the mathematically alert of you will
know that you can't do rotation with
linear interpolation so you have to do
it in steps but it looks really cool if
you do let's say I think these have
twelve steps for these rotations and
that's fine the grade typeface is pretty
cool this is really subtler effects can
you look at the textbook on the left how
it's getting thinner then darker without
reflow now this is it could be really
good in response to let's say ambient
light sensors deciding how how you want
to display your type without again
without reflow I'll take a bit about
around the UI there's the I've shown you
the loop this play pause button is for
animations that are associated
associated with each specimen that's
coming very soon the instances panel
there is that shows all the instances
that are predefined in the font again
these take up no extra space or a couple
of bytes each they're really useful
though the CSS button there that shows
you the CSS you need can you see it
changing there as I drag the slider
there's a playground with some other
little experiments
and there's a dragon drop if you're a
font developer - - to test your own
fonts new text box delete text box notes
for editing this this environment and
then using that arrow there you can save
these specimens to share them then you
get a URL that is uploaded that and you
can share them with your friends okay
let's go back I just had this week I
just had loads more fonts just in I want
to show you this is a Clifford from
monotype one of my favorite typefaces
this has an optical size axis so this is
used for use at large sizes this is for
use at small sizes we can do cool stuff
with that so you see it just there you
see how the cue is closing up we have a
break point where it flips to another
glyph so another setup interpolations
some French ones now Vesta bro by black
foundry spectral from production type
and this one I like mini Val Thomas from
our Shaw and this one again very very
new hot off the press this is a this
looks amazing in if you put some nice
coloring and glow on it it's just
incredible and just this morning Lucas
sharp sent me the variable test version
of the font I just showed you being used
in the drop box branding so their work
everyone's working on this stuff Alana
Monroe who's toffee no I showed as well
she's working on on one as well
we can do stuff like this
ftw for us it means fit to width this is
a Tom meal again by a French designer
that the idea of this interfaces it
shows you how we can choose access
settings depending on the aspect ratio
of the text box
it's the corners are going red when it
goes too narrow for the font to know and
then it switches to a simple transform
we go blue when it goes over we can also
adjust the weight and then which would
normally expand the typeface but we can
say no and use the width axis to bring
it back in how do we control variable
fonts first well with CSS font variation
settings is the fundamental one you will
hear people saying oh no don't use this
it's too low-level I really encourage
you to try it out because it's fun
that's the main thing that's how we do
it font variation settings then a list
of the axes weight 394 with 95 we've got
registered axes 5 of them the reason for
registered axes is so we can have them
predictable we want to know what happens
when we choose 600 on a bold scale it
will be around semi bold optical size as
actually implemented in the Safari in
Safari so it will actually automatically
change your fonts optical size if it has
an optical size axis there for example
there's the bolt
there's the font weight property showing
how its defined 400 is defined with a
normal 700 is defined as bold and then
we can use any floating-point value
between 100,000 so that is the same as
font variation settings weight 394
dynamic control with JavaScript there's
the vanilla JavaScript at the top jQuery
underneath again that's the same string
the weight 300 there
just as we saw in CSS without JavaScript
transitions it works with the transition
so just as I click the next now that was
set with the two second transition is
flipped
animations are more powerful we set up
our animations they work out they work
with the settings in in font variation
settings as well we can also use layer
behrooz mave o to do some even cooler
stuff using the inter in using
AXI using sliders input ranges to
control things again this uses no
JavaScript and it uses and it's playing
with ten axes so how do we control these
things well with two axis fonts it's we
can imagine it's pretty easy
these gingham and Dunbar this is from
these are screenshots from axis praxis
with ten twelve axes it gets a bit of a
mess an axis name start overlapping so
we're not really sure about interfaces
for these things if we have a simple
chair axis font again this could be a
this simple thing here I showed you four
winner could be a an idea and in fact it
has been used this kind of to it two
axis this two-dimensional space this is
super plate a tool that font developers
use three dimensions type his historians
and type education educators come up
these diagrams I put it into an
animation a few months ago not everyone
likes it this is I'm going to be sick
for those who don't speak French another
another idea so we're playing around
with ideas here this is just so you can
get them all in a small space but we
really would love to have your ideas for
interaction we're not great we're not
interface designers you you are browser
support that's can I use as you see
Chrome is great but come on Chrome is
great safaris great chrome chrome and
all platforms including Android Firefox
has some flags so you can try and fly or
Forks but just switch on some flags edge
is coming really really soon this is a
tweet this week again from Greg
Whitworth on the edge team fullback well
that's a call that's using two TTS well
that's a this is a old-style web
development this is with variable so
this is using one two TF in the font
face and then we're using two
definitions for form variation settings
for a regular and are bold we use the
supports directive to check whether font
variation settings are supported then we
can do one set of CSS if it's supported
another if it's not that's the one where
it's not supported we go back to the
bringing to TGFs down can you polyfill
it well I wrote one and it works really
amazingly well it's really quick
javascript is so this is the variation
spec implemented in JavaScript downloads
with the small javascript file you bring
in the variable font and it's not quite
as as fast but it's I think it could be
usable it's not quite ready but it could
be could be used so let's put all this
stuff together what do we get let's try
a single axis font with some key frames
anyone know this guy he took these
photographs around 1880
so I digitized them in glyphs 16 frames
that's all in the same glyph I must say
these are layers of the same glyph
here's some HTML that animates them so I
just use the HTML animation property
that's bringing in the woth - there's
the time 0 time 15 and here's the final
animation thing the body is just an
emoji horse and we get this
and this is how big the font is three
thousand nine hundred bytes plus the
three hundred or so bytes of the HTML
this is I don't know if there's a
smaller way to produce that animation
then I had some fun let's add some more
components add the new color tables that
Microsoft defined a couple of years ago
and we get this at this took about 200
extra bytes the color data this is
virtually nothing we've barely scratched
the surface so this is what some stuff
I've come up with we want you we want
your ideas we're from the font world
we're not interface builders
we're not typographers even you are so
let's collaborate thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
