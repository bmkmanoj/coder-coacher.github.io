contribute calm it's open source
blogging never Friday's generic comp
size software engineering everything
it's my blog for many many years and I'm
also currently a senior software
developer at Zynga so this talk is
basically about the Zen of Python and I
call it a philosophy because it kind of
is and it influences how you write code
in other languages as well so I'm going
to begin with
going over PAP 20 the set of Python and
then looking at Jupiter notebooks and
Sphinx which are have been mentioned a
few times here already and exactly how
they embody the philosophy of Python and
the Zen of Python specifically and then
I am going to look at moving Python
philosophy into JavaScript and Ruby and
JavaScript not so much
Ruby a little bit more so for those
unfamiliar with PAP 20 PAP means Python
enhancement proposal and this is one of
the earlier ones I'm sure everybody's
familiar with PAP eight which is the
style style guide Python style guide
so pep 20 is the descent of Python and
it was written by Tim Peters and I'm not
gonna read the whole thing I'm just
gonna leave it up but I did want to
point out a few of them that I will be
referring to later on the first one is
beautiful is better than ugly that's
kind of a mathematical thing as well
like seeing a nice equation or seeing a
nice small program where every part of
it makes sense and it just any other
solution would actually be kind of ugly
the other line here that I like is
explicit is better better than implicit
readability counts that's a really
really important one and having it
codified and explicitly stated rather
than implicitly stated is also very nice
if the implementation is hard
to explain it's a bad idea so you know
if you're having a conversation with
someone and it's very difficult to
explain something then maybe you need to
try a new tack if the implementation is
easy to explain it may be a good idea so
the expression embodiment and enablement
of the Python philosophy so in the real
world we're gonna take a look at Jupiter
notebooks and Sphinx documentation and
we're gonna start with Jupiter so this
used to be called ipython notebooks and
I'm not sure how long ago they changed
the name but they had to change it
because it turns out the idea of these
notebooks is a really good way to
explain how you solve particular
problems or how you visualize certain
pieces of data and things like that so
for those unfamiliar Jupiter looks like
this notebooks look like this you can
embed widgets you can embed a whole
bunch of a range of charts you can embed
code it gets executed you see the
results of that code so as a space for
explanation and in particular again it
embodies like readability counts if
you're explode if you have a line of
code there and there's no explanation
it's not very readable or if there's
like too much too much explanation as
well as a problem and you got to make it
simpler potentially explicit is better
than implicit is probably the biggest
one here where it's a line of code or a
few lines of code and all of a sudden
there's a chart like matric that doesn't
really make sense and you need to
explain why that chart is the way it is
and this is a snippet from peter noir
wigs ipython jupiter notebook so you can
look it up on his github i'll post the
link later for that and basically he
walks through a bunch of I think there's
15 plus different problems that he walks
through and you can see step by step how
he explains like the solution to the
problem but also as
he is developing the solution and what
misstep potential missteps he has of
course it's cleaned up after the fact
but here you have like okay I'm plotting
a potential solution for this problem
and this is how it looks like and then I
would like to show a small a smaller
chart of it as well so again he's
showing it step by step rather than just
jumping to the small chart so you can
see clearly here's how I began and it's
a big chart but actually I'm interested
in only this range of number so let me
just make it a little smaller and so
this is a snippet that you can use
yourself somewhere else right so this is
again explicit is better than implicit
because he could have just jumped to
here's the end result here's the final
result of my solution to this problem
and instead he's going through a step by
step so again this is the same solution
as the previous slide and here you can
see much more explanation there's some
links there's a math equation or to some
limits and then an explanation of
different approaches to problem solving
as well so you can have a really good
explanation of why you're doing what
you're doing so you can instead of
having this implication you're making it
explicit in the explanation and this is
actually very very useful a lot of times
if you're on it I don't know a DevOps
team of any kind or something is messed
up you always have like a retrospective
or post-mortem and I've thought about it
in the last few months there's things
like pager duty and you have a nice
template to fill in and everything else
like that but as you're doing that I've
noticed a lot of people take screenshots
so they take screenshots of different
slides they have little explanations
like this but it doesn't really fit it
was always just oh here's a markdown
with a screenshot well you know it's
three months later how do I potentially
replicate these queries so now you have
to copy and paste the queries and see
make sure they still work instead with
the true Paterno books for example you
can just
put in the code and then later on rerun
it and you can see oh I can reproduce it
still or no this is actually how we
solved the problem with the post mortem
so this is like a living post mortem I
like this example because you can
actually do some really cool things with
Jupiter I don't want to talk too much
about Jupiter here but you can like
really explain a problem so again this
is the idea explicit is better than
implicit you can implicitly guess that a
keyboard path when you're touch type are
doing gesture typing will look a certain
way but it's much better when it's
visual and it's explicit so Jupiter was
formerly known as ipython and it also
now supports our Ruby Haskell Scala so
this means that this Python philosophy
of essentially documenting everything
being explicit and purposely explaining
everything so that everybody understands
why certain solutions are a good idea or
can reuse that that kind of philosophy
can be moved into other languages as
well so this is something I've been
thinking about because I
Zingo we use Ruby and rails it would be
nice as part of a post-mortem for
example to just hit the database and
grab a whole bunch of data and show oh
this is this problem and this is how we
solved it and this is a nice chart
showing you know the average latency of
whatever so the next tool that I want to
talk about is Sphinx
so Sphinx is a really popular Python
documentation tool if you've heard the
website read the docs everything there
is in Sphinx and Sphinx produces really
nice-looking documentation but the
reason I think that swing C exists
really is because Python itself has
embedded documentation so you have doc
strings and not everywhere unfortunately
but in most places so you have this
ability to add this documentation and it
will
living and breathing it will live
alongside your code as soon as the code
is interpreted by the Python interpreter
it lives there you can access it from
anywhere and this is very very different
compared to statically compiled
languages compared to Ruby where Ruby
still has you know it's just the the
comments are all just stripped out
doesn't really it they just get skipped
over and nothing happens with the docs
but these embedded doc strings are like
potentially the most valuable way that
you can explore an API you can just go
into any Python console do you help
Django or help whatever it doesn't
matter which library you can start
walking through it and do it step by
step it'll list out attributes and
everything else and you can dig through
it that way and the only reason you can
do that is because python explicitly has
this support so that's kind of a
language feature enables this philosophy
of being able to explain essentially
everything and whenever you want you
have this information always available
to you so here's an example which
doesn't get used too often the embedded
doc string is used for tests so doc
tests the example from the Python
documentation is a factorial and you're
just walking through different examples
when the input is X Y Z the output
should be whatever and when it has a
certain value it should output certain
errors and usually I know in the Ruby
Docs for me I always just explicitly
document it myself but it's not the same
as seeing it an example that you can
just copy and paste and run directly
so again sphinx beautiful documentation
by default this ties into beautiful is
better than ugly so this is kind of a
higher level view this is not the code
level view but you can see that it looks
much better and your I don't know I feel
like I'm more inclined to document code
when I know that the output generated
looks like this when it looks like this
I can see something nice and I can share
with my co-workers I can share with
users and they can be like oh I can
use this documentation to set up celery
very easily and it looks nice
it doesn't look like oh just a plain
text document for example so Sphinx also
has expanded to JavaScript so Mozilla
who is also here
they have Sphinx Jes which can be used
to parse jsd
and it turns into a nice Fink's document
so you have the ability to generate
beautiful documentation from JavaScript
as well so that's another idea of this
philosophy of documenting things making
it easier to explain things is moving to
other languages and it's doing so in
through the tools it's not doing it
through oh I'm going to copy this one
Python feature of embedded documentation
it's just using what's there and it's
turning nice it's really nice
documentation and I've used j/s doc and
it was very not like this you don't even
get a search engine no matter how
primitive Sphinx is so I think this kind
of philosophy helps you to move towards
explaining more of the code and being
more explicit so Python library API
designs I'm just gonna skip over it
quickly you could see psych hits and a
little bit of pandas as well if you were
sitting here for the last 20 minutes I
mean if you've used Jango and flask and
everything else the API design makes
sense somehow I like this xkcd comic
because you can import anti-gravity and
print hello world is just print hello
world there's no plastic capsulated
there's no weird thing like Ruby where
it's put s and I understand I guess
that's put string I I guess but in
Python if I import anti-gravity I would
expect you know anti-gravity to fly to
work or anti-gravity dot whatever to
work and I would also expect Jupiter
notebook to show me why it's working in
such a way and I would expect Sphinx
documentation showing me the rest of the
API as well so there's like a lot of the
community itself builds these tools and
builds this documentation but it's the
philosophy behind it that
is that that urge and draw a need to
build this documentation and to build an
API design in such a way that you can
just go into the console and say import
anti-gravity import Django import
whatever and start working with it start
exploring it start making something
happen pretty much immediately so I'm
going to walk through a few examples of
JavaScript
not everybody can work with Python every
day I haven't worked with Python daily
for quite a few years but I still do a
little bit of script writing here and
there I've worked more with JavaScript
in Ruby now but this is an example from
Express Jas which is a web framework and
you can see they're kind of going in the
direction of being a little bit more
explicit so they have the handle and
then they have a debug statement so most
libraries in JavaScript don't even have
that debug statement so you don't know
where the lifecycle you are if you're
trying to debug this this one does so
that's kind of making it explicit that
I'm at this stage in the lifecycle the
function next is actually a helper
method which again in JavaScript you
don't see too much of even though the
ability is there to have that and
they're very explicit in saying Oh
remove at its slash restore altered
request URL so they're labeling each
section and this is like a really
tactical low-level code thing but
they're trying to be explicit in the way
that they know how so it can be argued
that some of these points of making our
kind of good generic software
engineering principles you should
document things you should use small
functions and things like that but in
some cases you you can't really do you
want to add another function to your
multi-thousand line javascript file just
to remove an added slash not really and
you know there's no module system so do
you want to try and shove it into a
module system and now there's a whole
bunch of infrastructure that goes with
that and so on so python has certain
built-in language features but these
look built in language features get
spread to other languages and people try
and make it work to some extent like I
would expect in Python to see remove
added slash
just another method call restore altered
request URL it's another method call and
same with signal taxi router it's just
another method call with another class
called router rad or dot signal perhaps
right so just using the language itself
but the Sena Python itself tells you to
be explicit and to have these
explanations and to talk about it and
explain them and see if it is a good
implementation or not so in JavaScript
as well you kind of see the
interactivity evident which I mentioned
with Python you have a lot of so you can
go to the console explore an API and
just make something happen make
something appear on the screen whether
it's just text or a chart or whatever so
in JavaScript land of course you have
that with d3 and Khan Academy is really
really nice you can type in a few lines
of JavaScript and now you can draw
something on the screen immediately so
it's kind of trying to explain it a
little bit more and trying to become I
guess it's like Jupiter notebooks
Jupiter notebooks actually uses
JavaScript to display charts and things
and to be more explicit so in the real
Ruby world function call parameters this
was an interesting tactical code thing
to look at because I have seen it where
we pull out the parameters to a function
into local variables and when we do that
it makes it way easier to debug you have
all the values are already there you can
just toss in a bunch of print statements
you don't have to pull each parameter
out and then examine it and put it back
in and whatever but if you use this
pattern you can just write away you have
ease of debugging and this is something
I've really only seen mostly in Python
I'm not sure how common it is for
everybody else to have seen it but I
started seeing this in Ruby because some
of my co-workers have used Python as
well so they started to think oh it
actually it would be nice to be able to
see these values and to debug like this
so this actually came up a few days ago
I was fixing a bug and it was testing
method calls and it was really really
like it's really dense and you can't
tell what parameters which and the
method call you don't know what like
you're looking at values and then it
starts your eyes start to glaze over
after like the second line because
everything looks kinda similar you know
to three to three versus three to four
and then what if you make a typo are you
sure you made the right you know is your
test actually correct or did you just
make a typo in the test rather than the
code so afterwards what I did was I made
it explicit each one of those lines
turned into a very explicit readable
line so it wasn't very beautiful but it
was very readable and it was not not
sparse but like very less dense I think
so each call was oh here's this
parameter and it should be this value
the order of arguments doesn't matter
anymore which is really really helpful
so you can put all the arguments that
you care about testing right at the
beginning or not so it's just a little
bit more readable but this is something
you can do in Ruby as well you can do it
in any language but it's just more the
mindset of do you do you feel that this
is a good choice because using that
r-spec helper - is this list of method
calls equal to this list that I'm
expecting that's fine - and that totally
works but is it's not something that you
really want to be looking at you know
for the hundredth time like I have
because this is actually similar to some
of the code we have at work and we do
test method calls because it is quite
important to do so for external API s
and all that so in Ruby we also have
domain-specific languages I just want to
touch on this one quickly again it's
trying to make it there is magic
involved but it does try to improve the
explanation so this is not explicit
versus implicit this is more about is
the explanation of my idea a good one so
in this case it's just roots so URLs
have to point to a particular controller
in action and our function and be
executed so you have get hello points to
the hello controller at index does this
make sense yes I'm taking a and I'm
pointing it to B and B should be
executed and it's the same with the rest
here and even the word ass so I have
patch patch hello world
- hello update as update hello world so
that has refers to this is a shortcut
this is an alias right so this DSL this
domain-specific language makes sense and
it makes it easier for us to talk about
this particular domain so that's kind of
again it hides some details but it has
that Python philosophy of explaining
things of explaining it and making sure
it's readable and understandable and we
can talk about this idea and see does it
make sense this this implementation work
and the advantage here is if the
underlying implementation does not work
we change that rather than this language
we're talking in so to recap the Python
philosophy hmm the Senate Python is the
philosophy it's expanded to other
languages JavaScript Ruby as I've shown
here Pascal Scala which I'm interested
in seeing as well mm-hmm and it affects
the code that you write so you change
slightly as much as you can your code to
fit this certain paradigm and Jupiter
does this brilliantly where they've
taken basically docstrings and doc tests
and turned them into an interactive
document living document that you can
see and you can see the result of things
and you can see the explanation and why
why things were done in such a way what
was the intent behind the code which is
something that we always skip over when
writing code it's I know the intent
today but you know for myself in a month
from now do I know that intent anymore
not really because you have to dig
through previous conversations previous
pull requests and all that why not have
a Jupiter notebook that has like that
explicitness of this is the problem we
were trying to solve and this is how it
looked like at that time this is the
solution and all that and Sphinx
documentation again it does the same
thing makes it easier to onboard people
onto a team makes it easier to see
like good examples you don't have to
clutter your code with documentation
so that's separation as well is a little
bit nice to have and I guess questions
comments oh I'm not sure how the Mike
thing works oh okay sorry
thank you hi thanks for the talk
I would have questions about what you
said I'd rip it her but that might be
too long so I'll ask one about Sphinx
okay um I I felt you said really
interesting but I'm surprised because I
would think doxygen would be the
language agnostic thing that pushed for
standardization of these good practices
yes so I actually did code in C and C++
a long time ago and doxygen was it's the
first thing you see for most C++
libraries but it didn't really migrate
to other libraries but you do have
something like Java doc right I know
this mostly from the oral world okay
yeah I really liked your presentation
because in my experience it's more like
I transfer my philosophies between
Python and R but and I was not familiar
with Ruby not so much so on the Ruby
side I'm using Ruby doc or yard actually
or our doc and it's similar to doxygen
it doesn't really it has all these nice
shortcuts and things but I think Sphinx
just sphinx looks way better than to
oxygen by default so I think that that
for me that's what kind of pushes it out
to other languages it just looks really
good and you kind of want to write more
documentation because of it
any other questions comments
if nobody else has a question can I ask
about Jupiter yes so I mean I'm really
glad that you're embracing the Jupiter
culture etc I'm a scientist so you know
it comes more from this world and you
know it's it's not really built-in that
would youwould be explicit and give good
explanations but it's definitely the
culture but you know at some point still
it's not like you're gonna build a web
app in Jupiter so I mean in a way I
found that you made a really good case
for Jupiter but at the same time for
most folks out here I'm guessing who are
you know Python developers do you mean
that on top of writing their web app
they should have a Jupiter document on
the side that documents the prototyping
or explorations that they've made so
I've actually done literate programming
where you write a whole bunch of
documentation and it's an explanation of
the code and then it takes all the code
tangles it up into whatever some
gigantic long file Python file or
whatever and it's really tedious in some
cases you don't need to explain
everything because it is kind of
implicit you have this domain-specific
language you're all talking you don't
need to explain everything and so for me
that literate programming experience for
a web app I definitely wouldn't do it
right a Jupiter notebook for a web app
doesn't really make sense however if
your web app is living for many months
like it's Singha some of the stuff is
living for years and close to a decade I
won't lie it's close to a decade for
some of it and you don't explain that
original code because at the time you
were focused on speed or whatever or
getting to market first you don't have
time for that explanation and you have a
small team you don't need to explain it
to everybody but later on like I
mentioned post-mortems if something
breaks why did it break and how do I
explain it to the next person who comes
along five years from now why this
particular part broke and how do they
look like back then so Jupiter would be
like a supplement and the thing is we
already do
kind of data collection and gathering of
explanations for post-mortems right if
you do post-mortems of course right so
if you do them you're already collecting
this data all you have to do is first
step it's a markdown document next up
it's a Jupiter doc so you're almost
there right thank you very much yeah and
you can come down to the mic I guess
thank you
which-which passage or phrase in Zen of
Python resonates with you most
I'd like I don't know I always keep
turning back to like explicit is better
than implicit just because of that
example in Ruby where you're explicitly
listing method arguments and that was
something I had my head down in like for
quite a few weeks worth of work so for
me that resonates a lot because I mean
like here I have to I don't know the
background of every audience member so I
have to be very explicit in some parts
and I can be implicit in other so for me
that's kind of how much data do you
share or hide and things like that so
for me that resonates the most though I
do like beautiful that's better than
ugly and I really think that one
especially for JavaScript documentation
the JJ s doc looks awful terrible and I
can understand why nobody wants to write
it because the output is just not very
good but with Sphinx the help it looks
pretty good
and it's I can make a PDF out of it and
oh it's an ePub I can read it on my
phone that's actually not bad you know
so it's a little bit better looking so I
think that one is also those two are my
favorites I think some more questions no
more questions okay
awesome thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
