progressive framework the progressive
JavaScript framework view and the first
order of business is to just settle the
questions what exactly is or what are
JavaScript frameworks and why do we care
what problems do they solve based on the
crowd it looks like people probably have
a good handle on this but having been in
a recent conversation with a senior
developer and a junior developer I feel
like we should probably just dial back
and talk about why we have frameworks in
the first place so a few weeks ago I was
out with a colleague of mine who was
actually in the crowd tonight or this
morning rather and he was arguing that
we have frameworks to deliver value
value to our users and that's the stance
that I take on framework that's what
they serve for me they are a faster way
to get from A to B now our other
colleague he was arguing that we had
frameworks for the sake of making more
correct code which is also fair we want
to make correct code that's right but
not necessarily at the expense of our
users today I'd like to be talking about
why view is so simple and how it can
help us deliver value to our users
faster and quicker and iterate better
and give them the product that they
actually want whether we're working on
open source code or whether we're
working for you know dollars and cents
like some people the ultimate goal is
deliver value to our users view is a
very simple way of delivering the value
to our users so slide it over to some
code here and we're actually just going
to dive right in this is more or less
the canonical hello world of just pure
HTML everybody see that okay all right
perfect
you can zoom in and out as needed
there's not much to HTML as we should
all know at this point we can type in
hello world if I flip over to my browser
that's hoping I could squeeze them both
in but that's probably not gonna fly
here so I'm just gonna slowly toggle
between them when I need to get back and
forth and I'll give you some fair
warning here so very first we got hello
world we can refresh this nothing to it
now we could go and we could edit some
other things like we might want to say
put in a button
do something it's a useful button and
save that and slowly flip back to our
browser and hit refresh and there's that
do something button this is basic 101
HTML of course this doesn't do anything
this is where our JavaScript comes into
play so if we flip back to the browser
it's not really obvious - especially non
developers folks who are maybe exploring
this space for the first time it's not
obvious how you would wire these things
up the pattern has changed over time
because flash forwarding backwards in
time when the web first was born what we
were actually dealing with were
documents and we're gonna see in the
very next code snippet that document
rear its head so let's take a look at
something slightly more dynamic I'm
gonna flip over to my little sidebar
here and open up a simple vanilla
JavaScript program so we're not in the
framework territory yet we've got a very
similar layout to below we've got our
full HTML document I've got a little div
here a division for the labeled app
that's where we're gonna put our stuff
and then we finally have this mysterious
source code sitting here in the middle
and what we're doing in this source code
is we're saying hey let's let's grab
this element by its ID and assuming we
get something back and it's working
let's actually you know inject some text
into it and pop our hello world out and
again if we flip back to the browser
switch tabs here and refresh we can see
my little view here we've got that's the
same source code we were working on it's
running just as it was written and it
pops out our hello world nothing to it
the things we have to watch out for and
the reasons why we're gonna start
looking at frameworks are that we don't
really want to be working this way and
it should become more obvious to all of
us if it isn't already but we shouldn't
be doing this
the very first thing here is I've put in
this extra if if we get an element back
let's inject hello world into it so out
of the box we already have to do some
error detection we already have to look
at our code and say hey is this actually
going to work the way we're going to
work we have to do error checking and
we're starting to get into logic even
though all we're doing a sine hello
world and that's not ideal so again
going back to frameworks I like to think
of frameworks somewhat like a road
without a framework or without a road if
you wanted to get to A to B you've got
to walk through fields you've got to
walk through forests
maybe there's a fallen log in the forest
and you've got to crawl over it and then
you do it and you get to the next step
and maybe walking too bit easier but
then there's another log and you're
crawling over it and over and over and
you have to repeat all of that and it's
not great the framework or the road gets
you from A to B much much faster
there's no logs to traverse you don't
have to repeat yourself well see that
you do a little bit but ideally you
don't have to repeat yourself and you
get to where you're going so let's take
a look at what HelloWorld in view might
actually look like and this is very very
simple much like the last example we
looked at it's actually slightly larger
in terms of code we've got an extra line
or two but as you'll start to see even
though sometimes our actual straight Dom
calls are a little bit quicker view
starts to give us this structure of this
road it's gonna get us from A to B view
is simple it removes some of that
complexity that's gonna get in our way
and slow us down and that complexity is
going to slow us and slow our abilities
to deliver the value to our users that
they need so in the view world we have
very similar layout we've got a division
it's also called app just like in the
last example
except here we change up a bit we bring
in this this vue.js file and it doesn't
matter what framework you use sooner or
later you're gonna have to bring in
source code but the amazing thing about
view the simple thing about view is that
here in this just 16 lines of HTML we're
actually able to do a full-fledged app
there's no tooling there's no build
system there's nothing it's it's
actually very much like the old days of
say jQuery or prototype or some of those
libraries that some of you might have
worked with about 10 years ago or
possibly yesterday I and that's okay too
I mean there's a lot of different
solutions out there a lot of different
problems that have to be solved not
every tool is the right tool for every
job but view is a great tool for a lot
of different jobs makes life simple and
that's one of the things that I like
about it so we bring in our view j/s
normally we might grab this from a CDN
or it might be built in a build system
typically we don't actually write
software this way but it's just a nice
way of illustrating how simple it is so
we pop in view I've loaded it locally
because I wasn't sure about network
access today and then we have another
little script down here that says hey
after views loaded let's make a new one
so we got that new view we're gonna bind
it to that app element and you can
already see my editors kind of
highlighting things for me it's a nice
piece of modern tooling it's nice to see
it working in HTML and JavaScript and
then we have this data property on this
object that we're constructing with you
and we actually seed it with a message
and it's no coincidence that this
message actually lines up with the stuff
and the mustache phrases here or the
curly braces so if you actually rotate
them sideways
they look like mustaches I don't know if
anybody's ever noticed that dude common
slang in web development so let's
actually see this in action I'm gonna
flip back over to that browser simple
view oh there was a little extra on
there and we'll get there in a second
but you can see there's hello world
there's our script everything is loaded
as is there's no translation and
nothing's going on here is very very
simple message gets put in and you see
that you gives us back just that
division with the hello world in there
so what I'm gonna do is flip back to the
code and just expand on this slightly
so we've got data we've got message what
if we wanted to add something else we
could say something like not feeling
very creative this morning I'm sorry
Saturday's usually my day to sleep in
but I'm gonna give us call this foo and
we'll add a property called foo and it's
gonna say something like good morning
Toronto let's actually exclaim that
we'll shout it out
get the let out a little bit today good
morning Toronto feel like a a little bit
more awake now I come back over here i
refresh and there it is
playing this day right in our code and I
haven't had to do anything else now
flipping back to the code if we looked
at say the simple vanilla JavaScript
version again it would be very very easy
for us to do something like just say
come over here and then say good morning
Toronto and that will work just as well
I can flip I can write that in there I
can flip back to my browser refresh it
and we get the exact same output or a
similar output I've made a typo in the
name of the city but aside from that
more or less we're working with what we
would expect now the downside is if we
flip back to the code the problem is now
we've got two pieces of text that we
might want to actually separate some of
us are coming from development
backgrounds where we've been trained to
separate our concerns and this approach
here is just not really gonna work now
if we flip back to the view approach
change tabs it's much clearer here that
we have two separate pieces of data for
all we know as like developers this
could be coming from two different API
endpoints that we're talking to it
doesn't really matter what or where it's
coming from the point is that we can
actually separate it very easily and as
users we can sit here or as developers
we can sit here and read this and say
hey message foo I think I know what's
going on it's pretty simple and it is
and it's good so moving along with our
examples here the next thing that makes
view really simple and powerful is its
change detection system change detection
is not unique to view every framework
has a method or a system for it in some
capacity or another views is just like
the rest of you quite simple quite
elegant and easy to use so if we take a
look at I'm gonna just open vanilla
JavaScript first this is a bit more of a
messy file there's a lot more going on
in this particular example and I'm gonna
flip to the browser and just show you
what it does what it's really gonna do
is it's gonna take one of these edible
items in this list and every two seconds
it's random we're gonna change the one
that's being displayed the very trivial
example we get that element just like we
did before we have a list of things in
real world this is obviously not gonna
be done in an HTML file to come from an
API or something we set the inner HTML
like we did because this is you know
hacky vanilla JavaScript and we have
this set interval business going on down
here where it's basically saying just
randomly pick an item from this list so
let's see that in action one more time
two more tabs over here we go I went a
little bit too big on that and you can
see that it's it's actually changing
here and this is the script we're
running it doesn't really pretty print
nice in this browser but you can see
that that's the native code and things
are changing so this doesn't really
change detection I'm actually just
overriding the inside of an HTML element
it's actually not what we want to do at
all the reason I did that is because if
we were looking at this vanilla
JavaScript and if we wanted to do some
sort of change detection we're actually
gonna have to write a lot more code more
code than I really want to walk through
right now and more code then will fit on
a screen so let's look at views answer
to change detection and we're kind of
setting up a problem here because this
is pretty concise and the view business
think for this example might look a bit
longer
sometimes that's been the case no not
too much very similar we have our
message we have our edibles the main
differences we're bringing in that view
javascript again
the thing to notice here is what we're
doing differently than the other example
is in our interval instead of wiping out
everything that was in that innerhtml
we're actually saying hey let's just
rewrite this message property on this
data object that we've broken out let's
rewrite the message property and see
what happens
and because view is relatively clever if
we flip back over to our browser and we
look at the view version of this pop
down the script tags so you can see
there's all the view stuff pretty simple
code it's doing the same thing and in
fact I've I guess in my dry run today I
left in this bulb is text so I'm gonna
just remove that really quickly oh no I
didn't maybe I didn't refresh oh there
it is good so well we'll get will build
up to that again in a second you can see
it's changing things here but the power
that I really want to talk about is that
and this is again true of other
frameworks it's just use a little bit
simpler is that if we flip back to our
code and we add in something at the top
like we'll make a strong element and
we'll say edible save it flip back to
the browser very quickly suddenly we
have this bold edible text but our foods
actually changing our edible item is
actually rotating and we're not
obliterating that edible so if we flip
back to the code again we've got edible
we've got message so we're able to start
writing a very declarative HTML again
similar to other frameworks it's just in
view it's very simple we're able to set
all of this up with no build tooling no
fancy like overlays on top of our HTML
or JavaScript or anything like that we
just have straight-up text and in 24
lines we've got a good change detection
example and we're not obliterating this
edible bit so just drive that home if I
flip back to the vanilla JavaScript and
we tried something like that and I put
in you know strong edible and we go back
to our browser see what's going on I got
to refresh it there we go it never even
shows up because right out of the box
our inner HTML code that we
just obliterated that and what that
leaves us with is this problem of in
vanilla HTML we've got to organize all
this code if we wanted to write it we
can we can go ahead it's fine just like
walking through the forest or walking
across that field but we constantly have
to hurtle these fallen trees or you know
traverse rivers things that bridges were
built for things that roads were built
to solve and view solves these problems
so let's let's take it up to the next
example there's a tool that every modern
framework has that everybody's pretty
excited about it's called components
view does components and the nice part
about views components is that you know
what frameworks popular single page
application JavaScript frameworks have
been sort of a mainstay for I guess
eight years now seven years odd and in
that time there was a bit of a
divergence between frameworks and then
they sort of started to converge back on
this component pattern and what
components let us do is essentially
write our own custom HTML and this
becomes really really handy because we
can then start to define our views and
our applications up here in declarative
HTML so other people can read it
designers who might not want to work
with code can actually come in here and
just take a building blocks that have
been built for them and assemble really
interactive apps and then produce value
for their users again that's the whole
crux of this framework Lang we want to
deliver value to our users and quickly
so we can fix it because chances are
we're gonna give them something they
don't want the first time around just
the unfortunate reality of programming
everybody says they want X you give them
X and then they really want Y so the way
we combat that is with tools that let us
you know go from X to Y as quickly as
possible so this component business here
we have made our own bold tag so just
like in the last example where we went
strong now we've just come up with our
own little bold tag again we're not
gonna do this in real life this is silly
but it's a great little example so
coming down here we got a slightly
different flow we're still bringing in
that that view code that's gonna help us
out in the background over here we're
saying hey view make a component and
register it globally in your application
we will call it our own bold it's like
this
so that lines up directly this our own
bold lines up exactly with the HTML tag
we've made and then we can put in a
template so we can put in this template
here and say hey this is just going to
be a strong tag just like in our
previous example the one little piece of
magic it's this slot business so view
provides a mechanism for projection and
they call it slots and you can have a
much more sophisticated layout than this
I'm sure somebody later in the day is
gonna get to something fancy in view
because there's a lot of deep dives
coming up a lot of great speakers but
this is the basic canonical example of
slots or transclusion or projection
whichever sort of vernacular you want to
use to describe this thing we want to
put something in the middle of our tags
and so when we use this this important
text actually gets stuffed in down here
where the slot is let's take a peek at
that in action flip back over to our
browser just zoom in a bit and refresh
so there's our important text it's bold
that's it not very much to that but the
concepts really important these
components we want to put into trees
because everything we do here is a tree
with say the body being the root in this
case or the HTML being the root we can
expand body we can expand app we're
going down branches of trees and it's
really really nice for composition we're
gonna be building component trees with
you much like we're going to be building
component trees with any other framework
just again with view we're able to set
all of this up in pure JavaScript and
demo a component without any tooling in
20 lines of code and have it all in one
self-contained file tried to keep all
the HTML in this just to really drive
home how simple view is but it gets
better
where we can go with you next is the
second data example so this I think
we've already kind of danced around this
a little bit but in this example it's
essentially what we've done before and I
just highlight it the same example was
previously where we're switching between
these edibles except now we have the
bold in there it's our own custom bold
tag and view is correctly updating the
view without obliterating that edible
which is exactly what we want
so flipping back to the code not much to
it it's just really really nice it gives
us these abilities to compose
increasingly complicated things now if
we were to do this in native JavaScript
we could definitely do this it just it
would be a little bit more work we're
gonna have to hop around those logs and
in the demo that I set up for the native
JavaScript version I just cheated I mean
it just does the exact same thing and I
think I mean I think I cheated if I
wanted to cheat I would have done
something like put the strong in here
like this and slash strong and then our
you know concatenate them or come up
with some function or some other system
of doing this I don't want to have to do
that I don't want to build the road I
want to drive the road to where I'm
going so I can deliver value to my users
but there's more the next stop
what good is an application if we can't
interact with it so in vanilla
JavaScript we can get at events like a
click for example pretty easily we can
say hey get us this element and we can
say hey maybe set the innerhtml
we're just setting in our HTML for this
example so we actually have something to
click on because we didn't put anything
in there there'd be nothing and then we
can actually bind to a click event and
cause some sort of side effect when
somebody clicks in this case we're just
gonna pop up a cheesy dialog box just
somewhat inspired by that earlier
conversation of talking about where the
junior dev was talking about program
correctness and it just came out of
happenstance that junior dev had never
lived through alert based debugging you
know we're really spoiled these days if
I flip over to the browser we've been
looking in this wonderful console here
this is a relatively new thing that in
the last 10 to 15 years has really
transformed the way we've been working
in the web space we didn't have this for
a long time what we used to have to do
was take our data and pop it in one of
these alerts so we could figure out
what's actually going on under the hood
now this is really no way to live but it
does demo that weekend it does demo that
we can at least you know display stuff
to the user and that's all well and good
but there's a lot of problems with this
it's not really necessarily obvious what
the problems are but right out of the
box we have to get a reference to an
element so we have to know where it is
we have to be able to find it as our app
grows that gets increasingly complicated
we also have to add an event listener to
it has our app grows and as we show
things and hide things this also gets
complicated because every time we add
one of these event listeners we actually
allocate a tiny piece of memory
somewhere in the system and that's not
really a big deal when we're doing it
once and we're not hiding the things but
over time if you're showing and hiding
things progressively it's very easy to
accidentally make a memory leak so
frameworks they give us a handle on how
to do this in a cleaner way so if I open
up the view version as you can
immediately see like in some of the
other examples it's a little bit longer
however as we scale this lengths
actually turns into shortness so what
we've done in this case we've got our
app we've got our message
we've used this magical view syntax here
to say hey on : event so unclick let's
call an alert method and we've added
this extra property down here to our
view object it's called methods and
we've given it one called alert
that's just calling alert so a little
bit verbose we could do this in a few
different ways that are a lot shorter
but I wanted to just detach things and
illustrate probably a more correct way
of doing it and having us call methods
now some people who have worked in
vanilla JavaScript are probably saying
yeah but you can do that in JavaScript
and you can like we could flip back to
our JavaScript we could say something
like click or is it no it's on clay
sorry
on click equals alert foo we could do
something like that which is great I
mean we can put that in line but then we
have to have access to whatever this
alert is so I'm just gonna flip to the
browser really quickly I think yep good
I'm still in the vanilla json' you can
see we've added this on click alert if I
click on there now I get the foo and
then I get the hello the problem with
this approach in vanilla JavaScript we
flip back to the code it's not
inherently obvious but this alert method
that we've called it's a global that's
available everywhere in our browser if
we wanted to start using our custom
methods we would actually have to expose
them to the browser if we wanted to use
this mechanism it's a great mechanism
but the problem is we have to get data
to it somehow so it knows where to find
it whereas in the view system click over
there all we really have to do here is
say oh the on click alert and alert does
not have to be global alerts actually
stuffed over here in this in this
methods collection and there are even
better ways in view of cleaning this up
especially when you get into the
component model I'm sure there'll be
demos of a little bit later so if you
solves a lot of problems with quick
handling and makes our life easier and
just to prove that it works we'll flip
back to the browser refresh and there
you see I can click on it it says hello
so not much to it but there's more we
have to do with Apps we don't just
display text we don't
just process clicks from users we
actually have to collect user input and
generally probably stuff it in a
database or send it back to a server do
something useful with it but it turns
out view is a full batteries included
framework and it actually includes
methods for handling forms and input and
output so our vanilla JavaScript example
what we've done is in this case I've set
up a more elaborate HTML blob we've got
our app just like before
but now we have this input and it has
its own ID called in it's got a
placeholder and we've got a slot for our
outputs it's also labeled out now in
vanilla jeaious we would have to say hey
let's grab this input element and you
know it might not exist
I didn't bother doing error checking in
this case but it might not be there and
that will throw you for a loop and we
also have to grab the output and again
also might not be there but we didn't do
error handling so just to keep this as a
terse example however in the real world
we wouldn't really want to write vanilla
J s that's not checking for these things
and then finally we add our event
listener on change and whenever our box
changes we're gonna just update the
output so let's see what that actually
looks like so we flip over to the
browser blow that up a little bit and
we'll refresh this so edit me alright
let's see if we can spell Toronto
correctly this time I notice I've typed
I'm still typing and nothing's really
changing yet but if I hit enter it
changes and that's just because if we
look in our source code here we scroll
down we're just listening to this change
event but we might want to have
something that's a little bit more
dynamic and it turns out there's a lot
of ways we could do that in vanilla
JavaScript it's just a lot more work
that we would actually have to do now in
the view example this is where things
really start to heat up and I really
really started to enjoy view if we look
at the view code for this finally we're
in territory we're actually in close to
even range with what we're doing in
vanilla JavaScript we have a relatively
simple app
division not too different from the one
we just did in the vanilla HTML except
the difference is we were able to say
hey view just use this V model binding
that you have built into your system
bind to the message property which again
messages here on line five here and also
on line 12 here so we've got that's all
the same message property that we're
referencing in three different spots and
here's the really fun part if I flip
back to the browser now and if I bring
up the view the view version and we
refresh to make sure we've got it all
says hello world let's just say Toronto
and you'll notice I spelled Toronto
again wrong but aside from typos you'll
notice that as I type everything is
updating in real time I can go back I
can go forwards and that is really
really handy we haven't if we look at
the source code here we haven't in our
actual JavaScript specified any of that
anywhere
there isn't source code saying hey
listen to a change vent there isn't
source code saying listen to unblurred
there isn't any of that stuff it's just
this few lines of new view here's a
message the rest is all in templates and
that is really really handy it means
somebody who doesn't know JavaScript can
come along come into a source code
editor and they could take some HTML and
all they have to know is the hey there's
something in the data call the message
and we want to bind to it that's it and
again other frameworks give you this
power but to do so in 17 lines of
JavaScript without tooling without
downloads without minification build
systems this is a wonderful property so
that in essence are the basics of why
people are loving view why it's a great
simple framework and why it could be a
solution to your problems so what's next
that is
hopefully answering what our JavaScript
frameworks why we have them and a little
bit about how and what makes you so
simple the next thing I'd like to talk
about are upgrades so everybody has seen
a little bit of a view probably already
interested given that you're out here on
a Saturday morning but how do you get
view into your app how can you leverage
it today
how can you deliver this value to your
users and there's a number of different
paths you can do some folks they're
gonna go for full-fledged upgrades
they're gonna take their whole existing
app and they're gonna say let's move
this all to view right now but let's
let's remember if you is a progressive
JavaScript framework we just we don't
need to introduce it all in one shot we
flip back to that code really quickly we
can see just how lightweight it is sorry
I'll just look on this window instead we
can see just how lightweight it is
there's really not much to it so it's
easy to start adding component by
component view to your system but I
don't want to pretend like upgrades are
easy because upgrades are never easy
every application is different there
aren't really clear-cut paths to what
the upgrade story looks like for anybody
and that is always a challenge every app
needs to be upgraded they need to stay
in shape upgrades as I've gotten a
second point here they're always painful
I mean even code that's architected
really cleanly and really well to be
resilient to upgrades can be painful to
upgrade and I experienced that over the
course of the week well I upgraded a
package that I'm gonna demo in a few
minutes
and I ran into sort of all the classic
problems we run into with modern
JavaScript tooling when I did it the
first bit out of the gate is routing is
challenging you've got a router that's
probably built into your framework that
you're using and it's probably loading
components up from your framework maybe
you don't have that if you're using
something a little bit more traditional
like say your jquery's and your lighter
pages then you can start using view in
really easily but if you're doing single
page application development just sort
of my bias I tend to I've been doing a
lot of single page application
development over the last decade upgrade
stay get challenging the problem with
these upgrades and the reason they're so
challenging is that it's very easy when
we're developing take business logic and
slip it inside of the framework code
inside of our view layer and as
developers we want
make sure that we are always separating
these concerns so we can keep our lives
simple so generally speaking the cleaner
the architecture the easier the upgrade
but again your mileage is going to vary
depending and I thought that I had an
app that had a relatively clean
architecture for upgrading and it it did
in a lot of respects but it it still had
its challenges and part of that was
because it hadn't been maintained part
of that was because of the dependencies
it's failed part of that was because the
JavaScript ecosystem moves very quickly
and the packages again dependencies it's
tailed but that meant to build system
it's tailed and even getting a build-out
it took a while to get that out there
the first thing though that I like to
see in any sort of upgrade path is a
separation a clean separation of that
business logic because we all have
business logic in our apps if we didn't
we wouldn't really have apps we'd
actually just have demos or show pieces
or some sort of really nothing the
business logic is the thing that's
delivering the value to your users and
again depending on the app of your
choice there's many ways to
progressively include you so the app
that I decided to upgrade for this
particular use case it happened to be
it's a game so it's not business II but
it's a game that's built in the Dom it's
a block dropping game so if you think
like dr. Mario or Tetris that kind of
thing I built this about a year and half
ago on an airplane just one of those
developer things really oh it's so
simple and then you know it wasn't I
ended up spending a lot of my holiday
trying to get it to go but that's what I
like to do in my free time so you know
to each their own
so let's take a look at what we've got
here I flip over alright so
so you can tell I obviously work at a UI
company because this is the cleanest UI
ever but that's not really the point the
point of this program was to see what I
could develop on an airplane pretty
quickly and again it turned into some
holiday programming but that's it I've
got three buttons here industrial
developer in view and they're all three
different frameworks it wrote this
application with the business logic very
much decoupled from the rest of the
program so much so that you can actually
switch between frameworks in real time
all right I'm going to refresh I'm gonna
click welcome and I'll just hop right
into the view version so there you can
see we have a simple block dropping game
and it's all done in the DOM and I can
actually flip between frameworks here so
if I come back over to this view here
where we can see our elements we can see
things like if I flip to say the
developer framework of choice you see
that display has gone to flex my view is
display:none and my industrial framework
displays none I can flip over to the
industrial back again and we can see hey
look there's that tree that I was
talking about earlier where everything
is sort of coming down and you can see
that these are all crazy amounts of text
coming down and again this isn't really
a business program
it's obviously a Tory game but no yeah
when I have developer tools open oh I
can actually do the the rotation this
kind of works but this is this is set up
for I think sort of dr. Mario rules
where you match enough colors and then
eventually the lines will disappear but
the point is more that as we flip around
in between frameworks it doesn't really
matter what we're using as a review
layer since the business logic separated
everything just sort of works TM now of
course this was not the case yes great
at all there were a lot of challenges
they weren't related to view they again
were more related to the build system
it's failed it took me a good hour just
to get things building properly but
again that's kind of a problem we have
with modern JavaScript frameworks we've
we've looked at the apps we've built
over the last decade and built out all
of this tooling and then slowly but
surely the tooling is starting to get in
the way of us delivering that value
to our users and that's one of the
things I like about view is that the
tooling overhead is very minimal so
that's that's sort of a tail of what it
was like to upgrade it wasn't too bad
but even though I had architected for
success it was still I found flaws in my
architecture there were things was like
whoa this is repeated I violated that do
not repeat yourself business and it was
really really unfortunate but at the
same time crafting view on top was
pretty painless there was less code than
with the other frameworks and I got it
done pretty quickly so let's clear that
out so I'm not displaying that and
before we segue into the last bit like
to just take a second to talk about
Toronto view Jas meetups so the company
I work for wrangle thought IO we've been
hosting vue.js meetups and we've got one
coming up on March 15th and somehow
we've actually managed to get Evan you
the creator review he's coming down so
if you're all interested in view you
should definitely try and come to the
Meetup there's some more details on the
next slide here it's a 7:30 to 8:00 p.m.
revenue is coming and I think the
tickets are going fast I took this
screenshot last night but even then you
could see there were a hundred and
fifteen people who had already
registered and I think the cap is
somewhere around 150 but don't quote me
on that go to the meetup site see if you
can still get in Evan you is coming and
it's gonna be great person to ask
questions too and with that out of the
way we're gonna wrap up with the case
review so I'd love to use view on my
next industrial project full disclosure
I haven't actually used it on a consumer
facing project just side projects but I
fell in love with it because it reminded
me of why I got into web programming in
the first place I can look at a browser
I can get code I can make that code run
on anybody's device everybody here has
at least probably two or three devices
on their person that can render and run
software written on the web browser and
view makes that simple and that's one of
the things I like about it so the first
case I have for view is onboarding
onboarding is always a challenge whether
we're talking about folks who are moving
from the design space into programming
whether we're looking at like grizzled
programmers who've been working on
dotnet or
backends and things like that all sorts
of folks are moving to the web I can say
that from experience the last two and a
half years I've probably been inside
about 30 different companies talking to
people about how they can move their
developers over to JavaScript or
typescript in some cases and onboarding
is always a challenge even professional
developers with a decade of experience
they use their Java or their dot nandha
their PHP and they say hey this looks
great I can do JavaScript it looks
exactly like what I do and then they
come and they do their JavaScript and
then they realize that javascript is a
really weird language and then they have
a bad time and they do not go to space
today so the other thing about view that
makes it really awesome is that you only
really need four things to get started
you need a little bit of knowledge about
HTML some may be basic to intermediate
as we all know HTML anybody can figure
it out it's just a markup language
you're tagging things making them strong
but it can get really complicated so
let's not trivialize it people would
also need a basic intermediate knowledge
of CSS we don't want to make apps that
look like the apps that I make so maybe
maybe I need to do some upgrading on my
skill set and T you see you're going to
need at least a basic to intermediate
knowledge of JavaScript
it's really really easy to get started
but again JavaScript as we all know it's
a little bit of a strange language and
there's lots of quirks and finally the
last thing you really need to be
successful and start with you is a good
text editor in a browser so you saw
today you can edit in straight HTML
refresh in the browser and it's really
easy and the great thing is the view
Doc's they really spell that out for you
when I read them the first time I was
like oh yeah I'm a developer I'm gonna
you know do my npm installs and all this
stuff and then the doctor like no just
include a script tag what its 2017 I'm
not I and anyway I sucked it up I did it
their way and I was so happy I I
couldn't even believe how simple it was
the thing about other frameworks not to
knock them but they do require all the
things that view requires and sometimes
more than an intermediate knowledge of
j/s but you also need the know package
management basics which for a lot of us
might be you know second nature however
for a lot of folks coming from other
environments you can spend half a day
just getting NPM working
you might need some CLI basics which is
like a command line or scaffolding
because a lot of these frameworks are
coming with their own command lines and
view does and then there might be some
other information that you need to know
too
the other great part of our view is it's
flexible and it has a large batteries
included official eco system it's got a
strong core it has routing it has state
management which Hassan is going to be
talking about a little later today
it's got template compilation so you can
optimize the app for distribution and
it's got this SSR business which is just
server-side rendering knocking out your
app on the server-side so you get better
SEO and quicker page loads that all
comes basically out of the box with view
and it's all officially supported so you
don't have to go find some library that
you've never heard of but again it's
flexible so you can also just mix and
match your solutions in fact their
initial routing guide is just to roll
your own router with html5 and it's
perfect for a lot of needs and with all
that said I'd like to thank you all for
again for coming out on a Saturday
morning to talk about view I think it's
a great simple framework and I think we
should all be considering it for our
next projects all right
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
