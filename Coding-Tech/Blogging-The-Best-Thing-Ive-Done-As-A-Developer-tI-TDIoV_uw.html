the top results was instructions to play
a Bon Jovi guitar riff that I posted in
college and it was wrong so I started
blogging and I found with blogging I've
seen a lot of benefits and today I want
to talk about poor of those that I've
seen I was developer I spent lots of
time deep in the code I'm programming
I'd be talking to a client and they'd
say something like how do I reply to a
comment well you let me get back to you
on that okay this is a basic workflow
thing but the fact is I worked with
programming I didn't ever work in the
WordPress workflow so when I started my
own blog I did write I'm in that flow I
understand oh well this is how I do this
on my site oh this is what we needed to
reply to a comment so I've got this
familiarity of the system and that's a
big help the other thing that helps me
understand things more is as a developer
don't tell anyone but there have been
times I have copy and pasted code that
worked and I didn't know why Thank You
Stack Overflow so when I turn that into
a blog post though I don't have that
option right you don't want to see a
blog post that says hey here's the code
I used it works somehow I don't know why
you have to take a little more time and
delve into it and understand what's
going on as I mentioned I used to be a
teacher and one of the things I found is
it's amazing how much more you learn
about something when you teach it you
really need to understand it and a blog
post gives me the chance to do that
recall I don't always remember things
very well and we have not yet got to the
point where I can just plug in a hard
drive and have that data though I'm
looking forward to that except for I
hope Apple isn't the one to do it
because they're always changing the
connections right it's like oh it goes
in the ear no no nope this new one goes
in the nose well the new one goes in
that spine spine
so I need to have this information
somewhere where I can go and find it
that's great I've got lots of options
about where I can store information I
could use a notebook right
but women things I'd like to be able to
do I'd like to be able to tag that
information
maybe categorize the information make it
searchable I get all that right out of
the box with WordPress that's default
functionality one of the things that
helps me with remembering when am i
useful blog posts I have a plug-in on
the dot-org repository it's called the
stop emails plugin all that does is stop
outgoing emails and I find it really
helpful when I'm working on client sites
when you have a plug-in on the dot-org
repository any time a new version of
WordPress comes out it's your job to
test the plug-in make sure it still
works and then you increment that tested
up to value to indicate that it works
with that version of WordPress and the
process of doing that involves SVN I
don't know how to use SVN so every time
I had to do this I'd need to go and
figure it out all over again and so I
wrote a blog post now and so whenever
it's time to do that I pull up the blog
post I follow a couple of steps and I'm
off to the races I'm saving myself time
there we don't need to know all the
answers but it's really helpful if we
know where to find them sharing this is
an amazing community we have I love the
WordPress community and and the sharing
that goes on and the web community
overall it's terrific people build
things they share them it's wonderful I
also really enjoy meeting with people
and discussing their problems and
helping them work through them and
sometimes that's paid client work but
there are often opportunities to do that
at other places things like meetups but
the fact is spending time with people
and helping them doesn't really scale we
only have a finite amount of time and I
found blog posts to be really helpful
because now I'll get an email from
someone hey Sal I've got this question
and I can say I wrote a blog post about
that check it out let me know if you
have questions we'll run from there and
it gets us into that subject so that's
been terrific in addition I can share
with people that I haven't even met
right so chrome clearing redirects
redirects you know we go one redirect
you're going to a new page some
those get cashed in Chrome and its
really frustrated and so I wrote a blog
post about this a couple of steps you
need to do to clear those out and and I
get a lot of traffic on this page and
hopefully everyone's finding it helpful
but these aren't people that I've ever
met or anything I'm not saying oh you
need to clear these redirects go check
out my blog post so it's really nice
being able to share with all these
people sometimes also I share with
myself because I don't know the answer
to a question I searched for it end up
it's my blog post that I find with the
answer yes I interestingly many of the
developers that I've spoken to who blog
say they have that same experience and
it's kind of fun because as a developer
you spend most of the time being very
angry with your former self right you're
always fighting
I can't believe old me did that right
and it's nice every once in a while to
say old me way to go you got this one
right brand-building
I'm a developer and when I hear brand
building it sounds like marketing to me
and that sometimes it rubs me the wrong
way but but we need to step back for a
moment and think about what brand
building really means right you want
people to feel good when they think
about you as developers we try and do
that all the time by writing good code
right oh yeah they write good code it
does what I need I like them and so we
want to build our brand we want people
to think positively of us and some
people might say well I work at a
company right my brands not important
but when you look around we've got a lot
of big agencies in the WordPress space
and I think a lot of the reputation has
to do with the brand of their employees
we associate that with them so building
your brand is great for your employer
you're bringing value to them that's
always wonderful to bring value also if
it's ever time to find a new employer
it's great to have built your brand
that's going to help you when it's time
to move on so these are the four big
benefits that I've seen from blogging
now lots of people agree with me that's
great Sal but you know there are hurdles
here that we need to address I just want
to take a look at a couple of those one
of the big ones I hear is I don't have
time and I look at its blogging as an
investment in myself right we talked
about earlier
I have a plug in the instructions for
updating the incremented up 2 value and
that saves me time I moved my site to
HTTPS a few months ago when I did that I
made some notes and I created a blog
post I used some WP CLI commands and
went through that so it's really helpful
now when I go for a client and I need to
move them to HTTPS I go back and refer
to that article I've got those notes it
gets me where I need to be I'm saving
time you don't want to be the lumberjack
trying to cut down the tree who's told
oh you know what that would go a lot
faster if you sharpen your axe I don't
have time to sharpen my axe I need to
get this tree cut down we want to be
efficient so it's investment in myself I
don't have anything to write about I
certainly hear that one as a developer I
would say if you have spent more than 20
minutes trying to figure something out
that would be a great blog post right so
if you could have saved yourself 20
minutes and in the future you could save
yourself that so you always have
knowledge to share and we're all at
different levels right so wherever you
were yesterday would really appreciate
it that blog post and there are lots of
people who are where you were yesterday
help them out the final money here is I
will look dumb yes and that's okay
sometimes we look dumb I'm particularly
good at that so I have often gotten
corrections on things that maybe I had a
mistake on or there was an improvement I
could made or something to just flat-out
wrong and the good news is most of our
community is filled with nice people and
they will tell you hey I think this
could be a little better if we did this
I like what you're doing but I'm not
sure if this area entirely right it's
great now I'm not gonna lie to you right
you were gonna occasionally get some
rude comments people really tear into
you and at that point I delete their
comment
this is my blog you can say bad things
about me just not here finally I just
wanna give you a couple of tips that I
found have really helped me and things I
try and keep in mind when I'm blogging
first one is keep a tight focus and make
it short we've got some great long-form
bloggers in the WordPress ecosystem
that's not a great place to start start
out with a problem and a solution
exactly what you need when you're
looking for something and you want to
solve it immediately write a draft
there were times I'd say hello this is a
good thing I'll have to remember to
write a draft tonight take that moment
go make a draft and just put your notes
in it
the bonus here is I will often find my
solutions in a draft post that hasn't
made it all the way to a blog post yet
it's that idea of expanding your memory
giving yourself that place so that you
have it all
so make a draft right away target the
keywords you've searched for so if there
was something you were searching for and
you didn't find your answer whatever you
were searching for would probably make a
good title for the article you're
writing SEO isn't about trying to trick
anyone or anything we want to make the
relevant content easy to find and you're
saying hey this is what I was searching
and this is exactly what I was looking
for it's a great way to guide people
there
and finally my tip is choose a wordpress
theme that doesn't require featured
images featured images are great they
look nice I use them a lot but they can
be a time-sink and you really don't want
to have a blog post you say oh I really
want to hit publish but I need to figure
out a picture I'm gonna put on this and
spend some time so use one that where
it's optional give yourself that out
thank you very much for your time I'm
