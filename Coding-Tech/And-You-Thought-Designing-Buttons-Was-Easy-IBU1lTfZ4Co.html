everybody's doing this now and Google
you'll see some examples from Google in
my talk Salesforce is a leader in this
area when I talk to in-house teams all
the executives want to ask the question
well how does Spotify do design systems
because Spotify does everything great
from a team perspective and I include
the u.s. digital service that's the
third row and third column and gov dot
UK on here because actually gov dot UK
had a woman who contributed to making
that system and she's like okay I'm done
I'm going to go to Australia and she's
making a whole system for that
government too and I think it's just
really wonderful to see all these
stories about design systems and in fact
Ashley from the Twitter design team got
into Twitter and measured conversation
about design systems and you can see the
progression and and how people are
talking about it a lot more I remember
that moment it was in September 2014
when I opened up material design for the
first time and I said to myself this
content is so awesome I'm actually not
using material design in my work but I
feel like I'm a better designer now
because I can see how they've modeled
all of that and then Salesforce happened
the next year and then it seems like
every every week there's a system
success story on medium when people see
these systems they see a big library of
parts to them it's a bunch of stuff that
we use and so here's an example of
semantic UI calm
they have header typography they have
error messages they have lists groups
and icons tabs and buttons and
breadcrumbs and then you go to Lightning
design system and they have headers
errormsgs list icons tab buttons even
bootstrap everybody wants a mini
bootstrap for them and lots of teams
start here with their own libraries all
the same stuff and so when we think
about what systems give us they give us
those solutions to what are perceived as
the easy problems so that product teams
can focus on solving the harder problems
and so my talk today here is to think
about the quality of those systems to
think about the foundation of your color
and your space and your buttons and
other components that you build
because when you make systems the
assumption is that the quality of what
they're going to use as a product team
will at least be as good or exceed the
quality that they're going to output the
criteria are high and so when you're
making a system you have to be able to
answer these questions when your product
teams ask what do you mean by quality
how are you going to assure that the
stuff we use that you give is good
enough for you what processes do you go
through and when you have that checklist
I think about the design first and the
visual quality of each of those elements
whether it reaches all the different
states and variations if it needs to be
responsive how is it responsive how
resilient are these components to
different lengths of content is it
composable with other components plus
the stuff you'd expect functionality
accessibility does it meet browser and
device compatibility that's the
checklist that when you make a component
or a new variation of your component or
you fix a defect you're targeting a list
of checkboxes like this so that you can
promise to your customers your product
teams that it's good and so we make
these big libraries these big libraries
are full of all sorts of different
components this is a slide I made for
one of my customers in January when I
was presenting to the product managers
on the team and said here's all the
stuff you now get with the system onward
with your product development and by
them seeing it instead of seeing a list
of items or seeing the documentation
site they got it they saw all those
different things that were made for them
and we can focus in on the button as the
first step in thinking about making a
design system in fact all those
properties of buttons the padding the
margin the background color the border
radius the type size whether you're
making the text upper case those things
set a stylistic tone for the entire
library just like Brad talked about
before I think it was direct with the
library the principle that they had that
meant no rounded corners and so even
here buttons start to evoke those
properties buttons get a little bit more
complicated though when you put that
nice primary blue button on a white
background it fits but then when you
start to reuse that button in a lot of
different places suddenly questions
arise around should I or shouldn't I
does it work in that middle
we're on top of that blue gradient when
the contrast between the background on
the in the foreground is at best
questionable and so we ask ourselves the
question of when can I use and where can
I use these components and it gets
complicated in addition to solve for
buttons isn't just to solve for the save
blue primary button but buttons are the
primary point of interaction there are
them the best affordance on a page that
screams click me and so what I'm going
to interact with that element has the
designer thought through all those other
states are you going to have a
progression indicator with inside the
button even the questions around a
single version of that button and then
you start thinking about other buttons
but what if we need a secondary button
let's make a gray because the primary
buttons blue well then when it's
disabled let's make that gray and so
what's the difference the tip on making
something disabled is also consider
altering the text color too because the
text color of submit on the right hand
side if that was disabled would be clear
as a disabled button and then my
favorite kind of button anyone want to
scream out what do we call these things
what's this kind of button called
anybody goes button anybody else got
another name outline button hollow
button empty button window button what
was the one you just said vacant button
good I've never heard that one before
that's awesome but this thing's really
dangerous it looks so sophisticated
doesn't it it looks so good and then you
put it on the designs and you're like oh
my gosh I can't see it at all it's
called a ghost button because you can't
see it in usability tests that I've
watched that is very true you especially
when paired with other kinds of
interactive elements that have a
background color that have better
contrast it's sitting alone on a page
like you initially saw I get it but in a
lot of other places those things simply
don't work and can you predictably trust
that you're going to have that button
appear in a place that will have it have
a high degree of contrast and so we
think about these challenges as systems
people and we go to principles like Brad
talked about earlier my favorite is
principle number four of the Lightning
design system
they talk about clarity and efficiency
and consistency but I'm drawn to the one
that is beauty on the lower right hand
corner and the reason is that last word
in the description craftsmanship that
when you make a system that you're
thinking through all of these details so
that when somebody your customer your
product designer or developer doesn't
have to worry about those things that
these pieces that they're using are well
crafted and then Etsy writes a story
called design for growth where they
clearly articulate the button change
that was very simple that they wanted to
make called a code diff that look like
this and suddenly that craft in buttons
woven through all of their systems is
just way too complicated it's not worth
the change it's so complex and the
potential regressive impacts of this
button change are not predictable and so
we return to that button and we think
about okay if we're going to craft a
good button what do we need to solve for
we need to solve for the version of the
button as well as all sorts of other
similar kinds of buttons maybe a button
that produces a menu my favorite is
split button or an icon only button or
button group and then yes we got the
tertiary although I didn't have tertiary
on there one of those could probably be
positioned as a tertiary button and then
two different states of the button the
different elements we want to use as a
button and all the other qualities that
the button needs to have is it
responsive now buttons for how they
don't need to worry about it that much
is it accessible you certainly have to
worry about that is it Thema Bulow would
you do that does the button look the
same on all the different browsers that
we have and so a product designer
product developer and a product QA
person got together and they made all
those different buttons on that previous
slide now maybe they took 200 hours for
all that stuff and let's just for the
sake of round numbers say they cost $100
an hour then that button cost $20,000 is
that an expensive button now there's a
lot of button in that button on the last
slide there's a lot of choices a lot of
configurations that if you're serving a
ecosystem of 50 to 100 product teams I
get it
you need to have those $20,000 I'm good
with
except that the story was for one of
those product teams and when you're
presenting buttons to executives as one
of the triggers of having them invest in
the system this is what makes them
scream even in an ecosystem of 10/10
product teams because they're saying I'm
paying two hundred thousand dollars for
buttons and I bet you all ten teams are
doing it differently I bet you they all
don't have the same answers and that
makes them want to scream brad has a
great button inventory trick that you
essentially do screenshots of all the
buttons that sensitizes them to
appreciate the problem but this kind of
cost and lack of efficiency and how
they're making product is unacceptable
to many of them in fact the first
question that I got in a pitch for a
system last October was how many fewer
visual designers do I need when we make
the system okay that's not why I'm here
I'm not I'm not talking about reducing
staff overhead but maybe we can redirect
all of their wonderful strengths to not
focus on the button problem anymore and
so there's the submit button and then
there's the Buy Now button because the
submit blue button happens on products
and the Buy Now button because it's red
and there is a lot of evidence that
people are drawn to red buttons
particularly if associated with the word
free right next to them that you want to
have on your e-commerce site and so
questions of color arise and even
hierarchies of systems arise but that's
for another day products and marketing
working together and so we talk about
color and I am enamoured by Google's 10
stacks
I love the array of colors that they
provide for choosing the color of a
button here the primary color is 700 and
that starts the conversation when you go
into a team and start to audit all of
their different products and you see the
brand red of that huge organization
across actually teams that we're
supposed to be working together and you
see all those different hex colors I've
been there a number of times you're not
trying to make all the designers feel
bad because they don't raise their hand
they I didn't code that the engineer
coded that just like we saw earlier this
morning but if we can't even get the
direction of the gradient writers the
diagonal is it
the top and so when you work on design
systems you want to settle those brand
colors early if you're a bank you're
probably going to be some flavor of red
and some flavor of blue but you want to
ground those so the decisions are stable
that people can trust even an early dot
release of the system that the basics of
color worked out and if you're going to
change some of the basics by working
with say the brand team where the brand
group has brand orange you want to
saturate it more you want to darken it
up a bit for whatever your objectives
are like Brad said collaborate with
people talk to people open the borders
between the different groups and
different disciplines to have
conversations I really also love how
many neutrals people have in their
system and a lot of times all those
neutrals in the middle like the 30 40 50
and 60 in fact those are really
problematic neutrals not just because if
you make a huge field of color on your
interface and it's sort of a medium gray
it looks really gross but it's a muddy
accessibility danger zone you have to
avoid those middle grades and in fact
you might have many grades near the
edges and a single gray or a second gray
right in the middle and so that there
are other basic choices - what's our
interactive color it seems like every
other system just chooses blue because
links are blue and everybody's familiar
with the clickable thing like a button
being blue you shouldn't be embarrassed
or have sort of self-loathing because
you went with a blue interactive color
especially companies that have red as
their primary brand color because they
don't want to conflict or make it feel
like everything's a warning from a name
ability perspective you choose all your
neutrals you a number I'm from 1 to 7
you have a bunch of variables you start
weaving them through and then suddenly
color three-point-five happens and then
color 3.25 happens and so you want to
avoid this kind of weird enumerated
sequence that actually doesn't have any
meaning other than the sequence by which
you decided what the hex color was so
instead consider enumerate them by the
lightness value I have success using HSL
as the number and that actually helps me
understand that between 30 and 70
there's a whole wide array of greyscale
that is not in use
in the system also when you look at
systems like material on the Left I love
all those colors they have 40 different
tints tax on their color page and I've
never worked with a product or an
organization that needed all that color
material exists to support so many more
people than almost every system that
will make in our lives and so limit the
color choices choose a primary orange
and then choose those orange shades and
tints on the edges of that primary
orange based on the hover or active
state or whatever other accenting you
need to do and then when you choose
those oranges be consistent about are we
going to handpick those colors because
we have total control over the
predictability of what that color will
be or are we going to allow as a system
community within our org the ability to
functionally transform those to lighten
and darken them using some staff
function for example I'm not as
opinionated here other than to say make
a choice and stick with it but I will
say that hand-picked colors are more
predictable from an accessibility
perspective you know what you're going
to get when you start to combine those
colors together another sub palette is
the success error warning a new color
palette you're going to have to choose
also accents for those probably maybe
for a band of color for a block level
error message on the top of a page and
so we start to think about how all those
colors are going to mix together and so
in my last year of work within systems I
work with about three to five system
teams a year to build system releases
this is coming up a lot more not just
how does everything look on a white
background but how can we make a system
that can be FEMA ball or predictably
show all the components on all sorts of
color backgrounds that we choose how can
we wrap an area of the interface and
everything within it magically recolors
itself so that when we choose background
colors see it just works and so the
first step in that process is choosing
are we going to just have a white and a
system black if not a pure black as a
background color are we going to have
for backgrounds actually so that we can
have light and dark toggled interfaces
where we have a sidebar that maybe it's
darker than the main canvas or a sidebar
that is a light grade
relative to the main canvas of the white
are we going to have actually eight
different background colors that we need
to model for because suddenly I'm
thinking about a data structure in my
head for all of those decisions that
we're going to have to make around how
all those pieces of text and other kinds
of backgrounds that overlay work and so
will work in a sketch file that looks
like this and we'll start in the upper
left and we'll make all those basic
elements but then we'll copy them over
to a second column and a third column
and a fourth column and as we copy them
we have essentially the starting point
or a sticker sheet of the what the
library is going to be and then as a
designer since we can trust the
engineers on our team we're going to
model this data correctly we can start
to choose specific colors for each of
those different dividers and background
colors and more in fact most systems
start with a cheat sheet of can you fill
in the blank please as a designer or as
an engineer I want you to identify
across these four background colors
what's the primary text secondary text
inline error text interactive blue link
text usually and disabled text and so
they make a bunch of choices and they
choose what each of those X values are
in the case of what you're seeing here
actually the colors are the same for the
light and the sidebar the first two rows
and they're the same for the third in
the fourth row but then after a while
we've modeled the data or the system
correctly because we anticipated they're
going to want to fine-tune those things
and one of the reasons they fine-tune
those things is because of accessibility
this is a chart that we made to depict
four different background colors all
that were dark and then candidates for
the primary text on the left you can see
secondary in the column labeled eighty
interactive and air text on the
right-hand side and when we take those
interactive and air colors inclusive
clearly don't work the contrast is
terrible they don't pass the
accessibility thresholds for even
double-a 18 or or double-a let alone
triple-a which is really a much stronger
level of contrast and so we fine-tune
those values we have back around and and
border colors you see that the error in
line error text on the right hand side
is white instead of red because it's
associated
with now an SVG that we're coloring the
fill of the exclamation point just as
much as we're coloring the outline
portion or the the filled portion of the
red that surrounds the exclamation point
we're making those decisions because
we're seeing how the components are
displayed on all those different places
each one of those border colors actually
is unique per column each one of those
header colors is actually distinct
although maybe your eyes and picking
them up and each of those cards that we
make we start to have very deliberate
discussions around well okay if we're
going to have a light colored card on a
dark background to have a really strong
level of contrast how are those two
colors going to play with each other and
in the upper right hand corner we've got
a light gray 95 let's say on top of a
light background which is gray 90 so yep
we're going to need a drop shadow to
separate those two things and that that
actually was the trigger moment that a
drop shadow entered into our system
fairly late on in our first release
cycle when we were making those cards I
look at a lot of libraries in my work
each of the columns here represents a
what might be fairly well known library
Salesforce lightning Google material
Walmart system semantic UI ZURB
foundation bootstraps us web design
predix UI and Etsy and then I but rarely
chose a range of background colors that
are all fairly light starting with white
and you can see even there to just feel
like you could trust those systems since
they're so popular I don't want to come
down on them hard I've made a lot of
mistakes too but some of these have what
I'll say questionable levels of contrast
accessibility even on a white background
for the blue text even materials buttons
white foreground or white text on top of
that saturated blue is a color doesn't
score that great from an accessibility
perspective and so we built a tool it at
my company eight shapes called contrast
- grid you enter in a bunch of colors on
the left hand side and you can have
optional labels next to them and we'll
do this early often rapidly as we're
working through that sticker sheet to
test all of these different things you
can even see at the bottom three rows we
have a blue that's effective on the
extremes of background colors you notice
the FFF
leftmost column and then the zero zero
zero black column and then you have
effectives on lights or an ineffective
blue and getting the right blue to be
well accessible across a range of
background colors is almost in
optimizing impossibility but you do your
best and you try to at least solve it in
good places and so designers will see an
early version of that sketch file start
copying those colors and then a
developer might see that same thing and
using dropper tool and take that totally
inaccessible blue and put it into their
code and that's bad and so at least
let's start making some variables so
that we enclose that particular system
blue in a reusable form so that they can
apply to the background I guess that's
better that's what I see when I look in
a lot of systems a lot of system - blue
or system - blue dot 1-2-3-4 when I look
at SAS files and across different
libraries but what about the time when
across an organization that has say 50
different product teams you choose the
right blue you have a system team that's
concentrating on all this optimization
and they want to apply that to buttons
and links and some other accents okay
that's a good choice that color is good
but and then they look at the ecosystem
of all the products and they say oh my
gosh look at all those different
repositories they all have their own
most of them are well structured they
have a variables file somewhere in the
repository that has all these SAS
variables or less variables and stylist
variables or maybe if they're working on
iOS or Android it's in some XML file or
JSON file but those decisions are
splayed all over the place and so Brad
talked about this too this morning but I
want to revisit this topic around design
tokens and salesforce pioneered the
abstraction of a visual system put into
data form and then spread across a lot
of products those design tokens can take
the form of a lot of different visual
choices colors but also how you're
applying those colors to background
texts and borders font family font size
line height all sorts of different
choices that you can essentially record
in your token file and then this is an
example from a library I worked on last
year called comet and this becomes a
cheat sheet for all the developers even
if they're not using you
markup even if they're not using your
components but they just want to start
hooking into a lot of the visual choices
of your system because that's how much
time they have to spend to bring it up
to some level of adoption maturity and
also it's a cheat sheet for designers to
all those choices and their actual
values associated with them these little
pills start to form the annotations
instead of specific measurements or what
have you so that they're the
conversation in the language between
designer and developer improves so that
as a designer I'm creating a card and I
can say oK we've got the card overall I
want to have this amount of space
underneath it and I've got that little
copy container underneath the thumbnail
of the card and we here's how we want to
use the background color on the
foreground color for the text and the
font size and the padding to inset all
of those elements inside that block and
so we have those tokens and we actually
use the animal as a format I never heard
of a animal before but it's a much more
lightweight syntax that has the
hierarchy you can include variables in
it and it's much more readable than some
of these other formats and the thing is
that these design decisions that go into
that yamo file is a place where I try to
create inclusivity for designers to then
make pull requests against the
repository those are the choices
designers should control and model with
their engineers rather than just throw
something over slack and have the
engineer create this hierarchy because
that hierarchy is very meaningful for
designers they can make those changes
and when they make a change the build
tools and propagated outs converted into
JSON which is then converted into all
sorts of other files and all those other
files become the dependencies that
product teams use when making their own
products so I love tokens I'm like a
token architect because I was an
information architect until I started
being called a UX designer so this is
right up my alley and so I started to
think well actually how much is style
complexity is there in all these
libraries that we work on all these kind
of variables and so on and so I looked
actually at six different libraries when
I was making discovery comment you see
there that one in the bottom middle I
looked at an old library that I had
worked on before for a company called
net app and then other major players
like serve and bootstrap material and
Salesforce lightning and I looked at all
of the CSS in the entire repository of
the library and I stripped out all of
the comments all the delimiter x' that
were unnecessary all the selectors and I
put all 11,500 declarations into a
spreadsheet and then I classified each
one of those by particular categories
like type or space or color or layout
for example like layout would be a float
property would be used for layout and I
also looked at whether or not they were
hard-coded choices you can see like on
line 1640 that's a hard-coded choice of
two M whereas on line 16 33 it's
referring to a base font size variable
within the repository turns out
bootstrap and Salesforce lightning both
were around 80% variables with all of
these whereas mine were I had something
to aspire to we were around 70% with
that but that made me appreciate how
much you can really enclose in to those
kinds of token files and here's what
actually the complexity looks like
there's a ton of color and there's also
size and type and size and color
combinations and so on but if you look
at the very top material design Lite
with all those forty ten stacks they
have to support there's a ton of color
and if you took material design Lite out
of this the most used property type is
space not color which gave me a lot of
inspiration when I think about padding
margin less right top and bottom that's
what properties correspond to space here
in this analysis there's more of those
choices than any other kind of visual
property within our systems and so I
look I return to the button and I think
to myself yeah there is a lot of space
and button the padding on the top and
the row the padding inside the button
the margins outside the button and how
it relates composedly to all the other
things in the library there's a lot of
space everywhere and you know what
spacing can be so sloppy in our design
artwork it's something that we kind of
avoid I look at this card and I think to
myself oh I've got a lot of elements in
it but I think it looks pretty well
spaced out and then you hand it off and
the engineer that's supposed to build
this thing says what's with 20 to 20
6:12 and 28 is this what's supposed to
be because I just coded it committed it
and it was merged and because that's
what the design file had and I as
totally not a system of space whatsoever
that's just a designer not even pixel
pushing their own comm so instead we
need to do space so well let's make a
grid because that's what space is how we
create visual order and an overall page
layout we've got gutters of 32s that are
green we've got margins that are thirty
twos at the edge of the viewport perhaps
or the edge of some big block of our
layout and we feel like we're done with
space but grid is not space grid is a
component that uses space it just so
happens that grid is invisible to us and
it makes us feel like we've got a
starting point to put all our parts in
but there's so much more space built
into all the individual components and
so we need a system for space and so
people say I've got a magic number at
six everything is going to be sixth in
our system and why is six awesome
because it's two times three and when
you have twos and threes you can create
almost any number except prime numbers
up through like what 18 maybe 21 in fact
you go like 12 15 16 18 you can have any
of those options I'm like why would you
want all those options that's crazy
because there's not an appreciable
difference between 15 and 16 when you're
thinking about space whereas 16 and then
powers of two actually becomes a much
more meaningful choice and that is a
geometric progression which to me as a
mathematician I have a degree in math I
really just love because I like to have
formulas on the screen but when we made
our spatial system for that comment
repository or that common library that
we made the the medium size that 16
sizes used 41% of the time you can see
the step up to eight and the step down
to 32 represented almost 90% of the
spatial choices that we had where we
were using those particular values and
that's a lot better than linear and the
reason is not because we don't need 4
and 8 maybe 12 need 16 but because
there's no appreciating 'fl difference
from a space perspective between 28 and
32 and then 32 and 36 you don't need all
those choices and so well we've got
these stops
what are we going to name them and I
said Kevin I really love Gmail's cozy
comfortable and compact labels I just
sit there and play with that thing I'm
like look at my thing spaced out and it
becomes some more dense and then it
becomes more comfortable and becomes
more dense let's use those terms and
he's like okay what are you gonna call
the bottom two
I said what you think of teeny and
Spartan you like that's good and I
luxurious everything is luxurious here
when it gets really big it's luxurious
I'm not even going to go anymore with
that okay let's stay away from luxurious
it's a bad term for talking about space
and design system and so no that's and
those aren't good labels we go with
t-shirt sizes or something like from 1x
the proportional difference going in
either direction and suddenly we have a
better way to think about turning the
dial let's say we went with t-shirt
sizes I kind of regret it now I wish we
would have gone with this kind of system
because those are actually I should be
4x
sorry that's a typo on the side I would
somebody caught that but to me that's
still not getting at the root of
thinking systematically about space
we're just talking about how much space
do we are we going to have in all these
places as opposed to how are we using
space what are the different kinds of
ways that we're spacing things out
within our repository I start with a box
model most of the stuff I do is the web
almost all and so I think about well how
does an engineer going to make and
spaced out things and I look at that
card and I add these dashed lines
because in my mind's eye that's how I'm
thinking about the space model actually
working and when I think that way
suddenly I can create different concepts
of space that help me differentiate
between here the pinks and the blues and
the oranges and the greens and what
those correspond to were concepts that
we wove through using new vocabulary for
that system and we've stuck with it for
libraries that we build sense because
when we talk about an inset where we
talk about a squished inset that has a
different spatial perception of how that
works and so insight was the basic one
you can think of it as padding but
remember we're trying to use these
decisions across platforms we want to
inset from the edge of a gray box the
card has a regular medium sized inset
the error message has a large inset the
galaxy's pill and the
icon button might be using a small
insect but for things like buttons data
tables and lists groups we wanted to
have a predictable way that it was more
inset on the side than on the top of the
bottom almost as if you had taken that
box and you would push it down squeezed
up like a cheeseburger and so those
insects squish happened in a lot of
components we have a pagination
component that also looks like this too
and so well we have squishing instead
then we clearly must have an inset
stretch where it feels like you're
stretching out the form control like a
text box in a text area well we're
making a system we've got all these
facial concepts let's add adds a stretch
concept except we never used it anywhere
else and so even when you're creating
useful concepts to weave through your
libraries or foster collaboration or
clear communication between people make
sure that when you're going to read
something get to the second or third
time of reuse before you really
institutionalize it with some value
within your system that is globally
available this is now in our tokens file
it's a total distraction when people see
all that they're like oh what I use that
for when we say pretty much nothing
that's don't reuse it because we have no
use for it and so you don't want to get
caught in that stack things we suck
things all the time and so what's our
stacking system
it's not about baseline typography and
that's that stuff which I am NOT an
expert at but how can we have a simple
set of stacks options so that we can
space things out and the address label
can be more associated with the two
boxes below it then the last name
textbox that's above it and how can we
think about within a component the
separation of the cards video label of
the type and the supernova title versus
between components how there's a bit
more space that will stack it when those
cards are displayed in some vertical
arrangement in line is similar how we're
going to separate things out that are
flowing in line and my crap and then
once we have those spatial concepts we
revisited the grid and said okay we have
a good sense of what these numbers are
and they're now more meaningful and
we're now going to change the grid
component to use those spatial concepts
that we have and so it became a pretty
simple cheat sheet when we go to other
designers within the org and we say your
space and stuff out what do you think
about using
these principles and you can look at the
component library also to to understand
how to apply many of them and they say
we got it we're good
those aren't that many options that's
not that complicated we can move forward
with that what if we need helpers well
suddenly these helpers that are
available and they do get used they're
still around they help us get over the
hump of where we need some special sauce
in a particular declaration or we're
just applying it to a padding left
instead of a padding overall for an
inset or things like that but guard
against those that's almost my way of
looking through a pull request and I
always hone in right on the changes to
the tokens file and the changes to the
CSS because I'll look for uses of
helpers and I'll say can we be more
specific
and I have a way to talk with the
engineers that are working on components
to fruitfully have those conversations
another thing that really helps us be
successful was we solve this line height
problem some might not think of it if
it's a problem but we always think of it
as this pesky thing that when you have a
line of test text like video that's that
there's a certain amount of space that's
unpredictably put on top and bottom of
that text and so we wrote a mix in that
essentially crops it out there we did a
lot of math there's a formula thing this
morning it has about the same number of
factors but it takes the before and the
the after element of that particular
element like the video tag that you see
there at the top and it just crops it
essentially uses a reverse margin a
negative margin to bring that in produce
predictably based on a default line
height or some other line Heights that
the system typically uses so that was
really helpful and it helped us not just
because we wanted to have a quick way to
crop stuff but suddenly the stuff we
build uses tokens that correspond to
what the designers see in their comps
and that's what that's the connection
that was most meaningful to me and so we
make things like cards and you can see
those in set and stacked concepts woven
through you do see a couple spacers in
there as well nobody's perfect but if I
was to make a card clearly these
concepts are straightforward for me to
follow and suddenly it's a quick
conversation for us to have between a
designer and an engineer we got about
90% coverage with those spatial concepts
we hard-coded
things particularly in the documentation
side of the system that we made but when
we were making components that other
people are going to use and we want to
tune the dial of space most of the
things we can trust are woven throughout
the entire library in fact even though
it wasn't a requirement the director aux
that was working on a set of products
for younger kids said I really wish we
could just take our products and puff
them out a bit because kids that are
kindergarten through third grade need a
bigger UI they need bigger targets we
need bigger type and we I said well you
can change the in sets but not affect
the stack like this and just weed that
to the whole library and it's like two
lines of code and suddenly her eyes lit
up not because she had a solution for
the specific project that she was on but
I was excited to see that she saw the
opportunity of thinking systematically
about how to approach her color her
buttons her space and so I write a lot
about this stuff I'm on medium I
probably write once every couple of
weeks these the things that I talked
about here are from a few articles that
that I've written in the past but I talk
a lot about running a systems team
thinking about it like a product and in
other topics too if you're interested at
all in this design system stuff Gina
from Salesforce set up a slack channel
and I'm one of the other admins and work
about 2,500 people in an open slack
community that are talking about CEO the
Salesforce tool tokens code running
products are working with products all
the different channels for different
topics of working with some systems so
join us there it's free just go to this
website and it'll auto invite you via
email to that so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
