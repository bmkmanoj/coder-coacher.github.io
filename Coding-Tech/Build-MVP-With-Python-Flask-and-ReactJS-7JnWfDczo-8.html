gel which is a systematic hedge fund
based in London where I'm a Qantas
developer I'm really excited to be here
today to tell you about how you can make
a full circle occations with Python and
PM webpack and react now being able to
transform an idea into an actual product
is an incredibly valuable skill both for
your career and for you as a person it
can kind of take you from thinking of
something and making a minimal Viable
Product that you can I be use to start a
startup make a new application at work
and get that promotion that you're
looking for because you can show that
you can actually create things and make
something happen so today I am going to
be showing you how to make a simple web
application like this this is a single
page web application when you flick the
button it changes with what it says
we're giving you hello in a different
European language it has a background it
has some style but it's not really doing
anything very complicated so what does a
web app look like this is an example of
this application which I would say is in
general quite a good representation of
what a web application would look like
it has a prompt them and it has a
back-end the front end is what you see
here in blue and green and it consists
of what the user sees and how the user
interacts with the web application I'm
going to explain this with the
assumption that you have a basic
understanding of what HTML CSS
JavaScript and poisonous and if you are
a perfect expert in all of these things
then this talk might be a little bit
basic for use but bear with me so the
index.html page is what essentially
creates a structure for your website
historically this
be an entire skeleton of what your butt
looks like but because we are using
react reacts actually component ties
with all the pieces of your website so
all of these things actually live in
react now instead of in HTML and we will
essentially just be loading in our
compressed JavaScript react files into
our HTML file and that's literally what
that file is going to be we then have
these two light blue file to the top it
is our style file and our javascript
file these have both been bundled by our
extra tools so if you look in these dark
blue files and they are our react files
we take our react files which have been
written in days x they are passed into
the babel comatose babel conversion to
normal JavaScript web pack then converts
this to something that our browser can
understand because web back only
understands normal JavaScript and then
we attach those things to our browser
when we talking through the backend when
we are clicking that little button what
happens is that we are using a
JavaScript library called jQuery you are
HTTP request to ask the server hey can I
get a new type of hello please and the
server will return that to us and we
will display it on our website so for
this example we are being going to be
using flock which I'll get faster more
later so first things first this is
going to be our initial project set up
you have a folder in your folder you
will have a readme to tell other people
about your project and what you're doing
and you'll have a project folder
respectively this project folder has a
server folder and a static folder the
static folder is a front-end it holds
your JavaScript your web path your babel
your npm and we're going to start by
going in there i'm building our
front-end so the first thing we are
going to need is a javascript package
man
sure and package manager I'm sure you're
familiar with from using things like
pace or app gas and agree just manages
your packages it makes life so much
easier because you don't have to worry
about going to this website to download
the new versions our package making sure
you have all the right dependencies what
are even my dependencies by using a
package manager you just say oh I want
this one in this one in this file and
it's download the version you want or
the latest version and you can easily
see what's going on so we are going to
be using NPM NPM is automatically
included with nodejs if you still
install that but it is really a separate
application and you can use it with
other languages and just no js' but it
is a JavaScript package manager it's
very easy to use it has a lot of
packages it has about half a million
packages it's well documented and it is
actively being developed so it is
essentially a safe option that isn't
just going to be deprecated in two
months at least I hope not
so the first thing we're just going to
do is initializing NPM for our project
this has really good default and you
basically just follow the defaults and
this creates a package of JSON file the
package does Jason file ends up in our
static directory like you can see here
in pink so preference everything that
things is the things that have changed
the package of station is really useful
for multiple reasons it's just a file
you can look at it and it tells you who
is responsible for the project what
version is the project how do I contact
the developers what keywords are
relevant to this project and it also
means that any other developers can very
easily install and run your projects and
it should be completely reproducible so
this is what my participation looks like
as you can see there a name there is a
version there's dependencies and a
license so everything I really need to
know about how this front-end work
the next thing we're going to need is a
module bundler this minimizes the number
of script tags in your JavaScript so if
you've done a bit of JavaScript before
you know that once you start kinda
having quite a few JavaScript files you
need to add them all your HTML the index
or similar and you need to add them in
the right order because if you add them
in the wrong order then everything is a
global and depending on you know how you
do this it gets quite messy and it takes
a long time to load so by using webpack
this bundles our dependencies
essentially give it an entry points and
based on this entry point it creates a
dependency tree of all your dependencies
and then you attach this bundled
javascript file to your HTML that is one
script tag for one entry point and this
basically means that you no longer have
to worry about Global's
you no longer have to worry about which
order do I importing then you no longer
have to worry about having loads of
script tags and having a really
unreadable code it's easy to see what's
attached and how do I run it it also
just lays in what you're loading which
means that it's actually essentially
your pages are going to be loading
faster right so this is what web pack
looks like with its mode basically it's
bundling so it creates takes all your
normal modules and turns them into
static modules and one important thing
to note about note about web pack is it
only understands JavaScript
this means that anything else needs to
be converted into JavaScript to be used
this is both a benefit and a bit of a
problem this means that we add a loader
or a plug-in for everything else you
want to add this means you want to add
CSS there's a loader for that you want
to add files there's a loader for that
you want a background image there is a
loader for that obviously there's a
little bit of a learning curve there I
would want to kind of start getting the
hang of it it's actually quite ok but
the benefit of everything being a module
is that you can attach it and require it
inside your JavaScript so I can require
my CSS file in my JavaScript and I can
require my background image in my
JavaScript which is actually what quite
really quite powerful and it also
integrates seamlessly with NPM so this
probably get started with Belfast you
install it using NPM and then you add a
file for webmasters gasps it's really
just task analysis to only thing you
need to get started is an entry point
and the output and the entry point is
just going to be our JavaScript
directory and of the index file in there
and then our output is just going to be
a bundle of gear and then we export this
and it ends up here in our static folder
and we can really get ready to use that
now if you want to have a if you have an
application that is a multi-page
application instead of the single page
application we are using this is how you
would do it so you can have multiple
different entry points for your
different sites you can have an index
page and about site and they will all
have a different entry point creating a
different bundle so in this case you can
just ask what happens in the output
where we have the bracket named Estrella
and this would just be named after your
entry point name okay
so let's actually do something
interesting with this we're going to
start by displaying an alert this is
going to be our updated directory tree
we're just adding an index.html file and
a JavaScript file and then you can also
see where our bond will ends up but so
okay the index this is super easy as I
mentioned previously you literally just
add your bundle to your body of your
file and that's it everything you need
to do all the layers and behavior is in
react in our index dot J's X file all
we're going to do is add an alert this
is literally only for a file on the
symptoms of effectively that is in our
file and that's enough to create an
alert
we don't need to build a replication as
well I always add some run command when
I build my application around commonness
an alias for example if you either
watched command as you can see I've seen
yes then use watch as the word instead
of that remembering that entire line or
all the parameters and it just makes
your develop and presence a lot more
fluid it means that you don't have to
remember the giant lines and you can
kind of just do a build and it just
builds it's similar to using make file
so when you start the watch commands
watch is special in the sense that you
start in a different tab and you just
keep it running and it automatically
builds any changed files and recreate a
new bundle for you so you don't need to
worry about actually making sure that
you've compiled your code manually
because what just going to do that for
you that means you can refresh your
browser window and see your changes
immediately instead of sitting there
going okay I made some changes but
they're not displaying and five minutes
later you realize just because you
forgot to build we open the index.html
page and tada we have an alert great
okay let's do something more interesting
we're going to add react to this now why
am i using react I really like react
because it allows you to build small
componentized
UI with reusable components it makes it
really easy to basically do repetitive
things without having to write the same
code over and over and over again which
is very good computer science
methodology in general it's easy to
maintain and it's easy to render
components unchanged and all the logic
foreign components lives within the
components which makes it very easy to
basically see what's going on and see
what lives where and which does one
component for another one without
problem so we're going to install react
and then we are going to add a react
file which is basically replacing that
alert we had previously with this text
so we actually always needs to import we
have to be able to use react obviously
there's a few things to note ere the
reacted or means that we are essentially
displaying things in which we are as you
can see when I'm importing my app
there's a doctor flash in front of it
this means I'm importing it from a local
file that I've created instead of
external dependency and you might think
that being able to use brackets is kind
of weird inside my JavaScript code the
business essentially was JSX stuff it
allows you to use custom effectively
HTML tags with your own created classes
so the app here is successively our
entry point into this part of our react
code around our applications we are then
going to add the app class which is
something that actually does something
in this case we are going to just have
it display hello app and we need to
export the falls on this class so you
always need to be able to you always
need to export your classes to be able
to import them somewhere else and it's
good practice to only have one class per
file and which which means as we can
basically just export default this is
where our new file ends up in the
JavaScript directory next to the index
file now what is JSX it's effectively a
syntactic extension to JavaScript it
means that you can use XML and HTML tags
in your JavaScript code and you can use
your custom classes directly in your
JavaScript code so it lets you write
those HTML tags to see there instead of
ReactOS create element blah blah blah
which makes your code a lot more
readable but how do we make our browser
understand that JSX
okay so for this we need to use Babel
Babel is fantastic is convert your you
know top state-of-the-art really modern
JavaScript into JavaScript that any
browser can understand
so it allows you to use JavaScript and
allows you to use JavaScript that it's
modern without having to wait three
years for your browser to start
eventually being compatible with it it
also allows you to use JSX because it
converts JSF into standard old
JavaScript so we able to use Babel we
need to add presets and Babel has preset
basically means what types of JavaScript
do you want to do understand and convert
the clean so we're going to add es 2015
and we're going to add reacts which
basically means these are the currently
the two types we can use we don't need
to go to our web pack config and also
add a rule for how we're going to treat
es x-files note for this but we are
excluding node modules node modules is
the directory where all your external
dependencies and though this basically
means that when we're not compiling this
we are going to save a lot of time every
time we're rebuilding our bundle because
we're not interested in retranslate in
this every time we're going to open the
index.html page in a browser and they
should say hello react which it does we
don't need to add a Python flask server
you need to go to the server folder and
ensure you are in a Python virtual
environment and you don't need to
basically install floss because we are
going to be using cloud so i'm previous
class project like this because of the
micro server or a micro framework it's
really easy using it started with if i
was doing a big industry project i would
probably be using something like pyramid
or django instead but it really depends
on what you need to use it for and we're
just adding a file called server top i
your server folder in here setting up
class it's very easy
so you just need to point us where your
static bundle is and where you end up
with hTML is and then you need to store
it and then okay so we have two two
routes to our server we have the default
route to the Getty when you just go to
the server and then you have the route
giggity when you go to /hello we are
going to be using the default route to
just load our website and then we're
going to be using the slash for low end
point to get all those different hellos
with you so in the beginning for now
it's just going to return or static
hello world we can start our server and
go to localhost 5000 and we will see
that hello reacts is so previously
because then it's basically connected
your react and your Python back-end now
this is great but how do we actually
make we have to communicate with that
back-end we need to use jQuery or
whatever other library of your
preference but I quite like using jQuery
so with jQuery we basically just call
the URL in question which is our
localhost URL which slash hello and then
we get some data back and with that data
we are going to display in our console
to check that it works and we are also
going to be passing it to a different
function to handle that data so this
function you see here we're going to be
adding to our vehicle we are not going
to be changing the Python in the backend
to do something a little bit more
interesting so instead of just returning
that static hello world we are going to
be returning a series of different
European hellos notice that there is no
English hello because that we would have
to update our code in about a year to
remove it anyway
so yeah and we just return a random word
from that list and I think it's nice to
be able to say hello to someone special
instead of saying just a generic hello
so we are actually going to be making a
few changes to our react code here we
are going to be using a car instead of
just putting all our code in in our app
file because that means that we could
technically have ten things saying hello
to someone on our web on our front page
instead of just one but for the sake of
this we'll just do one so you might
recognize this the render function from
previously in our ass 50s X file
I made it a bit more interesting by
adding a page header which is where our
information is going to go and also we
have this class now called glow which is
passing in a name called Remini what we
want to do is we want to create a class
called Lotus JSX
and we want to pass in a parameter to it
that is the name you want to say hello
to okay so how do we do that to do that
you need to add a hello to CSS file
naturally and then you need to create
the hello class as previously you need
to export default on the class to make
sure it's accessible outside and you
need to have a constructor the
constructor of powers in this thing
called props the props here is
essentially everything you passed in on
creation of the class props are
immutable and you're not allowed to
change them we don't therefore need to
also have a state states are internal
you can change them and when changing
safe edge generally when data is
actually updated on your website so in
we click that button and see a different
type of hello that is because we've
changed the state and updating of the
space you're you Argus re-rendered but
we never touch the props so as you can
see here we are initiating the state
with a greeting key and it just says
hello and the name is awesome which is
really so hello Remini also notice that
we have to rebind this this is because
this is not bound by default so when we
are trying to call a function when we
click a button if we don't rebind this
on that function we're just going to get
undefined if we try to use this within
the function and this is just a
JavaScript thing it's not really out
reacting as such but it's important to
keep in mind so we are going to be
adding this function to our hello class
and this is the function that handles
the data we passed in so we get a new
type flow from our server we passed it
to this function last data and then the
rerender safe when you rerender the safe
you always have to use this website with
your key because if you try to do what
we just did in the constructor it's I'm
actually going to re-render the UI so
that's why you always have to use this
source of state so okay let's render
that hello we wanted to be out put a big
hello a little bit of a lion and then a
button that is no place to change your
hello to do this
I'm added an h1 which are actual waiting
and H are in the middle and then a
button that's goes say hello whenever
you pick low and I used the bootstrap
buttons for this because they come quite
a fourth with quite a nice UI without
you having to do anything and they are
very active version that you can just
imported already half these are this
functionality so what do they get now we
get the UI it says slow Remini and a
button great okay so how do we go from
this to something a little bit more
interesting I want to add some CSS i'm
as previously
javascript only a web pack only
understands javascript so i need to add
a loader
and I'm going to stall the stoy loader
CSS loader on an extract plug-in we need
these two loaders to convert our CSS
files and then we need the extract
plugins to be able to extract our
bundled CSS from our generic JavaScript
bundle into something we can actually
attach directly to our index.html file
so you can render our JavaScript and our
CSS separately if you don't extract it
and attach it separately you're
basically going to have your UI probably
be rendered after all your JavaScript
has gotten been rendered which is going
to have very weird side effect so we
need to add a plug-in which is the
extracts loggin and the naming things
you can see there is what we've decided
to name our bundle CSS file and that is
what it's going to look like in our
directory tree notice that there is a
difference between my CSS file tool
start your CSS and my bundled file
style.css and this is because our
browser only access to the bundle files
if you try to load up the normal CSS
file you're not really going to get the
result you expect it's just not going to
apply your styles so you need to attach
the bundle one and basically load that
up so how we do that is adding a process
just CSS to our folder
I'm added a few cell service just
something to make it look a bit nicer
and then I need to require my four
stacks of CSS file in my react code if
you don't load it into your react code
it's not going to be picked up when web
pack is bundling and it's going to
things you have in a Cell supplied and
as a result it's not actually going to
get compiled and then we need to add the
style sheet which is the bundle
stylesheet to our index.html page and
what we end up with then is that
and now you can see I still have been
applied it looks different and it's
quite nice but I would still like to
basically add a background image adding
a background image is just adding an
image or image folder we need to then
use a file loader to load up image when
you use a file loader you can specify
what types of files you wanted to load
so in our case we are going to specify
that we will load JPEGs PNG etc and that
is just another rule in your web pack
config and then you need to basically
add a background URL to your CSS as
we've done here but the caveat here is
just adding this your CSS is not going
to actually make your image show up you
need to also load your image in your
react code to be able to have that image
show up and this is something that a lot
of people seem to be quite confused
about just judging by googling it
because because basically you need to
import your image you then need to
create a new image object and add your
image as the source for that new image
object and then you need to render your
image in your render function in that
file and only if we do all of those
steps are your image is actually going
to show up otherwise you you're not
going to see anything you're going to
see that white page we saw previously so
what we have now is enough the has the
background image is has some nice CSS we
have managed to position it where we
wanted to on the page and when you click
the button it says hello in different
European languages so thank you for
listening and any questions you can find
me on engineering the Twitter this is
also the same handle I use on github
medium
there is a blog post about how you can
do this step by step and all the code is
also on github so you can either follow
the blog post and do this step by step
or you can go to github and just get all
the code immediately besides are also
been uploaded on the european website of
course thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
