probably heard I'm an expert in Bitcoin
I want to talk about something else
completely trust the Dunbar number is
defined as the maximum number of people
who can be in a community and we see
this in nature again and again even
among other social animals like
chimpanzees or wolves or bonobo monkeys
about a hundred and fifty members of a
community can relate to each other just
simply based on ties of family and
acquaintances you probably know
intimately about a hundred and fifty
people your brain is designed to have
that limit how do we exceed that limit
exceeding that limit essentially is the
definition of civilization for thousands
of years human beings have found ways to
gradually increase the number of people
they can relate to and organize creating
ties between neighboring communities and
to do that first we had to invent
language but language was not enough so
we invented religion and religion was
not enough so we invented money and
gradually we kept making the
organizations we could build bigger and
as these organizations got bigger we
started building monuments to these
achievements the pyramids in Egypt are a
demonstration we can collaborate and
organize tens of thousands of people
over decades to build monuments that
last and our civilization has continued
to grow and build on this promise the
Industrial Revolution created new models
for us to organize new models for us to
collaborate and the primary model of the
industrialized
revolution is the bureaucratic hierarchy
the organization the institution the
corporation a pyramid scheme a system
that looks like the Egyptian pyramids
where actions are taken at the bottom
decisions are made at the top and
information must flow up and be
concentrated but there's a problem with
the scheme and the problem is that power
also flows up and is concentrated and at
some point once you make the
organization big enough the person
making the decisions or the people
making the decision have too much power
and not enough information they are far
away from the place where decisions are
being acted on and they cannot see the
consequences of those decisions and
power corrupts the more you have the
more it corrupts and now the
organizations that through the
scientific methods and the Industrial
Revolution brought us to this
globalization to the Internet to all of
the amazing things we've built as a
civilization the fundamental units that
helped us decide that helped us
collaborate that helped us organize our
failing to scale we cannot make
decisions on a global scale about simple
things or about important things we
cannot solve the problems that we have
enough money to solve like poverty or
climate change
and the reason we can't is because our
fundamental organizational unit is
failing to scale to the demands of a
global planet how do we fix this On
January 3rd 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto
invented Bitcoin and most people think
that this invention was about money but
it wasn't it was fundamentally about
trust you see the Internet has given us
this
fantastic opportunity to be able to
scale communication to a global level we
can now communicate effectively at
numbers of billions of people all around
the world without barriers Without
Borders blinds to ass Nissa t
nationality race religion age ability or
any of the other things that confuse our
communication and yet many important
things on the internet are centralized
they still have the fundamental
construct of a bureaucratic hierarchy
corporations that require
decision-making at the top of unelected
leaders who decide on the social
structures and rules of our most
important applications and functions and
yet they are far distant from the users
they serve organizations like Facebook
and Google but so many others too
the Internet has scaled communication
but it cannot scale decision making and
the reason for that is trust we do not
have a platform to scale trust we do not
have a platform that allows us to create
trusted decision-making without
hierarchy until January 3rd 2009 because
once you understands what blockchain
technology does you understand that this
is not about currency currency is just
the most obvious application once you
can build a completely flat non
hierarchical peer-to-peer network that
allows you for the very first time to
take trust and move it from being a
system of institutions bureaucracies and
hierarchies into becoming a protocol a
flat network that allows you to engage
in trusted interactions with others
without an intermediary without a
corporation without a hierarchy and we
can make this technology scale so we can
now
have trusted decisions governance social
decision-making on a massive scale
without giving power to the few without
creating these hierarchical
organizations that have managed to get
us this far but cannot get us any
further this model of trusts is
gradually seeping into the consciousness
of the world people are beginning to
realize that we can do a lot more than
just currency with this technology we
can build voting systems we can
reimagine the corporation itself create
ad hoc associations between people who
come together to create new projects and
applications without leaders in this
system of trust there are rules and
these rules are very easy to determine
and very predictable in their outcomes
but there are no rulers and we have
never before in history had a system of
rules without rulers and what happens
when this technology is unleashed on the
world the world's governments rise up
and say thank you this is the solution
we've been looking for
we no longer needs to make hierarchical
decisions finally we can scale no they
say this will only be used by criminals
pornographers ransomware it subverts the
state we cannot allow it
we must regulate against it who gave you
permission to do this you didn't ask the
regulator you didn't ask the Parliament
to start organizing on a massive global
scale we did not ask for permission and
yet here it is it is happening on a
massive scale and it is growing
exponentially and it will shake the
world to its foundations because it is a
system of social organization that
delivers equality as a feature and works
at massive scale almost every important
innovation in history starts off being
illegal or unregulated all of the
interesting things that happened in
technology were started by people who
forgot to ask for permission because the
regulations themselves the laws
themselves are written by hierarchical
institutions to serve the incumbent
corporations that need those laws to
protect themselves from competition the
model that we are disrupting is not
finance it is hierarchy and the rules
were written by hierarchy and of course
these systems break those rules well
guess what skype was illegal and they
did it anyway uber was illegal and they
did it anyway
Airbnb was illegal and they did it
anyway and everything interesting in the
world starts off being illegal
self-driving cars started rolling in
California without permission and they
were illegal and they did it anyway
you are startup founders when you decide
how to build your next application be
bold be brave break a few rules don't do
criminal things think of morality first
and rules seconds break the mold don't
ask for permission innovate faster than
they can write the rules creates the
next world the one you want your
children to live in one that is free
from hierarchy one that allows us to
collaborate across the world peer to
peer which means person to person we
can't change the world but in order to
that to do that we must not ask for
permission we must be bold
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
