for piping ystos and the root of this
talk I'm not gonna try to douse you with
all of the things that kubernetes can do
but I want to educate you a little bit
on what containers are and while they're
important to people especially in Python
many of these languages have very
complex dependency systems and they
could be a barrier to entry especially
if you're building or distributing
software so we're going to go through
this and think about this from a very
beginning of how you would think about
containers helping you okay now her this
was a technical conference so this is my
last slide if that's okay let me know I
can find lots of cat pictures on the
internet so we're gonna be in this mode
for a while
okay so when I first started learning
programming that was about 24 years old
and I had that book and I wrote my first
hello world program kind of like this
one and Python is like magic you write a
few lines and you really believe you're
a real developer I started applying for
jobs immediately after this was done
senior developer Python five minutes of
experience and you look at this code and
you're like wow this is this is pretty
awesome so I'm gonna run it you always
automatically should know what this does
so we'll say Python and then we'll say
our app py okay this is sweet and then
you go to your browser and this is where
this is where your life changes for the
first time if you're new when you see
this this is when you run around your
house and your spouse is like what are
you doing that is not impressive like
this hello world why I could do that on
a piece of paper but it's important okay
now
I got brave my first UNIX machine
FreeBSD house right free s BSD people
are serious they have like tattoos of
the mascot I'm like you know that's not
ever coming off right so we got this
hello world thing going so it's like you
know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna run it
on my server should be easy I got this
one file just @py
so you copy it to the server and it's
tiny and then you go to type Python and
nothing's there and then you become a
cyst that men in FreeBSD you do not
install Python the easy way you have to
heat your whole house from the server
you compile from scratch this is what
you do so after about six months I got
Python
on my machine and the app didn't run and
then I needed pip
two years later my app was running it
wasn't that bad but this is what we're
asking people to do when we write code
we're asking them to go and figure out
what version of Python they have what
version of the dependencies they have
got forbid if you're using some C
extension and trying to use that on a
Chromebook it's very funny seeing that
in airport your computer's gonna write a
battery in about thirty seconds so we
have all these dependencies and
packaging has come a long way in Python
right so we have this ability now to say
hey here's here's what my app requires I
can just do pip install and I just did a
little tweet I'm gonna show you guys
what it look like so I'm on I'm on my
Mac and I'm writing this test app for
the demo and I do sudo pip install - you
you guys are already like what the hell
are you doing so I'm like yeah I mean
what could go wrong I have Python
pre-built on my machine they're like
dude the first rule of Python is you
don't use system Python I'm like hold my
keyboard enter you type in your password
right and then it's like you're you're
enter your info SEC team is like what
the hell are you doing nothing works
anymore but I have flasks and everything
I need on my machine so we're winning
like I have to do this so we have our
app now and we start to ask ourselves
that there has to be a better way of
doing this so when I used to contribute
to Python I told you we we had dis utils
and I used to be a war setup tools dis
utils and then we made peace and the
whole goal was not to reinvent the wheel
listen prove what we have so last night
I was like what is the state of the art
in Python and it turns out we literally
reinvented the wheel
I thought this is a joke I was like no
no no it's not actually called wheels
they're like no this is what you do
that's like okay wheels it is so the
truth is packaging is a pain point for
all languages it's a pain point for all
software things that work well are like
your mobile device you go to an app
store you bring the whole package down
and the reason why we can have a billion
devices is because we do not ask users
to go and install other software to use
the software that they're interested in
as simple as that but we do the opposite
when it comes to servers we were making
everyone's life difficult
anyone have ever heard of DevOps anyone
know what DevOps is I took a stab at it
DevOps is group therapy for systems and
we needed it largely because of
packaging it's not just PI thon all
those packages need to be maintained
they need to be updated you write a
Python app say hey install this and all
the system managed just sleep so how do
we make this better
and this is where I think containers
become interesting how many people think
static linking is a good idea how many
people like containers it's amazing to
me that so few people think static
linking is a good idea but they like
containers this is static linking on
steroids
it's a big turbo with everything a full
operating system is in there you're
linking everything I saw one container
it had like a Chrome browser in it okay
what are you doing so what we want to do
is how can we leverage these containers
in a very smart way so just so
everyone's on the same page a container
there's two parts to this
the packaging format the goal is we
package all of our dependencies into a
tarball
it is actually a tarball and it's a
tarball with a specific format so we
know how to download it extract it and
be very efficient with layers so we're
going to do is build one of these things
now i've cache most of this because
these days no matter what app you build
for some reason it downloads like 2/3 of
the internet in order to work but i'll
show you what one of these looks like so
we have our application so we're going
to do is start with this docker file so
the docker file here is you'll see the
first line there it says from ubuntu yes
that is an entire operating system to
put our 2k application into now there's
a reason for this
how many people here would say they
honestly know all their software
dependencies exactly so when you don't
know you just bring in everything until
it works and then we get DevOps so the
next thing that you hear is there's a
couple of things happening though we
take all the tribal knowledge from
wiki's and run books and we put them in
the docker file now this is not the best
we can do but it is a good stepping
stone for the majority of the people
building software and we can do clever
things like cache some of the layers so
even though that first layer is pretty
big it's actually only about 70 so Meg's
we can cache that on the servers so we
only have to copy it once for our apps
ok so the next thing we're going to do
here is going to do apt-get install
python 3
everyone is using python 3 by now please
tell me it happened
all right just clap in case it just
pretends and then we copy our
requirements that txt into place now the
goal with this whole thing is that now
everyone has a very sane and clean build
environment and they can build our
application you can either give people
too raw docker file and they can build
it themselves or you can build it and
store the artifact right so if you've
ever built any package of any kind the
goal here is to build and
artifact and we'll store it somewhere
now once we have the artifact we can
give someone the image name and they can
run it so we'll just build this here so
we can see what we're talking about now
my Python is rusty so if you see any bad
code today please give me a pass do not
put it on Twitter I promise to follow up
f/8 later okay so we have this entry
point so this is basically going to do
the same thing I was doing on my command
line and we're just going to set that in
an entry point all right so we're going
to make a tarball now this is a very
fancy way of doing it so we'll just do
this docker build command so here what
I'm doing is saying hey I want to build
this image and I want to run that
command but what I want to do is have
all of the requirements be pulled down
and run inside of a true root
environment so that I have a clean bill
that's reproducible so we'll run this
now okay so the lucky thing is here is
that I'm having a bit of caching so I
didn't change any of the lines at the
top now you could run into issues with
some of this caching but the nice thing
is when you're building and writing
applications you want to iterate fast
you do not need to run the whole entire
app get command or the PIP command again
those live as separate layers so once
you have that we can just copy in our
application and then we can run it how
many people think is really easy to run
multiple copies of an app on your
machine not a lot of hands I mean if you
are using a virtual ant to solve this
problem okay so if you're familiar with
virtual ants to give us multiple Python
environments you can look at this
runtime so this is the other part of the
equation once we have this tar ball we
can run it under a runtime so let's do
this really quick so we'll say docker
run alright so what we're going to do
here is we're just going to run our app
to make it a little bit easier so we'll
just run out five thousand to five
thousand so just doing a bit of port
mapping so I can get to it we're gonna
run this hello world that is gonna run
in the background so at this point I
should be able to hit it in my browser
and there it is now I can run as many
copies of this as I want
maybe map to different ports but this
only solves the laptop problem
we have this thing packaged it's easy to
distribute it's easy to run as many
copies as I want but what happens if I
have five or twenty servers that I need
to push this to how many people are
familiar with scheduling every hand
should be up every device that you have
has probably more than one CPU core and
when you launch an application there's a
kernel that has to figure out where this
thing runs so you have a really
effective scheduler there what most
people are doing these days and lingyu
of a scheduler we call it like the meat
cloud ok this is where you say hey run
this application and a human decides
where it runs and sometimes we track in
a very fancy database aka spreadsheet
and the problem with this is if one of
the machines dies they have this thing
called on-call okay machine goes down
you get a call and you get to put the
app back on the machine so what we want
to do is like solve this problem in the
way that transfer you know goes a little
bit further than our laptop so we have a
tool called kubernetes
other tools that do very similar things
but we're going to work with this for
now so I have about five nodes in my
cluster now the goal with this is that I
do not want to statically assign my apps
and machines they're designed to go away
I want to treat each machine as one
collective or like a multi CPU system
and treat the whole cluster like a
single machine so we need a new API we
need some abstractions so once I have
this abstraction we can we can package
our container and what we call a
deployment so let's look at this really
quick so we have this deployment object
so here is the container we've built and
we have it hosted somewhere so anyone
that wants to run this app can pull this
particular container image now some of
you are like well how does the system
know where to put this since a lot of
people didn't raise their hands about
what a scheduler is I'm going to explain
it now the fastest way I've done this
without diving too deep into computer
science and hijacking my whole talk we
play a game of Tetris so how many people
here so they have fully automated
deployments
okay now this is a worthy goal to get to
you click a button and your app installs
it's a specific machines I'm going to
show you what that looks like you do
that in Tetris I'll show you it looks
like it's amazing by the way if you can
get to this point so the goal is we want
one-click deployment of all of our apps
now you need to know a whole bunch of
information ahead of time in order for
this to work you need to know all error
scenarios you need to know if a machine
is and maintenance or not and you need
to make sure there's no network issues
because you need to be able to route
around them all in bash Python if you're
lucky so we're gonna do is this is one
click deploy this is the dev ops holy
girl I'm about to show you be ready you
ready
one-click deployment BAM well click and
then you leave
it's fully automated by the way but the
problem here is your memory is C for you
it's just on the floor and you're losing
now we're gonna cloud provider this is
pretty good actually spin up more VMs so
what does the scheduler do so here's the
difference
the scheduler has to actually examine
every workload as it comes in now this
is the like x86 architecture you're not
doing anything that fancy but things are
slightly different so they have
different shapes and sizes the goal is
we look at these workloads as they come
in and then we make a decision so what
qu Bernays does out-of-the-box is what
we call been packing so let's look at
what that looks like so here we see a
workload and the goal is just to place
it by examining it now we look at these
workloads as they come in and what we're
doing now is just scheduling in a way
that we try to utilize all of our
resources so this is memory and CPU I'm
looking at all of these workloads coming
in now happy you're like wow this dude
is really good at Tetris if you can
totally talk and play Tetris at the same
time ok but this is still been packing
that's happening here now you asked why
is the scheduler doing this well when we
examine all the pieces here what we want
to do is make sure that we allocate
things in a way that imagine a machine
learning job comes that needs that CPU
and you've been reserving that special
machine because it cost a lot more than
run things on it and when the right
workload shows up you can place it there
and then when it's done you get back all
the CPU and memory
he got a Tetris on Twitter so that's
kind of the difference between just
automation and this idea of
orchestration
we want to have this online examination
of every workload so we can actually use
our machines effectively and the goal
here is that we want to be able to reuse
CPU and memory the best way we can so
it's part orchestration so how do we do
that for our own applications so for our
own apps we have to make this the
deployment descriptor now it's a big mo
Fallon's declarative but what you'll see
here is that we have our app name is
called hello world and then we're saying
kubernetes when you run this thing I
want you to go grab this particular
image and when you grab that image I
want you to extract it and run whatever
the entry point was Python @py
and then I want you to also shape this
workload now the thing you got to think
about in order for us to schedule these
things properly we need to know the
shape of the piece this is why we have
our memory and our CPU requests so we
know where it fits in the cluster okay
so once we have this we can actually
give it to kubernetes so coups ETL get
pods so what we'll do is we'll create
this deployment object now can anyone
tell me what machine that it landed on
there's a brave guy like ah number four
like no the scheduler is going to figure
out at runtime the only thing we are
asking is that we declare that we want
one of these things running so I say qu
CTO get pods we'll see that it's running
somewhere now the nice thing about this
let's look at what machine it's on so
it's on n f6p
and it has its own IP address dot 90 but
what happens we were to destroy it all
right we're going to destroy the work
load
now depending on where you work you
either fired or you're going to get a
call so we delete the workload and this
is what we expect we expect it to be
replaced quickly and it has a new IP and
a nice thing about a system like this is
when we replace the workload we keep
track of it we know its IP address so we
can hook it up to the load balancer
automatically now if you've been doing
this kind of work this is just from
decades of people doing these patterns
and now we've just baked it into the
infrastructure itself it's kind of like
the Python standard library it's massive
because there's no reason for people to
rewrite these things over and over again
so these are things with pretty standard
issue if I look here Gipp SVC will see
that we have a low balancer that's
routing traffic to all of those so no
matter what I do
I have this table endpoint or I can hit
my application and there we go
it's up and running then it gets really
complex just like you can't run
production Python by just using flask
anyone know why one requests at a time I
spent the hour figuring that out like
why is my show hanging one request at a
time so what do we do so in the Python
world it's common to pair it with maybe
some whisky server or nginx
so what does that look like in
kubernetes now I'm about to show you a
lot more on the screen so be prepared so
in the container world one would say you
build the even bigger docker file and
you install nginx in there you put your
whiskey in there and then you take a
script to launch all of that in the
background great you just invented an
init system there's no reason to do that
what's a better approach well we don't
want to pack engine X inside of our apps
container we want those to be separate
so what does that look like if you
separate them so here's another
deployment object and this time we'll do
things and this is a lot here I'm going
to walk us through it really quick so we
all can understand
this has multiple containers in them
that we can stack think of it like a
virtual machine they're just going to
run as processes that are co-located
together to form the logical app so at
the top we have nginx we're using nginx
graceful shutdown and then what we also
learnt Elling engine next to do you'll
notice here in this particular line here
we're going to share this particular
path and what's going to be there is
going to be our whiskey UNIX socket that
is exported from our app so we could
actually send traffic to it in the way
proposed by their particular Doc's so
here we are sharing a filesystem one
container is going to write its socket
there and another container is going to
pick it up and send traffic to it but
the nice thing about this is everyone
knows how your infrastructure is
composed and your next stands alone and
the app stands alone so at this point we
can actually have kubernetes manage this
for us as well Coop's ETL crate - F
deployments all right so once this is
online get pods great and you'll see
that there's two of two ready so we can
actually compose these things if you
need any helpers you can run your helper
scripts as well now once you have
infrastructure like this you start to
think about why do I need to use
conventional ways of interacting with it
I've been using command-line tools this
whole time so in the Python world one
thing that has been amazing over time in
Python Python has been used as a facade
for more complex systems like tensorflow
most big data stacks Python makes it
super easy to interact with things so if
I were building new tools how would I
interact with this now I think if more
Python people showed up to the Kerberos
community they would also look to
simplify things so I found a really good
Python library so I wrote a new
interface to Python and this is the
first time I'm going to show it to
anybody okay
so if it doesn't work remember wrote
this yesterday so bear with me okay
so what we're going to do is going to
clean up here a little bit get pods
Coop's ETL we're gonna delete these
deployments so it's really easy to spin
these things up and down
let's clear them out and keep in mind
the frame of reference I'm coming from
I've been watching a Star Trek The Next
Generation for some reason on Netflix so
I really believe I'm living in the
future right now so when I went to go
build this thing I wanted something that
felt like that okay so let's just do a
watch on here I'm gonna show you my new
tool as you can tell them a bit shy here
so please don't laugh at me if this
doesn't work all right so this should
terminate let's clean things up man do
you know what it's doing just trying to
gracefully shutdown all right we're down
okay so we're gonna try this thing so an
app I'm using was shipped on Wednesday
so this is just devil not smart on
conference Wi-Fi okay google talk to
kubernetes well we need we may have to
go to airplane mode because I might need
the bandwidth okay okay Google you
better work as people are watching
I spent all night on this too so talk to
kubernetes no hold on we're not gonna
abandon ship on this I will be up here
for six hours if I have to you just
ignore the whole speaker timer okay
google talk to kubernetes what is
sitting here let's do this let's do this
maybe maybe we have to hit the test
button
maybe we need that but you guys like
when the live demo doesn't go well
you're like I don't understand
talk to kubernetes this is the top
result talk to kubernetes here's the top
search result
it's trolling me okay google talk to
kubernetes sure here is the test version
of kubernetes cluster hello Kelsey hi
looks like you have a large crowd this
time I hope the demo gods are on your
side
what's my cluster status the PyCon
cluster is running with ten CPUs and
37.5 gigs of ram run the hello world
application
what image tag would you like to deploy
1.0 deploying hello world 1.0 into the
python cluster so we got an app running
scale the helloworld deployment
how many replicas would you like 500
divided by like 10 - 40 - 5 5 5 scaling
the helloworld deployment - 5
now here's the thing it's easy to do
deployments how many people have ever
done zero downtime deployment you liars
you still got on call I know it's a
tough thing to do
so the Holy Grail is to do these
downtime zero downtown deployments so we
have one dado running right now inside
of our cluster and the goal is we want
to upgrade this so this is the nice
thing about this fully API driven world
from the networking to the stores to the
app itself also around auto scaling so
what we want to do here is see if we
could update this in place without
dropping any of the packets here okay
update the hello world deployment what
version of the application would you
like to deploy 2.0 updating the hello
world deployment to version 2.0
thank you okay I gotta admit that was
pretty dope and with that I would like
to end the presentation thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
