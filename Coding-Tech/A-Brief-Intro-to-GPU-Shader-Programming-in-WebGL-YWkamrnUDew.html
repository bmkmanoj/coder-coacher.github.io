because with WebGL we have the full
power of our GPUs available to us this
is something I made yesterday using
OpenGL OpenGL you know you think about
GPU program you think about gaming you
know we have WebGL gaming that's that's
very very possible GPUs are really
really great at parallel computation
which makes them very suitable for
cryptocurrency mining but beyond that
our users are increasingly demanding
great visual experiences and this is
stuff that we can make possible with
with with our GPUs but programming with
your GPU does require a different
mindset I think as a JavaScript
developer myself I'm used to thinking
about the Dom the Dom is a tree
structure it has a root has children the
most important thing about the Dom for
me is that every node has knowledge of
other nodes you can access the parent
you can access children you can access
siblings this is made possible by all of
this work being done on the CPU
typically in a single thread and you
know this is happening in a
deterministic way when we think about
JavaScript development but you know our
screens are not a tree structure they're
a grid they're a 2d array this laptop
here is 2560 by 1600 that's 4 million
pixels running smoothly at 60 frames per
second that's 240 million calculations a
second if we were trying to do this in
JavaScript we'd have some nested loop
structure or something we'd run it all
the time our computers would burn down
it would be horrible so this is what GPU
programming is really really great for
instead of running it on the CPU you
drive this work out onto the GPU using a
shader language but what is shader code
this is shader code right here shader
code these are small programs that are
executed on the GPU each shader they'll
operate on a single vertex in the 3d
stage or a single pixel in the 2d stage
and this is made possible by the fact
that GPUs comprised of thousands of
lopat thousands of low powered cores
that can do floating-point operations in
parallel really quickly as opposed to
CPUs which have less cores but can do
more complex calculations WebGL is a
JavaScript API and it's a major
responsibility of it is to
the state required to run shader code on
the GPU so we can take a look you know
at a basic hello world of of GPU
programming
this is a typical shader function it
takes in the X Y coordinates of the
pixel you're operating on in this case
I'm setting the red value equivalent to
X so we go from black to red on the
x-axis I'm setting the green value equal
to Y so we go from zero to green on the
y-axis and blue is currently set to zero
but I can animate it by using the
absolute value of a sine wave which will
animate it smoothly there at every pixel
but you know we can even get more fancy
uhm we could take everyone's favorite
badass jean-claude van damme and you
know you'll notice he's surrounded by a
green screen let's say we want to get
rid of the green we could check every
pixel for the red content and the green
content and just set it to black which
is a vector for of zero you can see that
happening there it got rid a lot of the
green still not fancy you know if we can
take that that color pattern we had
before set every pixel equivalent to
that and that's how we do it and now
each one Claude is a lot prettier so
going back to you know WebGL in general
you know there are a lot of yeah yes you
got it good so there are a lot of
challenges with with web with GPU
programming in general in the first one
remember I talked about the Dom each
pixel has zero knowledge of other pixels
you can't do a thing where it's like if
this pixel is green set it to red that
it just doesn't work that way
debugging is super duper challenging um
the reason is that the GPU doesn't want
to talk back to the CPU for performance
reasons and so figuring out what's going
wrong can be can be a challenge testing
we don't have great unit testing suites
tools like we do for JavaScript so again
testing can be really challenging but go
forth and code on your GPU it's
available to you now and check out this
resource here a book of shaders it's
online these are other great resources
for you as well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
