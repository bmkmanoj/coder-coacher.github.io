hit this and this price I don't care
about the price I think the price is the
least important part about Bitcoin you
can call them bubbles you could call
them you know irrational exuberance like
other people call it and so you could
compare the time that we're in right now
to the late 90s will my children will
they think that in order for their money
to be secure in order for them to trade
in exchange and have savings accounts
there is even the need and existence of
a bank the cryptocurrency jumped on the
news reaching an all-time high of voices
back sure this is the biggest thing to
happen in mankind it doesn't mean the
world has been absolutely captivated by
the drama of bitcoins meteoric rise and
subsequent collapse in December the
price of a single Bitcoin reached nearly
20,000 US dollars by early February 2018
that price had dropped to below 6,000
dollars prompting the economists Nouriel
Roubini to tweet the mother of all
bubbles and biggest bubble in human
history comes down crashing a few days
later Rubini tweeted again this time
more ominously predicting that bitcoins
price would continue to drop until it
hit zero in the same week the digital
currency was dealt another serious blow
when the general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements
liken the mania around Bitcoin to a
combination of a bubbly a Ponzi scheme
and an environmental disaster even
before it lost nearly two-thirds of its
peak value Nobel prize-winning economist
Robert Shiller may not have gone as far
as sounding the death knell for the
cryptocurrency that he did express a
fair share of skepticism I tend to think
of Bitcoin as an experiment it's an
interesting experiment it's not a
permanent feature of our lives
what Shiller did do however was point to
bitcoins underlying tech lock tone as
the deserved focus of our attention
we're over emphasizing Bitcoin we should
broaden it out to the blockchain which
will have other applications
if doom says there
correct and the preeminent
cryptocurrency is on the brink of
collapse what if anything will be its
legacy what becomes of say blockchain
but before we get ahead of ourselves
what is blockchain blodger is a database
the centralized database it's immutable
which means the information in
blockchain is permanent it's a database
of all of us it's a way to build a
system of record with nobody acting as
God in the center of that system so we
can build cooperative networks and
cooperative applications on top one of
those things we can build is a
cryptocurrency there isn't a beacon Inc
CEO there isn't a beacon headquarters
somewhere there is no one controlling as
a company as a centralized institution
for Bitcoin but it's completely
decentralized we've gotten really good
in Silicon Valley and the internet
community at building databases and web
servers and things that allowed us to
build big central services think uber
right think PayPal but we didn't really
make it easy to build decentralized
systems and so blockchain technology and
the decentralized web which is what
we're getting it really are a way to get
there I mean I think the blockchain is
gonna do really interesting things
around the transfer of value but this
idea that it's like a decentralized
system that's gonna completely bypass
the banks I just like I don't understand
why that - coming from because the banks
are the first to use the technology just
to make the transfer of value more
efficient whereas a lot of the
discussions in the cryptocurrency
community and focus on how do we avoid
the banking system how do we create an
alternative to it banks themselves are
realizing that this underlying
blockchain technology they can use this
underlying technology to automate a lot
of systems that today requires a back
office staff that requires regulation
and and regulators watching what they're
doing these are systems that help
prevent a lot of fraud from happening in
the first place right prevent somebody
from selling the same object twice
they're spending the same dollar twice
and and in doing that can help make
trustworthy systems and auditable
systems much
less-expensive for for many of these
banks so they can do a lot of what they
do today just faster and cheaper and
with greater guarantees that the parties
that they're working with will make good
on their commitments I think the
question is less about the pipes and the
mechanisms but whether the notion of
money and currencies is fundamentally
changing so will my children will they
think that in order for their money to
be secured in order for them to trade in
exchange and have savings accounts there
is even the need and existence of a bank
that I think is the more interesting
question versus whether the blockchain
is gonna you know get rid of the banks I
think the blockchain then becomes the
technology in the tool that enables that
sort of transformation in the
relationship into value while few banks
are likely to endorse the exchange of
digital currencies many are waking up to
the possibilities of blockchain and it
bears repeating that this technology was
first designed to support an alternative
store of value which principally as a
system removed the need for third
parties like banks if you see it erosion
of trust same financial institutions or
banks how does that create some kind of
vacuum that then gives the space for
alternatives to rise up where people
become more receptive to placing taking
a risk in something new placing their
faith in something new and there I think
there is very much a direct correlation
that you there was this trust vacuum and
these cryptocurrencies rose up and
people were more open to an alternative
financial system I think whether we're
talking about cryptocurrencies or we're
talking about the underlying technology
of blockchain technology it really is
about trust
I could give you any example where you
could deploy a blockchain and you would
say but couldn't you do that with a
centralized system would it be faster
would it wouldn't it be cheaper and the
answer is always yes it'll always be
faster and cheaper to do something
centralized but we don't do that because
we don't want to have to trust that
entity at the center right Bitcoin would
work tremendously
if there was just a Bitcoin bank and all
of us had accounts in and out but the
whole point of doing a cryptocurrency
like that is to decentralize that so
this is a protocol for re-establishing
trust in digital systems read a moment
where people are losing trust trust in
institutions trust in government trust
in in in whole professions like banking
and lawyers and and and such and we need
our technologies to help give us a bit
of that back give us what we had when we
knew the people that we did business
with face to face for a very long period
of history we have largely been
dependent on institutional trust trust
flows upwards to experts and regulators
and CEOs and political leaders and the
trust really flows through institutions
and what we're starting to see now is of
course that trust in the Institute of
not saying institutions aren't important
but the trust is starting to flow
sideways to strangers and peers and to
colleagues and even to anonymous bots
and what worries me about that is then
we become in this very dangerous cycle
of who is responsible and where does
accountability lie so a lot can go wrong
because often individuals don't realize
the responsibility they're taking on in
this age of distributed trust where does
that leave us
are we in the early days of the internet
left to one day wonder how we ever lived
without these technologies or will the
hype around blockchain proved to be a
bubble in and of itself you know amongst
the evangelicals you hear her
cryptocurrency is going to change
everything in the world and then you
hear from skeptics you know they think
it's gonna change nothing all of this
just a bubble
I think the truth must be in the middle
somewhere in some ways it feels like
1995 in the early days of the internet
where the first bits and pieces were
coming together where the first websites
were launching people were realizing
while we could conduct commerce online
we can build communities online and lots
of excitement lots of experiments being
conducted but still some key
architectural pieces that were still in
the very early days and needed to be
solidified such as the security of the
connection between a website and your
browser so that you could send a credit
card number and know that it wasn't
going to be listened to by everybody in
between right and so we're somewhat
early days although there are production
deployments now of lots of blockchain
technology whose real companies you know
and realizing value from from the
application of this technology but still
early in terms of the markets
understanding of it and and in terms of
how companies are comprehending there's
a lot of excitement and I think we're in
a time where these kinds of cycles get
so compressed compared to 20 years ago
that this kind of this this duality is
pretty understandable it needs a whole
new kind of social safety net so I think
this is you know people worried about
the future of work I worry about
independent contractors on platforms so
if you don't have the institution as the
default and you don't have mechanisms
like health insurance and disability
leave and parental leave whatever it is
what is that new social safety net
underneath the distributed network but
the real issue like whatever the
manifestation is the real issue is an
issue of accountability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
