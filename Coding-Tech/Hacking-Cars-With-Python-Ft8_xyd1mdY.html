hiking carts with Python my background I
do a lot of work on embedded systems and
the past lot of stuff in the automotive
industry and in automotive security
asked me more later if you're curious
about that stuff but the main theme here
is cars or computers they're just
computers where the input devices are
like pedals and steering wheels and the
output devices are like you know torque
going to your wheels and propelling you
forward why did we make cars into
computers this might not seem like a
great idea for a number of reasons but
there's a safety component here so we
now have airbags we have a BS these
actually make people safer they reduce
the likelihood of collisions as well as
the damage to people whenever they
actually crash we have advanced features
so things that the industry calls a TAS
or advanced driver assistance systems
which is like the Tesla autopilot kind
of thing the active radar following cars
so that also you know reduces accidents
and makes things safer and except for
when people use them wrong but we won't
get into that
we have emissions and this is in bold
because this is like the real reason
that everyone started using electronic
control units and vehicles they had to
meet these emissions targets and to do
that they had to make engines more
complex to do that they wrote software
for them but cars are also networks
because they have a lot of controllers
in them nowadays this is a incredibly
simplified vehicle network but this is
some controllers that probably are in
any car that you'd be in nowadays modern
vehicle can have up to a hundred
different controllers and they're all
talking to each other and that internal
network is totally trusted so you send a
message on it and everyone's like yeah
cool you must be the engine because you
sent the engine message gotcha
which is super fun now here's some
sample controllers who have suspension
the instrument panel so your dials in
front of you your engine controller
which is at the back of this cart it's a
sports car I guess HVAC seat positions
on some vehicles every door handle has a
controller in it like a 16-bit
microcontroller and these are all
connected using a can bus what is that
controller area network it's a low-cost
system for or network for connecting
these controllers Ethernet you need a
lot of hardware you need you know extra
stuff can it's right on the micro can
roller you toss a really cheap
transceiver I see there you use two
cheap pieces of wire twisted together
and boom you have a data connection and
the automotive industry loves cheap
things so this is one of the big reasons
they used it it's also fast it's
reliable does like CRC's for you and
lots other nice stuff
so a typical network you see in the
vehicle has these tiers you'll have like
a high speed bus and a low speed bus and
they'll communicate through different
controllers there's a few different
kinds of can but yeah they're all
similar I get asked this a lot should i
hack my car and like with some caveats
yes why you understand more about how
cars work you rely on this every day to
like get you places and not kill you so
it's kind of nice to understand if
you're kind of the hacker mindset that's
Google thing to look into
you can do it Diagnostics which saves
you money which is a pretty good
incentive in my opinion and good example
here you read out some fault codes you
find out that some parts broken you go
replace that part you saved yourself
like the 80 dollars to get the
dealership to scan it plus the upsell on
that part plus the labor to change it so
if you know what you're doing it's
actually not that hard you can build
your own third-party devices that let
you interface with the vehicle and like
log data maybe or you know show you GPS
some different device whatever it is
I've seen some people do some pretty
cool stuff and you get into this
automotive security world that's
starting to emerge as we see more
connected vehicles and start to care
more about that you can also wet your
ride if you so care to how do you do
this well the low cost option are these
suckers the elm327 dongles you can buy
them on Amazon for like $10 right now
they come in Bluetooth or USB they're
totally insecure and sometimes they're
really sketchy you can get them from
eBay for like 2 bucks don't buy those
ones but what this will do is it'll let
you do the very simple obd standard
Diagnostics which is enough to start to
like get data out of your car and
actually read and clear fault codes and
you know bluetooth you can like hook up
your laptop no wires and have a good
time warning the pin code for all of
them is zero zero zero zero or one two
three four and if you see an obd2 device
on your phone you probably can connect
to it with one of those two pins so what
else well I ended up building a device
called cam tack this is very simply a
can
two USB interface because my macbook pro
well the next one won't even have like
any ports but this one doesn't have
canvas on it
so I needed this tool so now we're gonna
do it with Python basically I have this
private project it's a Python vehicle
interface toolkit abstract the way your
hardware interfaces so you can buy
different tools and work with them it
deals with async stuff for you and it
implements some protocols yeah car plus
Python equals whoo so today it supports
the can't act tool it supports anything
that does socket can on Linux which I
can't get into right now but ask me
later and it does you know standard can
obd stuff iso TP and iso 14 to 29 kinda
which is the more proprietary
diagnostics that auto makers use to like
flash the firmware on your engine and
it's got some utilities for doing async
stuff and logging if you want to do a
denial of service attack on a car it's
really easy it fits on a slide basically
you send a frame with ID 0 really really
fast and that is the most priority frame
the car freaks out and all the fault
codes go on yeah that works
don't try it because you'll set a lot of
fault codes fortunately you can clear
them by sending a special frame and it
won't cost you a lot of money to turn
the light off which is nice this is a
simple example there are fancier
Diagnostics but that will actually work
on any can enabled vehicle next step i
want to support the cheapo obd dongles
because they're cheap and more devices
as we need to more support for iso 14 to
29 j1939 can't open whatever other
products or protocols are being used
today it's that we're seeing more
ethernet stuff come up in automotive so
hopefully that soon better tooling for
ipython cuz it's really nice to just tab
complete your diagnostic requests and
then like have them all pop up and
graphical user interfaces and like
better docs and snippets as every
project needs that was my whirlwind tour
through this because we had some issues
but i'll be around today and tomorrow if
you want to talk about cars and
otherwise you can find me there you can
find all the code at github link layer
and open garages comm is really cool so
go check them at they do open source car
