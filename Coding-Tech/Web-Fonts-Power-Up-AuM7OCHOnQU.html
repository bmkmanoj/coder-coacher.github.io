firstly some basics about web fonts
secondly OpenType features and CSS
thirdly color fonts and lastly variable
fonts you've already heard mentioned a
variable fonts if you don't know what
they are you will both have undone so I
mean everyone so everyone who uses web
fonts right on your projects you already
use them already yes yes okay good good
do you use them to their full extent to
use everything that they can do do you
use all the features you could use in
print on the web probably not I'm going
to show you how you can do that so let's
start with some basics why is that
backwards by the way does anyone know
why that Helvetica is backwards because
yeah yes that's right that's right
that's what you put the ink on and it
comes out the right way so what is a
character people know what characters
are do you know the character is it's a
number it has some properties like is
this an uppercase letter is this a
numeral but it's basically a number
whereas the thing that you actually look
at is called a glyph and that is the
visual representation people often mix
these up characters and glyphs fonts are
collections of glyphs so good now this
is the real basics a test now there will
be questions so what is that and what
are we looking at is that a character or
a glyph yes how many characters is it
too good how many glyphs one excellent
what about here how many characters any
other answers good both questions are
correct
yes it could be one if it's precomposed
on or two if it's not it's one glyph and
it could be one or possibly two fonts
and if it's two fonts then it'll look
really ugly and you don't want to ever
do that okay some more terminology
myriad Pro I've got there that is a font
family and then we've got several
different faces in that family light
Roman bold condensed etc they're all in
the same family and certainly there's
Baskerville and it has some faces as
well so good we've got some basic
terminology down we're all talking about
the same thing now look look at this
what do we got here we've got a
font-weight:bold and we've got a
font-weight:bold why is it there twice
what's the difference
one is a font face that's correct but so
is that the same property twice No
one of them is a descriptor and one of
them there's a property in the out front
face you what you're doing is you're
saying this font has the following
properties it has these these
characteristics so you're saying this
font does bold whereas in the h1 you're
saying I want this styled using a font
that can do bold that's different
what is the request for styling one is
the description of the capabilities so
there we are descriptors and properties
okay
good we're almost done with the basics
yes in fact we are done with the basics
I cut out some basics that were not as
basic okay so open type features and CSS
so this is where I mean we've got the
basic yeah I've got this font I've
downloaded it's used on the website
great what about doing stuff like that
which is a bit more interesting you can
see we've got some little you know fancy
ligatures there and some swash forms and
interesting stuff going on so open site
features are stylistic controls
typically optional not always for some
languages they're actually required to
display the language but they're in the
font and then the idea is that you
control them with CSS obviously you want
control of the typography in your
stylesheet not buried in the font
somewhere throughout this talk I'm going
to be using the font variant property
which is preferred it's readable I'm
also having to give this talk in Firefox
because that's the only browser that I
found so far that supports it properly
do then there's also font feature
settings which are in all the browsers
and there are horrible little cryptic
four-letter things like boo boo boo boo
and it's like what what is that what
does that do so don't use those actually
you will have to use them where you can
a polyfill them or do something you
could probably have to use them for now
but every time I mention this that
there's only one browser doing I just
hope the other ones have sufficient
shame that they get their act together
and start implementing what people
actually want so here's an example of a
feature if you look we've got some upper
case text and some lower case text and
you notice that the numbers and the
upper case they match well and on the
lower case well lower case letters have
ascenders and descenders but these these
letters don't these numbers don't but
single-property we can change that to
old-style numbers and then suddenly the
the numerals have upper lowercase forms
and they fit much more nicely oh you
wouldn't do it like this obviously I'm
just showing you if it was if your title
was enough a case you would use one
value and you could if your text was in
lower case you'd use the other one you
would do it as appropriately but that's
just one one property very easy to add
simple thing to add to your style sheet
so here's another one fractions
lots of fonts will have a fraction they
will say yeah I've got a half I've got a
3/4 but if you want an 86 480 thirds
yeah you're gonna be out of luck there
but just by setting them like this and
the other thing is if you actually put
3/4 as like the Unicode character
someone searching for 3/4 3/4 in Google
they're not going to find it right it's
a different set of characters so if you
do it like this and then you set font
very numeric to diagonal fractions boo
suddenly we get nice-looking fractions
with the numbers all scaled down and
shifted and it all looks beautiful and
again very simple just one single
prophecy here's another example we're
looking at these tables of numbers there
and well let's find the biggest one well
this one starting with 8 that's probably
bigger than the other ones right because
they start with 1 &amp;amp; 2 actually no
because if you look that has less
numbers it has less digits and now you
could get around that by just setting us
using a monospace font but that looks
super ugly so what you actually want is
to have a proportional font where all
the text is proportional but the numbers
all take up the same width which is a
principle called tabular numbers ding
suddenly they all line up nicely and
lastly the thing I started with with
these interesting ligatures so there is
ligatures normal which is just the
ordinary ones now let's switch on
discretionary ligatures and we get the
le going like that and I swash R with
the O underneath it and that sort of
thing so that's nice you would probably
want no one to do that um body text but
for a heading it looked pretty good and
then none notice that the F and the
outline ow colliding so you've taught
you force the font to not do the
ligatures including the ones that it
really needs to do don't
ever used this value it's only useful
for testing now a thing you're probably
aware of is that the browser's will tend
to fake up for you you you download a
single font and then you ask for bold
and italic these count can't be created
out of thin air but what it can do is it
can kind of slant the letters and
pretend that they're italic they're
oblique which is really ugly
actually it look works better in some
than others so here we have a font and
it has roman and italic and bold and
this font synthesis property says which
ones it's allowed to fake so let's
switch that to none okay we already did
have a bowl but the italic was just made
in the browser this is much better if
you sometimes you don't want the ugly
version and you would rather it just you
could use a different color as well
something like that
and we can look at different font
families and see what they have by way
of yeah you can see that one's just got
a single value in the font family but if
I set style there we go there's the it's
italic the italic isn't could that could
that be any worse actually and the
weight okayed now it's made the bold so
really this is for switching off a
feature which the browser is doing for
you
and then lastly kerning now B people
know what kerning means yes
yes okay good good and how is that
different from flatter spacing do you
know yes good correct so the kerning is
about particular pairs of characters and
how they fit together so that they look
nicely done as letter spacing is applied
to all of the calicos you in uniformly
so there's font kerning you can tell
this one's designed by the CSS working
group because the default is auto and
that has normal and none and you're like
what which so and normal isn't the
initial value right but let's said it's
normal and nothing happens because why
does nothing happen oh okay nothing
happened because I didn't actually
manage to select it that is also true
but it's still nothing happened why is
that so what just means is that this
particular browser has kerning on by
default so when I switch to to normal
then
which normal means do what the font says
and the browser isn't always doing what
the font says in some browsers though
switching it to normal would result in
kerning being applied if a browser like
Chrome for example is more in concerned
about performance than it is concerned
about looks then it will switch kerning
off by default so this is a handy
property to use because you can
normalize results across browsers you
can say for this text I want all the
browsers to do kerning just set font
kerning to normal and they will all do
it and then of course you can also set
it to none which means we're now we have
really ugly the W in the a look just
terrible and let's compare that to
letter spacing which is how you spread
everything out or reduce it or yeah
don't ever do that
okay now color fonts what we see here is
a piece of cloth with some sign writing
on it's from India there was a chap
who's going around India and he was
looking at all this amazing signage that
he's actually hand-painted for you know
fruit stalls and this sort of thing I
thought this is great and these people
are going out of business cuz it's a
traditional labor intensive it's being
replaced by sort of vinyl printers and
print shops so he sent to these guys I
want you to design fonts for me they're
like yeah but we don't have a computer
so that's fine just design me the font
let me see it and I will do all all the
computer stuff so they delivering bolts
of cloth were these gorgeous
multicolored things painter alone and
there's like their letters yeah but we
can't do that
well we can now but we couldn't at the
time so why do we actually want color
fonts anyway well as you can see
illuminated manuscripts in medieval
times had multiple colors they had red
they had letters with you know
decoration and multiple colors and
people have missed this for so long
there's been such a desire from the web
community to be able to do illuminated
manuscripts once again okay that's
that's not the reason this is the reason
actually this is why we have colored
fonts suddenly when they've been wanted
for ages but now we have emoji so that's
cool
but yeah likewise this have to be in
color pretty much so let's go back to
this one here's an example there we are
see it's on my screen it's in multiple
colors doesn't it look great does it
look great does it still look great if I
view the source does it look great oh my
god think what that is going to do for
your search engine optimization you've
got the same text nine times whoa
blowing fail no that's not gonna work
this is fine in print no one knows that
you aligned all these in Illustrator and
then just line them up went bang and now
she out came to printed out put on the
web not so much but there are some now
in the the second-last version of open
site there are ways of doing color fonts
some of them are sucky frankly Thank You
Apple and Google for your bitmap fonts
which basically we were trying to get
away from those for ages please do not
bring them back on the other hand there
are two versions that are going to tell
you about which are vector fonts which
are still colored and they're vector
fonts so the first one is using color
and see pal color holds a stack of
TrueType outlines and c pal holds the
palettes which gives you this you
probably don't believe me that that's
actually being displayed live in the
browser so I'm just going to delete that
and go there we go I mean no mind cbss
that's the next version of CSS but
that's CSS with variables okay good so
we have that so that works now that's
good but that's a stack of outlines okay
they you can't have gradients you kind
of anything fancy like that and it's
fine but where did the styling go this
is not cool at all the colors are in the
font we don't want them in the font we
want them in our style sheet so SVG not
SVG fonts right nobody uses SVG fonts
now I hope okay but SVG in OpenType
which also uses C power the SVG table in
the oven type font has the SVG graphic
the panel hazard palettes and you CSS
variables to alter the
so this is actually again live this is
an SVG in OpenType font which again I
can type good so these are live fonts
and here's an example here these these
variable names are predefined they're
actually in the open type spec and you
can specify them and then start changing
the colors like that whew there we go
so that's one way to do it's actually
not a very nice way but it does work a
better way is in CSS for where we added
a font - palette so often the font
itself will have two palettes one for
use on light on one piece on dark so you
can switch between them okay that's fine
more interesting though you can have an
app Palace entries which is an out rule
which lets you override the built in
palettes and provide your own one that's
better than using predefined variables
and stuff that's a nicer way so lastly
in the last few minutes I'm going to
talk about a brand new thing variable
fonts I was at the ATI conference in
Warsaw in September where there was a
huge announcement with many many
companies all participating to announce
on the same day variable fonts what are
they so before we start here's a quick
question just to check your CSS so I set
font weights 400 and then I set font
weight to calc 9 times 100 what is the
value of font weight is it 400 or is it
900 okay shout-out for 400 shoutout for
900 no it's not it's 400 why because you
look at that 400 and you think that's
the number it's not it's a string if you
look in the CSS spec unfortunately font
weight takes one of nine different
strings which look like numbers really
ugly really horrible right because of
variable fonts we're changing that back
to what it should have been originally
when I specified it actually which was
copied from the openes wasn't my
origination it was just that's what the
open type spec said and that's what we
were going on so actually don't worry in
CSS for he goes back to being an actual
number between 1 and 9
you didn't know you missed this but you
will but once you start having unusual
font ways yourself so variable fonts
will have support for weight for width
for slant for optical sizing woohoo and
the most interesting one custom you can
have custom axes in your variable fonts
so there's a variable font it's being
animated you can see that the weight is
being animated also the x height is
being changed that's a custom axis and
also just on the thinnest ones it's
spreading it out slightly so you've got
the condensed expanded also being
changed so peers in that font face but
look now look what's happening in those
descriptors font weight says 100 space
900 that means it does all the weights
between those numbers fonts stretch
between fifty percent which is condensed
and 200 percent which is expanded font
style it goes between minus 10 degrees
and 40 degrees and here we've said we
want our H ones to be oblique tanned at
24 degrees and we've got our weight to
be 234 just any number between 100 900
it can do them all with one font an
obstacle sizing none because actually if
I was to pick the only other value then
that would be the defaults that we
pointless so there we are this is how
you do it now unfortunately remember I
said about the old ugly things with the
font bit settings that's the example
that's unfortunately the only way it's
implemented but it is in Safari
technical preview 16 plus as of about
three weeks ago so you can actually use
it but only a one browser so far and it
has to be on the latest version of OS X
as well but it's getting there and
here's an example of using it so we're
animating the weight between point three
and three point one on the axis and the
font weight will change and you can do
stupid like this this is basically
a font that has one animatable square
and it uses that square to make the
leather actual characters and I said
characters you nobody booed their uses
them to make glyphs there we go right
here's another example notice as you get
bolder the line starts merging in so
beyond a certain point the font
designers decided to go go to a
different glyph with just that
and bottom and miss out the middle bit
so that again this is just an OpenType
this is gainful is nice so it gets
bolder and it gets lighter but the
spacing stays the same a little bit of
adjustment to the kerning a little bit
as justman here to the width and it's
fitting in the same space now imagine
that you're trying to fit a headline you
want it to be as big and bold as
possible in the particular width and you
don't want that with his usual situation
we're using this you can have the
ultimate in responsive design you can
condense it down basically copy fit like
you would in print so you get exactly
the right font that fits the space quote
from Jason Parman tiled this made them
the significant development for
designing the web since responsive
design itself variable fonts coming to
you in a browser soon if you want them
let them know get on to their user
questions or whatever it is and request
it now people want it now it's being
worked on in CSS for and that's the end
of my talk thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
