development is architectural II more
challenging than react web development
then react is nice and declarative but
the native API is that we use are often
simply not declarative how do we manage
those native API is how do we do that in
terms of architecture and then I'm going
to show a little bit of the ideas how
psycho dais handles that together with
react native and then a real-world
example app so why is react native
harder well because this is really new
stuff and we are all pioneers here so we
really don't know what we're doing I
mean I don't know what I'm doing and
that's exciting and also it's poly lone
polyglot development so if you're doing
web you use JavaScript and you know HTML
CSS but if you're doing you know Android
using Java now iOS using objective-c
in our case we're using all of those
languages plus who knows and you know
see if you need to debug some kind of
yoga or whatnot and there's flow and
there's typescript and may be swift and
Kotlin I mean this is really really more
broad and there's more challenges than
just rendering a state and some other
stuff so for instance react solves
rendering Redux solves state management
and you have some routers that solve you
know routing and what else you have
maybe requests maybe something like
graph QL but you basically most of the
time you're concerning yourself with
rendering state routing requests and
with react native we know that we have
all those plus many more dimensions so
it's it's more stuff to handle and then
you're never sure if you should make
that question on github or should make
it on Stack Overflow so that's kind of
adds to the challenge so um how you know
react is declarative and that's nice and
if you have explained to your boss why
should you use react native you probably
said something along the lines of you
know in react native the rendering is
declarative you don't need to manually
update the parts of the UI that's like
the opposite of what we do in native and
that's true and that's one of the
reasons why most of us bet on react
native but on the other hand you have
other api's like you
this one that has a show method which is
imperative and then you have also in
this vibration API you say you know
start and stop that's imperative and you
pretty much need to manually update that
state right and then you have toasts for
Android and you know toasts are actually
100% UI they're not like any kind of
other thing they're actually visual
their UI but still we're declaring it in
a very I mean we're using it in a very
imperative fashion we're not using it
kind of like we do with rectangles on
the screen we also have the clipboard
you have get and set and then a
non-official API is on NPM follow the
same style here's a package for
text-to-speech on Android and there you
have an imperative function speak and
you also have is speaking and you have
also cancel method so basically know
these api's are not declarative and this
is how guys this is how you why
development was before react came around
and we're doing it so that's kind of
funny so the first insight let's just
try to settle this that you know these
are Singleton's that we're dealing with
like vibration up vibrate and they have
imperative methods let's keep it this in
mind we're gonna come back to it later
and how do we handle these kind of
things well the basic ways that we put
it in like a life cycle hook so for
instance here when component mounts you
know it checks something and it calls
the imperative method on the singleton
another way it would be in some action
creator function there we you know
logout from some Singleton's inside this
function and these are all valid options
you know things work and you know apps
get built and they get shipped but could
we do better I mean could we handle this
in the modern style not the style pre
react you know before react came around
so that's our other insights is that you
know components are not Singleton's
right
they have many instances and action
creators you know there are many
instance of those and like we call that
many times there are many actions so
these things are not Singleton's so if
you put these two
in size together that you know the
native API is our Singleton's but the
components are not Singleton's then that
means that we don't get composability
because you're calling something
singleton from something that's not
singleton now what do I mean with
composability I don't want to give very
theoretical definition so I will just
give you the composability test and it's
pretty simple so you can just get that
file that has the component you can put
it in a repo and you can publish it on
NPM and it's going to be useful for
anyone who imports it ok so that's kind
of what it means to be composable and
for instance in this case here we have
an app and we have the hierarchy of
components we we also have some custom
singleton such as my app manager which
is specific to your app and we have the
vibration singleton and they're deep
inside the hierarchy you have some kind
of call such as my button you know will
call vibrate on the lifecycle hook so
let's say the Welcome tab we cannot get
that and simply put it on NPM because
it's going to be tied directly to that
my app manager so you can't just do that
so it's not composable that component
over there so what can we do for
composability we need to call those read
calls just from Singleton's okay so
Singleton's should be called from
Singleton's so how can we do that in
practice so we can take for instance all
of these calls deep in the hierarchy and
we can put it above in a single thing
okay so now the Welcome tab doesn't
directly call the my app ant manager
anymore but I just so I can take the
Welcome Tabak and put it in a repo and I
can publish it to NPM okay but how does
the Welcome tab actually call that API
how does it do that so one option is
that you can do it kind of like redux
does okay so redux introduced the
singleton store right in flux we used to
have multiple stores but redux you know
we have a singleton and that Singleton
has dispatch and the dispatch is passed
down as prop through this hierarchy and
that's how we can sort of like we could
pass the method of
these Singleton's down as props and call
that we could but if you think about it
you know we learned about UI manager
today and how it's called in the in the
background for us and we are not really
calling UI manager create view from our
lifecycle hooks right so because there's
a framework that handles that for us and
we don't need to deal about deal with
those things so instead of doing that
we're gonna do something a bit closer to
how react manages views so we're gonna
do this we're gonna basically bubble up
an event from the my button as a request
I want to call vibrate okay I'm gonna do
that animation again if we want it
because it's kind of like fire see yeah
it's bub it bubbles up and then the
singleton catches that and actually
performs the request so this is like
roughly what cycle Jess does now you can
ignore for now exactly how does it do
that
just imagine that we have a way to
handle this okay and it's pretty simple
and we call that singleton there we call
it a driver and it just basically picks
the events from an application and
executes those events for real okay
everything red above is what we call
effects basically real function calls
that do real things and everything green
is just your application logic how to
compose those pieces together and make
your your app so what happens when you
do this you get some interesting
benefits of of course the first one that
we talked about was composability you
can get those green boxes and put them
on NPM the other one interesting is
interception so basically components can
intercept an event which is bubbling up
and sort of modify them or cancel them
for instance let's say that my button
wants to call vibrates so it bubbles up
the request but my app component says
like no sorry here you're not going to
call vibrations in this app because we
disabled it and then we're able to do
that another benefit is testability
because when testing I could just create
a test singleton that doesn't run on the
native side at all it just runs on the
JavaScript side that
all of these events that are happening
in the greenside and just makes
assertions on them and it doesn't
actually like run anything it's sort of
totally headless you could say without a
emulator or a device and the my favorite
one is the bottom-up design and that
means that you can build a leave
component first and then proceed to
build the component after it and so
forth and this and when you're doing
that you don't go back to the leaf and
alter it so the really cool thing about
bottom-up design is that you don't need
to do upfront architecture design you
just because the the sort of our comfort
zone is when we're programming that you
know button that special button and only
the button right so that's nice if we
can start from those basic stuff and
build upwards so then the the leaf
component can assume that I get
everything that I need so in order to
explain bottom-up design let me just
explain to you a little bit about
fractals and I'm actually talking about
fractals in real math they are sort of
pretty cool structures they're basically
recursive geometric figures okay so the
way that you create the child figure is
by copy pasting the parent figure
resizing it and putting it in the corner
and then you create this sort of
infinite zooming geometric figure and
notice that the equal sign is there you
know it works in both directions because
equal signs so it means that the way
that I can create a new parent is by
using the same pattern to create the
child okay and that's pretty cool and
I'm gonna show you a transition that I
took awhile to make for my slides so
please try to appreciate it okay and pay
attention because pretty cool
see I'm creating a new parent and I just
copied the child so why am i explaining
this the idea is that in UI development
a fractal architecture would mean one
where the components the pattern used to
build a leaf component is the same
pattern used to build the root component
and it all looks kind of the same and
actually if you use react with state and
props sort of the vanilla style
then you're actually doing a fractal
architecture let's go back and that's
kind of also the property that governs
the hierarchy of psychology as
components the pattern used here same as
the pattern used there and what is that
pattern it's data falls through this
hierarchy and requests bubble up okay
requests to call the actual native api's
so this diagram is kind of pretty I like
it but I'm gonna make it uglier so bear
with me okay I want it I want all of the
arrows to go down because right now I
have arrows going down and arrows going
up okay
so data is kind of falling out falling
down and bubbling up I also made it this
transition was harder to make okay so
please try to appreciate it and it makes
sense okay here we go
cool huh I can actually do that again
sorry yes II know so the this this
diagram is that actually exactly the
same thing as before it's just if you
think of it like this you know and you
fold it back like this it's the same
diagram as before so now you know we
have data going down and sort of data
bubbling down you see and um I also have
a weirder transition coming up so I'm
just gonna rotate stuff okay simple
rotation okay here we go
okay this is this is the same thing as
before it's just that instead of
wrapping around through the top I just
you know doing this loop so we have
unidirectional data flow in a loop so
it's kind of like a cycle and that's
cycle J s and now you kind of know cycle
J is kind of okay but how does it
actually work okay I'm just showing
figures here but what about code okay in
code one of those green boxes would be a
function it's not a react component
anymore and it takes stuff from above
and it returns stuff below okay so the
input is actually not an object okay
typically with
react function components you have like
props as an object as input and you know
react element as an object as an output
here we have sort of like all of the
props that happen over time from now
into eternity and we have the output is
all of the rendering that happens now in
a new future it's not an object that's
that's just you know momentary so that
actually for real it means a stream or
an observable and an event stream so our
component now is just a function that
goes from a stream to a stream and I'd
liked you to admire that for now because
I'm gonna make it uglier okay that was
enough time so it's actually a function
that goes from many streams to many
streams why many streams because I need
to do many renderings over time from now
into eternity but I also need to do many
fetch requests over time and I also may
need to do many alert iOS requests over
time right and when it comes to the
inputs I have many props over time right
arriving to my component but I also may
have many hardware back press events
over time okay so it's a function for
many streams too many streams because
your component may handle not only props
and rendering but also all these other
kind of native api's that we usually see
in react natives so you know all of
these boxes are functions that go from
many streams to many streams and I'm
gonna make this diagram a little bit
more accurate with a another transition
of this guy's full of transitions but
this is this is pretty simple it's just
I feel like it's you're not gonna
understand it in the first time so I
need to do it two times I'm just putting
boxes inside boxes okay because I have a
function call inside a function call so
my app has the tabs view inside it which
has the tabs through it
this is rather like familiar as well if
you think of how the UI actually looks
like it's rectangles inside rectangles
so this is literally what psycho jess is
it's data flow unidirectional with
functions that take many streams and
goes to many streams and I made some
drivers for react native that helped me
to build real apps I have some real apps
and the benefits as we saw you know why
why are we doing this is for
composability so we can get all of those
components and you know make them useful
by by themselves not useful tied to the
rest interception which is pretty cool
for different types of customization of
your application testability and
bottom-up design I'm going to show you a
real world example of an app that I'm
building it's it's alpha still so if it
doesn't look great then don't worry
so I'll start from the innermost
component I have you know many
components here but I'm just going to
show these to the white part is called
the public tab which is a basic newsfeed
and the outer one is called main which
handles you know the blue part and
everything else so how does the public
tab look like we know that it's a
function from many streams to many
streams so it does a bunch of stuff in
the middle but what matters is this that
we have many streams to many streams and
it sort of connects those things
together
let's see a little bit in details what
we have there we have sources screen
okay what is that that's basically the
event stream of all of the touch events
so if I go some slides back I'm gonna I
can show you basically I had Hardware
back events right so that's a source of
events and you know it's not software
presses it's hardware presses so in the
same way software presses are treated in
the same style as hardware presses okay
so that's why I have oh now you need to
see all the chat again but my point is
let's see now you need yeah now all of
the software events are handled in this
function that looks pretty simple what
you see there is basically some kind of
jQuery kind of backbone thing I know
those are like square words
in this conference so don't panic I mean
it's okay it's okay
don't don't panic you don't need to
learn this stuff and we handle those
just in order to like pre-process them a
little bit and then we have the view
part and there you know sources SSB is
kind of like my database so you can
think of it as my database data over
time all of the data from now to the
future if we look at how view looks like
it takes that stream of data from the
database and sort of maps each feed
object to you know a public feed
component so what's the public feed if
you look at it it's just the react
component so you can get the data from
the from the feed thing you can put it
in a flat list so now this probably
looks familiar to you you probably feel
warm inside and I feel home this is good
but then when you see that there's no
JSX
you're like what's that I'm using
something else well sue me yeah so but
the point is that you can use normal
react components you can integrate them
it's not like you know this doesn't work
with you need to sort of convert
everything you can just use normal rare
components this was the innermost
component how does the parent component
looks like that would be the function
main it's also a function that takes
many streams and outputs many streams
and as you can see I'm calling public
tab there and I'm passing it the many
streams as inputs I also have another
tab and we're sort of you know joining
streams here kind of like you join roads
you know they're just literally sort of
the same idea then we returned many
streams and if you look at the bottom
there I have status bar so I am
controlling the the status bar in
Android with a stream and that's pretty
cool because it ends up eventually in
the in the singleton that sort of sets
the status bar stuff I don't actually
have you know the imperative calls here
I have them separate and that's the big
point here how does index dot Android
Jayesh looks like it basically imports
all of those Singleton's that handles
these stuff and gets my main component
and sort of plugs those two together
puts them
Loup and the app starts working this is
literally how short my index dot Android
Jas is so how does the app actually look
like it's a social network here you can
see peers that are around you basically
local area network or or Bluetooth and
then it has newsfeed which pretty much
looks like Facebook newsfeed except this
app is intended to be so you know you
have likes and stuff it's intended to be
decentralized in P P to P so it doesn't
spy on your deepest darkest secrets to
make money for mr. Zuckerberg it's just
all of your data is with you so it's on
github and you can take a look if you're
curious about this architecture and
everything that I'm talking about here
is there it's awful but like I'm
dedicating 50 percent of my time for
many months to building this and so
serious stuff this is not the only app I
built with this pattern I also built an
app for myself for like taking care of
my finances and I noticed that you know
this pattern is working nicely for me I
haven't seen like serious problems with
it and that kind of stuff here's a nice
bonus streams are pretty cool not as
cool as Ken wheelers crossbow but still
kind of cool you see the line for the
status bar there it's a stream that
sends you know many colors over time so
I can do something else instead I'm
making their stream periodic 40 what
that means is I have a stream of numbers
that goes like this 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11
Oh wah every 40 seconds it emits I mean
40 milliseconds it emits a number and
then I can just map each number to a
color so it says limes the ER line 1
line 2 LeBlanc lime 9 and then limes 0
line 1 and cetera and what you get out
as an output this blinking status bar
color now that was pretty cool because
it was done with two lines of code but
the lines of code is not actually the
coolest part the coolest part is that
this is declarative okay just like
component render and it should be
declarative because status bar is UI
right why are we dealing with these
stuff in an imperative fashion
and yeah so like imagine you know in
react we have render but you can think
of the render function as rendered on
like we should have also render status
bar and then we do it and declare it to
faster when we should have render toast
and we do in declarative fashion that's
sort of what we're doing here I have a
second bonus for you that's okay you've
been seeing this diagram many times
today right yeah you got it you just
replace the names okay and there we have
the JavaScript engine or the thread and
we have the native threads where they
have the serialization bridge what I'm
saying here is that this architecture
from this framework psychologist is
basically the same architecture that
react native uses because in react
native all of the actual effects happen
on the native side right and we need to
pass messages so it's a message passing
system and that means that all of the
benefits that I listed for you
composability testability interception
and stuff could work also here for react
native without you know installing these
stuff so just as an idea you could do
like interception stuff so for instance
all of those events that are being
passed through the bridge such as you
know the UI manager stuff what if we
would create plugins that would sort of
you know mutate those stuff it's just
you since you the same like benefits
apply in this architecture and the other
there's a lot of things that we could
you know explore so the conclusion is
basically cycle is an architecture for
you is that goes beyond just render Ford
on a mobile UI and consists actually not
of just rectangles on the screen but
also you know status bar color vibration
and all these kind of stuff
and we want to handle those in the
declarative style right not just putting
a bunch of imperative stuff in action
creators of course there's a lot of more
things to learn streams are not easy but
I'm trying to make them easier because
rxjs has like 150 operators which is
like total total death in order to learn
off all of the stuff so I made a smaller
library that has just 20 and you can
sort of learn it quite quickly there's a
bunch of other different ideas like
psychologist's isolation
which is like a unique concept for us
that doesn't encapsulation and also the
react native integration with psycho is
rather alpha it works kind of like react
native worked when it just came out you
know it works but of course we can
improve it and we're gonna improve it
and that kind of stuff when cool thing
is that I didn't mention the word
functional here at any moment
neat neither did I mention reactive so
we don't need to talk about those buzz
words if they don't help us at all but
you know you can use it if you want you
can take some ideas if you want I just
hope that this was an inspiration and
what's possible in terms of architecture
and in order to make everything
declarative I also super interested in
bringing all kinds of stuff to react
native such as Elm I want to use a pure
script for react native actually because
I have a use case where I need to
validate all of the JSON because there's
no back end so all of the JSON could be
corrupted in nonsense and actually pure
script turns out to be a very good use
case for that so that's the type of
stuff I want to bring to react native
because I believe it's much bigger than
just JavaScript and web okay if you have
any further questions don't feel shy to
talk to me I'm open and we can go
through details just come and talk to me
and that's pretty simple okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
