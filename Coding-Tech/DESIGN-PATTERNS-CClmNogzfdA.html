for having me my name is Peter I'm a
computer science master student from the
Netherlands and my education focused a
lot on software design and architecture
in the past year and I became quite
passionate about this topic because it
allows you to go from raw code that is
unclear and right in front of your face
to more abstract terms so here for
example we use very easy UML or just a
very standard modeling to model a system
that has an API some logic a model an
SDK and that communicates with the
outside world so if you take your code
and you put it in such a model you
immediately see how your system works
how it interacts and most importantly
you will also see disadvantages or
security flaws and this is software
design when it's more a code level and
then you have software architecture that
is more on a structural level so you can
for example model how how many api
service you have for that you have a
load balance in between and how you
connect to the database and these kind
of things so that's how you model more
your whole system so these two topics
became quite important to me and I would
like to give you a very short history of
design patterns of software design
namely software design wasn't that
didn't come from actual software
engineering but it came from real-world
architecting so really building
buildings and this man Christopher
Alexander he was so to say the founder
for something that is called at the
pattern language so he wrote this book
in 1977 and he actually in this book
proposed 253 design patterns for real
world architects so when you want to
build a building you don't have to
reinvent the wheel you don't have to
think whether you put the dining room
next to the kitchen or next to the
bathroom these kind of things when you
want to think about what kind of
interior you need for a certain room or
what kind of kind of styles work nicely
together u.s. real word architect can go
back to this book just have a look at it
and
pick your design patterns out of that
book and this pattern language actually
became quite interesting also for other
fields for example software engineering
and these four authors they were became
known as the Gang of Four those were the
first authors of the first people in
software cheering who used the design
language in software engineering and
this book in 1994 was at the very first
milestone on well book milestone in this
area and in this book they proposed 23
different design patterns and they are
still used today and they are language
independent so whether use Python or
something else you will always mostly
use these design patterns this list
actually got extended now by different
people it's around 40 40 design patterns
now you can find them on the QPD if you
want to look up all of them but you
might actually ask here so what's
actually a design pattern you're all
practical people so let let me give you
a practical example of the proxy pattern
so you have a problem so a design
pattern in general it's always about a
very general problem and it explains
that problem and then it offers a very
general solution to that problem and you
can then implement a customized version
of that of that pattern in your code so
well our problem is that you have high
resolution images on a website and
because when a customer comes to your
website he or she has to load all of
these images at once so you have a long
loading time it takes a long time and
you also want to be able to style these
images so the problem is basically the
long loading time so if you look the if
you look at the proxy pattern then the
solution offered is that you simply
replace these images with placeholders
and whenever and you can play style
these placeholders and then whenever a
user comes to that part of your website
you load them then dynamically so you
download all the web server emerges in
the beginning but then over the time
when a user Nene's needs them then you
load the image and if you look at the if
you look at it in in UML a little bit
that's how you would implement a proxy
pattern so you have an image proxy let's
ponder see if those image foxy both of
them an image proxy and an actual image
the image proxy holds the CSS and the
connection to the actual image that
holds like a file path or something else
a ul to the actual image it's just an
example when you want when you will
implement the proxy pattern in your code
it will actually look differently but
that's in general terms how you would do
it so that is a design pattern we now
let me give you a little example of how
you can actually use design patterns and
I made a little comic story about this
and I hope you like it so this is evil
overlord and it's all evil overlords he
obviously wants to take over the world
he wants to control everybody any things
well people are a lot in front of their
smartphones and they're kind of
controlled by the smartphone's so if I
just control the smartphone's I can
control the world so you guys to use a
little minion in this dungeon and he
says create three updates which give me
pseudo rights over iPhone users because
he wants to start there and the minion
obviously obeys he gets these updates he
goes to the iPhone uses he makes him
update his malicious update but once the
iPhone users have it the Android user
show up and they're like man these nasty
iPhone users with their fancy features
and everything we also want that update
give us the update say says okay I would
do that he goes back to his dungeon and
ask us meaning well give me seven
updates to control the Android users and
the mini says well it's a reflect today
but we all know it's not that important
to effector is it yes I will get right
to it he makes the app the Android users
also update their phones with a
malicious update but then all of a
sudden the friend a Windows Phone users
shop
we're like well would you mind
developing this update for Windows Phone
as well and we all know it's a little
bit hard to develop for Windows Phones
is like total despair no and one
eternity later he finally creates the
update
everybody's almost dead and P Windows
Phone users are like well thank you very
much they install the update
well poof they're gone thank you all
right that's a lean introduction but a
little sure story here and now actually
the Overlord he has this malicious
update on all the phones but he actually
has a problem because you see he has
three different groups of people and
they speak different languages so elvish
for example - or fish and the humans
speak Swedish and his language is
English so whenever he wants to call
when he wants to send a command so to
say to one of these groups he has used
either either elfish dwarfish or swedish
and he has to translate that first from
his english language so you have to a
lot of you have to customize a lot and
he looks into his book of gang of four
and he sees the adapter design pattern
he really loves it because with the
adapter pattern you can just simply add
another class and adapter class in front
of your minion class Jose and you will
do the translation in that adapter class
so you just have to call you have you
have to as a one unique command that you
can call on the adapter and the adapter
will translate it for you I will just
show you because I it's my first dog and
I heard from a lot of people that it's a
great thing to do a live demo yeah
that's always a great idea it works for
lousy so I created these example classes
I hope you can see that you have some
like else some dwarfs and humans and all
of them have kind of the same command it
is actually translated from the English
call me apparently to the internet in
elvish it's known in and dwarfish it's
astronaut and in Swedish it's a thing
Mick
I've pronounced it and kind of correctly
and you see it's kind of the same
command but you have different names for
it and what you could do was that what
the overlord could do you iterate over
all you in a minions and then you check
every time okay if it's a if it's an elf
I will call this function if it's a
dwarf I will call another function
otherwise I call the default function so
to say but I mean everybody I think you
spot already the problem here because if
you add any other minion groups like L
like trolls and orcs then you have to
create more and more of these else if
statements and it just gets longer
longer and it's hard coded which we
don't like so when we use the adapter
pattern we can actually create an
adapter for each of these groups so we
have an elf adapted rorf adapter and a
human adapter and they all like they all
look quite the same you just when they
you create them you hand in a minion
object that you want to adapt and they
all have the same function which is a
call me function and the elf one called
Nolan and the dwarf one called this one
and the humans calling me so you create
an adapter for every group but then
again it works yeah you can iterate over
the minions and you only have to call
one single function and adapter takes
care for you and it works but again you
see the problem whenever we want to
create another group you have to create
another adapter as well so what if we
just use a very general adapter class
for any minion and that's a little bit
complicated but I will walk you through
it it's just a meaning that doesn't
matter whether an elephant wolf and it's
same you create a you have personal and
minion object and you also pass and some
adapted methods and you can create any
you can pass on any method you want to
adapt so we have the same ik function
for example we can hand this in here and
then you just iterate over them you get
that function from the actual object and
you set it onto the adapter find a class
object with the new sort of a name with
a new key so you take the ring make
function and you register it on the
adapter
with a new name so you can call it on a
new name and the and I do this here so I
create for example a minion adapter for
an elf and I say that I want to have a
Call Me function and that should be the
non in function on the elf object and I
can do the same for the dwarf and the
humans and then I can simply again just
iterate over them and say and call the
call me function but another cool thing
about this adapter is that you can still
get and set any attribute any variable
any function on the actual object on the
actual minion object and you don't set
it on the adapter but on the actual
objects also at one time you can just
rip out the adapter and you still hold
the object with all the attributes set
so this is what you would do with the
width you get and set so this code
actually I think will be online
afterwards so you can just look at it in
peace at home but when we run this we
actually see that okay
oh that else.you they call home and the
humans at the dwarfs call home and now I
test it okay I looked at the name on the
actual adapter and I checked it with the
name on the actual minion and then I
change it you see that's the same and
then I changed only the adapters name
and check it again and you see that on
the adapter but also on the minion
object the names changed okay so this is
the adapter pattern and or evil
overlords happy because he only has one
function to call but still every time
when he wants to call someone all those
minions he has to make one call for
every minion he has so you just iterate
over them and call so many functions he
just wants one update rule them all just
one function and the minions as well it
sounds complicated but I'm pretty sure
there's a design pattern for this and
the minion is well educated because
there's the facade observer pattern the
facade observer pattern you probably all
have used it before you also note F with
the name interface so if you ever use an
API that's actually interface it's a
facade
facade design pattern so with the facade
design pattern we can put something in
between that handles all all our calls
for us so we just have to make one call
to the facade and the facade again calls
all the minions I'll show you again how
it looks like and we have again our
adapter and then I created a minion
facade and I also created a function to
create all the minions to take all over
the people and that's the same that you
know from before I just create a couple
of adapters but then I have this one
function to rule them all and I can
summon all the minions and that's just
as we have seen before a for-loop of all
the minions but I can just call one
function that's nice and the overload on
the other side just has to create to
call two functions they create minion
function and then the summoned minion
functions so not like a for loop not a
hundred calls going out just a single
call to the facade all right so with the
facade pattern in place the Overlord
still has one last problem because the
overlord he is a very busy people person
and very busy people have to go on
vacation every now and then but when
he's on vacation he doesn't want to
check his laptop all the time to check
whether all his minions are still in a
good state and they're all under his
control but he actually wants to get a
notification whenever something changes
on these minions and he looks up his
Gang of Four book and he just burst
through it and he actually finds the
observer pattern so you might have used
the observer pattern before especially
if you if you have used Java because
it's baked in it's a built-in function
there and with the observer pattern we
can just we can just make all these
minions call back to the observer tour
overlord
every time when something changes so we
don't have to actively poll and I asked
like hey something changed no okay but
they notify us when something changed if
we go back to our code so this is the
observer pattern it's two classes it's
taking mainly from from
but some Python you have the observer
class that is the class of the object
that gets notified and it has a single
function which is an update function and
it gets an object some arguments and
some key value arguments all the
information you want to hand in there
you can you can just change it as you
want and then the more important part is
the observable class which is the object
that notifies when something changes on
it and it just has a list of subservice
you can add an observer you can remove
observers and there's the most important
part
whenever something changes we simply
call notify observers and we iterate
through all the observers and simply
call the update function and say like
hey something changed here with this
argument and this key value argument so
when we use it in our in our project
first of all I created an evil overlord
class and that evil overlord class has
an observer is inherits from the
observer so this one will get notified
and it will implement the update
function so we just say we receive the
message and that's the information we
got and then I decided on you making the
minion adapter one and observable
because we already wrote the get
attribute and set attribute functions
here so whenever you change something on
the actual minion object you will most
likely go through the adapter and
everything I have to do actually is make
this inherit from observable and then
say okay whenever something changes
whenever we set an attribute on the
object on the minion which is notify all
the observers and we just send their
like which attribute has changed to
which new value yeah so when you run
this again
you see that first we create the minions
we add an observer to the elves because
I I added an function called just
moneyto the elves for now and you simply
add the overload as an observer to the
elf object and then yes we add the
observer and then we just for test
purposes change the elves name and we do
that here oh yeah so we just say okay we
change the name and then we changed the
name on the adapter but as you know
already it's actually change on the
minion object and then we say well the
elves name changed and it is exactly
what happens so we changed the elves
name and then hey the evil overlord
received a message something changed
it's not good I have to look at my phone
and the message of the message you got
is from a minion adapter and we see that
the attribute name was changed to Elrond
and then we say okay we successfully
changed the elves name so this is this
is how you see observer pattern you can
use it it's it's a simple implementation
that I've shown you here when you
implement it especially in a more
concurrent
environment then you have to make sure
that it's thread-safe and that's a
little more complicated but still you
can find this observer pattern on the
internet and just copy-paste it okay so
with this observer pattern in place our
evil overlord is happy and you can
finally go on vacation about design
patterns whenever you maybe maybe you
have heard about them before and maybe
you've read some articles and in the
community there are a couple of things
that are criticized on these design
patterns and one of them being is well
design patterns can mostly be replaced
with built-in functionality and about
this so we don't have to implement them
ourselves they already kind of in our
languages we just have to use the
language right and about this criticism
I have to say yes there's some truth to
it but also know there are some things
that don't really match
so yes some design patterns are already
built in
for example the iterator pattern it's an
actual pattern but you are if you use
Python you're so used to it that you
don't see it as something weird or
something cool on you because it's just
built in if you use a list comprehension
anything you iterate if you heard that
if you use something else like C++ or C
you don't have an iterator function
entirely sure about this but I heard
that you have to at least when they
wrote the book the Gang of Four then you
had to implement the iterator thing
yourself every time when you want to use
it which is not really nice so this one
is built in yes but many are actually
not build in so as I shown already is
the facade the interface you can't
really have one fits all interface or
facade you also can't have one fits all
adapter it will always depends on the
class you want adapt so this that's my
opinion on this criticism and the second
criticism you hear a lot as well design
patterns I'm really more for Java and
c-sharp and not really that much for
Python I must say that I disagree with
this only because yes these design
design patterns in general somehow more
prevalent in these fields if you want to
become a Java developer fresh from
university you apply for your first
junior developer job you must you you
really have to know that the design
patterns you have to know the names and
you have to know how to implement them
because they will most likely be part of
your interview for your first job and
that's in Java I'm not entirely sure how
that some Python but I must say that I
think they also really important in
Python and that's why I'm giving this
talk because they not only helped you to
solve problems but they also help you to
get a more abstract and understanding of
your software because when you want to
use these design patterns what you have
to do is you have to model your software
mostly you have to look at how your
components interact and when you model
your software with UML for example then
you really see how how your system looks
like how it interacts and that's I think
if you train that a lot it really it
really gives you like it helps you
understand yourself or
and you will also create a better
structure there well structure software
in even less time because you can just
pick up these design patterns implement
and implement them in your code and
these design patterns are mostly well
actually all of them are really well
structured so if you implement them well
your software immediately becomes better
structured and one important thing about
this whole thing is that they often
actually offer a shared language to
communicate so when you sit down with
your developer colleague over lunch and
you solve the problem with for example
the observer pattern and yet a colleague
tells you his problem or her problems
and you use a thing like well you know
what your problem is quite similar to my
problem so if you wouldn't know the term
observer pattern you then have to go
into all these details of what your
problem was and how you solved it but
since you already know and hopefully
your colleague also knows the term
observer pattern you can just say well
just use the observer pattern and let's
say that's all you have to say so it you
can apps you can communicate about
problem solving on a more abstract level
and Genma talk I would like to give you
some takeaways one of them is please
look at design patterns really only
study them forget them again and then
look them up when you ever you need them
because once you read them and I read
the book of king of force myself and I
thought like my hand that's just a
solution I needed in my software and you
immediately probably start using one of
these design patterns and even later on
when you count a different problem you
just think back well there was something
in the book and you just look it up and
you have yeah like a very easy solution
and you will write better software when
you look at design patterns and they
will become more and more helpful and
even necessary the more senior you
become so when you become when you move
from junior developer to senior
developer or whatever other title you
want to use you most likely won't really
sit in front of your computer every day
all day long and just look at lines of
code but you will rather start to decide
on the overall structure of your system
and the architecture and then when you
know the design patterns again your job
then becomes easier you will have better
software you
structured better and with these last
notes I would like to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
