hard work I didn't sleep much but before
that in February I was recruited my
friends said you know come out to the
coast well if you laughs do scheme in
the browser and by the time I got there
of course it was supposed to look like
Java and it's Christophe said be a
little language I knew after I got into
Netscape 2 that he it would either die
quickly and Microsoft would completely
replace it or it would be around for 20
years or longer and I said this to my
cubicle made at Netscape Jeff Weinstein
so he can testify to that
but people get impatient and they get
tempted by things like you know Windows
on the PC and you think the web will die
every 10 years and it doesn't it just
keeps going and that's why I like this
quote from Ian Hickson things that are
impossible just take longer I'm going to
cover why that is necessarily so with
the web and the best way to cope with
that fact I've been around a long time
so there was Netscape JavaScript I found
in Mozilla with jamie zawinski and other
people did Firefox which he started the
browser market nobody thought that was
possible talk Google how to do Chrome
and for me the interesting innovation is
now going into peer-to-peer networks
that are not just for downloading songs
but but now for things like crypto
currencies and involved in those as well
as in the ad blocking trafficking
protection and privacy by design
I think privacy tech is going to be big
in the next 10 years I'm glad that
Europe is doing its part there how do we
cope with the fact that in any regime of
web browsers you're going to have
competition you might have a near-death
experience where internet explorer takes
ninety five percent of the market but
Firefox showed how to restart it and I
think that will be a lesson that it's
not forgotten that means you'll have
competing browsers working in standards
bodies and they have to find a modus
vivendi they have to get along and best
way that I've learned to do it it's just
not smoke but to socialize and this has
been going on with JavaScript since
1996 November 1s tape took JavaScript to
the echo standards body at that time it
was the European computer Manufacturers
Association here's the secretary-general
of the time a bon vivant I remember
fondly he's retired now
he lived in Geneva he is a Dutch surname
but he's Belgian born a polymath
rocontour a really fun guy and that I
think taught me something that we've
tried to keep going in this committee
that you have dinners together and you
try not to hold grudges or let
personality conflicts what your
inevitable get the better of you and and
Netscape while it lasted did that and
Microsoft even played relatively fair as
they took the browser market but then
they shut it all down
so with Firefox we brought it back and
we actually restarted it I went to
Geneva in 2005 after Firefox 100 came
out in November of 2004 and I said the
on let's let's bring the band back
together it's time to improve JavaScript
again and you know Microsoft was kind of
like no do we really have to we're doing
c-sharp
but Macromedia had used a version of
JavaScript called ActionScript in the
flash player and so we formed an
alliance with them and this led to a
bunch of learning and socializing and
philosophizing that I think is important
I used this famous painting by Raphael
there's a detail from it
that's Doug Crockford on the left and
then me on the right
dubs always pointing up and I'm like
keep it real there are bad problems in
committee so it's inevitable because you
get conflicts of personality and
conflicts of style and and sort of deep
deeply held beliefs that aren't fully
unpacked into chains of reasoning it's
hard to reason together if people come
from really different schools of thought
so we've learned how to cope with this
by not rushing to any conclusion when
you're doing language design you're
solving many problems which cross cut or
trade off against each other you have to
take the the hermeneutic spiral as it's
called you have to be willing to go
several times before you close on a
design and sometimes you have to throw
things out and start over again that's
happened for instance with es6 proxies
you have to avoid the temptation to say
well I have developers that are solving
this complex compound problems so I'm
just going to give them a complex
compound solution that's kind of a fixed
composite function because that usually
doesn't work it's usually the case that
when you decompose it you find that
you've got um composable parts and what
you'd rather do is what the scheme
scheme in the browser the scheme report
says in its very first paragraph it says
break the language down in two
orthogonal primitives that work well
together so that's been the job of the
committee and coming to an understanding
of those primitives and minimizing that
the choice of primitives choice of
axioms has been important
then there's the ugly I shouldn't linger
on it too Co you find people sometimes
let their competitive interest get the
better of them and so they they use
essentially bad faith arguing they find
sort of vague excuses for not doing
something and they all have some truth
in they're all half truths you ain't
going to need it don't scare the junior
people you know don't make it into Java
but you have to actually get into the
concrete aspects to get past those
objections because that could be true of
many things that we want and while we
don't want to make JavaScript into Java
languages grow there's a great talk by
guy Steele where he starts with a subset
of the English language and presenting
the talk and then he grows his subset as
he gives the talk languages grow that's
how they how they progress so we've had
to cope with the good the bad the ugly
and we've made progress the old days
were when Netscape had some market power
which was going away and we got ps1 done
based on my work in that scape 2 &amp;amp; 3
Atma script to just historical curiosity
was the ISO version of es 1 yes 3 was
the big one it had a bunch of new things
it had fully nested functions and
closures function expressions a lot of
you may have heard about es 4 I spent
many years on that that's where we with
Macromedia which we got bought by adobe
tried to really get microsoft to sit up
and pay attention by doing the big
language that had been envisioned even
in 1999 by somebody in Baltimore whore
watt of Netscape who I gave the keys to
the kingdom to me he designed this
language ActionScript 3 has a lot of
aspects of it it actually got
implemented by Microsoft on the server
side in 2000 but they they never
promoted it and didn't not standardize
it yes four failed but the failure was
important because the committee then
with my codename harmony found a way to
come together and work on ES 5 which was
the no new syntax 3.1 kind of
incremental step from ES 3 that had been
started concurrently with the s4 dot
crop four and others descending from es
4 in public
we pulled everybody together and we've
been operating in a much better mode
since then es6 obviously is a big leap
forward a lot of backlog had to be
absorbed but now we've got on to a
better cadence there's a back story some
of this is you've heard about scheme in
the browser it was a lie it was a bane
hope let's say there were other things
that I did in hurry in the 90s that I do
regret no do-while switch try-catch
that's all ok I think that worked out
regular expressions felted Emil I based
on Pro for sorry I met Larry wall in 97
I said hey I'm putting Pro regular
expressions in JavaScript that he turned
green he looked very unhappy he was
changing them for pro 5 and pro 6 is
even even yeah different because he had
could do a clean slate language the
restarting of tc39 I mentioned that that
was painful because Microsoft didn't
want to do much the language until they
did and when they did it was still this
sort of half-hearted thing until I think
chrome came out and that really woke
them up so we had you know amazing
performance work in JavaScript engines
we even had Google to say that
JavaScript cannot be repaired so we'll
do
- now dart and I told him it wouldn't
work they didn't listen
that actually leaked through an
accidental global message post by
somebody on the tc39 committee whose
name is on it he's not the
author of that - memo but he he turned
white and went over to another Googler
during the November 2010 meeting and
tapped him on the shoulder in a
theatrical fashion and they all all the
Googlers decamp to the hall and we said
what's going on as the singularity
arrived has has Sergey or Larry canceled
free you know cookies only later did we
learn that my friend on the committee
from Google accidentally posted this
this internal memo which the JavaScript
must be replaced it was like job we love
JavaScript but it must be replaced and
it's just really hard to replace there's
something like successful DNA about
JavaScript once it's in there you're
gonna heart then getting rid of it
another thing I'm particularly proud of
in the last 10 years was this sort of
discovery carving nature at the joint
this play-doh set of science of azzam
j/s inside of JavaScript if you look at
C code and some of you probably know C
code you have you have a statically
typed language with machine types and
there is fast C code notably games games
were always torturing the hardware can
you map that to JavaScript it turns out
you can and this was discovered at first
I think by alone Sakai maybe by others
concurrently or a little bit before at
Adobe labs and the trick is to use the
bitwise operators that I put in most of
them come from C one of them comes from
Java so I'm really glad I put those
those like vertical bar or operator in
because that if it hadn't been in there
from 1995 what we've been hard to add
later and the fact that it was there all
along meant we could do incredibly fast
JavaScript also needed typed arrays from
WebGL and this is this is not meant for
reading but just the dynamic nature of
JavaScript has led to a common
architecture and all I think all the top
engines now the open source engines
where you have interpreting and you have
sort of a fast just-in-time compiler of
baseline compiler and then you have a
much more aggressive compiler that
operates when there's really hot code
running and the fast subset of
JavaScript that is assam j/s the
statically typed fast subset allows
bypassing the baseline JIT and the
interpreter which has paved the way for
what is web assembly which we're all
excited about a little more backstory I
I realized after Ellen where's Brock did
a great job
as editor of Emma 262 and as we got es5
done that he was not happy at Microsoft
so I recruited him to Mozilla and we did
es6 that was a cool and I was glad to
have Allen on the crew it was all there
the formalization of Asmodeus as a type
system was by Dave Herman the
exploratory compiler driven work was by
Alonzo Kai and Luc Wagner did the
amazing compiler that bypasses those
jets and does a full sort of whole
module compilation to machine code and
it all came together in one week in the
fall of 2012 in Raleigh North Carolina
and Epic Games Unreal Engine 3 was
ported in four days you know you have to
get the audio working using open al
mapped to web audio you had to get
OpenGL mapped a WebGL fix a few compiler
bugs and suddenly this game is running
at 60 frames a second Tim Sweeney the
founder of Epic said he thought it would
take years to get there I think this
pretty much killed portable Native
Client and other such approaches it was
at that point inevitable that
webassembly would emerge Babel j/s was
interesting because 10 or 20 years ago
people would say I'm never writing code
with a compiler I'm writing JavaScript
to the metal and and now they've gotten
used to using tools and I think that's
beneficial linting but even type systems
typescript and so on
and at some point I think the committee
will standardize some kind of type
system we have a new proposal from some
folks at Google it's gonna take a while
it there's disagreement between flow and
typescript and there's a lot of
evolution exploration to do you know how
modern software works on a rapid release
cycle 6-week cycle for you know firefox
chrome brave some of the browsers are
more like an annual cycle the atma
committee is now going on an annual
cadence which is good because it gets
rid of that schedule chicken problem
where if people feel like they're going
to miss they can just go to the next
year they don't try to hold up
everything to jam and something doesn't
fit and as Frick did Google threw in the
towel on dart and if I'm at the same
time I think threw in the towel on
portable Native Client it's not gonna go
across browser web assembly was out in
2015 June so there's been a lot of
interesting backstory that you may not
hear everywhere I sometimes try to share
this this is a
Brooklyn Jas Meetup when I said you know
something's changed some say the same
Apple still Apple other companies sort
of trade roles and and attitudes and and
right after that of course Microsoft
open-source their chakracore JavaScript
engine we're still waiting for edge but
it could happen I it was a good move
I'll just share what in detail one of
the new things that's coming into es
2018 or something I don't know what
it'll be it's it's getting implemented
in all the engines now at all the open
source engines and that's big and you
know how when you start counting up in
JavaScript you get past 53 bit integer
you lose precision I didn't have time to
do any other number types and I did put
in those bitwise operators so implicit
in JavaScript are 32-bit signed and
unsigned integers other than that you're
out of luck and if you want to go to
really big numbers like the finance
people do you end up using your own big
decimal or big in at your library but
we're putting big in into the language
and it will have nice end suffix for
literal syntax they'll have operators
that work sensibly even with some safe
conversions for comparisons it will have
the ability to name property keys and
cast to narrow or integer types which is
important for Asmodeus because big int
will matter there this is how we're
going to project 64-bit types through
javascript begins back in to 64-bit
machine types in assam Jas I I had to
get this ball rolling by saying let's do
64-bit types and a couple of people Dan
Ehrenburg notably said let's let's let's
do begins and we can make it just as
fast it'll be better and dart head
begins so we know it's better so that's
good
I'll put these slides you see the links
here's an example Fibonacci function in
JavaScript nicely using D structuring
and computing Fibonacci numbers and if
you go up to fifth seventh e9 you run
out of 53 bits of anticipate all
everyone blames me for I Triple E
floating point problems like not a
number somebody put a tweet up with a
oscilloscope with not a number this is
like a Tektronix or HPS Losco and he
said it's JavaScript and I said no it's
not it's C code it's it's
it's I Triple E but I'll take the blame
with big int we get rid of this we got
the true answer in green instead of the
wrong one you ready just to show you
that the committee is it's not messing
around these are a selection of the
stage three proposals those unit of node
realize import as a function it's hard
to do statically but it's coming
thanks to dominic google dante nicola so
dynamic import pretty big michael
Takara's championing flat map and
flattening for all the functional fans
out there Seb mark page at Facebook is
doing rest and spread for objects that's
what the third line shows we're evolving
classes and actually I think other
things to have private fields and
methods and and the design is more like
Ruby I think there's still some details
being debated there but this is at stage
three a synchronous iterations so you
can do for a weight of and you can
totally a face the the pain of promises
a bunch of regular expression fixes look
behind pack in 1997 just missed yes
three
it was just being added to Perl when we
were cutting off the es three regular
expression features so finally getting
looked behind assertions and Unicode is
getting help and named property groups
the /s flag on regular expressions and
there's there's much more small
proposals some bigger ones I didn't
cover here they all have to go through a
rigorous process to get into the next
version language but it and the annual
cycle we're going at JavaScript will
continue to evolve and that's why I say
almost bet on Jas and I have to treat
webassembly fairly because it's another
input language for the same JavaScript
VM that we all enjoy in multiple
browsers and oh yeah web packs pretty
cool - thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
