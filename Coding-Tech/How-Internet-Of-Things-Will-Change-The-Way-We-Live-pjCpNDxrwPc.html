plugged into me right now I've got this
band this is real and it's modeling my
looking at my heart rate but I'm also a
type 1 diabetic and I've been diabetic
for twenty years one of the things that
every diabetic does when they become
diabetic as they try to solve this
problem usually with Microsoft Excel but
at some point they try to figure out
well I'm diabetic and I'm an engineer
let's plug some wires together and see
what we can do so when we say the
Internet of Things I think it's great
that you the normal Sugar's people you
know you have your fitbit's and we think
that's adorable but but I have you know
an insulin pump and that insulin pump is
plugged in there's the insulin pump and
it's plugged into my arm it's 24 hours a
day and that talks to a system here is a
CGM that is my actual live blood sugar
right now then you see how it's kicking
up there a bit that's because of stress
that's actually plugged in down here in
an implant in my side sorry to show you
my chubbiness and this is real when you
hear internet of things you think Fitbit
you think Raspberry Pi but I think this
ok and we plugged this into some cloud
systems that I want to share with you
while the Internet of Things is fun
things like raspberry pies this is great
this is a raspberry pie and this is an
internet of things enabled one we've
actually got some C code on this that is
talking to this temperature sensor so
what is that temperature sensor look
like let me switch over to some code
here and show you this is some C code
inside a visual studio this is the low
level stuff C code makes your eyes blur
a little bit sometimes what you need to
know people who are wearing suits is
you've got I Oh T hub and you have Azure
devices so the takeaway there is that
that's cloud enabled but for the
developers that think this is crazy
I want you to notice that we've actually
got a visual studio plug-in to do remote
debugging of things like raspberry PI's
in Visual Studio so whether it be high
level updating hundreds of thousands of
objects or whether it's low level and
doing remote gdb debugging
to a Raspberry Pi we can do that now
let's talk about my system let me bring
back to the slides here for a moment
this is overwhelming it's a Shuren right
it's all these icons what's going on
there's all these people they're doing
all of these things well let's talk
about me and the system that I'm
building that's me and my shirt I've got
my band the band goes to Microsoft
health that goes ultimately into storage
my glucose system actually goes up into
an API and I pull that data in as well
because that's personal to me I've got
my heart rate over years I've got my
blood sugar over years what can I do
with that well I'm gonna show you some
visualizations some graphs I'm gonna
plug things into office and see if Azure
machine learning can answer some really
interesting questions about me and my
health and this is all live and this is
all real so let's come back over to this
machine here this is a system called
night Scout this is an open source node
application that is running in Azure and
this talks to my CGM like a continuous
glucose meter and I want you to point
out a couple of things here this is the
first presentation today and this is now
that is a real-time system that is
showing my blood sugar and one of the
things that happens it's not just that I
drink orange juice which by the way I
have in case I pass out but also stress
stress dumps glucose into the system and
this is just one of the things that I
have to deal with when I'm managing my
blood sugar and actually yeah I'm not
sure if that guy can get a tight shot of
that but this just popped up and it will
appear in the MacLeod it's warning me
that I'm now going high so in a second
the website is also been announced and
then I'll get a notification on my band
and on my watch and then people are
going to start calling me and then it'll
be scary
so up there we go notifications just
showed up so let's talk about how that
notification did in fact shut up so I've
got a band and this is some data in the
cloud how do I see that well it turns
out that the band can talk some
JavaScript I can take JavaScript out of
the band this is up at developer
Microsoft band comm you may have a band
you may not be a programmer but you may
have a URL that points to some
JavaScript or a blog or some XML and you
want to create a tile I made one for my
blood sugar so now I've got Knight Scout
on my system and I can see my blood
sugar right there what's interesting
about this is that I can use this visual
designer but I can also look at the
manifest directly and look at this
that's the code there sugar is high if
it's over 150 notification and then I'll
get a notification on my band this could
be done with a build server whether you
want to water your plants whatever that
is the personal internet of things and
that's what makes me happy but let's
think about this once my blood sugar is
in the cloud what else can I do with it
well I can send notifications my wife
can be concerned she's probably gonna be
calling in a moment to make sure that
I'm okay but this is part of the process
remember how I said I want to analyze
this stuff in Excel well it turns out
that I'm not very good at VBA Visual
Basic for applications right remember
that 80% of the world's business logic
runs in Excel I think that's a fact and
in fact there's an Excel jsapi
JavaScript API for Excel I can write an
add-in for Excel in JavaScript using the
web technologies that I know how to make
so we went and we made the the Hansel
sugars project and I'm gonna actually
show you some of the code here in just a
second there we go tada where we gonna
populate a table in Excel using
JavaScript using web technologies and
what is exciting for this exciting for
me about this is that I didn't know how
to do this before you see I'm a web
developer
but now I can go in here and put in my
target range hit refresh and now we're
gonna go and talk to the backend system
and then dynamically populate a chart in
Excel of my blood sugar that I could
then send to a doctor or my wife you
have to think about the sense of power
and enthusiasm that I suddenly have for
Excel which I did not care about before
I'm a web developer that's a web
application in the pain there and it
works in Excel online and one day it'll
work in Excel on an iPad like once you
learn how to use one Lego piece you can
then plug them into other stuff so it's
extremely heartening for me to be able
to do this and again if my blood sugar
isn't interesting to you and it
shouldn't be maybe some hobby of yours
or something at work or some inspiration
will come into your mind and you'll
think about how you can plug these
things in together that's what's so
exciting about this so I've got all my
blood sugar in real time I can collect
it into the cloud what else can I do
with it let's switch over to another
machine here I'm going to switch over to
a a Mac this is a Mac running vs code
and this particular Mac is got the code
to collect my data from the oops from
the health API okay
so we're gonna go and make restful api
calls be standard api calls off to
Microsoft health with vs. where the
banned data is stored because this is
the thing that's so important
it's my data it's my heartbeat data my
blood sugar is my data so once I have
that ownership of that data what can I
do with it I can plug in that data and
do different stuff so let me see if I
can jump out of here this has gone full
screen full screen can be a little
confusing there we go I'm going to take
that data I'm going to pull it out of
the Microsoft Health API and this is a
storage Explorer the reason I wanted to
show you this on a Mac is that this is
the Azure storage Explorer that we've
released that is cross-platform we're
looking at the CSV files of my blood
sugar data as it's sitting in the cloud
I'm assuming my heart rate data
pardon me I'm gonna hit download I'm
gonna throw that on the desktop watch
the right side now I have power now I
have control now I've got ahold of that
and I can run an analysis on it now in
this case I just brought it down to the
desktop I could do some test
notification about my blood sugar I've
got a neck doing some analysis here but
maybe I want to do that analysis in a
more sophisticated way when you start
thinking about the Internet of Things
you start thinking about huge amounts of
data I saw that has my heart rate well
how much is that well I mean is it an
average over a minute over five minutes
over hours this is a huge amount of data
my blood sugar is doing 3 or 400 data
sets every single day over the course of
a year this adds up to huge amounts of
information
this is we're simply putting it into
Excel and sorting and going on it looks
like a pattern isn't gonna be enough for
me I'm gonna need to do some machine
learning I want to find out about why
does my blood sugar go up when I'm
stressed out what does Thanksgiving
dinner look like maybe I can answer
those questions with machine learning so
I'm going to switch back over to this
this system here and what I've what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna jump into here this
is a machine learning kind of algorithm
that I put together an experiment if you
will to pull in data from the heart rate
on the right there from Azure storage
and the glucose data and I'm going to
come up with a stress index I'm
inventing a number it's the Hanselman
stress index and we're going to load
that data up and what we're gonna do is
clean it up do a little bit of
normalization do a couple of analysis
run some statistics and then come up
with a data set that the result is going
to be a time-based data set of my stress
okay so that's kind of interesting it's
pretty powerful though that but I need
to see it over time so how would I
express this over time and what value is
there in it well there is this API in
office 365
and all of Microsoft called the graph
API at the Microsoft graph graph
Microsoft comm and this allows me to
pull my information remember how I keep
it stressing it's mine my blood sugar
and my heart rate and my calendar and my
email I want a unified API to go and get
those things and the graph API you can
see there at graph Microsoft comm allows
me to make those requests so what if we
looked at my blood sugar and my stress
and my heart rate over time overlaid on
an office 365 calendar that could give
us some insights and again I don't know
anything about this stuff this is what's
so important and why as a developer this
is so exciting
I know JavaScript I know the web I know
c-sharp and now I'm feeling comfortable
about the cloud but when I say when I
see hey this is an an API and it uses
JavaScript and I can access all of the
graph data and Microsoft that's amazing
that's that's a playground of excitement
so I can go and build this get a start
date and an end date this is all
standard parsing of JSON parsing of
JavaScript all using the graph API let's
go and see what kind of a question that
that could potentially answer so here is
my calendar the stress index as it
applies to calendar data let's click on
one this is all real okay so here's
glucose is updating I can see the
different rehearsals and I can see heart
rate and sugar and stress changing I can
actually run queries and see the result
of that machine learning and ask the
really burning question the question
that we all have which is what is the
most stressful person in my life that is
causing these problems and raising my
blood sugar
it is a really really great time to be a
developer I can put stuff like this
together now it is an extremely personal
time it is extremely empowering time you
know how we keep telling everyone you
know teach the kids how to code everyone
needs to learn how to code that's a part
of it but we need to teach people how to
think about systems and how to plug
stuff in I don't know the graph API but
it made sense because it's using open
web technologies I don't know a lot of
open-source systems but I'm learning
those libraries and I'm bringing them in
because they're using open tech dotnet
is open-source if I have questions I can
look at the docs but I can also read the
source maybe I want to run a Mac maybe I
want an iPhone I can build those systems
with the mobile tools and Visual Studio
maybe I want to run on Ubuntu then I can
use Visual Studio code and I can write
angular and I can use go I can run those
things in the azure cloud it is such an
exciting and powerful time to be a
developer right now I really hope that
you have as much fun building stuff as
we have had building this stuff for you
and I really look forward to seeing what
you all can build thank you very much I
have a really great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
