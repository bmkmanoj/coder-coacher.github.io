this talk is about my learning journey
through functional programming my
introduction to F be a bit of a
background so I have I've done front-end
development before so I have a bit of a
mobile development background and then
in re I get the chance to join another
team and I chose this back-end team with
highly competitive people doing
functional programming in Scala
so the code base that we have in that
team is basically a lot of functional
code and I kind of look up to the stream
and was really excited to join them so I
had this post situation going on where
I'm really excited and keen to learn FB
but also very anxious because the FB
community to me at that point in time
was a bit elite a bit secretive I don't
know what they do sort of thing so to
begin with like hided my learning
journey go so how did I start learning
it it started as usual with any
programming language that you do I
started with books I did a lot of video
tutorials thousands of blog posts and
also even YouTube videos YouTube
tutorials because why not
and my learning graph kind of looked
like that not good there was a lot of
ups and downs and it basically sort of
reflected my interest in learning FB I
would I would learn or grasp a concept
and then I would be at the peak and I
would be excited to go back to the
company start using what I've learned
and then I'd come across someone who
says something like oh you don't mean
Mona Mona
you mean monoids so they're different
things like there's there's this jogger
on and this language that people use
when talking about FB that kindness
immediately attacks your confidence and
it goes it goes down immediately so I
sort of sat down and tried to identify
where I was having problems with like
my learning Johnny and I came up with
these with these points and the first
glaring glaringly obvious fact about F
is the jargon that they use and it's
sort of like all over the place it
sounds a lot like a complex mathematical
theory that you're trying to learn it's
not but you're immediately put off
because of the word and then you also
have this thing where you're trying to
identify what that word means for
example what is functional programming
if you if you look at look it up online
you'll find millions of definitions for
EFI and they some of them are
conflicting and they all are very
verbose and very hard to visualize and I
feel like most of the definitions online
are more about the characteristics of
EFI rather than what it is actually so
this is one of the things that put me
off and it's the same thing with any any
of the jargon that you actually find an
FPU you look for a definition you pretty
much find thousands of it and you can't
understand what it says you can't
implement them the next thing was as I
said before my the team's codebase had a
lot of functional code in it so I used
to learn something and go back and look
at it which and and try to read it try
to understand what that code did and
this was a bit problematic for me
because f is not really easy to read for
a beginner it has a lot of hidden things
in it at least for a from a beginner
perspective that's how it feels like so
not easy reading and that's why the the
confidence level on the learning just
plummets another thing I figured out was
the slow learning aspect of it because
when I started with the team I expected
to grasp FP concepts in like one month
that didn't happen it took way more than
that so that expectation that you're
going to be
you're going to master FB is that sort
of works against you in learning FB so
at this point I was I was ready to give
up I I sort of felt like I was I'm an
idiot I can't I can't do Fe this is not
for me but so the main problem here was
like I would understand a concept from
the book or the video tutorial but I
could not implement it on a real real
world application sort of way I could
not implement anything to all contribute
to my company codebase that's what I was
having a problem so at this point I
actually did ask for help but luckily I
work for a company re a group in
Melbourne and they have this very large
FP community that's really friendly we
have an active flack channel that that
we there's discussions every day on it
there are 128 members and we're always
discussing FP concept and the beauty
about it is you could you could ask a
stupid question well not a stupid
question but a simple question or big in
our question and you would immediately
get help from them people are willing to
explain it to you to pair with you to
make you understand the concept so
they're really helped so I had this so I
got a couple of mentors I had one mentor
who suggested this to me why don't you
do a site project but do do a game a
simple game sort of thing so the
difference between doing any side
project was a game like any mathematical
project was it was a game is that in a
game your interest is engaged and you
can always evolve it evolve it to
include different scenarios different
rules you can have different players
sort of thing and it doesn't have to be
a complex you know role-playing game
sort of thing it's it's it could be a
very simple thing so this is what what I
did and the game that I chose to start
working on from scratch was the cousin
both game and I actually came up with
this
now I saw this app on an Android app
store they have the same game called
cousin balls on App Store you could
probably check it out it's a very simple
game
it's a guessing game so basically you
have like a secret number and you're
supposed to guess it sort of thing so
this is what I'm trying to achieve with
my learning functional programming
aspect of it maybe you could do
something similar something simple but
equally effective so as I said this
beside projects which would you do like
a game really keeps it interesting you
you really want to work on it the next
time and it doesn't frustrate you
another aspect of this sort of learning
is that it encourages the philosophy of
learn when needed mostly because when
you look at books or video tutorials you
have a structure in which you learn
something you have if you look at the
index page that's exactly how you go
about learning it but this way of
learning you're actually going to need a
functional programming concept to use
and then you go go find out what it is
you look at how it's being used and then
you use it so this is more consolidated
learning and I think it's really helpful
for people especially beginners to FB to
do mostly because learning FB is not
exactly the same as learning another
computer language if you're learning
another programming language it's it's
it has a lot to do with swapping out
syntaxes or you know just just modifying
your concept but FB is more than that so
once I started doing it I had to revisit
this page where what is functional
programming so if you ask people about
this they'll all have different answers
so my answer is probably different too
because functional programming for me is
a programming mindset it's it's the way
you think about good and the one thing
about FB is that it forces you to think
about code
it has this unique feature where when
you look at a functional code you see
that it's about what that code does it's
not about how that codes being done
because that's that part is a bit hidden
which is what makes reading functional
code a bit difficult so so what happens
to a programmer using functional
functional programming is that you you
have to focus on a small aspect of your
of your function of what you want your
code to do you think about it really
intensely and then you write the code
it's not it's not easy and it takes a
lot of practice at least for me to
actually get to the stage where I'm
confidently smashing out functions never
happened but yeah so that's that's the
way I feel functional programming is so
why do we care so I feel like this is
also something that I can't just tell
you and expect you to accept this is
more about you practicing functional
code and then realizing why what are the
advantages to it because anyone can say
it's clean its elegant it's the number
of lines are smaller or it's
modularization and things like that but
these are my reasons but if you really
want to understand why you would use
functional code you have to try it try
writing a simple game program and then
see see if you like it or not I'm pretty
certain 100% certain you will so a few
things that stood out for me while
learning functional programming I'd like
to share them with you you'd probably
come across the same thing the first
thing was this mutability and
immutability so yeah so what happens is
like in immutability you basically have
an area and if you want to add elements
to it you create a new array and then
with the updated elements but you keep
the old area so that's sort of like
immutability so why do we use
immutability and mutability so I might
get some opposition on this but I
you when you're doing mutable when
you're dealing with mutable data you're
leaving your data unprotected sort of
you're leaving it a bit open-ended
because that data has the opportunity to
mutate into something especially when
your code is expanding and the thing as
a programmer is you might not be aware
of it so when that when that happens it
usually leads to like bugs and it's it's
a pain to debug so that's what the
immutability aspect really helps because
you're kind of like setting boundaries
or you know closing that sort of
scenario saying that this is your this
data will not change so at any point in
time even if the code expands you kind
of know what your data is going to be so
that that was really striking to me and
the next thing this is this was also
very obvious to beginners in FP is the
recursion aspect of it where did all the
four loops go you see this everywhere so
I had so the problem I had with
recursion is writing recursion I could
understand it I can read it but writing
a recursion is a bit different because
you when you look at blog posts or book
books and read books you kind of come
across recursion examples as
mathematical you get like factorial or
Fibonacci series and that makes sense
but when you're looking at your
real-world application you want to use
recursion that's where I usually get
stuck so I kind of learned this new
trick it's basically the way you think
in recursion and it's it's sort of like
this you have a collection of data data
elements that you want to do something
with if you write a function that takes
that in as an input and you do two
things the first thing is what do you do
with the last element you write an
ending argument or function or return
something in this case you're returning
accumulated and then you have another
state where you're dealing with the rest
of the elements and this is usually
where the recursion
call is also happening and then finally
you just returned the function right so
this is like a trick that I learned to
actually implement tail recursion and it
works so maybe you could use that this
is another thing I see a lot of this in
my company code base a lot of one-liners
and I remember the first time I actually
looked at it this was one of those
things that kind of like I gave me that
sinking feeling because I literally went
I have I I know what it's trying to do
but I have no idea how it's doing it
it's it's doing something with a list
its mapping it an average reducing it
and then combining it to get another
list or something so but the thing about
one line is is the more you you do
functional code the easier it becomes to
read it and easy it is to implement it
so me personally the first one-liner I
did was the reading from the console and
then converting converting it to two to
a list two digits so this this is an
example of how something can look
intimidating but it's not actually
and the more you more you learn about it
more you think about it you sort of get
into the habit of writing it it's also
very compact where you need it and
that's why I think more type list sort
of thing comes in and when one line is
get too busy there's there's another way
you can write it and that's using for
comprehensions I did not know about
whole comprehensions before so that's
another thing that I learned so this is
actually people talk about map filter a
lot but I want to talk about this zip
tool which is which is an FP tool and
this is rather special because this is
the first time I actually used an FP
concept while I was doing the cousin
both game the first time I used it
because I needed it and that's how the
learning started this is how the
learning started I had this
a secret number and this guest number
and I wanted to find this element that
had that was in the same position to see
if they matched and zip actually helped
with that so this is an example of how
how you actually learn and consolidate
your Fe concepts while doing the game
because it's interesting and it's very
enjoyable to do okay so I don't know
about you guys but for me this is like
one of the major things about Fe so this
is like a C++ code that prints out the
happy birthday lyrics I attempted to do
it in Scala and that's what it looks
like it's literally one line and for me
that's really exciting so taking a look
at how my learning is now compared to
everything everything that I've done all
the all the pain that I've gone through
and also the help that I've received
from different people how's it going now
it's going really well and you can see
this like this it's a slow learning
progress but the interest is more and
more every day and the more you actually
get into it you know cryptic concepts
like monads or applicatives they don't
scare you anymore you know you you can
handle them so it's sort of like this
building block strategy where you kind
of start with a smaller concept and then
you you start building building into a
bigger you know learning arsenal which
can deal with like complex data so it
really works so these are like the
helpers that I have for you these are
the things that I actually went through
and maybe you've gone through the same
reading thousands of books I remember I
was sitting at a place and I had these
people kept sending me references to
links and things that they found really
helpful and I kept looking at all of
them I think I read almost all that
everyone's given me it doesn't help
because it's it's sort of like
your memory about something and then
it's riding on top of it
nothing is retained and in the end at
the end of the day it's just like a
confusing spaghetti bowl video tutorials
there there is amazing
good very good courses on Coursera about
functional programming and Scala Haskell
but there was this one time where I was
like looking at this video tutorial that
was 15 minutes long and I washed it for
five times not on the same day thank God
but I washed it for five times and and
that's when I realized it wasn't working
and I watched it for five times because
people told me it was good so I was like
is there something wrong with me this
this is like people are talking about
this so much but then you you look at
the people who are talking about it and
they've been doing FP for a while so
they feel it's good but it might be a
different story for a beginner a
complete beginner to FP so and then
another thing was when I joined I
accidentally kind of walked into this
advanced FB talk it said on the note
that it that was an advanced if we talk
I kind of ignored it still went in bad
idea because it was one hour of me
thinking I am never going to get FP
again only because you know it was
really hard to understand I couldn't I
could probably get maybe ten words in
that whole lecture so maybe don't do
that okay so this is something I'm
really guilty of when I started FBI
immediately started looking up what a
monad was and that's a really bad idea
it immediately puts you off so probably
don't becae cryptic cryptic concepts
like monads and stick to something
simpler okay so I do this too I get I
look at the literal definitions off
terms because I'm a researcher so I have
this thing where I need to like research
where the background
every term is from and that's a bad idea
again because they have conflicting
definitions and they don't actually tell
you how to use it sure there are like
examples about how to use it but the
thing is like when you want to use that
concept to your application that's why
you run into a problem so that's what I
went through and expecting the learning
to be fast I I feel like that also
something I'm guilty of I expected to
grasp FB cons I'd like it's only math I
mean how hard can it be
it is hard it's not math so that's
another thing that you probably
shouldn't do it's going to be slow and
the last thing is me trying to always
contribute to their company codebase and
that doesn't help because it's already
functional and you can't and when I'm
trying to add something there's like all
these all these people sending or me
saying you're doing it wrong
so maybe don't do that so what did help
games I cannot emphasize how great
programming games is to learn functional
programming it it it gives you like the
sense of freedom where you actually want
to go back home and do this do this
thing where you're learning where you're
doing games you're very interested in it
you want to try out different things and
you can use the the learn when needed
approach because you run into something
and then you want to use NFP concept and
then you use it this way that that
concept that you're using you kind of
consolidate into your brain again start
with the simpler concepts like how to
pass a function into a function or maybe
even recursion so start with like simple
concepts and then you can slowly build
your Fe arsenal and the next two are
something that really helped me mentor
sessions and discussions people in the
FP community are really really fun to
talk to and they're very friendly and
they're always willing to have a
discussion on
concept so I'd encourage you to talk to
someone who's already practicing FP if
you're if you're keen on learning so
hopefully my talk talk has actually
inspired you to start learning FPE i've
got got a few resources i'm getting
these slides will be online at some
point so i can add some more some things
that i actually did find useful thanks
