introduction
as Patrick said I work on a v8 team at
Google v8 is the JavaScript engine
that's used in Google Chrome but also in
other invaders like nodejs
and I brought v8 stickers so if you like
JavaScript or if you like v8
specifically come ping me later and I
have plenty of stickers today I would
like to give you some performance advice
for your JavaScript code but before we
get to the actual advice we're gonna
look at some JavaScript engine internals
together and I work on v8 so I'm gonna
be talking about some optimization
mechanisms that we have specifically in
v8 however the performance advice that
will extract from this knowledge does
not just apply to v8 and Chrome it
applies to all JavaScript engines and
all web browsers and I think that's
really important and in fact that's not
just my opinion the entire v8 team is on
board with this just last week we
published this blog post together with
the chakra team at Microsoft chakra is
Microsoft's JavaScript engine and the
underlying message here is that for
developers it doesn't make sense to
write JavaScript code that is optimized
for just a single JavaScript engine by
using specific performance hacks instead
it makes a lot more sense to write
modern idiomatic JavaScript that just
makes sense without worrying about
performance too much and that way the
JavaScript engines can make sure that
your code runs more quickly it's quite a
paradox because by not wondering about
performance too much when you're writing
the code the end result might actually
be faster now let's talk about some of
those v8 internals although these
internals are I mean there are internals
right then what's in a word so they're
never directly exposed to JavaScript
developers but they help explain why
certain code patterns are faster than
others and that's why I'd like to dive
into them today specifically I would
like to talk about one thing that we
call elements kinds in v8 and I know
this is a little bit of a strange term
there's like a double plural there it
sounds a little weird but this is just a
name that we use and it kind of makes
sense and I hope you will agree at the
end of this presentation that the name
kind of makes sense it goes back to the
fact that JavaScript objects can have
arbitrary properties associated with
them the names of object properties can
contain arbitrary characters any
alphanumeric character even the weird
special Unicode characters like emoji
for example but one of the interesting
cases that a JavaScript engine can
choose to optimize for our properties
whose names are purely numeric and more
specifically array in Nexus in v8 array
indexes are handled in a special way
although in many circumstances they
behave just like other object properties
but v8 s--
chooses to store them separately from
those non numeric properties for
optimization purposes internally v8 even
gives these properties a special name
they're called elements so think of it
this way
objects have properties that map to
values and arrays have indexes that map
to elements it's just the names that we
use so whenever you're running
JavaScript code v8 keeps track of what
kind of elements each array contains
this information allows v8 to optimize
any operations on the array specifically
for this type of element for example
when you call reduce or map or for each
on an array v8 can optimize that call
based on what kind of elements the array
contains take this array for example
what kind of elements does it contain
well if you would use the typeof
operator in JavaScript it will tell you
that all the elements in the array are
numbers at the JavaScript language level
that's all you get
javascript doesn't distinguish between
integers floats or doubles but under the
hood behind the scenes in v8 itself we
can make a more fine-grained distinction
so the elements kind for this array is
packed my elements will get to the
packet part in a minute so ignore that
for now but for now focus on the my part
smile is the term that we use in v8 to
refer to the particular format we use to
store small integers that's what it
stands for so it just means this is an
array of integers later adding a
floating-point number to the same array
transitions it to more generic elements
kinds in this case it becomes packed
double elements now adding a string
literal for example to the array changes
the elements current once again
v8 assigns and elements guides to each
array the elements kind of an array is
not set in stone it can change at
runtime as we just saw in this case we
transitioned all the way from packets my
elements to packed elements so let's
recap so far we've seen three distinct
elements kinds there's one for smiles or
integers one for doubles and one for
regular elements you can note here that
double is a more general variant of
smile and regular elements are another
generalization on top of doubles so the
set of numbers that can be represented
as a smile is a subset of the numbers
that can be represented as a double but
what's important here is that elements
kinds transitions can only happen in one
direction you go from specific types at
the top to more general types at the
bottom once we reach packed elements
which is the one at the bottom we cannot
go back up to packed double elements
because that would be more specific so
going back to that array that we had
before it has five elements in it now
what happens if we assign a value to an
index that is far outside the bounds of
this array for example if we assign a
value at position nine in the array well
this creates holes in the array at
positions five until eight the array is
now sparse or holy as we like to call it
on the VI team now creating holes in an
array downgrades the element kind to its
holy variant we went from packet
elements to holey elements in this
example and there are other ways to
create holes for example if you use
delete on an index property that would
also create a hole and there's many more
ways where this could happen but why
does v8 care so much whether there are
holes in an array why do we have these
separate elements kinds for them well
let's find out together by taking a look
at an example pretend for a second that
you're a JavaScript engine and you're
getting the element at index eight out
of this array what is the value for the
element at index eight okay you're a
JavaScript engine you can't just give
the answer right away you have to do
some work first so to answer this
question the first thing we do is we
start off
a bounced check on the array index eight
is this index between zero inclusive and
the number of items in the array
exclusive in this case the bounced check
succeeds but we still cannot answer the
question of what the result is more work
is needed now v8 looks up the property
named eight on the array itself but in
this case that property does not exist
all that's there is a hole so we still
don't have enough information to
actually answer the question so we have
to dig deeper because the property is
not present on the array itself v8 has
to grow up the prototype chain until
either a value is found or the prototype
chain ends so first it checks a raid of
prototype which is the prototype of any
array and it doesn't have a property
named 8 defined on it so at this point
we still do not know what the answer is
we have to continue to follow the
prototype chain now the prototype of
array prototype is object prototype so
that's the next thing we check we check
if the property exists the property
named 8 and in this case it doesn't
exist there in this case the prototype
chain ends after reaching object of
prototype but it could be longer in case
someone extended it which is totally
possible in JavaScript you can extend
native prototypes although I personally
think it's a very bad idea
but remember we're all JavaScript
engines so we have to support this kind
of code because it can happen now
because the chain ends here we cannot
continue searching for the property
which means we can now finally answer
our question the hole at position 8 in
the array is undefined tada
well from the JavaScript engines
perspective that's a lot of work just to
get an undefined value right
compare that to a packed array which is
an array that is guaranteed to have no
holes in it if the array index is within
bounds then the engine can already
return the value there is no need for
those other checks or for those
expensive lookups on the prototype chain
it's much simpler now even if we get a
property that does exist on a holy array
then the engine still needs to check
the property exists first so va checks
if the index is within the bounds of the
array and it is but it still doesn't
have enough information to answer the
question at this point we must check if
the property exists on the array itself
just in case there is a hole at this
position because we know that this array
contains holes in this case the property
does exist so we can finally return the
value so if the property didn't exists
it would be a hole and we would be back
in the previous situation and we'd have
to do the whole prototype chain lookup
which is very expensive and slow so this
is the very best case scenario for a
holey array and it's still one more
operation compared to a packed array
that is why in general packed arrays are
preferred over holy arrays especially in
performance sensitive situations
operations on packed arrays can be
optimized more aggressively than
operations on holy arrays for optimal
performance you should avoid creating
holes whenever possible now going back
to that list of elements kinds that we
saw earlier we already knew that there
are smiles and doubles and regular
elements and that you can transition
from smiles to doubles and two regular
elements however we now saw that there
are actually two flavors of each of
those elements kinds there's the packed
version and there's a holy version and
we can also transition from a packed
kind to its holy counterpart so instead
of these two pyramids it might be easier
to think of this elements kind thing as
a lattice and that is in fact how v8
implements the system around elements
kinds and the transitions between them
more concretely it looks something like
this so we have our my double and
regular elements and each of those comes
in two flavors packed and holy now in
total v8 currently distinguishes about
twenty different elements kinds these
are just the most common and the most
important ones but each of those
elements kinds comes with its own set of
possible optimizations now tree of this
lattice you can only transition
downwards it's kind of similar to that
pokemon blue tower puzzle where you step
on the tiles containing arrows and then
your character moves in only that
direction it's very similar like that
you can all
follow the arrows throughout this
lattice you can only go downwards so
this means that once a single
floating-point number is added to an
array it is marked as double even if you
later remove the double for example and
if it later consists of integers only
there's no way to go back to the more
specific type and similarly once a hole
is created in an array it is marked as
holy forever even if you fill the holes
later now in general more specific
elements guides enable more fine-grained
optimizations the further down the
elements kindness in this lattice the
slower manipulations of that object
might be now for optimal performance you
should avoid needlessly transitioning
between any of these types you should
try to stick to the most specific type
that's applicable to your situation for
each unique elements kind v8 can apply
specific optimizations when performing
operations on the array whenever you're
using for each for example v8 can
optimize that call based on that
information it has available about the
elements kind we can have one set of for
each optimizations for packets my
elements and that a completely different
set of optimizations for packed double
elements and over time we can add more
and more optimizations and in fact if
you look at chrome 59 this is when we
launched a new pipeline in v8 we had all
this magma mechanisms in place but we
didn't really use it yet for for each
specifically we didn't have specific
optimizations for each of those elements
kinds but then a couple of versions
later in chrome 61 we had optimized for
each in turbofan or optimizing compiler
for all packed elements kinds only the
holy ones were still not specifically
optimized and in fact a couple of weeks
ago we launched Chrome 64 which now
optimizes all these different elements
kinds so we have specific optimizations
for each of these cases and this is just
for each what about the other array
built-ins
well we do the same thing for array dot
prototype up map for filter for sum for
every four reduce for reduce writes and
that's almost all the array built-ins
there are isn't it
well there's two more that I can think
of and these are a little bit special
they are called find and find index and
yeah they're a little bit frustrating
from JavaScript engine developers
standpoint the reason for that is that
if you look this look at the spec
closely these are the only two methods
that require turning a hole in the
source array into an explicit undefined
value and for technical reasons that
makes it very complicated for us to
optimize this specifically for the holy
double elements case however as I
mentioned we're working on this and in
the future we will only be adding more
and more of these optimizations so
someday soon it will look like this for
all array methods we're getting really
close now now let's look at another
example this piece of code here creates
an array of length tree but what does it
contain yep the array just has three
holes in it the array is sparse at this
point so the elements kind is wholly
smile' elements because that's the most
specific possibility given the
information that's currently available
now let's assign a value to position
zero in the array that's just a string
value which is not an integer so the
kinds transitions to holy elements now
let's assign a value to position one in
the array it's again a string value so
the elements kind remains unchanged and
finally resign a value to the last
position in the array at this point all
three positions in the array are filled
so the array is packed and no longer
sparse however we cannot transition to a
more specific elements kind such as
packed elements the kind remains holy
elements once an array is marked as Holi
its Holi forever and that makes me a
little bit sad in this scenario of
course if you just want to add three
items to the array and you know the
values ahead of time a better solution
is to use an array literal like we're
doing here
but if you don't know all the values
ahead of time there is still a way to
avoid creating a holy array you could
start off with an array containing some
of the values that you know I had
time and then later push the values to
it that way holes are avoided and the
array will never get marked as holy and
this approach ensures that javascript
engines can optimize any future
operations on the array properly life is
easier without holes JavaScript engines
can deal with packed arrays more
efficiently so in general if you need to
perform lots of operations on an array
avoid creating holes in it and similarly
here's another piece of advice you
should avoid reading beyond the length
of an array if you have an array with
two items in it the first item will be
at position zero the second one will be
at position one but there will be
nothing at position two so it doesn't
make sense to read that item at position
two because there's nothing there this
is very similar to hitting a hole it's
not the same thing but it's very similar
so don't write your loops like this this
loop reads all the elements in the array
and then one more it only stops once it
hits that undefined or null element and
I didn't actually make up this code
example there are some libraries that
use this in the wild but this is just as
bad as hitting a hole in an array in
this case v8 bounce tag fails the check
to see if the property on the array is
present fails and then we need to look
up the prototype chain again which as we
now know is very slow so don't do this
and instead keep your loops simple and
just keep iterating until you hit the
last element in my opinion this code is
more readable than the example at the
top as well so that's another benefit
you get for free now of course there are
other ways of iterating two arrays
nowadays you can also use for off and
this works whenever the collection
you're looping over is iterable so it's
not just true for arrays it also works
for things like node lists in the DOM
and this is my favorite way of iterating
or looping over arrays or anything
that's a collection but yet another way
for arrays specifically it would be to
use for each and the good news today is
that either for each or for off or
writing your own for loop all three of
those alternatives are equally fast in
v8 now it is so you can just choose
whatever you prefer you can write code
that make
most sense to you and performance is no
longer a factor in making that decision
which i think is really great because I
just got to use for off all the time now
so avoid reading beyond the length of
the array doing so is just as bad as
hitting a hole now before we move on to
some more performance advice here's the
fun facts javascript has two zeros
there's the regular zero which is
positive but there's also a negative
zero and although these values are
strictly equal to each other they do
behave differently in some cases and you
can verify this by using objects if you
compare them it actually tells you that
they're not equal to each other because
they behave differently it means that
JavaScript engines also have to store
these two values in a different way and
the reason I'm telling you this is
because this has an impact on elements
kinds another piece of advice that I
hinted at earlier is to avoid
transitioning to a less specific
elements kind whenever you can and this
is actually much harder than it seems
for example just adding minus 0 to this
array of small integers is enough to
transition it kind to packed double
elements any future operations on this
array will now be optimized in a
completely different way than they would
be for smize which may not be very good
for performance that's just one more
reason to avoid the use of minus 0 in
general unless you need to explicitly
differentiate between those two values
in your code but I think you probably
don't the same thing is true for the
values nom and infinity these are
represented as doubles so adding a
single num or to an array of smile'
elements is enough to transition it to
double elements if you're planning on
performing lots of operations on an
array of integers then consider
normalizing minus 0 and blocking nan or
under an undefined and infinity values
when initializing the array this way the
array sticks to the packets my elements
kind this one time normalization cost
can be worth the later optimizations and
in fact if you're doing mathematical
operations on an array of numbers you
should probably look into using typed
arrays v8 has specialized elements kinds
for those as well and
they're kind of built for this thing so
consider using them in general if you
need to perform lots of operations on an
array try sticking to an element's kind
that's as specific as possible so that
v8 can optimize it as best as possible
some objects in JavaScript especially in
the Dom look like a race although they
aren't really proper arrays it's
possible to create these array like
objects yourself which is what we're
doing here
this object has a length and it supports
indexed element access just like a real
array but it lacks array methods like
for each on its prototype it is still
possible to call these array generics on
this object though here we're calling
the array for each built in on the array
like object and it works as expected
however this is slower than calling for
each on a proper array which you now
know is highly optimized in v8 if you
plan on using array built-ins on this
object more than once then consider
turning it into an actual array
beforehand so that v8 can optimize those
operations based on the elements kind
and here we're doing just that by using
slice and of course there is a one time
conversion cost of making the actual
call to slice but this cost can be worth
two later optimizations especially if
you plan on performing lots of
operations on the array one specific
example of such a case is the arguments
object this is an array like object but
it's not a real array when you call
array built in such as for each on it it
works but it won't be fully optimized
the way it could be for a proper array
now in this particular case yes 2015 had
this new feature called rest parameters
and they can really help you out in this
scenario they produce proper arrays that
can be used instead of the array like
arguments object in a very elegant way
and nowadays I think there is no more
good reason to use the arguments object
directly this is much more elegant and
more performant as well this is not a
real crocodile and it's not going to
have the same performance as a real
crocodile and the same thing goes for
arrays in general avoid
like objects whenever possible and use
proper arrays instead now after all this
talk about elements kinds you may be
wondering how to identify the elements
kind of a given array this might come in
handy when you're debugging a
performance issue or just when you're
trying to get a better understanding of
what I've been talking about now luckily
whenever v8 is built from source it
produces a binary that you can run from
your command line the binary is called
d8 and no one on the VA team really
knows what the D stands for some people
say it stands for debug others think
it's a developer shell there's some
discussion about that but what I do know
is that the binary offers a read eval
print loop just like this similar to
what you get when you run node without
any arguments on your command line you
can type in some code and get it
evaluated and see the results right
there it's very similar to the dev tools
console in your browser now to find out
the elements kind of a given array we
can run a debug build of d8 we pass in
the allow native syntax flag and doing
so enables access to some internal v8
functionality from within JavaScript and
then we enter the command and that opens
up this read eval print loop The Wrap
hole and now we can start to enter some
code and run it directly in v8 so first
we create the array that we want to test
and then we call one of those special v8
functions on it in this case debug print
and you see how the name of that
function starts with a percentage sign
yeah that's not really valid JavaScript
we prefix all those special v8 internal
functions with the percentage sign for
exactly this reason we don't want people
to accidentally ship this into
production because it wouldn't work
anywhere else it only works in this
particular shell and it doesn't make
sense to try and use it in production
anyway it's only useful when you're
debugging something so anyway here we're
calling the buck print on our array and
that will print a lot of information
about the array even more than what you
see here but in this case what we're
looking for is the elements kind which
is listed on this line in this case the
elements kind is holy smile elements cow
that cow does not refer to the animal it
stands
for copy-on-write which is yet another
internal optimization but don't worry
about that for now that's a topic for
another presentation or maybe for the
Q&amp;amp;A if you're interested let's recap
we've explored what elements kinds are
and how they work
and as a result we were able to identify
some practical tips that can help us
boost performance avoid creating holes
in arrays don't access indexes beyond
the arrays length try to keep the
elements kinds of your array as specific
as possible by sticking to a single
value type for each array avoid using
array like objects and when you have to
use them consider converting them into
proper arrays before performing any
expensive operations on them now
although this presentation covered to
the eight internals these tips don't
just apply to v8 other JavaScript
engines can benefit from them as well
now there is one more thing that I would
like to clarify we had this example
before where you have an array and it
has some values in it and if you know
the values beforehand it makes sense to
hard-code them into an array literal
like this however things get more
interesting for larger arrays especially
if you don't know all the values
beforehand maybe your computing the
values dynamically or maybe you're
fetching them from an external API or
whatever if you know the length of the
array ahead of time it makes sense to
pass it to the array constructor like
this and we saw this example before now
doing so has one benefit a JavaScript
engine can pre allocate space for all
the 9001 elements the array will hold in
the backing store we looked at the
downside of this technique before which
is that the array gets marked as holy
because it contains holes at the moment
of its creation so just to give an
overview of the pros and cons of this
technique when you're using the array
constructor like this javascript engines
can pre allocate space for the correct
number of needed elements behind the
scenes and especially for larger range
containing thousands or hundreds of
thousands of elements this might speed
up the creation of the array however the
array gets marked as holy right from the
beginning resulting in potentially
slower array operations
compared to pact arrays so it's a trade
of that you're making do you want to
optimize the creation of the array or do
you want to optimize any operations on
the array now to avoid going holy we
looked at this pattern before where we
start with an empty array or an array
with some values and then later as we
dynamically compute more values we just
append them to it and this way we avoid
going holy for this array now when you
create an array the JavaScript engine
creates a buffer in the backing store
behind the scenes to hold all these
array elements and we're trying to be a
little bit clever about this for example
for an empty array we already initialize
a buffer of 16 elements so that it has
some room to grow whenever a new element
is added that doesn't fit the buffer any
more than we have to reallocate which is
we have to create a new buffer and then
copy over all the elements from the old
array and this is a slightly expensive
operation so if you start off with an
empty array and then push 9001 items to
it one by one
v8 will reallocate the buffer in the
backing store for the array elements a
total of 16 times which is not too bad
it's not like it reallocates every
single time you push but still for
larger arrays this might turn into a
performance issue so starting from an
empty array and then continuously
pushing to it ensures that we never
create any holes the array remains
packed meaning operations on the array
will be optimized in the best way
however the downside of continuously
pushing to an array like this is that
behind the scenes engines might need to
reallocate space as the array grows
larger for larger arrays this might slow
down the creation of the array so either
you choose to optimize the array
creation itself by using new array
passing in the number so it can be pre
allocated or you choose to optimize
later operations on the array and in
this case it makes sense to avoid holy
elements kinds it's a trade off for sure
and the choice that you make depends on
your exact use case it depends on what
you're doing exactly and this makes it
very difficult for a generic go
generator project such as bubble to make
this decision
they use some of these patterns all over
their codebase
in the code that they generates but they
cannot know what your intention is when
you're writing that code so might be
interesting to look into that and that's
it thank you for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
