so I'm Nick Cameron I'm from Mozilla I'm
quite involved in rust I'm I lead the
tools team I'm on the compiler team the
language team and the core team and
today this is meant to be kind of like
an intermediate level tutorial hopefully
you'll still be able to get something
out of it even if you're kind of a very
advanced programmer in rust or you've
never touched rust before
I'm not going to kind of introduce the
syntax but hopefully if you can program
in something you'll be able to follow
along I have an alternate title I played
around with this talk was kind of
thinking in rust and why I want you to
get what I want to help you do is to
really get into kind of like the mindset
of an experienced rust programmer so
you're not kind of like fighting the
rust compiler anymore you're kind of
like working with it and winning so the
it's it's mostly going to be kind of
like a chalk and talk kind of tutorial I
didn't realize we'd have this awesome
room where you could like actually get
some really proper work done but there
are gonna be like a few exercises but
don't worry if you don't have like a
rust kind of environment set up like
that you can do them on pen and paper if
you like and maybe even use them little
pile is gonna be cheating for some of
them ah
and I'll stop every now and again to ask
questions but please interrupt if if you
don't understand something or I can
clear something up for anyone don't wait
until the end because it's quite a long
tutorial and I'll have forgotten what I
was talking about okay so the tutorials
going to be in kind of two halves the
first half is gonna be kind of
programming in the small so like how to
write better function bodies how to
write better kind of like code the micro
kind of levels so gonna cover a few of
the really key fundamental data types
that every Russ program I'd like users
will have you Russ program users a lot
I'm gonna talk about some control flow
that's maybe not so familiar from other
languages and then I'm gonna tell you
how to like avoid
doing that and write better control flow
and by using kind of other constructs
and some methods on these types the
second half of the tutorial is going to
be kind of like programming in the large
although it's more kind of like the
medium are not so much going to touch on
kind of architectural issues so much is
kind of like design issues how to design
the kind of like data types and
abstractions in your programming how to
do error handling in your in your
program before we jump into all of that
though I just want to kind of like talk
about some principles that have gone
into kind of like the design of rust and
its libraries and that will kind of give
a themed this tutorial safe and fast
this is like the kind of the foundation
of everything in rust we we want to be
like a systems programming language and
that means it has to be fast like as
fast as C or C++ or even like
hundred-and assembly in a lot of cases
but it has to be safe memory safety is
like a big selling point and rust and in
this respect we kind of as safe as like
a higher-level garbage-collected
language but also safe in other ways we
want to like avoid giving you so many
options for shooting yourself in the
foot as you have in some programming
languages but really this is just like
this I mean this would be quite cool in
a language if you just have safe and
fast write but actually this is just
like the starting point this is like
what we consider like table stakes or
any kind of like new feature in the
language and what we want to kind of
like move towards is we want kind of the
the language as a whole to be kind of
economic we want it to be pleasurable to
write Russ code we want it to be easy to
understand when you're reading Russ code
or debugging Rast code and so that's
kind of like what we we want everything
in rust to be where we want to end up
and that's kind of like a theme for like
a lot of the parts of this tutorial is
I'm gonna start by showing you a kind of
a basic maybe naive
of doing something and rust and sure
it'll be safe and it'll be fast because
hopefully everything is but then I'm
gonna show you a better way to do it
which will give you kind of more concise
code and easier to read code and faster
to write code okay so let's start
throwing in the small so just to let you
know what's coming up the data types are
going to talk about option results and
iterator and I reckon that in any given
like Russ program maybe 50 percent of
the types that you ever use are these
three types basically so these are
really kind of like fundamental to rust
and in terms of control flow we're going
to touch on the the match statement
which is a kind of pattern matching
construct and iteration in just kind of
it in general I know we're not quite
gonna go in this order we're gonna kind
of zigzag between kind of data types and
control flow okay so I'm gonna start
with some C code so this is fairly
idiomatic C code although it's not
actually doing very much or C++ sorry
we're gonna take a point to stern
objects of type foo and of course we're
good programmers so we're going to do a
null check because there could be a null
pointer and if it's not then we're gonna
call a method on this object so what
could go wrong there's actually quite a
lot I mean it's pretty easy to forget
the null check I mean hopefully we're
all excellent programmers no one here
would ever forget doing a null check but
it's a pretty easy mistake to make if
you're a beginner and actually much more
common is you don't need the null check
because there is some invariant
established somewhere else but of course
it's code and code evolves and that
invariant changes and all of a sudden
you need a null check we didn't need it
before but like there's no indication in
the code that you need one and so nobody
adds it and so you're missing the null
check the this pointer variable could
get mutated I mean probably not in the
function as it's written at the moment
but you know if this were a more complex
function and especially if that variable
is aliased and/or it gets passed to some
other function it's actually pretty easy
for a variable to get mutated without it
being obvious from the from the code and
pointer could be like it could be non
null but it might be like otherwise
invalid so I mean it could it could just
be a random punch in numbers right or it
could point to memory that's already
been freed or to memory that's never
been initialized and your null check
isn't gonna catch that so here's what
the same code looks like in rust and you
don't have any of those problems which
is nice so let me kind of explain what's
going on here as you say I'm not really
going to like explore in this tutorial
why you're not getting all of those
problems just kind of like some of them
you have to set my word for it on the
others so the really interesting things
that are happening here let's start with
the type of the points were passing in
so the amps and foo is a is a reference
to foo and references are pointers but
they are they can never be known okay if
you want to represent a pointer that
might be null you have to wrap it in
this option type and an option says
either you have something or you have
nothing okay so it's just like a null
pointer like ether it like we've got
something and we're pointing all we've
got zero and we're pointing at nothing
except that it's explicit in the type
and rust okay so you have to opt in you
know that it's there and unlike a null
pointer you are forced by the type
system to check whether you have
something on nothing if you try to just
run this G method on the the PTR
variable it would be a type error
instead we have to use this match
statement and a match does a pattern
match and there are two patterns that
this option can be it can either be sum
or it can be none and in the some case
you can go ahead and use the value that
there and you know that it's there and
in the nun case we do nothing and we
return exactly like we would in the null
check and because of the sculpting in
this statement it's impossible to mutate
the the PTR variable once you've done
the equivalent of the null check so
these these two two these two key
concepts option and match and it's gonna
come out drill into into these a little
bit so match is an exhaustive pattern
matching it's a little bit like a switch
statement except that we force it to be
the compiler kind of like checks that
will be exhaustive so here's a really
simple example we've got an enum type
with three variants a B and C and assume
that X has type foo we're then going to
match that variable and we've got the
three cases either it's a either it's or
it's B or at C and in each case we have
a code block and we execute the you know
obvious one at runtime you can use the
an underscore here to say like you know
we're interested in what happens if it's
a and we want kind of like we interested
in anything else happening so you don't
have to kind of like repeat yourself all
the time and unlike a switch statement
the match statement can be used as an
expression so oh and also it binds
variables in the pattern matching so
we've changed the enum a little bit so
now the a variant takes a value with it
so either so if we have a foo like X is
meant to be a through here then we've
got three options either it's an A or
it's a B or it's a C and if it's an A
then it's carrying with it a 32-bit
integer and so when we pattern match
using the match statement in the a case
we can bind this new variable n
to the value and we can use that value
in the code block and we can or we can
kind of return it as the value of the
match statement and in this case like
all the branches have to have the same
type so in the default case we use zero
and then we assign all that into the the
variable little case food so that's a
very very brief introduction to match
there's a lot more that match can do you
you can have quite fancy patterns you
can it does beep pattern matching if you
have kind of like nested types that you
want to match into there are kind of if
guards that you can have on the the
match arms and so forth but that's if
you entered in that you can can look it
up the option type so we've seen kind of
like the option type in action before
the option type is not magic it's not
built into the language it's just a part
of the standard library and it's a
perfectly ordinary enum it has two
variants some none but it is generic so
in the some case we have whatever we
instantiated to so before we saw we had
like an integer as the the type
parameter and we can have any any type
we want in the some case it's very easy
to use because it's so common it's part
of the Russ prelude that means like you
don't need to import the name or quad or
qualify the name when he use it you can
directly use kind of the option or some
or none the names of the variants
directly in your Russ program and also
in arms are kind of optimized cleverly
by the compiler so even though you have
like an option of a pointer and so this
seems like it's a little bit more
heavyweight than just having a pointer
that might be nullable the compiler will
optimize that to the same thing okay so
if you know that a pointer will never be
0 which you do or sorry the compiler
knows then it will optimize the the
option representation in memory so that
it's just a pointer and
the non-case is represented by the null
pointer so it's some you know that works
out to be just as fast and very
efficient to see when you at run time
the result type is very similar to the
option type it's just another generic
enum the difference being that whereas
with option you either have like
something or you have like nothing with
the result with the result type you
either have something or you have an
explanation of why you have nothing okay
so you have like the the value type
which is kind of like the success value
and you have like an arrow type in case
the an error happened so I'll just show
that in action here we've got a very
small slightly silly function it takes
an integer and it returns a result where
the success value is an integer and the
error value the error type is a string
in this case it's just gonna be a
message about what went wrong and we're
going to use the pattern matching
construct match again on the input and
if it's a positive integer we're going
to return success and we're going to add
10 to the input and if it's negative
then we're going to give you an error
message
and then here you see how we would use
this kind of function so we call on the
second line in the main function we're
going to call that function and we're
going to get back either a success with
an integer all we're going to get back
the strength and we're going to use
match and we're going to give a message
to the user that's appropriate in in
each case so just look is it clear to
everyone what's happening in this code
does anyone do I need to explain bits no
reason like I mean success is kind of
the sorry I should repeat the question
the question is why why are the type
parameters in the order te and not ET
that is success type failure type and
not failure type success type and the
order of type parameters in Rus is not
really important doesn't signify
anything like we don't have any kind of
currying or anything so like it
basically doesn't matter what order the
type parameters are in and given that
like success is more common than like
error hopefully and so that's the order
it's in any other yep
so the question is is there any
significance to the exclamation mark yes
so an acceleration mark means that this
is a macro usage rather than a function
call so you so print line is a macro not
a function and whenever you use a macro
you have to use an exclamation mark the
reason for that is that there are things
that a macro can do that a function call
can't do for example a macro can hide a
return so you know print line probably
isn't gonna return now to your function
but like other macros might do so it's
to make it clear when you're reading
like that the invariants around you know
what you can assume this is going to do
of are different any other questions for
move on excellent all right so the
result type is absolutely central to
rust error handling essentially it is
rust error handling story we're going to
go into a little bit of detail right now
about how you can use it ergonomically
and then we're gonna see it a bit later
in the talk about kind of like designing
error handling but its result that's
really important okay and so what you
often see a function signature which
looks like this like it returns a result
of T and and arrow type and the kind of
way the way to read that is that it
returns a team the success case or it
can throw this kind of like error this
is not valid rust syntax but maybe will
evolve to something similar to this soon
and I think it's worth making kind of
like or comparing to kind of like error
handling mechanisms in other languages
if you're kind of like a die-hard C
program out then you're probably used to
kind of like return codes and result
basically works like that except that
you're forced to check it in the same
way that you're forced to check the null
pointers so you can imagine you know the
these are the error codes like in when
you get like your arrow type but like
the you know if you have success then
you get the
the success value passed back at the
same time you can also see this kind of
like analogously to exception types and
Java or C++ except that there's when we
kind of throw an error that's kind of
nothing special is happening in the
language there's no stack unwinding
whatever else is just a a regular return
from a function so I want to introduce a
few bits of control flow next that make
it easier to use types like result so
it's pretty common to see idioms like
this with the match statement where we
call some function or we do some work
and if it's if there's success then we
do something with the value that was
that we got back and otherwise we're
just gonna do nothing actually this is
probably more common with option than
with result you probably want to handle
your error and not just do nothing
although that's a strategy but this is
this is common nevertheless and so we
have a special construct which does
essentially kind of non exhaustive
pattern matching which is a flat so if
let matches just a single pattern so
here like the we've got like a result
type and so we're gonna match like the
okay pattern and so if you've got kind
of ok we're gonna do something with the
value we got and it binds the the
variable I in the same way as match does
and if it's not that then we're just
gonna carry on
here's another somewhat common idiom in
rust which is actually more common with
result type we're going to call a
function again like we had H before and
if it's okay we're gonna do something
with the variable I and if there's an
error we're not going to try and handle
it we're just going to throw it again
and assume that I caller can handle it
in some way I'm assuming the return type
of the function here is is result
otherwise this wouldn't work
ah this one or this one
okay okay so like the if flat is kind of
a single keyword and then okay I as a
pattern and then equals just as an
equals and then we've got an expression
which will be executed and then we try
and match the result of that expression
against the pattern and if it matches
then we do the block so it's it has
exactly the same semantics as this okay
so here's here's this other idiom where
we we are we the take the success or we
throw the error and actually it's more
common to write this like like like this
and rust where we're using the kind of
like expression or inside version of the
match statement and we either binding
into a local variable if we had success
or we're throwing the error to be dealt
with elsewhere and this is such a common
idiom in rust that we have some
extremely sweet syntax to deal with it
which is this so when you see like this
postfix question mark operator that's
basically doing exactly that match right
if we it was successful then we keep the
we keep that variable bind it into I and
then we can do something with it and if
there was an error we throw that for our
caller to deal with okay so this
question mark
sure
and this becomes this yeah okay so
repeat the question what happens if the
return types are different so it doesn't
matter what it will do
type adjustment yes is the short answer
it will can it doesn't matter what the T
is and actually the ease can be
different as well as long as the
compiler can find a way to convert one
into the other and it's kind of beyond
this tour to talk about how we do that
but it can be done yes yes I mean I I
think it's probably easier to kind of
like look at it like this in that like
the yeah like if the error case is still
kind of like wrapped in the result and
will be be thrown because the return
type for the function has to be result
not the arrow type whereas if we want to
use the value then there's no point
about keeping it in side the result
because we know it must be like okay at
this point okay
I only got like half the time we could
see like doctor okay okay yes so we're
not so the unwrapping kind of happens at
the patent level so it's the the
unwrapping is not part of the the whole
match statement the unwrapping is like
because we're matching the okay pattern
then we're unlike by by matching it
we're kind of doing the unwrapping and
we're left with the I was on the earth
case so I probably should have used the
better that's that's a local variable
called not the capital e of which is the
name of the variant and so there's no
unwrapping happening on that case
there's a question over here somewhere
so the question is this looks a little
bit like a macro shouldn't there be like
an exclamation right so the the history
of this is it used to be a macro it used
to be called tri exclamation mark and
was was a macro and we all know the
question mark for reasons I'll discuss
kind of on the next slide and basically
it like it's not a macro and so it
doesn't need it and if you're looking
for like all the places a function can
return while you look for the return
keyword you look for an exclamation mark
and you look for a question mark and if
you see these bits of punctuation then
you know it could return and if not it
can't Oh what so no we do not have that
I remember saying I will talk about
unwrap a little bit later the short
story is you should never use it okay so
this is the simple kind of syntax for
question mark and you often see it in
chains of method calls or field lookups
like this where you know if you did the
matching explicitly this would be like I
don't know ten lines of code and it'd be
really hard to follow what's actually
happening here but in this case you can
actually see quite clearly what's the
you know what's the kind of control flow
what's happening here it's just a chain
of method calls but if you want to know
what the exceptional control flow looks
like it's explicit here like exactly
where you might be kind of throwing out
of this function and so the question
marks is really nice compromising that
it's extremely lightweight so you can
quite easily see what the kind of common
case-control flow is doing but it is
explicit and so if you need to know like
every possible path of control you can
see it okay so having kind of talked
about various kind of like control flow
constructs I want to now show you ways
you can avoid using them at all okay so
there is a lot of methods on the option
and result types or not don't have
anywhere near enough time to cover them
all here but you should look at the
documentation I think kind of like
mastering these things is a really
important step so kind of like writing
kind of clean elegant code and rust I'm
go there's kind of like a symmetry
between the option and result types so
I'm only going to cover option but
pretty much everything I cover here
exists for results as well either
exactly the same or in some variation
so here's kind of a common thing that
you often want to do so sorry look at
the second function this kind of maybe
add four so we're gonna pass in either
an integer or not an integer like
nothing at all and if we get the integer
then we want to add 4 to it and then
return that and if there's nothing there
we're just gonna return nothing okay so
this is kind of like a really common way
it's kind of like unpack do something
repack and we can express this really
simply and rust with the map function
method so this is a method on the option
type and so it can it's if there's
something that then it applies the
function that we passed to it and if
it's not if there's nothing there we
just pass none out of it and actually
it's much more common to see kind of
this closure form where the the function
we're going to apply is written in line
as a closure and even if this syntax is
a little bit kind of funky if you're
coming from C then it should be kind of
clear what's going on here X is the what
we've we've got an option if we indeed
have anything at all and then we're
going to return X plus 4 so is it clear
to everyone what's going on yeah yes
yes so I'll show this on the next slide
yep it does sorry the question is why
doesn't the question mark work for the
option type and it does and you could
use that here but it would actually be a
little bit less succinct they're doing
it this way because you would have to do
the repacking yourself so you have to
you know put the the sum in there
whereas that's done as part of the map
here yeah so the question is given that
you have like this map function why have
the question mark operator as well it
just leads to like better control flow
like when you when you have this really
common case of like the chains like this
with the question mark it's really easy
to read like what's going on here like a
set of kind of like nested map calls is
just not as clear
I know it's a short-answer we don't have
high kind of tight so the question was
is there like some kind of syntax for
doing this in general I guess like do
syntax in Haskell and the answer is no
we don't have higher kind of types and
rust we can't really express like the
the concepts of kind of like do in the
more general case so we have stuff like
the question mark operator and functions
as a replacement okay I lost my place
where do we get up to okay yeah I was
gonna show you the function signature
for map which I had a question about
just now so looking at the the function
signature hopefully it's kind of clear
what's going on here even though it's
not the clearest function signature if
we look we see the first argument itself
we have to be explicit in rust about
taking a cell for this argument so that
just basically shows that it's a method
with a receiver we see that we take a
function and if you look at the where
clause you see the type of that function
don't worry about the details but like
the the essential bit is we're mapping T
to you where T is the type parameter for
the receiver and you is the type
parameter of the option that we return
so in the example here T and u are the
same they're both a 32 but there's no
reason they have to be the same in
general
okay so I want to look at some other
methods and I'm gonna go over there's a
bit more quickly and I'm just going to
show you the type signatures so one kind
of intuitive way you can think of
optional result types is like a like a
boolean where if you've got some or okay
it's true and if you've got nothing or
error then it's false
with that interpretation then it makes
sense to want to and or all these things
together and indeed we have these
functions so and takes another option
and we can look at the two and if both
of those are true like some then we're
going to return the the second one that
we passed in and if either of them is
none like false then we return none
similarly or does exactly what you would
expect these are actually kind of like
more useful if you think about these
well like maybe a more kind of practical
programming terms so and is kind of like
map except where what you're sorry I
have skipped ahead
I should before getting to this I should
introduce that they're like the and and
the or are kind of eager versions of and
and or and that there are also kind of
like lazy versions of and and or so and
then or else you can think of the
boolean operations and and all but the
short-circuiting kind so and then takes
function and if the the receiver is none
we never execute that function but if
the receiver is some then we unwrap the
receiver pass it to this function and if
that function gives you some then that's
the results of the hole and then
function similarly like or else takes a
function and if the receiver is
something then it never executes s--
whereas if it's nothing then we ask you
the function
and then you can think like and then is
exactly like mapping but where the
function that we're mapping can actually
return a nun right rather than always
succeeding where we would wrap it back
up in the map case and then lets you
execute a function that might return
something I might return nothing but
handles like the nun case to start with
similarly or else you can think oh well
or as well you can think of being like
about having a default value so it's
saying if if this is something then
great I'll just you keep using it if
it's if there's nothing there then I'm
going to execute this function or use
this value and and that's kind of like
the default I'm going to go into use so
these are both like really common really
useful functions for on the option and
result types and there's this pattern
that often you have they're kind of like
eager and lazy versions where the eager
version takes of value and the lazy
version takes the function that'll be
executed if necessary okay okay
before I it so this is probably another
good point to ask if people have
questions on on these methods know the
type parameter is on the option so all
requires the argument that's passed to
have the same type parameter as the the
receiver was that's not the case with
hand okay cool so another couple of
methods so I said before option and
results are fairly similar and it's
often extremely common that you will
want to convert between them and so
there are methods to convert from an
option to a result and vice versa and so
okay or turns an option into a results
and you the the all bit is because you
have to supply like the error case if it
was if there was nothing there and
there's a there's like a lazy version
okay or
else of this itzá is a way to convert an
option into an iterator
so if boolean is one intuition you can
have an option type you can also think
of an option type as a collection it's
kind of like a list which always have
zero or one elements in it
so given this intuition of like a list
of zero one elements then you might want
to iterate over those elements and so it
so gives you an iterator back and we'll
see kind of like more details of the
iterator next okay so time for an
exercise basically here are two
functions these are written kind of
badly so write them really well is the
exercise there's a link in the top right
corner for the documentation you might
find it handy to look up the the docs
for for option in order to do this we
can figure bigger this out I'm just
gonna give you a couple of minutes to do
and if you have any questions that you
along just going to stick up your hand
but I'm gonna interrupt because I'm
already slightly over time sorry but I
want to go through what we're what we've
talked about so I'm just going to go
through the first function first so this
if input it's none returned none and
then unwrap the input well we can do
this much quicker using a try operator
sorry the question mark operator so that
this is exactly what's happened in this
version but if we keep reading a little
bit further down then we see that like
in we're then doing like an if test and
we're gonna return none and otherwise
we're gonna wrap it all back up in a sum
so that suggests that we can do even
better we can use the and then function
that I talked about before rather than
like the the try operator so this is
doing like an implicit check and whether
it's some or none and then we're
returning none if we're we're less than
zero and actually if you're using
nightly rust you can do even better than
that because there's a function that
hasn't been stabilized in the standard
library yet called filter which does
what and then was doing like with some
or none but then applies a predicate to
the value if there was something there
and effectively kind of like those and
then returns like some if the predicate
is true and none if it's if it's false
okay so the second function is a bit
simpler it just has a match statement
where and it calls the previous function
which returns an option and it gives you
an okay result or it gives you an error
and this can quite easily be mapped onto
the okay or function that we talked
about earlier this is just converting
from the option type into the result
type so does anyone have any questions
about the exercise before we move on
okay great
so on to iteration and iterators so I
want to start again with an example in C
we've got a ping all function this is
going to take an array of some type foo
it also needs to take the length of that
array it's gonna iterate over that
arrays and standard C for loop and then
it's gonna index into that array and
call some ping function on every element
of the array what could go wrong so that
length might just be wrong right who
knows who's calling this function right
there's nothing that says they're gonna
get this right
the array could actually be mutated
inside the loop we could be adding
something on to the end or taking
something away or changing things or
what have you the counter variable could
be mutated I mean not in it that would
be an obvious error in a simple loop
like this but in more complicated loops
especially if you're mutating the thing
you're iterating over then it's kind of
common to mutate the counter you could
have some logic errors so a really
simple one would be you know starting at
one rather than zero or using less than
or equal to rather than less than these
are probably pretty obvious hopefully
they'd get caught in code of view but
who knows and certainly once you start
having like nested iteration or you're
iterating over multiple arrays or you're
going backwards rather than forwards or
you're stepping over multiple elements
at a time it gets much much easier to
make this kind of logic error finally
this array is just a pointer and so it
could be null and we'd into a null check
and it could be otherwise invalid in the
same way that a pointer could be so
there's a lot that could go wrong here's
the version in rust
so hopefully the tape looks kind of
similar
unlike see the type includes the length
and so we don't need to separately pass
the length so that's one thing that
can't go wrong iterating over it is like
a much simpler expression it
the for-loop but it's not like a c4 loop
we're just gonna this is going to bind
the variable F to each elements in Fu's
in sequence and then we're going to call
this ping function on it so this is
already like much better hopefully you
all agree but actually it's kind of
uncommon to even see like four loops for
this kind of single simple case because
there's a whole bunch of functions on
iterators just like there's a whole
bunch of functions on option and result
that let you write kind of like much
more succinct code so here we explicitly
have to ask for it iterate over the
array use and the inner function and
then there's a for each function which
just executes the function for each
element so having got this kind of like
tasteful what's going on I want to kind
of like oh yeah sorry question so the
sorry the question is what's the benefit
of using for each rather than for its so
the I kind of want to make the general
point that when we see like other
functions that I'm going to introduce
next then it gives you kind of like a
nicer kind of control flow it's more
explicit about exactly what's going on
with for each there's not a lot of
benefit over using for like it's a it's
a more sustained construction if you're
not doing if you if you know if this was
gonna be like a ten line closure I would
say use a for loop if it's just like a
real simple thing like this then it's
easier to read the code if you use for
each it's just on one line
okay let's look at some methods on the
iterator type so option and result were
concrete types I showed you the the
definitions that are in the standard
library iterator as a trait and we're
going to cover traits like at the end of
this talk but what the important thing
is that like iterator is kind of like an
interface of which there are many many
concrete implementations you may even
write your own it's common to write your
own in rust code and that for various
reasons that means that actually looking
at the signatures these functions is not
very useful so I'm going to do this all
by example rather than by showing you
the signature okay it's so a vac and
rust is just a resizable array so here
we're just going to create our back
we're going to call it iran it's got an
iterator and then we're going to use
some functions so map just like map on
option applies this function to every
elements of the it's razor and then
gives you a new iterator filter applies
the predicate and if it's true it keeps
it and if it's false dumps it so this
gives you a iterator that's the same
size or shorter and then for each we've
already seen what for each does it just
execute this function on all of these so
what's the output going to be here you
can have a think or shout it out if
you're feeling brave yeah so we just
gonna prints out two three and four
okay another couple of functions this
time we're going to use a for loop as
well so it's actually pretty common to
kind of like gasps and iterates and
manipulate the iterator in some way and
then use a for loop to iterate over the
iterator if you like so we're going to
use the chain function so chain takes
two iterators and change them together
so you got a new iterator that iterates
over all the first element all the
elements in the first iterator and then
all the elements in the second iterator
enumerate well sometimes I mean so in
the for loop we saw earlier there's no
counter variable sometimes you want a
counter variable right it's useful so
enumerate gives you a way to give that
back so enumerate takes an iterator and
then gives you back an iterator which is
an iterator over pairs of the counter
variable and the value from the original
iterator and so that's when we see the
for loop doing some kind of basic
pattern matching on the left-hand side
here so I is the count value and V is
the the value from that we're iterating
over and then again we're going to like
print stuff out so what do we think it's
gonna get printed out this time yes just
pop-up what's gonna get printed out
okay finally the collect methods like
we've gone from a collection like a
vector into an iterator but often you
want to go back you've done your
iteration and you want to collect back
down into a collection so in the first
example here we're going to get area
straighter we're going to run map we've
seen map just now and then we're going
to get a new vector which is kind of all
the results that we've tucked that we've
got and then in the second example we're
going to do map again but then we're
going to run in numerate and so this is
going to give us an iterator of counter
variables and value pairs and then we're
going to collect into a hash map so
we're going to get a map from the
counter variables to the values and the
fact that these are two quite different
things gives you a hint that collect is
quite a smart little function and
exactly how it behaves depends on the
the type that you're expecting and
that's why we need to put some explicit
types on the variable declarations even
though usually in rust we can just infer
these and the the output is going to be
like a vector and the hash map with
these values question
a hat so question is are there any
lazier taters and all these raters are
lazy or most of the iterators are lazy
yes and there's kind of like there's
functions for taking like a certain
segment of that yeah so when I say like
this takes one iterator and gives you
another one that's actually not what
happens it happens lazily when you kind
of like call one of the terminating
functions like collapse or 4-h okay well
I have a question so we have this back
right and we've seen two ways we can
iterate over it and I think intuitively
these are very similar you can see why
these might correspond but it's kind of
odd that these are maybe not as close as
you might be expecting right like the in
the first case we have to explicitly get
an iterator and in the second case we'd
done but we do have an extra ampersand
in there so what exactly is the for loop
expecting like a for loop is built into
the language is a is it expecting a
vector but we saw an array earlier and
we saw kind of some iterator stuff as
well so what's what's going on here okay
so let's start at the beginning like
this this vak macro this creating a
vector for us the type of that is
capital v vac this is not kind of an
iterator which is why in the first
expression you have to call it sir to
actually get an iterator but the vac
type does implement into iterator which
is a trait and we'll see what that gives
you in a second but actually there are
multiple implementations so there's
actually an implementation for just vac
which gives you an iterator over the
values in fact and as an iterator for a
reference to vac which gives
you an iterator over a reference to each
value in the vac and seeing us in our
for loop we we don't want to kind of use
up that vac we won't have access to it
afterwards it's it's pretty common that
you want to get the the references and
so that ampersand before the vac ensures
that we get the the implementation of
into iterator which is going to give us
an iterator over the references rather
than values and what is into iterate to
do into iterator house like a single
function which just turns the receiver
ah I forgot the South bit sorry that
should be in to iterate sort of into it
or self so it turns that receiver into
an iterator and then the iterator trait
it has a lot of functions I've been
talking about some of them there's an
awful lot more but the one that you
actually the really kind of like key
function is this next function and it
returns an option we've seen option
already and what happens is if the
iterator has been used up we return none
because there's nothing left to give
otherwise we return the next element as
a Sun so you might have an inkling of
how this is gonna fit together but let's
kind of like explore a little bit more
so I talked about if flat as a control
flow statement before so it's just
pattern matching and if we patch the
pattern we execute the block there's
also wild lat so while light does
exactly like if flat except it keeps
doing it so while lat says while I can
match this pattern executes the block
and keep going and then when I can no
longer match the pattern that I stopped
so this is essentially what the for code
for loop boils down to we run into it so
to get ourselves an iterator and then we
repeatedly call it a dot next and whilst
that returns a some variant we execute
the body of the the loop and if it
returns none then we stop but that's not
the end of the story as we
before with a flat then you can rewrite
that with match so similarly like with
wild lat we can reduce this to even more
primitive constructs but you need to
know that there exists loop which takes
no arguments and just loops forever it's
an infinite loop and also the rust has a
break statement and so I'm going to get
you all to do this as an exercise which
is can you write the this while lat
loop that we had before to do iteration
using these more basic constructs so
just give you a couple of minutes to do
that okay
so hopefully you had some fun with this
I want to kind of like just show you
what the solution looks like quickly so
we still need to kind of run the Intuit
write it into is earth function to get
ourselves an iterator then leave all
this infinite loop and we've got a match
that will break out if there's nothing
left on the iterator otherwise we're
going to like a sign into a local
variable and this should hopefully
remind you a little bit of where we saw
the question mark it operator earlier
and the the idiom that led to that so
just to summarize like where we've we've
come from here like we're looking at the
for loop and I've shown you kind of how
you can think of the for loop
like getting rid of this implicit so a
for loop works over an iterator it takes
any any iterator and then by using kind
of while lap I've shown you how
explicitly we're kind of getting that
iterator and then iterating over it and
then shown how like while that itself is
can be thought of in even lower-level
terms the second part is probably not
too useful but it is often useful in
your Rus code bail to use while lat four
kind of various complex kinds of
iterations so that's really nice
things kind of having your in your
toolbox okay so that's the end of the
the first half of the the too-tall it's
been slightly more than half the time
but never mind and in the next section
we're going to talk about programming in
the large ish so we're going to talk
about error handling we're going to talk
about ownership primarily like as a
design principle and we're going to talk
about traits if we have enough time so
error handling
so my my my first and most important
point I think is that you should think
of error handling as an architectural
concern in your program primarily that
means you have to think about it really
early in the design process so when
you're thinking you know should this app
run on a server or should it have a GUI
or should it have like a restful api
like when you're making that level of
architectural decisions you also want to
be thinking about you know what is the
error handling story gonna be for this
piece of software and in this section
we're going to go over the kind of
decisions you'd be making as part of
that so we talked about results earlier
I told you result was kind of like the
fundamental part of the a fundamental
part of rusts error handling story so
we've basically kind of I've been
showing you all this code that uses
result but whenever like we've got the
error type you've basically kind of like
you know ignored that so what should you
do when you get this when you get the
error case of your result you have a few
options the first option is that you're
able to recover somehow so often a way
to recover is like you can pick an
appropriate default value so you know
that if this thing succeeded you've got
a value and if it didn't succeed then
there's a default value I can use
there's if you were paying attention
earlier you could write this more
succinctly using like an okay or
function ah sorry unwrap or function
some people think that an appropriate
way to recover from an error is to give
it to the user and this is wrong you'd
like it might at some points in your
program the appropriate to alert the the
user that there has been an error and
maybe the error the user can give you
some inputs
to help recover from that the mistake is
and presumably what is going on here is
that like your actual arrow types are
internal for the to the program it you
should almost never actually show your
internal arrow types to the user this is
almost certainly going to give a bad
user experience if you're going to do
this you need some kind of like
dedicated code in your in your software
that handles the the internal arrow type
and gives you like you know user
interface over that that you're going to
present the user it's option number two
is to just re throw so we've seen this
before we've seen this is what the
question mark operator is for this is
like in I mean this particular function
and I don't know how to recover from
this era so I'm going to just throw it
up the stack and hope that my caller or
their caller and so on will be able to
handle it oh yeah that's the yeah
question mark operator the third option
is that you can panic so a panic is that
controlled crash in in rust so it
crashes the current threat but it does
so by it does so kind of like cleanly by
unwinding with stacks or destructors
will get called and this isn't a sag
fault it's not exploitable and you can
actually catch this panic or you can
catch it at thread boundaries its you
you don't net this doesn't necessarily
have to crash your entire process and
you can explicitly do that using the
panic macro but it's much more common to
use the unwrapped or expect functions on
an optional error where they if it's if
it's okay then we unwrap and if it's not
okay then we panic so these are your
three options so the first two options
are like actual error handling and the
third option is not error handling
basically and it's acceptable to do that
sometimes like if you're writing like
you know very experimental a bit of code
then maybe it's okay but really we
should be doing one of the first two and
so the obvious question it becomes like
which of those two should I do
so an intuition I want to try and get
across is about kind of the modularity
of error handling and so I want is like
think of think of your code in terms of
kind of error modules now these are not
like this is not a rust concept this is
not like something that's actually
explicit in your code and an error
module could be smaller than a rust
module but more commonly it would be
bigger than a rust module I mean quite
common is like your error module fits
with a whole crate and an error module
like is so within that error module you
have context specific ways that you can
recover from the errors that happen
whereas outside there's no way that you
can recover like in a in a kind of local
kind of way and so you instead you want
to present enough information so that
you can do kind of like try something
else completely instead so to give you a
little example of this like imagine that
you're doing some network i/o okay so
within your error module then this might
be as small as a single function right
like you're gonna try to use this
connection and maybe you'll get like a
woodblock error back from your system
call or maybe you've got a you know
connection busy kind of error well you
can kind of like recover from that in a
very context-sensitive way you can just
sleep and then try again right but if
none of this if this doesn't work then
at some point you've got to kind of tell
your caller that like you failed to do
this i/o and for them like whether you
got like you know couldn't get the
connection or whether you got like a
woodblock kind of error this is useless
right but they might want to know well
there was an i/o error trying to connect
to this particular IP address
okay so that's kind of a difference
between like a kind of internal kind of
error in an external error and where you
want to convert from one to the other is
kind of like the boundary of your error
module and generally like within an
error module you or a common pattern for
error handling is that you always throw
re-throw your error when you're inside
the error module and then you have in US
and the kind of boundary of this module
you have like a single place where you
try and do recovery okay and if that
recovery fails then you're going to
convert the internal error into a kind
of public facing error and so that's
kind of like the intuition that I kind
of pushes to know him when you should
kind of like throwerw versus recover is
kind of getting this intuition of kind
of like mmm
modular error stuff actually do you have
any questions about that
yeah so the question is how do you deal
with out-of-bounds accesses in arrays
and so I so bounds checking is done at
runtime and rust and it depends like you
can index into an array in different
rays the pen which depend will give you
different ways of getting the different
ways of handling the out-of-bounds error
so if you just use like the square
bracket operators and you're out of
bounds then that's going to panic which
you don't want to happen so if you think
that you might possibly access out of
bounds then you should not be using
those indexing operations and you should
use an explicit gap which returns an
option I think either an optional result
bshorts an option and then you can like
explicitly check or you can use the
various functions we talked about on the
first half to say if this is a if there
was something there then do something
and if it was none than recover in some
way so that yeah and then how you do it
is up to you
ah yes correct
okay so if you remember the result type
has two type parameters it has the value
type that we haven't a success and how's
the arrow type hopefully what value type
you know that I don't need to talk about
that it's obviously just what you're
doing and your function that's going to
take the value type what should you use
for your arrow type okay this is kind of
a big question but first of all result
type I mentioned earlier it's not magic
it's not built into the language it's
just part of the standard library and
it's actually totally possible to use
your own result type but don't do that
there's like there's very rarely any
reason you'd want to do that unless you
are reimplemented some really kind of
like fundamental library stuff I can't
imagine a scenario where it makes sense
to implement your own result type on the
other hand aliasing the result type is
almost always a good idea if like within
a module you are using a single arrow
type then kind of having a an alias for
that makes your your code much clearer
no you can think of like the an alias
like this being resolved oh sorry the
question was does this prevent kind of
implicit coercion between your results
hype and thus general results I've
announcer's know and you probably don't
want that like you want to be you want
to just be using the result type you
want to be able to in you know interact
with the rest of the ecosystem by doing
that but by this is just a convenience
so you don't have to keep typing my
every kind of function that you have
this end which gets boring really fast
you you can oh sorry
so the question is there is an option
for not allowing the coercion so I
should clarify that there's it's not a
coercion like the aliasing it happens or
the D aliasing I guess happens very
early in compilation so as far as the
compiler is concerned these are the same
types it's not that it's being coerced
from one site to another if you do want
an something that is like an alias but
does not coerce you can use like a unit
struct as like a new type types trick
but you should definitely not do that
with results
it's the one option is you use something
really simple as your arrow type so you
could not use anything at all if you're
if this is really early days code maybe
you just want you know it's it's nice to
be able to throw errors but there's
maybe no relevant information that you
can get in there and so you can actually
just use the void type which is just the
the empty parens and there's no
information at all you could use error
codes like you know one two three or
error codes
that's not very user-friendly but it's
fine for experimental programming it's
pretty common see people use strings
like a Gaines it's not something I
recommend in kind of production code but
it's great when you're experimenting
it's very lightweight and it lets you
debug it the other option is you do this
properly and you have like a struct or
an enum with lots of variants and data
that it's carrying around which lets
gives you lots of information for
recovering lots of information that you
can give to the user about what went
wrong if necessary and you have a couple
of and but you have some options you can
use like a single arrow type for all of
your code or you can use multiple arrow
types so if you're using a single one
it's quite often to you common to use an
enum so here we're just using the single
enum type as our arrow type and every
possible kind of error gets a different
variant and you know any data you want
is carried along with that so here we've
got like a server error user error
connection error whatever else
alternatively you can use multiple
different error types so different
functions would return different throw
different kinds of errors so here we've
got like a struct for a server error and
that has like quite different data from
all the other kind of errors that we
might have you in the end you're gonna
have to deal with multiple error types
anyway because the standard library is
full of different ones with its own kind
so you're gonna have to accommodate that
so even though using a single kind of
error type is simpler and often look
kind of like what you want to do you
still have to handle other types often
if you're thinking of
like this in terms of error modules you
want like one arrow type / arrow module
and that's like another way that this
intuition of arrow module is really
helpful and I'd say if you do have
multiple types and if you want to do can
I error handling properly you should
look at the failure library this is a
library for error handling and it is on
the road to being part of the standard
library and hopefully it's gonna be
widely used in the ecosystems so it's it
gives your your librarian advantage so
it lets you handle kind of lots of
different kinds of arrow types very
clearly it lets you change ours together
so often you'll have an arrow that has
like an underlying calls and it lets you
deal with that kind of like chain of
causes and it will allow you to have
like back traces when you when these
kind of errors get surfaced and it lets
you interoperate very cleanly with the
rest of the rust ecosystem oh and it's
extremely easy to use okay like if you
have like a if this is your error inning
on um then you can opt into using
failure just with this very small drive
fail attribute question question was it
seems there's no error hierarchy is
there a reason and we J I mean we
generally don't have hierarchies and
rust life
there's no inheritance between data
types so there's no kind of obvious way
to even have such a thing yeah is the is
the short answer it just doesn't kind of
like fit with the rust philosophy of the
way we do things to do that
okay so what should I do like your your
programmer like what should I do like
what kind of approach does have error
handling so the first question is are
you writing a library or are you writing
an application if you're running a
library basically you have to do
everything properly if you want other
people to use your library they're going
to expect it to have proper error
handling so you need to use your own
arrow type don't try and use like a
string or an error code or something
like a Paik like that you need to think
you need to like consider like the arrow
boundaries that I was talking about
earlier and you should probably use the
failure library if you're using an
application if you're producing an
application then you want to think about
what kind of application that is if
you're writing a script that you're only
going to use once and throw away then
just panic everywhere but like bear in
mind that scripts that you use once and
throw away have a tendency to become
scripts that get used twice and then go
into production and are in essential
part of your you know business plan if
you're running like very experimental
prototype software then you probably
want to have some quite lightweight
error handling so you know something
like using a string as an error message
it's quite a good idea and if you're
putting something in production then you
need to do like with a library you need
to have like a really kind of like full
error handling thing and I should say
that it's kind of hard to refactor from
a system that panics if you wear into a
system with proper error handling but
it's pretty easy to refactor from a
system that just uses like strings say
into something that does proper error
handling so if you're having prototype
or experimental software that's why I
say you should kind of do kind of like
the basic and I error handling approach
because it's really easy to factor that
into like proper error handling whereas
if you does panicking everywhere that's
that's really difficult
plus it lets you do stuff like easing
the question mark operator and the easy
interaction with some of the standard
library types okay so that's the at the
end of this section and a good place to
ask if people have questions sorry yes
sorry the the question was can you write
a trait which relies on things having
other traits the answer is yes and but
stick around and we can talk about it
rather than going into it right now cool
okay so I have vastly underestimated how
long this talk would take and I only
have seven more minutes which is
probably not enough time to cover even a
half of one of the two sections that I
have left so I'm happy to kind of stick
around but I think they need to stop
video recording at some point and people
might want to leave so now it's probably
a good place to stop and carry on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
