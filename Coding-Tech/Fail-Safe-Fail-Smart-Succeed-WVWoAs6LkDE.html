all in this room we make software and
software is about innovation software is
about making hard things easy making
easy things automated changing the way
people interact with each other with
their business how they're entertained
and that is a process of innovation
that's a process of invention an
invention requires failure if you want
to do something new something novel
something innovative and you do it
perfectly
immediately it's not very innovative you
have to fail in order to invent and you
that may seem obvious you may disagree
with me but somebody much smarter than
myself has said this anyone who has
never made a mistake has never tried
anything new
right if Albert Einstein says that you
know it's probably pretty smart so if
you can agree with me at least for the
next half-hour that invention requires
failure an innovation requires failure
then what's important isn't avoiding
failure what's important is how we
handle the inevitable failure when it
happens we know we're going to fail
we're absolutely going to fail so how do
we do it in the smartest way that
actually helps us and teaches us new
things helps us be better instead of
setting us backwards now I call or I
talk about this in the context of
creating a fail-safe environment now for
those of you like me who've been doing
software for a long time when we used to
talk about failsafe code we used to mean
fault avoidance as opposed to fault
tolerance I worked at Microsoft Research
for a while and one of the projects
there was proving code writing proof
for code to make sure it would never
fail yeah that was a long time ago we
don't do that because it failed so
instead we've learned how to be failure
safe and a big part of this is failing
what I call failing smart I'm a Tavo as
you heard today but I and as you heard I
used to be at Spotify and Spotify it was
actually quite quite good at this a lot
of what I've learned about failure I
learned at Spotify and it's Spotify we
talked about a lot about failing small
we know we're going to fail it's fail
fast and let's fail small we talked
about this as minimizing the blast
radius so this is a quote from me Kyle
Krantz he's chief architect at Spotify
and he and I this was a conversation we
were having in slack one day and he said
this and he said it was okay for me to
use it so I do we want to be an internal
combustion engine not a fuel air bomb
many small controlled explosions
propelling us forward in a generally ok
direction not a huge blast leveling half
the city I like this idea partially
because it acknowledges these small
failures as an opportunity to move you
forward instead of setting you back we
often think of failure as pushing you
back one step forward two steps back
actually it can be to want two steps
back three steps forward if you use it
right now
an important part of this is finding the
fastest cheapest easiest path to
learning which means finding the fastest
cheapest easiest path to fail anytime
you want to add a feature to your code
or your product or develop a new product
the first question you should be asking
yourself is how fast can I prove that
this is a good idea with customers how
fast can I ship this to customers and
get real feedback so you might say well
okay we can't do this in less than six
months
okay try then take that number and
divide it in half because you definitely
can do it much much faster you can
always do it in a sprint or two if you
can figure out the way to do it without
building the whole idea but finding the
kernel of the idea that you can put in
front of customers and get feedback now
we can do this now it's actually very
easy for us to do this it used to be
very hard how many of you do not
recognize clipping or don't know office
assistant do not okay almost no one some
of you at least a fairly large group of
you are probably too young to have ever
used this in office or even seen it it
was discontinued about I think 10 or 12
years ago but the thing is this was a
failure on a scale so massive it escaped
our industry and became part of popular
culture
I could go to almost any country in the
world and people who'd never seen a
computer would probably know that Clippy
was a stupid idea that Microsoft made
now I worked at Microsoft when we made
clipping I did not work on Clippy but I
worked in Microsoft Research and I had a
lot of friends who did what you don't
think about when you think about this
kind of failure you might think oh this
is a horrible idea that the people who
worked on this must have been very
stupid but that's really not the case
this came out this was being developed
in the mid to late 90s and at that time
Microsoft Office was actually probably
still is one of the top two three most
successful software products of all time
and at this time it was at the peak of
its popularity and working at Microsoft
that was a pretty hard team to get into
because of that so the people who worked
on this were very very smart very smart
product people very smart developers as
I said I worked in research there were a
bunch of people with PhDs who jumped
over to help on this project that failed
miserably so wasn't that they weren't
smart enough and it wasn't that they
didn't think they knew their customers
well or their product
it was that they didn't have a good way
to validate the idea somebody had this
idea somebody else thought it was good
they put a lot of money a lot of time
into building it and it turned out it
was absolutely the wrong thing for their
market and there was no easy way to do
that because for those of you who are
young and didn't don't know how we used
to write software we used to write
software especially a product like
Microsoft Office Microsoft would
literally lease the entire CD and DVD
manufacturing capability of the world
basically every CD and DVD manufacturing
plant in the world if they could get
them and they would have to do that
because it's very expensive and very
hard a couple years in advance and
that's how we wrote software we would
write it for two years we would ship a
golden master off to all these plants
they would produce plastic and foil
disks that got put into boxes it got put
into bigger boxes that got put onto
pallets I got put into containers taken
by ship or by boats to some other third
location where they were taken by truck
to warehouses where they were taken by
truck to stores where you would drive
your car to go buy the software take the
software home and spend an afternoon or
an entire day installing it that's how
long it would take us to ship software
to people it would take years so an idea
like this which seemed great at the time
you'd spend a couple years working on
this I'm sure you do a little bit of
user testing maybe but you wouldn't know
whether it was a success or failure for
years today you could ship your website
on every safe in your editor
hit save and you could CD that straight
out to production if you really wanted
to you can ship your Android app every
day you can ship your iOS app twice a
month or something like that there is
literally no excuse and as a Java
conference I can make fun of iOS a
little bit there's literally no excuse
to wait a really long time before you
ship your software and get real customer
feedback now TJ Watson
it was the early CEO of IBM and he said
if you want to increase your success
rate double your failure rate think
about Clippy for a moment Clippy took
multiple years millions of dollars of
investment dozens of person years to
fail if you want to fail if you want to
fail twice as much before you think
you're going to get to a success a
smaller company this would kill you
you'd never make it you'd never have
your success interestingly by the way I
worked at IBM a very very long time ago
and I worked on a big project there and
we spent you know a couple years working
on this research project at the end of
the project we found out that there were
two other labs at IBM that were working
on the exact same project and none of us
knew about each other and we were very
upset at the time because we said oh we
could have shared our work and we could
have done much better but later I
realized this is how IBM failed faster
it failed in parallel instead of failing
serially an important part of creating a
fail-safe environment creating an
environment where you recover nicely
from failure you use failure to move you
forward is creating a culture where
failure isn't punished and that sounds
like a weird thing to say do not punish
failure but if you punish if you think
about it if you punish failure and
failures required for innovation and
invention by the transitive property
punishing failure is punishing
innovation and I've worked at companies
I won't talk about which ones that did
this
that punished failure very clearly you
got laid off you start a new project
project didn't succeed immediately you
got laid off well what does that mean
does that encourage lots of people to
try new things no it doesn't and that
was a company that was constantly
struggling to figure out how to innovate
better so it's important that you don't
punish the failure but what you do need
to punish is not learning from it right
because if you make a mistake and you
learn nothing and you make the same
mistake over and over and over again
your
why bother right so making sure that you
and your team's punished not learning
from failure but not the failure itself
and that's an important important piece
and very important to actually creating
a culture of innovation in your company
or on your team learning from failure
you can learn a ton of things from
failure in lots of different areas every
failure can teach you a lot about your
process why do you know this release was
so buggy a lot of users are upset what
happens well the test team was working
on a different project and they shifted
over really late and we didn't want to
delay the release but the test
automation had caught the issues but
it's been really flaky so nobody's
looking at it anymore I've had that
conversation right you may have had
similar conversations that's a failure
of your process it could be your team
and it doesn't mean that your team is
bad what it could mean is that you
didn't have the right skill set you took
on a technology you didn't understand
and you didn't have anyone the team who
knew it it could be you know
interpersonal things on the team it
could be a lot of things and it could be
your team isn't great and you need a
better team your perception of your
customers this one's really important we
all think we know who our customers are
or hopefully most of us think that the
thing is we don't we have an idea of who
our customers are and that idea comes
from a lot of things user research forum
posts app store reviews meeting them in
person but the thing is hopefully you
have them way more customers and you can
personally know I hope and if you do you
what you do you have to create an
amalgam of these people a version of
them in your head because you can't keep
all of them separately in your head and
that becomes a myth of who your customer
is and it's not the real place or not
the real customer and the thing is that
even if you could know every one of your
customers intimately today tomorrow you
won't anymore because you'll have new
customers tomorrow
and your software have changed
and your new customers are using the
software you ship today not the software
you shipped last year and they're
approaching it from a different way so
you create these myths of your customers
and hopefully your miss are close but
oftentimes they're not and that's a
failure an opportunity to learn your
understanding your product now of course
you understand your product you're
writing your product but the thing is
that you're writing a product to solve a
problem right for your customers your
customers are using your software to
solve a problem for themselves but it's
entirely possible that the problem
they're solving with your software is
different than the problem you're
solving for them writing your software
they're using a different product than
you wrote now this happens all the time
for a while at Adobe I worked with the
flash team and one of the things about
Flash was every time we'd release a new
version of the VM we'd have to ship
every previous version of the VM in the
binary and why was that that was because
flash developers were an inventive and
hacky lot and they would figure out
weirdnesses in the VM that they could
exploit to do cool stuff on the web and
if we fixed those bugs because they were
bugs in the VM we would break the web
and we were not allowed to break the web
so we would end up shipping old versions
so that they the developers who taken
advantage of bugs essentially we're
solving problems we hadn't intended for
them to solve could keep doing that
finally of course you can learn a lot
about yourself and that's kind of the
hardest part to learn all the things
that you need to learn about yourself
and how you approach your work the thing
is with this failure it's uncomfortable
it's on it's not fun to wallow in a
failure you have a failed project the
last thing you want to do is spend a
bunch of time figuring out all the ways
you screwed up but the matter is that if
you can do that you will learn a
tremendous amount that will help you do
your next project better and every
project after that and will help you and
it will
help your company do speaking of failure
take time to extract the lessons from
failure
so do retrospectives right we're agile
or many of us are working agile we're
we're comfortable with retrospectives we
used to do retrospective Zhun failed
projects and we would call them in the
US I don't know if you call them this
here post-mortems which is what you do
when you examine a dead body to find out
why it died and that was really mostly
to establish blame like who else's fault
was it for the software project to fail
because it certainly wasn't our team's
now we do retrospectives and the
important thing is if you want to create
a true culture of learning you do those
retrospectives on both successful
projects and on the failed projects
every project you do that's successful
is probably you probably still did some
things that were wrong and you can learn
from those things if you do them for the
successful projects and the failed
projects there's no stigma you're just
this a part of your process you always
do it so do those retrospectives and
collect them catalog them put them in a
place that anyone can find them in your
company that's also important you may do
the retrospective in your team and you
keep those notes to yourself partially
because you don't want to admit your
failure to the rest of your company but
the thing is that when the team next
door to you has the same failure you did
or makes the same mistake that may feel
good from a schadenfreude a kind of way
but it's not the best thing for your
company you're not doing your company
any favors or that team instead of
instead of watching them fail or finding
out that they failed in a way you could
have saved them instead give them what
you've learned share all that learning
and let them fail in a whole new way so
that you can learn from their failure on
your next project failures hidden or
forgotten are going to be repeated and
we don't there's no point in doing that
anyway
now as I said Spotify was actually quite
good at this and creating a culture a
fail-safe environment this is from a
team at Spotify when I worked there this
is a squad they had a fail wall where
they collected lessons and their
failures and they put this not in a
hidden place this was on their
whiteboard that faced the walkway so
everybody walking by could see this they
were not embarrassed about this
whatsoever they were very proud of what
they learned and that retrospective
collection this is I think is this a
novel one maybe we do this at all though
it doesn't have to be anything
sophisticated it could just be literally
a Google folder full of Google Docs with
all your retrospectives in it when you
do a project a big project and you want
to learn good things and bad things
about projects have happened before
having a place where you can just skim
through very very valuable Bob Sutton
he's a professor of management and he
said the most creative people and
companies don't have lower failure rates
they fail faster and cheaper and perhaps
learn more from their setbacks than
their competitors right you can use your
failures to actually help you beat your
competitors because you're all going to
fail all of you are going to fail and
your competitors are going to fail and
if you can use those to learn and learn
faster than your competitors you can use
your failures to beat them now another
part of being a fail safe environment is
making failure safer and reducing the
cost of failure now this is a product
development or feature development
framework called thinkof build it ship
it tweak it it's basically a small
version of lean this is something
there's another thing I learned it's
Spotify and this puts the horizontal
access there is time the vertical axis
and investment not specific investment
generalized investment it could be
opportunity cost literal euros people's
time whatever and the idea is this
you break a new feature or sets of
features into four parts the first part
is the idea you have the idea this is
the thinking you're coming back from
lunch with some people from your team
and you have a great idea and you start
talking about oh this seems like a good
idea you get back to the office you talk
to the product manager and you say we
have this idea prog manager says that
sounds good - let's talk about it you
spend a little bit of time part-time
working with the product manager maybe
another developer design or something
just playing around with this idea so
there's not a lot of investment it's
part time it's just something you're
doing eventually you get to the point
where you say no you know what this
actually seems like something we should
do let's build it for real so now the
entire team gets involved now the cost
gets grows very very quickly because the
whole team is building this feature and
you want to minimize that cost right the
idea is to minimize this shaded area
because until you've actually shipped
your feature to 100% of your users
you're spending and you're not getting
the return on your investment so you
want to Mize a build it time well how do
you minimize the the time spent building
a feature will you make an MVP you don't
make the full feature you make the
minimum version of it to prove that it's
a good idea and you'll notice the
shipping time is longer than the builded
time and that it can be and a lot of
companies you have shipping as a binary
thing you haven't shipped and now you've
shipped one or you know you haven't
shipped now you shipped that's not a
great way to do things
partially because we don't when we don't
have to do things that way anymore we're
not sending golden masters to CD plants
we're shipping stuff on the web and we
can do things like roll features out
which we did in which we do a Tavo and
the idea is this you had an idea you've
built it you want to make sure it's a
good idea you don't give it to all your
users because if it's a bad idea
now you're failing big instead of
failing small so you give it to a small
percentage of your users and you wait
and you get the data back because of
course you've instrumented your
applications
so you watch it and you see is this
probably a we do did we do something
that our customers like and if they did
and if it is that's great you roll it
out further and now you're saying a
bigger group is this still something the
customers like but also more importantly
is our software scaling well right is
this handling the load if you're a
company like Spotify without 150 million
users you actually kind of have to care
about that but aren't my company has
fewer users and we still care about that
as well so now you're what can also
happen by the way is you roll it out
just percentage of your users and you
find out they don't like it this wasn't
the idea that you thought it was now you
have a decision point were we wrong was
this just a bad idea and we thought it
was a good idea it was is this another
Clippy right if it's another Clippy you
can say forget it all right let's just
roll it back delete it if you wrote
micro-services speaking to the
introduction you did this with
microservices you just turn those turn
those off and your move on with your
lives
if it is now this is still a good idea
we just missed something with the
customers you can tweak it and you can
change it with that same small set of
customers and improve it until the point
where you actually get positive results
for your for your metrics so that is why
shipping it and I'll tell you a story
after this about time we're shipping it
took twice as long as building it but
once you've shipped to a hundred percent
it's looking good your users are liking
it enough to say that it's a good idea
it's still an MVP it's not the final
version of your feature so now you move
into a phase where you're improving and
you're essentially you're doing this
process in miniature over and over and
over again continuing to improve your
feature and over time the cost is going
down because people on the team are
moving on to other things you're doing
less and less you get the law of
diminishing returns and eventually your
features done except that you never that
you'll notice this cost never goes to
zero and why not because once you ship
something in your product you have to
support it forever
a new version of the JVM comes out and
breaks your feature and now you got to
go spend a few weeks fixing it you
update a database and something breaks
you have a piece in the UI and now you
want to add something else to UI and you
got to move it around or figure out
where it where it should be now you
always are gonna have a cost once
something's in the product so you want
to make sure that anything you add to
the product is additive and not
subtractive because you're gonna be
paying for it forever
you've never done so how do you fail
fast using this framework there's a lot
of ways you can find along the way here
that it was a bad idea
and it's a clippie instead of I don't
know I don't it's hard to think of a
success all of a sudden on stage I can
just think of lots of failures but these
are all techniques that I've used
adabo at Spotify to find out all along
the way is this a good idea or is this a
bad idea can we fail fast instead of
failing slow now I'm gonna tell you a
story about if my one of my failures my
biggest failure consequently it's also I
think one of Spotify his biggest
failures this is Spotify now I don't
know if you recognize this UI does
anybody know what Spotify now is besides
me it was released in Germany
Spotify now was this thing that we did a
couple years ago so fall of 2014 2014
Spotify new Apple music was coming out
we knew it and in fact we knew more or
less when it was going to come out we
didn't know many of the details of it
but we knew when it was coming out and
we wanted to beat them to market or not
beat them to market but we wanted to
prove to the world that we are a more
innovative company and that our product
was going to be better than anything
Apple was going to do
so we had a bunch of ideas that we'd
been playing with that were and think it
phases and we decided to take those
ideas put them together in a narrative
and release a big announcement so this
is not how Spotify works spa PHY works
with this think it build a chip it's
weak it it's new stuffs happening all
the time in the product don't do a lot
of big announcements and in fact every
big announcement we'd ever done had been
a horrible failure but we try we decide
now we really wanted a major press event
so he collected a bunch of stuff I was
the head the development lead
essentially the what we called it
Spotify the road manager I was the one
for the development aspect in my my peer
the VP product I worked with he was the
head for product and then we had a head
of UX so the three of us were
essentially responsible for this big
project it was the largest projects
about if I ever did hundreds of
developers tons of marketing and
licensing it was a huge massive project
Spotify was happy you don't know about
it but it's also sad that you don't know
about it because they've tried really
hard to make you know about it so this
included stuff like video and podcasts
and Spotify running a party this user
interface Spotify now the idea was that
it was going to be the right music for
any moment to your day you launch the
app and you get the perfect playlist for
you right now
that was the idea and we spent about six
months building this which was also a
very long time for Spotify Spotify
doesn't like working on projects that
are that long and along the way people
inside the company we were using it and
we were starting to say this doesn't
feel right this app this doesn't we're
not sure this is a good idea so we were
able to convince the company marketing
and etc please please please let us test
this with real users somehow we know we
don't want the press to find out about
it but we still want we still need to
test it and so we got
approval we gave it to a bunch of users
in New Zealand and just luckily none of
them were press people so a little group
of users in New Zealand got the features
and then we waited we shipped it to them
and then we waited to see what would
happen and what we saw was amazing we we
used second week retention as an
important metric for us to know if this
was a good feature or not and what we
saw was a 6% increase in second week
retention 6% is ridiculously large for a
company like Spotify at that scale it is
impossible to move a metric a whole
digit and we'd moved it six percent so
we were all doubts were gone we've done
something amazing something almost
impossible and we can't will relate to
release it so we're super excited at
that point we scheduled the press event
because we knew we had a hit and we
couldn't wait the day of the press event
came the senior leadership was in New
York with all the famous people and then
me and my peers we were with all the
development team in Stockholm watching
the event on video and the minute they
said you know made the announcement we
flipped the switch and 1% of our users
in Germany the US the UK and Sweden got
the feature of course we weren't dumb
enough to actually release it to a
hundred percent of our users all at once
and this turned out to be a really good
thing so we released it to 1% in our
four biggest markets and then we waited
we waited to see is the idea are we
going to see another 6 percent increase
in retention and every day I'm going to
the analyst I'm going what have we got
what do we got and they're saying oh we
don't have enough data we don't have
enough data just wait coming back next
day well we're starting to get some data
not really sure right now just come back
again and then next day yeah it's not
quite what we thought but we don't have
statistical significance yet so don't
worry come back you know next week and
then finally we got two statistical
significance and we didn't see a 6
percent increase
we saw 1 percent decrease in retention
now that means
millions of dollars lost if we roll this
out we would just lose money
we would lose customers so we couldn't
roll it out but we just had a massive
press event where we told the world
here's all these cool features that
we're doing we're amazingly innovative
company forget about that other company
in in California we're much better and
we couldn't give this feature to anybody
because they would just get hurt us and
that started the beginning of a several
month long shipit process where we now
had we had a big problem because we
didn't know that we'd done so much in
one release we couldn't figure out what
we'd done wrong we had released a big we
had a big failure instead of a little
failure and so it was extremely
difficult for us to know what we'd
screwed up so we had to spend months
tweaking this thing with this 1% user
group and of course we were losing them
so we had to keep adding new people in
because we weren't retaining them as
well as we should have been and
eventually we actually got to the point
it was still taking us taking us too
long to learn this way so eventually out
we had to do the math to figure out how
many millions of dollars would we lose
if we went from 1% to 5% because we just
can't wait the amount of time it takes
to get to statistical significance on 1%
and we did this through the spring
through the summer and into the fall
this was incredibly difficult time for
the team that built it for me for the
company because we just didn't we were
just blind because we had failed big
instead of failing small but eventually
we figured it out we never got to 6% by
the fall we were able to roll out we had
a modest increase in retention to
probably I think I don't remember what
the exact number was somewhere around 1%
so it was ok you know wasn't what we'd
hoped for this UI you don't see because
this was part of the problem but along
this path as many month very painful
path this was a company that had a
culture of fail-safe which means that
I'll believe me this was big
failure and everybody knew about it but
we weren't being punished
we weren't we're being supported in the
learning we were being supported the
whole company was behind figuring out
what had happened and not placing blame
and firing people you know and now if
I'd been at Microsoft and done this I
would have been fired
probably Adobe to the fact that I we
weren't and we were able to spend a
bunch of months figuring this out was it
a true testament to a fail-safe
environment and by the way along the way
we learned a tremendous amount we had
missed of our users missed of the
product process problems and in fact I'm
sure you're curious one at what what one
of those problems the word the big one
was we found a bug in our a/b testing
system yeah it turns out we'd roll two
tests to the same cohort of users in New
Zealand we tended to do things and like
a lot of companies doing things in New
Zealand because when they don't want the
world to know about it
so one of the other tests we ran two
tests at the same group of users one
test was the Spotify now the other test
turned off advertising in the free
product because what we were trying to
what that what that team was trying to
do was find a floor or find a baseline
what would happen if we didn't have
advertising in our free product and I
can tell you if you would have a 7%
increase in retention we'd actually
screwed up their tests as well but the
things that we learned in doing this
process is what has fueled a lot of the
innovation that's come out of Spotify
since then stuff that's still shipping
stuff that stuff that I know about that
was being thought about before I left it
that's still coming out discover weekly
release radar daily mix all these things
partially came from the lessons that we
learned from this big failure and that's
important because Spotify has used this
failure to grow to capitalize on its
growth and grow 50% from when we had
this failure
and that's all the lessons that we've
learned from actually spending the time
to figure out what we've done wrong
learning the lessons and using it to to
move forward I'm going to leave you with
one parting thought failure is simply
the opportunity to begin again this time
more intelligently
