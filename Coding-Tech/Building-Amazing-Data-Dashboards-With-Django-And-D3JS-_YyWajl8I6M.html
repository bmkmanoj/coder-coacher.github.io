want to make one note about concepts the
dashboard that I'm going to show this is
all a case study based off the dashboard
that's built and just released his
open-source last week it's all based
around 9-1-1 data great so the problem
that I had to solve I started up my job
and they came to me and said hey we want
to go this dashboard that handles
millions of 911 records we have a
prototype here it is the prototype is
built it's a static site it uses a CSV
file for the back end it serves
everything in the front end and it's
cool but it really doesn't scale you can
see it here it looks nice but it really
doesn't scale and so they said hey we
would like for you to build something
better that we can really use millions
and millions of records for this is what
I ended up building and we'll look at it
in detail later but with this I built it
with the back end of Django where I do
all my data processing and then front
end using d3 d3 if you're not familiar
is a data visualization library in
JavaScript it's fairly intimidating who
in here is ever seen or been intimidated
by particularly d3 1 or JavaScript
that's awesome you're not gonna have to
see too much of it so part of my talk
actually recommends hey maybe you don't
wanna use d3
so the architecture of it so here's the
tools that I use this is my stack I use
Django of course it's right now I'm
learning on June you know 1:8 but I want
to upgrade it I don't mention the
database I use here I use post for
sequel which I see is kind of a
necessity for this and you'll see why
later I used to take the rest framework
which has been great for me I absolutely
love it
obscura library kanji no URL filter and
then on the JavaScript side I used
something called are active Jas this
gives us the ability to reactive
programming I'll kind of explain what
reactive programming is as we get
further into the dashboard and then d3
of course is my visualization library in
vd3 is a higher-level library on top of
that and then leaflet leaflet is a
mapping library that allow us to have
dynamic maps before we get started I
think just so we have context it'd be
nice to see what we're looking at so I'm
gonna pull that up right here so the
dashboard that I'm talking about this is
that this is using New Orleans data I
don't live in New Orleans and live in
Durham North Carolina
the Durham one is the one that I created
for my local police department this is
using public data and that's a really
good point this is open source so you
can use it with public data but here I
can see the call volume over time you
see it dips and then this is because we
don't have today's data yet
I can click through and see if I want to
see all general assistance calls only
like that now I'm just gonna drill
assistance calls I can see how heavy it
is all over town I can with response
time and see that the median response
time for general assistance calls is 5
minutes and 26 seconds for last two
weeks that's not too bad overall it
could be worse and then I can even look
and see all the calls by location
wow this is gonna work this clusters
them so I can go in look at individual
calls and see like this call right here
was complaint other and I can see high
call volume locations which this is
being used actually to attempt mental
health promise of community and some
places using that okay now that we just
have the like brief s over you how do
you build something like this with Dania
pool so this is the architecture and I'm
gonna come back to this again and again
so you're gonna get to see this again
but if you look here you can see I start
with a request that comes in I love the
page and then I sort of push everything
off to the front end where I'm handling
everything with d3 I'm using Django
really to generate summary stats which
are the summarizations that you see on
the front end it takes the filters that
come in and generates it okay Django how
about use video well so for Jake for the
ginger side of this I have an endpoint
for every page that you saw when I flip
through the dashboard so this is really
simple just there's three little
endpoints here at all they have a BPI
prefix because they all serve up JSON
responses they all serve very they try
to keep them compact and I they're all
summarized ahead of time most of that's
done in the database to make this as
fast as possible the way I approached
that was accounting this idea of a
summary model where I put all the
analysis that we need to do to display
it entirely actually on page in here
this is just a very small subset of it
you can see here in this I don't have a
laser pointer so it's gonna be hard to
point but that's okay you can see here
in this I have from a base one call
overview and then I used in my
subclasses this idea of annotations each
page is really about a specific subject
so we've got a page that's about the
amount of calls for especially for
department
planning they want to see the number of
calls for the public we really want to
see the response time I care a lot about
where this box time is in my community
and so I can have a different annotation
for that here but every one of the
particular irrigations I want to do
whether it's tick you know by day of
week by district by type of call by unit
all those different things I can do and
I just put the different annotations for
how I want to aggregate that side of
each one here you might notice in here
down the bottom on that last annotation
for the mean the average seconds of
officer response time seconds is not a
standard janggo function for the ORM so
I'll talk a little bit about why that
happened how useful it's been so
admission I use post or sequel and I
find that to be a necessity for this
sort of work because it really does have
some great things inside of it in terms
of being able to do different types of
queries that you can't necessarily do
because it goes outside the single
standard but here here's an example of
where I was able to build a custom
function around the jingle or my Django
was so useful we have our option if that
I was pressured at the beginning a
little bit to use a different technology
just because we had several people
internally who were very good at
javascript the discussion came up maybe
we should use node for this and one of
the big arguments that I made in favor
of using Django was how great it is at
letting us customize that ORM build
things around it to make it fit our
needs exactly so here and we'll help
reflection come precision where
depending on the amount of data that I
am looking at when I'm looking at a week
you know I'm looking at a month I'm
looking at a whole year of data it's
going to use a different precision when
we're looking at the data and you know
it may be month today or hour and then
down here at the bottom on volume by
date you know I have I truncate that
date by the precision so it's grouping
it together like fine we'll get a year
of data its competing together by month
I'm looking at less than that it's
coming together by day I'm looking at
less than
dey's grouping it together by our and
that it's gonna happen dynamically in
our dashboard just to take a quick look
here all right so last seven days when I
moved to last seven days here we're
suddenly looking at it by our and we can
really see what's happening if I go back
here and your date and then I'll change
that to a more custom range okay so
that's my day you can see by day and
then by going here and say oh yeah I'm
not January 2016 but January 2015 it
might be quicker to type that this is uh
this is why all right here let me click
apply Wow okay look at a future date I
was because I um him a nut I thought
this was August I don't know excited
there but now we're looking at it by
months this much flatter live so this is
a really cool feature that I was asked
for that
Django just made easy to do jeido plus
Postgres in this case when you see here
with this date trunk again that's not
standard function I had this whole thing
in my blog and I go into that function a
little bit further there I don't really
have time in five minutes to die set the
date trunk function but with something I
was able to add easily in this case I
was also able to add a granese aliy I
need the percentiles you know so I
worked at RTI international I work
specifically on our Center for data
science on a particularly heavy piece of
data science but in this case we really
wanted not just to see the average
response time but you know 75% of calls
what's their response time because
that's gonna matter a lot more that
average the class time can get
artificially lower but we really want to
be able to see what's the real response
time on the ground so with here I was
able to go in and say give me the
quartile
that is you know 20% of Falls how
quickly are they responded to 50% 75% of
the total number of calls lastly with
these summary models I just call a bunch
of functions and return a bunch of JSON
in this case you're seeing a data
structure here that gets turned into
JSON by Django rest framework and this
was this is for the volume page I've got
volume ID a source and all these
different types of ways that we want to
look at the volume and then we look at
the we also have the heat map which
shows by day of the week an hour what
the amount of calls were the key to this
and the key to doing one of the big
things that was demanded was jindal URL
filter so one of the big demands one of
the things that I had to have this
project was the ability for every view
to be bookmarked if they click through
on three different charts and they drove
down to say a in this district on
Mondays for general assistance calls
this is what I'm looking at we may want
to be able to send that to someone else
not just the book market so they can
look it up again but you know for people
who aren't necessarily a 10th floor they
just wanna do something quick you know
you've got you've got a say you've got a
lawyer who's looking at this public data
and wants to send it to their client or
you got someone within the police
station what's the send to the chief it
would just be able to zoom that URL so I
use Jane Doe URL filter now a lot will
be be familiar with Jacob filter just
because that's highly shown all the
jingle rest framework website it's a
separate library but it's often used
with Django rest framework legal URL
filter is its little brother that isn't
nearly as good but it's super hackable
and it's very small I shouldn't say it
sounds good it's just quirky right and
if you look at how many people use it
not many but it's very very hackable and
that was important because I had a
couple of things I need to do here the
big one was I needed to be able to call
query sent methods I had certain ways of
looking at my data that I couldn't just
put in a fight he'll call about objects
filter statement I needed to be able to
say hey I need everything during day
shift which is you know 7:00 a.m. to
7:00 p.m. and so I might make meth
my query set you certainly don't have to
understand this code up here but note
that what it does is it wilts here to
see if there's an attribute with that
filter name on the query set and if so
it just goes ahead and calls that
instead of sending it over to filter and
that became very very useful so you can
see here how it translates it right if I
have gift rameters of District seven in
nature ten those will go straight to
filter but shift because shift is up is
a method on my query set will get called
here if that's one of the parameters the
other big cackles I need to build my
filter from a data structure instead of
building it from classes and objects the
reason why is because I have a filter
and I have a way ways to select it own
my front-end I didn't want to have to
recreate that right one of the easiest
ways to make mistakes and programming is
by repeating yourself because you will
never get exactly the same and so I
certainly didn't wanna do that here I
want to be able to have this data
structure right here which is a pretty
arcane data structure like most things
that you put together while you're
coding it you know this is sort of
putting that you're playing together
while that follows init it got a little
funky but it's up you know relatively
self-explanatory what's happening here
I've got filters based on time received
and based off shift and district and
nature group and whether or not the call
was cancelled and with this it can just
translate it straight in JSON and then
my friend can consume that to build all
the filters that I have along the top of
the page we'll see that again when we go
back to look at it
my each guy in points were sold there's
not a lot of detail to go in to own them
but you can see here a call it takes
those parameters from the request which
are gonna be up the top of the page or
be in the URL bar right so it's bookmark
boy and send other people and then it's
just gonna take my overview model or my
summary model call to dipped on it and
send that back nothing major there the
front end is where this get really
interesting and how it works with Django
so my friend I mentioned that it's
reacted so what do I mean by that
Grantham really just means that they
is flow of data there's events that
happen there's things that monitor those
events and react to them in this case
the things that you might see someone do
while uses pages they change filters
which they can do in one or two places
right they can click a drop-down that
let's pull that up so if you click one
these drop downs like I just want to
look at Monday you can see the URL
changes up here immediately and it
reloads I might also say I just want to
look at this district right so this
updates in two different places and the
thing I just selected here at District
three I could slip District seven here
or I could go in here and clear it right
I have two different ways that I can
update these filters but every time I do
the URL stop the page changes the
application watches for those changes in
the URL right if I went changing or I'll
just by manually changing it I went here
and said I don't care abouts nature
group but would really expect someone to
do this but they might have a bookmark
in that case this would be necessary it
was for those changes in the URL and
then it says request to the backend for
new data
he gets that request back we have made
the data and when the data is updated
the page is updated if anyone's ever
written like a fairly complex JavaScript
application using pretty standard tools
we'll say you just use jQuery which is
an awesome library but whenever you have
something new you need to update there's
a lot of linkages you have two different
ways that you can update something now
you've got a link both of them with this
sort of way of looking at it it made it
very easy to add new controls to add new
charts and not have to have sort of an
exponentially growing so that linkages
like I said we have been programming the
big words that you might care about are
unidirectional right everything flowed
one way you know would this change
happen and then this would happen this
would happen I don't have data syncing
two different ways and then it was data
flow right data go away and I've been
driven so let's this is a sort of a
summary of the different events and the
reactions that I saw in my application
and all of these look kind of
synchronous right when a user puts on a
charcoal filter changes when the filter
changes the URL hashes update but
that this is asynchronous and that was
part of this that worked really well
because it means I can come in at
different points there's no direct chain
of things I have to do if any of these
things change the things that should
happen happen right so like I showed
what I just go and change the URL cache
manually the Ajax request it is sent for
new call data and then each one of those
charts actually monitors a specific
subset of the data so if only that
subset changes then only that chart
updates a pretty slick way of doing
things this is a similar thing to what
you see if anyone's ever used react j/s
it's the same model but our active was
what we use because it was a little
simpler it worked really well with
Django and it was written by people I
respect over at the Guardian is a simple
component that you might see so I've got
some jumps up here that shows I've got a
template and then I've got this data
hidden true thing right so I have a
little chart header I want to hide and
open in fact you can see it right here
hey pretty simple stuff not normally
complicated but here I have the template
where you can see you know since like
unless hidden show this right this is it
rendered once it monitors the data which
is the whole point of the way this
dashboard works is it monitors the data
to update so as soon as the data updates
this is weird okay
I haven't talked about d3 at all yet let
me have five minutes so but what I was
going to say about d3 is there are d3 is
really it can be easily thought of as a
toolkit for building visualizations it
is not particularly good to think of it
as a chart library because it's not a
chart library would give you some charts
d3 gives you a lot of tools I sort of
describe it as you know you can get you
it's like a bag of Lotus parts you can
build your Lotus it's gonna be awesome
but you got to build it and so getting
you know going into picking up a Ford
Taurus from a lot it's sometimes a
smarter move and there's a lot of
the library's on top of III that I
recommend I used any d3 because I liked
it styling it didn't really mobilize
doing but there's a lot of other ones to
look at one I've been using recently is
plotly Jas the team behind flatly
open-source their JavaScript library
it's awesome it's also like two
megabytes it's giant that's the only
downside but here you can see a simple
chart object that I built this
higher-level object on top of the three
you know it says so filter things by dad
we perceive when I click on it and
that's the formatting stuff in there and
then I have this monitor chart and this
is how I hold up the reactive nature of
this
so whenever data and the volume by day
of week subset of that data tree changes
then call update on this chart all my
chart objects have a create and update
method that's really that's the entire
API behind my entire system here's when
the page loads call create when the data
updates call update monitor chart is
simple it just takes up what's called a
key path to given sort of a pin to the
tree of data and says hey call this
function when that changes unless the
page is currently loading that was a
little protection I put in there because
a lot of stuff in a synchronously
loading the heat map was where I
actually use d3 for real the heat map
was very very cool to show how to do
this would require an entire class on d3
which I am NOT going to go but and the
great part is I built it directly off of
one of Mike Moustakas samples on his
exit site blocks org if you're
interested in doing visualizations
because amazing examples there it was
cool until I was teaching some people
data science and then one of them made
their example project had exact same
heat map in it okay I guess more than
one person has looked at that example
but this heat map here showing you know
by day of week and by hour how many
calls there are and again I just have a
great date function so I was able to
plug this into the way everything else
works very easily by having is create an
update function so every one of my
visualizations has the same API because
of the way the data flow works so Maya
lessons learned
firstly was for building something
that's so data intensive like a
dashboard reactive programming really
simplifies those interactions it made it
much more simple to work with I learned
that I should always do hire full timers
on top of d3 I started by not doing that
and I bled on my computer for it it was
not fun
I really really that was like two weeks
that I've ever get back talk about this
in here but this is an open source
application you can look at it when you
have serious for an in work happening
when I had quite simple front-end work I
like to just use the standard sort of
Django asset pipeline tools I like
genuine compressor myself but for
serious burning work we have a lot of
stuff going on using webpack and Django
webpack loader is really great really
simple I was able to use it with this
and even make a plug-in system for it it
works really really well running we're
getting near the end so again it more
sense to you now that the reactive
programming how it works how all these
things are connected if you want to see
the code behind this there's a link at
the bottom to get io / CFS you can look
at the code there and if you go to CFS
to demo the RK ICDs Network that's a
mouthful you can actually play with the
application with the live New Orleans
data and that makes nightly so it should
continue to have live data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
