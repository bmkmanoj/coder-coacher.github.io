blog there if you want to ask me any
questions first of all please come and
see me because I am here and I would
love to talk to you but if you can't or
you think of something later
hit me up there and I'll do my best to
get back to you and as we mentioned the
title of my talk is beyond media queries
and essentially I will be talking about
responsive design without media queries
but I'm not trying to say that media
queries are bad and that we shouldn't
use them and in fact there will be many
examples in this talk where I do make
use of media queries but where I do that
this is going to be a deliberate choice
rather than just assuming that this is
the default way to do responsive design
I'm going to talk about the changing
role of media queries and some of the
features and characteristics that media
queries have techniques that we can use
as an alternative to media queries and
why we might reach for those rather than
more familiar patterns so essentially
I'm saying that media queries are not
the only tool for responsive design and
this means that I want you to think
about things like flexbox CSS grid
viewport units calculations and CSS
custom properties as well and one thing
that all of these features have in
common is that they're relatively new to
CSS media queries on the other hand have
been around for quite a while now and so
long in fact that I think there'll be
many competent designers and developers
here today who haven't had to work
without media queries media queries are
strongly tied to how we think about
responsive design and in fact the idea
for responsive design kind of emerged as
a result that media queries media
queries were originally intended for
things like print and projectors and
other things so we kind of equate the
two in our head and media queries are
seen as the solution for making
something responsive and because of that
it's not often that we think about
exactly how media queries work but media
queries do have specific features and
characteristics that make them ideal or
less ideal for certain tasks they allow
us to change CSS properties at a
specific point in the design and this
typically means that our components or
our layout will jump from one state to
another
and of course that's okay if that's what
you're trying to do but it often seems
that this is just a default choice and
these default choices seem to be
reflected in our design processes as
well so as designers or implementers of
designs so pretty much all of us here we
usually have two primary screen sizes in
mind a small screen and a large screen
or a device in a desktop and I know that
you probably think about more than just
these two but these two become
particularly important because they
represent an upper and a lower bounds
for our design and when we adjust
properties at or between these two
screen sizes what we're doing is a
little bit like interpolation and you'll
be familiar with interpolation from
animation and CSS transitions but we
interpolate values in responsive design
as well albeit manually and often
unknowingly and we'll do this at fixed
points right as the screen size gets
smaller this typically somewhere in the
design where it's put under some
pressure by the constraints imposed by
smaller screen real estate and a
breakpoint represents where that design
sort of cannot withstand that pressure
anymore and the appropriate response is
to adjust some aspects of that design so
designers choose breakpoints carefully
and they probably have in mind where
constraints like screen size begin to
put pressure on design and how quickly
that affects the overall quality and for
a long time media queries have been seen
as the best tool available for
alleviating that pressure on design but
in many ways there are compromise to
technology because we're forced to
choose that single point where the
design should change and we usually know
that immediately before and after that
point the design is still under some of
the pressure by other constraints that
dictator there's something needed to
change and I think that it's feasible to
say that some aspects of design should
perhaps very directly in relation to the
viewport rather than only at these fixed
points and that's what this graph here
sort of intends to illustrate I've got
the two ideal sort of screen sizes and a
gradient there that shows the closer you
get to a breakpoint or the further away
from those ideal States the more signs
of pressure we see on design
and this little step line here shows how
CSS properties typically change they say
at one value and then they step to
another but some properties could
perhaps have a more I sort of smooth
transition from one value to another and
font size is of course a great example
of that but not the only one so I
understand this graphs a little bit
difficult to comprehend so I build a
tool that can scientifically measure the
amount of pressure in a design and I
want to show you how this changes in
relation to breakpoints so this is a
little site that I made but it's a real
layout and this is it at around twelve
hundred pixels or so or what I would
call close to its ideal desktop state
now and you can see up there the
pressure needle is right in the green
area but if I reduce the screen size
down to around 900 pixels you'll see
that the layout changes and we begin to
see some signs of pressure there's a
fair amount of white space under there
and that same kind of added balance in
relation to the size of the image and
this text here is become a little bit
longer than I'd expect now and it's sort
of wrapping onto multiple lines you know
in a way that's not ideal so some signs
of pressure there but if I reduce this
down again to what would be like an
ideal sort of tablet size or a large
mobile phone it's the same layout that
those signs of pressure are gone and
it's a similar story if we go down to
the smallest sort of small device that's
fairly balanced there but if I take that
up just a little bit you can see the
images become a little bit too large
difficult to read maybe there's a bit
too much space around the menu all of
these things are fairly sort of simple
nothing really broke but sometimes that
is what happens and although I made this
example it's sort of fairly typical of a
lot of sites that we build we do design
for these ideal States and I think this
shows that the closer we get to those
breakpoints we sort of tend to see these
signs of pressure so if you're a
designer here I want you to think about
how we can alleviate some of those signs
of pressure without necessarily making a
hard cut from one UI state to another a
predetermined screen sizes right
now that I've said all this I want to
show you some ways that we can do that
and fluid topography is the first
example that I want to explore and I
feel that fluid topography can make
working with responsive design and
responsive components a lot easier and a
lot more flexible and forgiving in some
cases so we're all familiar with how
responsive design works using media
queries right or responsive typography I
mean and you can see that at specific
rate points it's sort of changing there
and it's a little bit clunky I've never
found this ideal we're forced to use
these multiple points where things
change and it doesn't necessarily change
in relation to other things on the page
which means with headings and things
this can sometimes cause trouble so
viewport units are an alternative to
this and I think we're all somewhat
familiar with how a viewport units work
now but for amusements sake could I get
a show of hands of how many people have
used viewport units in the last year
okay so we're probably looking at more
than half when I first sort of started
asking this it was only a handful of
people but I think they're entering more
of our collective consciousness and I
think that's a good thing because we can
start to think about solving design
problems there have fluid solutions so
for anyone that hasn't seen them this is
pretty much how they work and as you can
see everything scales smoothly here it's
uniform there's no text reflow it's
almost like resizing an image though if
you put you in a Sun ideal when you get
down to really small screen sizes they
can become infinitesimally small or
large as well on larger screens I can't
read that I don't know about you and as
well as this we can't control the rate
at which viewport units scale so if I
wanted to have a font size of 15 pixels
at a screen resolution of 500 pixels I
could choose three viewport widths but
if I wanted to fluidly transition that
value to 32 pixels at a resolution of
800 I couldn't do this not without
changing from three viewport whit's
to four viewport widths so essentially
with viewport width units I'm confined
to a single column at this table I can't
control the rate at which it scales so
I'm going to show you how we can solve
these problems that the minimum and
maximum font sizes and this rate of
scale
but before we can do that I think we
need to get a little bit of a better
understanding of unit types and values
and also how calc equations work and I
recognize that that doesn't sound
particularly fun so let's start off with
a quiz now I just want you to shout out
the answer
how many unit types are there in CSS no
no don't think about it just shout three
there are in fact 27 units in CSS I
counted them all this includes
percentages I don't really know if
percentages are a unit but I don't
really care
the next question I have from you is how
many do you use for five I think if any
one sort of said more than three or four
they might be lying I tend to only use
about three or four in any one project
and this begs the question what what's
the unique potential of the other 2324
that we're not regularly using so we
still frequently see these arguments
about which unit types the best
particularly in relation to EMS our arms
and pixels and we mean this in a general
sense and generally for font sizes and
sadly I think that these arguments miss
the point every unit has unique
characteristics that make them better or
worse for particular tasks and many of
us don't understand these three most
common ones that we typically use so am
units are relative to the current font
size now and this makes them great for
things like padding and margin or
sometimes font sizes in fluid components
and I'll show you more about that later
pixels are ideal for things like borders
and sometimes for positioning things
around icons or images or other elements
that have a fixed width in REM units or
REM units these are relative to the
route font size and that it that means
the route am which is the font size of
the HTML element on the web and if you
change the value of the font size of the
HTML element this will change everything
that's directly and indirectly relative
to that so that means all REM units
most DM units as well and this has
always been the case but it's never been
more useful than with fluid topography
and changing the route e/m can be a
really useful technique for applying
some fluid topography techniques and
again I will show you those later but
first of all we need to get a little bit
of a better understanding of calc now
we mentioned before that the viewpoint
units have some limitations so character
is going to be one of those things that
can help us solve that and calc allows
us to perform simple mathematical
operations in our CSS and this means
addition subtraction multiplication and
division and there's five rules that I
want you to know about calc but that
sounded too hard so I can then sit down
into two and a half rules so the first
rule that I want you to know about calc
is that you can add and subtract units
with a similar type and what I mean by
type here is things like color time
frequency there's all these groups of
units in CSS and you don't need to know
what they are they're kind of intuitive
and in these examples I'm going to be
talking about length units and that
means basically anything that has a
length right pixels am's
our EMS so looking at this example here
we have 10 pixels plus 2 REM now we know
that the REM is the root element and we
know that the default size of that is 16
pixels so two REM is going to be 32
pixels plus 10 pixels is going to be 42
pixels all right pretty simple the
answer to life the universe and
everything a blue guitry nerd example
but that works because we've got a
length value on both sides of the
equation there and it's the same with
this one here so 100 pixels minus 50
pixels is going to be 50 pixels that's
pretty straightforward but if I didn't
have 100 pixels I had a hundred bananas
or whatever that wouldn't work okay so
the second rule is you can multiply and
divide CSS units by real numbers so it's
kind of the inverse of the other rule so
in the first example there we have three
times to REM we know the two REM is 32
pixels so this is going to be 96 pixels
and in the second example 300 pixels
divided by 3 is going to be a hundred
pixels so you can see we have a whole
number on one side of that equation
there
and the other half rule that I want you
to know is that normal mathematical
order of operations applies and this
means that you can use things like
brackets and you can also use cap other
calc equations kind of like brackets so
you can miss them and that's it that's
easy right
everyone understands count okay so are
you prepared to be tested on that the
thing is I've always wanted to host a
game show and I thought there being here
at smashing conferred maybe be the best
chance they ever got so I apologize this
is mostly for me so my game show works a
little like this I'm going to ask you a
calque equation and then I'm going to
I'm going to show you a cap equation
then I'm going to ask you is that valid
and I need you to shout out yes or no
and I encourage you to do this audience
participation is vital this could end
really badly and by that I mean for me
should be entertaining for you either
way so let's do it all right
I think we can made that out now all
right so the first one is 10 pixels plus
1 REM is that valid yes all right you're
good at this all right the next one is
to REM times 3 is that wait for it is
that valid yes all right so to REM
divided by 5 is that valid yes all right
10 pixels minus 3 is that valid oh good
one all right to REM times 3 is that
valid yeah
enthusiasm is waiting isn't it all right
so the last one to REM divided by yellow
is that valid no that's ridiculous all
right but it's not really that
ridiculous right like if you had to REM
/ like so if you had to REM divided by a
hundred pixels it would be kind of
similar right you wouldn't know what to
do with that so it's almost common sense
right okay so now that we have a bit of
an understanding of that let's get to
solving some problems with calc so that
mean font size problem that we had we
can set a minimum font size with calc
right so if we said 18 pixels plus 3
viewport width this would mean that at a
viewport resolution of 0 the font size
would be exactly 18 pixels and from
there it would scale at the same rate as
three viewport units so that's great but
more often than not we might want to set
a minimum font size that our viewport
resolution other than zero and this is
where we can use media queries oh
they're not bad so let's do um sediments
fixed font size to begin with and then
above 600 pixels we'll set that to three
viewport width and if we do the
calculations right we can work out the
exact point where three viewport weights
equals 18 pixels and it works a little
bit like this it's just the font size
divided by the number of viewport units
are divided by a hundred and this means
that there'll be no jump between a fixed
and a fluid value and you can see that
that's exactly where I placed the media
query there so those of you that have
been paying particular attention and
that means all of you you will realize
that we can do
for a max font size as well so if I did
24 divided by 3 divided by 100 then I
would get 800 pixels and that's where
I've placed that media query and I'm
just doing the reverse I'm going from a
fluid value to a fixed value so we
haven't gotten rid of media queries
entirely here but that wasn't our goal
now what we have done is we've limited
the role of media queries to one thing
here and we've got a tool here that
allows us to alleviate some of that
pressure on design but we haven't solved
all of the problems right we're still
confined to a single column of this
table we're not controlling the rate of
scale and before we were calculating
what those screen sizes should be for
those breakpoints we weren't choosing
them so we still got some problems there
and we can control that rate of scale
with some advanced fluid typography
techniques we can have font sizes that
scale between specific pixel values over
a specific viewport range and this means
that you can have sizes that start and
stop scaling exactly where you need them
to and it looks a little bit like this
now I do realize that looks a little bit
scary but it's not this is just a
mathematical function that takes a value
within a range and works out what a new
value would be if it was applied to a
different range so if I had the number
50 in a range between one and a hundred
and I wanted to apply that to a new
range between 1 and 200 my new value
would be a hundred because both of those
are right in the middle of their
respective ranges it's a linear
interpolation function for any one
mathematical so the only thing here this
method works with EMS are EMS or pixels
or any other type of unit that you like
to use the only caveat is and because of
some of the rules we mentioned about
count you have to use the same values
everywhere in this equation for it to
work so if you're using EMS for font
size you're using EMS for screen size as
well so that's fairly straightforward
and it simplifies quite nicely so this
is what it looks like and as you can see
the font will scale down and it gets to
a minimum size and it stops scaling and
likewise it gets larger and then it
stops there so that's pretty
straightforward but is anyone feeling a
little bit like this Mike I want to use
fluid typography but this is a
using I don't want to have to remember
stuff and that's fair enough because
remembering stuff is the worst I hate it
so just use a mixin right forget
everything we learned let's just use SAS
and by SAS I mean anything you like to
use whether it's less stylus post CSS
there'll be some kind of method for
doing this if you can't locate one now
get in touch and I'll point you in the
right direction so this is pretty cool
so who here has heard of modular scales
okay so for those that haven't I think
it's best described visually so each
heading in this scale here is 1.2 times
the size of the previous heading this
means that as they get larger the
variation in size also gets larger and
the golden ratio is another example of
one of these types of scales this one
here is called the minor 3rd 1.2 and
some people say that there's something
that's naturally aesthetically pleasing
about these that they're good for design
they found naturally in nature and all
of this other people say that that's
bullshit I don't really mind it's a
really good system for me to base my
font sizes off particularly for headings
and stuff and it's no less aesthetically
pleasing than anything I personally
would choose on my own but if you want
to use them as a guide and then and then
alter those values you can do that so
the techniques that I'm about to show
you are going to work for non precise
mathematical scales as well so how do we
calculate them by modular scale starting
with a base one size of say 16 pixels we
multiply that by the ratio so 1.2 times
16 will give us a 19 point 2 and then
with that answer we multiply that again
by the ratio to go up the scale and we
can divide to go down the scale so
that's super easy right but who has time
for that right so just go to type scale
com pick a font size that you like for
large screens pick a font size that you
like for small screens now I like to
have a more varied scale for large
screens and a more uniform scale for
small screens you can do the reverse or
you can do whatever you want and then
you just pop them in that mixing that I
showed you before something like this
against your headings or whatever other
values you want and it looks something
like this so
me headings have always been something
that causes me problems at different
screen sizes they're typically one of
the first things to wrap they come in
various different lengths and because of
their larger size it's usually
problematic with responsive design and
this is something that can really easily
be applied to existing sites and I've
done this for a number of sites
including for Australian government
I think cope in blogs are using this as
well as the CSS tricks website smashing
magazines doing it in their redesign so
this thing's been fairly well tested and
if you're going to try one thing from
this talk I'd really like you to give
this a go just because it's so good so I
have a fluid typography collection on
cope in where you can find more examples
of this kind of stuff and if you want to
take a closer look at that you'll find
all of the details of this and other
examples that I'm showing you today
including this one so if you're
interesting this one I strongly
recommend that you have a look at the
code there's about a blog post worth of
comments in the code there and I don't
have time to go into all of it today but
I just want you to have a look at how
this particular thing is changing in
relation to the viewport but also have a
look at what's not changing okay so
apart from using papaya whip as the
background colour here there are three
other important choices that I made in
the code and I want to draw your
attention to those the first is that I
opted to set the HTML HTML element to a
fluid value and this means that I'm
opting for sort of fluid typography by
default if you don't change anything if
you do this and don't change anything
else all of your font sizes will be
fluid because of that relationship with
a.m. and REM values so this is a really
good technique for sites with a strong
typography base design but perhaps not
as good for things with lots of UI
components or complex patterns so that's
what one that you can use for a sort of
typography design the other thing is I'm
setting I'm using the body element like
a container here and I'm setting its
value to 25 REM now because I've changed
the value of the rooty m to a fluid
value this means that the width of my
container has a relationship to the font
size and this is really great if you're
looking to maintain a perfect reading
length of say 45 or 75 characters per
line somewhere between that range is
said to be a
good for reading and finally I opted to
set a fixed font size on the figure
caption element kind of to show you that
you can use fluid and fixed values
together but it also allowed me to
maintain some other symmetries in that
design so what I mean by that is the
length of the title compared to the
width of the column of text the height
of the figure caption and the picture in
relation to the lead paragraph there
that's emphasized and also consistent
line length in in all areas here and you
can see some of those symmetries there
despite the differences in your slight
differences in lay out those height
things are maintained and you wouldn't
be able to do something like this
without fluid typography and with just
media queries alone so I think there's
some interesting potential for things
that we can do with that just very
quickly one final example I said before
that all unit types have unique
characteristics and unique potential and
in the last example despite the changing
font size I was able to maintain a
relationship with the container within
the ideal line like there in this
example we're using fluid typography but
we're not changing the value of the
route am and so this is where knowing
what CH units are about can be really
useful so in this one here I'm using CH
values and one C H represents the width
of a zero glyph in the current font size
and this means that CH values are almost
directly equivalent to characters per
line and so here I've set a width in CH
values and that's relative to this font
size here that I've set on the same
column of text I've then used Flex
properties so that the image will take
up the rest of the remaining space in
that so CH units can be really useful
with fluid typography where you're not
setting it as a default and I think we
should all be using uch values a lot
more because they don't just work in
this context and this kind of brings me
to flex box I had flex box in my
previous example and of course flex box
itself is a responsive pattern and I
think we're probably all fairly familiar
right with our flex box works it's
probably changed how a lot of you do
layout in CSS already so I'm not going
to go into the specifics of how flex box
works but I do want to take a look at
some of its unique responsive
Bertie's so we can stretch and grow
items within a Flex container and we can
put boundaries on those items so they
won't grow or shrink beyond specific
sizes we can then use flex wrap so that
when they overflow onto a new row they
can take up the rest of the available
space or be scented or justified and
this video shows different ways in which
you can do this so this is a unique
responsive property of Flex box because
it's relative to the container width
rather than the view than the viewport
and this is why I think that flex box
can be really useful for the layout of
things inside components but not
necessarily for our overall page layouts
and one challenge that we sometimes
encounter when we're using flex wrap is
when we want an item with a fixed width
next to an item that takes up the rest
of the remaining space kind of like that
meteor object type pattern there but
when we get the smaller screens I want
both items to take up the full space
kind of like this card pattern here so
we've got sort of items that are
shrinking and growing and wrapping and
it sounds like something that flexbox
can do so can flex box do this and the
answer is it can but it doesn't really
want to if I give the first item a Flex
basis of 0 AB so Flex basis of the width
that I want that image to be and a flex
Gro value of 0 it worked kind of well
and as a media object but when we rap to
this card pattern it's not filling up
any of the remaining space so kind of
problematic so if I give both of them a
flex Gro value of 1 this works as a card
pattern that is a media object it's sort
of both they're getting extra space and
resizing so it's no longer fixed and
that's kind of problematic as well so
the trick to solving this is to give the
first item a flex grow value of 1 and
the second one a flex grow value of
something like nine nine nine nine and
this means that when they're on the same
row together that second item will be
allocated all of the extra spaces so
this grow value is going to dominate the
other one and essentially this prevents
an item from growing unless it's on its
own line and that's what we see with
that technique and this technique is
called the Flex grow $9.99 hack or at
least that's
I call it and it's something that keeps
getting rediscovered by different people
I first heard about it in 2014 on a blog
post by I've got the name here
john van hee and it's one of the only
posts that john wrote so it's worth
mentioning that it's based on techniques
that Zooey McClure Gillenwater did
around the same time and this is a
really good way to handle responsive
design at a component level and you can
use it to create things like this so
this is the example that I was talking
about before with the Flex crow 999 hack
and I'm also using a CSS property called
object fit to sort of resize that image
and you might be wondering well why is
my image not being stretched or cropped
in weird ways as you might be familiar
with when you use object fit I'm really
glad you asked because the answer is SVG
is amazing SVG is another area that has
a ton of potential for responsive design
I often see SVG used as an alternative
image format or a solution for icons and
I think that people do this because they
have this idea of they know how images
should work on the web but SVG has
responsive properties that go well
beyond vector scaling it has a unique
positioning and coordinate system that's
entirely different from the box model
and it also has its own document context
in certain situations and this can be
really useful for creating scopes CSS
and I will show you what I mean by that
in a moment but if you think of SVG just
like any other image format if we gave
it a width of 100% it should stretch and
scale to fit the available space like
this and you won't be surprised to learn
that scalable vector graphics are really
good at doing this they tend to be
pretty sharp at any resolution but let's
imagine for a moment that this isn't
just any other image on the web and how
might a traditional artist adapt
something like that border flourish for
different sized pages and the answer is
they probably wouldn't just uniformly
scale the design it's more likely that
the corner flourishes and the center
diamond would remain around the same
size and the length of the connecting
line would be changed and this is
something that we can do with SVG as
well and I'm not going to go into all
the details of this example
but I will say that it's a little known
fact that the view box attribute is an
optional attribute on SVG and without
one it will establish establish a
coordinate system relative to its parent
context and in this case this means the
image element here and this means that
now we can do things like this so if you
really want to understand the details of
that document context and positioning
system I recommend Sarah Siddons
excellent articles and in-depth articles
on the SVG coordinate system as well as
Emilia blah me Roy's articles on scaling
SVG that helped a lot when I was doing
these but I wanted to take things even
further than this and I mentioned before
that SVG when it's in a reference
context and that means anything other
than inline that the CSS inside that SVG
is scoped and this includes media
queries so this means that we can adjust
what parts of the image is showing at
different sizes and this means the size
of the image not the size of the
viewport so you can see in this example
here I'm hiding and showing different
parts of the corner flourish and that's
a really sort of useful technique and
it's responsive rather not relative to
the viewport and with the same technique
this means that we can create responsive
art directed images right so although we
have picture element and source set and
they're fairly widely supported with
some exceptions in IE and stuff we can
also use SVG to do this now one
disadvantage of this over the picture
and saw set is that everything inside of
the SVG is going to be loaded there's no
potential to prioritize particular
assets sort of depending on the default
screen size that the person loads it
with but on the flip side this technique
works anywhere SVG works and then
includes in older versions of ie and we
can do things that like SVG filters or
any other techniques that we could do
with CSS or SVG - so depending on the
situation it won't necessarily result in
a larger file size so I think we should
use this sort of creatively where it
makes sense in addition to the picture
and source set alright so I want to go
back to layout very briefly our CSS grid
is another feature that can help us
and some of the dependency that we have
on media queries and in fact I think
it's one of the most significant because
it's a bit like flexbox in that it's a
responsive technology designed to help
us solve layout problems it's not some
hack or some trick or or some
alternative technique that we use to
avoid media queries it's just an
everyday technology which up until now
it's it solves problems which happen
till now it seemed like media queries
were the best solution for and of course
I don't want to have a grid in detail
mostly because Rachel did such a
fantastic job of that this morning and I
don't think I could do any better so I
choose not to try but I do want to
highlight a few specific responsive
features of grid and one of the great
responsive features of grid is the
ability to auto place items that haven't
been given an explicit position and in
this example here despite the changing
screen size there's no media queries
whatsoever I mean I know that this
example looks a little bit chaotic but
it is possible to use these techniques
in a bit more subtle and controlled way
and you might have seen this this an
example like this was in Rachel's talk
as well the CSS properties here grid
template columns and grid template rows
allow us to define the shape of the grid
and it's the values repeat min max
autofill an auto fit that allow us to
define these complex repeating patterns
and basically this just says for all of
my columns I want you to repeat a
pattern I want you to auto fit as many
items as you can I want them to have a
minimum size of 400 pixels and if
they're above 400 pixels I want them to
have them in a maximum size of one
fraction which essentially means to try
and make them all like equally sized so
that's pretty straightforward
and this example here extends on these
ampuls that I just showed you with the
SVG and flexbox so using grid on the
outside to determine the overall layout
of items and flexbox on the inside to do
that wrapping and that 999 trick there
means that we can iterate through these
different layouts at different screen
sizes and none of this is directly
relative to the viewport so I think it's
an incredibly useful combination and
this example here unbelievably isn't
using any media queries whatsoever
but of course some designs do need media
queries and one of the difficulties that
we have with responsive design that
relies heavily on media queries is that
no matter how we organize our CSS the
the properties related to different
items can become scattered across
different media rules within within the
CSS so CSS custom properties is
something that can help organize some of
that responsive logic and make working
with media queries a lot easier so the
main difference between custom
properties and variables in pre
processes is that custom properties can
change and that might not sound that
surprising because variables typically
do change right but variables in
pre-processors are static this means
that we can update it at different
points in the compilation process but
when it's rendered to CSS it's always
going to be the same and typically you
can read something like that and you
will always know what the value of the
color variable is going to be custom
properties on the other hand are dynamic
this means that we can use media queries
and selectors to update the value of
custom properties and the computed value
of that variable will only be changed
when that is rendered in the browser so
I think that this makes custom
properties and static variables useful
for different things
I think static variables are really
useful for writing dry organize code and
dynamic burials can really be helpful
for organizing responsive logic so I
think that it makes sense for all of the
logic related to responsive design to be
at the top of the document and I'm
calling this idea the logic fold and
this means that our variable
declarations go at the top of the page
in our property declarations are go
below the below the fold
this means that above the fold will have
more functional CSS and then below the
fold we'll end up with more declarative
CSS which is just like reading regular
CSS properties so I'm going to show you
what I mean by this but first of all I
want to tell you a few simple rules that
you can use to tell if you are using
custom properties in this way so the
first one is separate
logic from design and this means that if
something changes it's a variable if
you're using a media query to update a
CSS property maybe you should put that
property in a variable and move this
along with the media query to the top of
the page and define how that change that
variable changes below the fold we just
write out CSS as normal and wherever we
use that custom property or that
variable we know that that's a CSS
property that changes so this provides a
link between logic and design that we
don't normally have with traditional
methods of writing CSS there's no way of
knowing which properties are going to be
changed later on by a media query or a
selector you pretty much have to read
the whole thing and get an understanding
of how it works but this link that this
creates is incredibly useful the next
rule I have is change the value not the
variable with SCSS it might have been
useful too I have a whole bunch of sort
of global variables like font size small
font size medium font size large and
then you'd use a media query to change
from say using font size medium to font
size large at certain break point this
would be the wrong way to use CSS custom
properties I think a better way to do
this would be to define a single font
size variable for the component that
you're working on and then change this
as many times as you need at the top of
the document in one place with media
queries and selectors if we were to
change the which variable we were using
we lose that link between the logic and
the design that I was talking before or
between the logic and its implementation
and I think that that's a bad idea
the other rule that I have is use
pre-processors for static variables I
still think it makes sense to have a
whole bunch of variables like font size
small large and medium or cut theme
colors or anything that you might want
to change sort of globally and we can
still use pre processes the the custom
properties are not a replacement for pre
processes and I think as Rachel said
they like the specs don't really compete
with each other this isn't something
that in the case of pre processors
they're not really in the spec but
they're not designed to compete with
variables and preprocessors they're not
the same thing so we can still do this
we can still assign the value of a
static variable in sass to a custom
property and besides from helping
with that separation of logic and
implementation we now have something in
our code that denotes these more global
static variables and that can be really
useful too so the final rule that I have
for custom properties is media queries
should only change custom properties and
it's kind of like where I said with the
first rule if if it's if it changes its
a variable if you're using a media query
to do anything other than change your
variable and there's a chance that
you're not sort of following this same
logic and able to take advantage of
these benefits and when you do this this
is what the code looks like and I don't
expect you to read all of that but you
can see that above the fold we have like
all of the media queries and all of
these different variables for all the
properties that change and then below
the fold which is what this size outside
here is we have all of the different
properties and anywhere that we're using
a variable we can look over to this side
and see where that variable changes and
so this is really easy and we can use
poast CSS techniques today to write this
out to browsers that don't support
custom properties there are only a few
situations that using custom properties
that sort of can't be written in another
way and that includes if you're using
javascript or some other dynamic stuff
but most of this can be written out and
you can start writing CSS like this
today I find it incredibly useful I've
been doing it for a little while the
only thing I don't like is that you do
tend to end up with a lot of variables
and I'm trying to sort of figure out
ways to sort of organize those and
prefix those so that we don't end up
with too many there but definitely
having that link between logic and
design is something that I've personally
found very useful so I'm interested in
exploring this more and maybe you will
give that a go okay so do we remember
this video from the start so I've taken
everything that I've talked about here
today the fluid typography a little bit
of grid a little bit of flexbox some
responsive SVG custom properties and of
course an eye of newt and I've mixed all
of those together to show you what my
idea of responsive design is in an age
Beyond media queries and you can see
here that there's less signs of pressure
around the breakpoints as this design so
that goes through
it's various different sizes and I know
you might say that it sort of jumps a
little bit in things in certain places
and that's okay we're not actually
wanting anyone to be doing this but it
means that whatever size they go in at
the the design is fairly well balanced
for their screen sizes and if you can
tie your shoelaces you are probably a
better designer than I am so I'm really
interested to see what you can do with
some of these ideas but this is the
direction that I think that responsive
design is taking at the moment and media
queries are sort of a tool that does
responsive design relative to the
viewport which is one way to do things
but it's not necessarily the only way to
do things so I think I hope that you'll
consider which which it is you want to
do and then like try and work a solution
that works for that unfortunately
there's still a lot of things that we
can't do
we don't have container queries proper
container queries it would be nice to
have container units as well and we
could use those in count as well they
were they would be like viewport units
relative to a container and I would
really like to see a native
interpolation function as well so that
we could do some of those Kalpa
techniques on values that aren't or
length values and we'd be able to use
animation timing functions and other
things in CSS to create nonlinear
transitions instead of what is mostly
linear transitions that I showed you
today so we be able to have these really
complex responsive designs that are not
necessarily directly relative to the
viewport but I didn't get time to talk
about this today I wanted to focus on
things that we we can do so I didn't
have a chance to mention most of these
possibilities because of time so come
and find me if you want to hear me talk
about that and speaking of time thank
you so much for your time I've published
all of the code with the before and
after examples at that link there as
well as blog posts and anything else
that might help you if you want to try
out some of these techniques once again
