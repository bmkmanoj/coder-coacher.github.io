journey and some of you might know me I
spoken at previous Jinga cons about the
process of teaching myself how to code
and this is the sites that I ran I was
running for about seven years and long
story short I was a designer with no
programming experience and wanted to
build a startup I ended up learning a
little bit of Django launched this
little website this little website
suddenly started coming like larger not
exactly very big but larger than before
I turned to startup and it's been a lot
of us fulfilling things I've ever done
in my life like learning how to code
learning how to to do Django it's been
wonderful over that process of teaching
myself how to code while building this
website I started thinking like why like
I'll figure something out and I'll be
like why was it taught that way Wix who
then taught this way especially as a
designer that's where the book series
come with what came about
I built hella web app to teach
programming or what about developmental
ace to non-programmers the designers
okay like my books a lot I designed them
I sell polished them the dingo community
the Python community has been so
wonderful my second book last year's
junior con a fundraising Kickstarter for
my second book everyone's been awesome
so thank you everyone and Django for
supporting me in this journey but as
I've been working on these books
teaching programming space to designers
I've also been thinking about ways that
I could teach design programmer because
that's my background I have an a degree
in art and I did drop design I works web
designer for a long time and the same
thing I started looking at program
excuse me tutorials teaching design
through programmers and same thing as
before I was like why was it taught why
is it taught this way when I clearly
think it should be taught a different
way why how do we how could I teach
design to people who have a programming
background makes more sense and then
based on these other tutorials exists so
my design I don't mean this is crazy
design the world of design just like
programming the world of design there
are so many different fields within
decide UI design you'll exercise
I simply mean design in that we will
helping you make an interface that works
well there's at some point in your
career as a you know when you're
programming or building open-source
projects you'll probably at some point
need to create something that other
people use a lat homepage for your open
source project so I want to be here to
help you feel more comfortable jumping
in and doing design I know why people
say oh I need to go find a designer help
me if I project so that was like me when
I was learning how to program I was like
oh I need to go find a co-founder for my
project I want to help you just you more
comfortable we're kind of on your own
and some of the things that really give
me pet peeves we're not going to talk
about here in this talk not gonna talk
so golden ratio that is I don't know why
keeps showing up in begin our designs
are not to talk about the pieces and
parts of typography I know there's a
type of hard we caught talk I think
tomorrow and I'll be awesome
I'm going to bypass that for now I just
want to talk to you about creating
better more effective designs so first
and foremost let's just talk about the
visual stuff and the number one thing to
remember if you're coming designer or TV
not becoming designer which point do
design is to simply cut down on clutter
for example great examples and look like
crazy cluttery website the fastest way
to a better design is to cut down on
clutter so for example I built this
little widget and you know it's okay
and we're going to make some design
principles apply to this widget and see
how things slowly improve this little
widget I built on to make it a better
design so first the grid you might
already know about the grid gets rid
show up in things like bootstrap just
think of the grid like adding a grade to
something as simply lining things up
because pixel differences are noticed
like when something is like a little bit
offset or something else
those pixel differences can add
- offensive clutter so instead of
thinking you like working on the design
project oh my gosh I need to line
everything up
I love shortcuts and when I again pet
peeves is when people say don't use
bootstrap ever was using bootstrap use
bootstrap seriously like it has only
shortcuts it's going to make your life
so much easier because it has a grid
system built in I love these shortcuts I
love like trying to use things I used to
trap all my stuff use things that like
bootstrap you miss director design make
it better so to see lining things up in
action add a little widget and we just
simply set up columns on the left and
right side lining things up and you can
re see that's looking a little bit
cleaner
next up color again big overarching
principles color principles keep your
color is complementary making them work
kind of well to each other get into a
second what that means but a good rule
of thumb is to use mostly neutrals and
use a bright color to help things stand
out now there is so much to say about
color and this article on Smashing
Magazine is a particularly good one
what's simple why developers guide to
color like when I was a school is a
whole quarter simply on color and it's
kind of ridiculous there's so much to
learn and understand in terms of like
complementary color is better and so
forth 22 got here but I love again
shortcuts so this is my favorite
shortcut I use this for everything I use
this I use this for the color palette
for my book for hello web app I use this
with a color palette for wedding lovely
go to color lovers calm with it you I
just moved to Canada so I'm like yeah
use holdovers I calm you can search for
color palettes and other people have
submitted and then people can vote on
them so if you search by you know top
most loved of all times you can find
color palettes that are guaranteed to be
complimentary to have a large range of
colors you can scroll through here in
find something do you think might work
your project and try it out rather than
take starting from scratch so back to
the widget say when two color lovers
start pulling in some color palettes and
applying to this widget and just testing
things out and sometimes they might not
work if you try a bunch of different
color palettes until something does it's
so much better than trying to like jump
into some color program and like on that
little palette and trying to pick two
what works I let it go to the place
where you can find colors that already
work well together well with each other
and use those as them and quick note
about this one and you don't don't feel
like scared you like I'll say the color
slightly this download button on here
generally tell the screen with the
darker reds are the one that's in the
Clark College you can still play around
this gives you a really good shortcut
next up font again principles keep the
number of fonts low it's just in terms
of clutter just the more different types
of fonts out there adds this feeling of
clutter on so two different fonts is a
good rule of thumb try to use display
fonts very sparingly buy display fonts I
mean everything that's in the back here
some things I feel very nineties I those
are also very cluttering so try to avoid
using them and if you need to add more
differentiation we are designing you can
add folding you can make things
uppercase italics you can use that to a
differentiation rather than tapering
another another fun so again shortcuts
love shortcuts so big Google Fonts I
love Google font they use it for
everything as well but if you go either
there's like 200 something launch new
scrolling through and it's really
overwhelming much easier to go to these
websites like beautiful websites or
titles which curates the best google
fonts so instead of going through a list
so say 200 fonts you can go with one of
these sites and just have plenty to
choose from and you're guaranteed to be
working with a well-designed well of fun
so back to the widget
any update the font this is using a
serif font and a sans-serif font
serif font just means a little widget on
the end as type and probably you can
learn more about that in a typography
far it's thought tomorrow essentially
this was to response and we did some
differentiation the download button is
all caps the input form and lowercase we
had some italics in there but it's
looking a little bit cleaner and well
put together last principle with white
space white space is the ultimate letter
reducer now a blast and hacker news we
all know and love every three to six
months there's always something that
pops in hacker news say hey everyone I'm
a designer I redesigned hacker news and
every single time the main thing they do
is just add white this one thinks I can
use a super squashed I particularly like
this one a little easier to read the
white space isn't just like a person
something like hey I want to make this
all keep jumping ahead one more example
New York Times redesign the New York
Times as a well as a newspaper has a lot
information you can't just like blow it
up with white space both this example
left is the floor and right is after the
right is a little bit less cluttered
feeling and the main one of the main
things I did to make it feel less
fluttering this simply opened up the
columns in between the text a little bit
more give it just a little bit more
bracing robe made a big impact the white
space is kind of a huge trend right now
which is a little funny cuz if you go
onto these like top design website sites
I took a random screenshot every single
one of em has like acres of white space
with the huge trends and might go a
little bit too far but not just a trend
adding white space can also improve your
conversion rate so in this example
between these two tables the left table
it just got moved a little bit farther
down a little bit more white space was
added in between the two tables
and by doing this they saw a 20%
improvement engagement high percent base
and product value to cart and a 33%
preventing customers continuing on
through purchase so reducing clutter and
using white space can affect your bottom
line so back to little bitches we just
let it breathe a little bit bar added
some space for on the edges also
normalize with spacing in between the
blocks between the button a forum for
content added some more line height
between the paragraphs of content for
the headline and the content you can see
this re looking very good place a lot
better than we were before so in terms
of visual design the best thing you can
do is just to simply think about how you
can reduce clutter in your design if
you're reduce clutter by keeping the
number of fonts and colors low adding
whitespace and lining things up like
clean designs are really in right now
and just aim for clean design you'll get
pretty far but you can't just talk about
design without talking about user
experience this is arguably more
important that is arguably I believe it
will hardly house us work whatever you
design how it works is better it is more
important than how it looks and whenever
you're designing something just keep
this in mind
he's been keep in mind what's the most
important action what do you want your
users to do with your design and then
focus on making that action easy to find
you I mean that's for example is a short
low example that's reason why widgets
and forums whatnot have a brighter color
for the button so they want to have that
button to be easily easy to see use and
click I use that on my homepage right
hello love app and that's why I get the
books the most important part of my
design is a bright green but also
another website you know this one has a
pretty grey drab background but it has a
bright blue button but not different
landing pages you can see this in work
another page other websites like well
for
in blogs you can argue that they had
this blog specifically so they can bring
in more engineers for company because
they talk about engineering topics I
think probably hopes when it comes over
reasoning power engineering topics and
think hey this place looks like a good
place to work and then bright green on
the right they have a bright green blue
hey you want work here button so you can
say also again so much about user
experience just keep that in mind I make
sure that your goal to ease into finding
views make sure you have analytics make
sure you're looking at how well your
design is working you launch a forum or
a website or whatnot pay attention to
they like figure out a success metric if
it's someone moving on to the next page
with submitting your form and see what
you can do over time to make this better
accept content this is a huge part about
Web Design a lot of people forget about
this I see a lot of people who launch
their website and they want to tell the
SA of their life on the about page but
the thing is they caught like large
paragraphs of content or assign clutter
no one liked you first people who read
on the web but especially people are
more likely to be scanning through your
article or whatever your content looking
for words and if they see giant
paragraph at content they're more likely
to leave than read so in comes right so
in general in terms of content less is
more try to cut down simplify break down
your words think it's like good
principles like two to three sentences
per paragraph big paragraphs are a sign
of clutter and if you can't simplify
your content try to break into bullet
this is attack that I like to use a lot
in my content so on the left this turd
of the content is part of the kind of
hard to use you can read it by going
line by line but you can improve
readability by breaking the bullets and
then you have a visual point to skip
between as someone again assuming
someone's scanning and there probably
are it intense between
they individual points in a paragraph
but we can improve readability by adding
some folding so now we like not only
broke it up into points we added folding
over around the most important parts of
of those paragraphs again that person
who is scanning can read the bullet
parts and then see whether they want to
read further and then we also just
talked about whitespace you can further
improve readability by adding some white
space
all right so read the docs I want to
give a real-life example of something
that I would test updating I love to
look at designs and see a life I was on
this or Eric Holder came to me and said
hey Tracey what do you think of homepage
which I don't think you will
big-nose I do this big logit what would
you test what would you try to change
and see this improve conversion rate I
talked about making sure that you have
an action and making sure that action is
easy to find and use and this website is
home page very gray I noticed that there
is a hover State over the let's do this
button that's bright frame so that is
something that I would test I would test
giving the eye some place to jump to in
that basically size like hey person
business homepage this is the most
important part of this page now you
could you know try making the sign a bud
bright green or something but giving two
eyes like it's hot
having those things easy to find and use
if someone a pass of what to like look
at first let me just start talking about
content and that content is this
homepage is very beautiful my content
looks very nice at it our way but I was
wondering you know how many people
actually do read this and I would also
test breaking that up into bullets so
this is arguably not as pretty as a that
block of paragraph number four but this
is something that would test and see if
taking a paragraph breaking the bullets
making easier people to read those
features that I want to read the Box
homepage I'd be something I would try
and see about updating
but I don't want to stop it just content
I want to talk a little bit about
headlines as well headlines are very
important whatever you're trying say a
blog post or a home page for a landing
page what's on seeing at the top in
general is better talk benefits not
details I'll give an example on that in
a second
stuff like content so make sure your
headlines are not too long and then try
to use natural and friendly language
talk like a human not robot that goes in
the content in general so this is kind
of pseudo my books are about my books
are an introduction to building web apps
in Python using web building web apps
using Python and Django this is boring I
mean it's very descriptive it says
exactly what my books are about but this
makes more sense to a reader
let me change my website this yells some
exactly what the benefit is if they read
my books again this is not just like
personal feeling like hey this would be
great to do with this headline changes
the sting of someone's teeth first your
website updating it to be more about
benefits rather than details can improve
your conversion rate and this one is
complete they updated their headline and
then improve their conversions by 52%
but we're not going to the widget now
you might notice that the headline is
kind of boring the content is kind of
long for just a smaller widget we can
simplify it make it easier make it more
human you know drawing the headline make
it more about benefits tour in the
content add some folding an important
part that's Simpson change the input
form so it's more human instead of
saying email address says add your email
here and then the client changes so just
a simple download to something again a
little bit more like you're talking
someone saying to me free info so in
this journey we have gone from here to
here you can see how small little
changes through the principles can all
work together to make something look
nice very nice
all right quick note about images and
imagery when I first gave this talk it
and have a section and this is one of
the things that people usually ask me
most about in general it's nice to add
images to your website you can do so
much with just text and take a
screenshot and boxes in line you don't
necessarily have to have images and
using a stock photo or someone just like
people can pick that out immediately and
generally pay attention the file size
that we're also images from screwed up
and making sure you have retina quality
images is also something I usually
protect myself because I have an old
MacBook Air but you know like images can
improve how delightful so say it was
going to be so in this example of stripe
and I really like your little icons and
this and those little icons they do help
out and if you you know I want to want
to say that you don't need images but
they can help out and you know these
ones are pretty simple and I'll get into
where you can find them it's just a
second if you want like a big image in
the background is not look like a stock
photo unsplash.com
is my favorite they say they upload
beautiful kind of history images but
they're really beautiful and they say do
whatever do with what you want them and
they're just beautiful really big really
awesome in the gym photo pen is another
resource I use for blocking that
searches for Creative Commons images in
Flickr brings them up for you can use
and then this is where I get yelled at
by my designers you want icons like the
one on stripe and you are launching your
first project you don't have a lot of
budget I think it's totally ok to use
something like Fiverr and get something
cheap and fast now as a designer like
once you have budget and you have the
ability to do so a professionally
designed logo image icons will be way
better than anything can get on these
new sites or you can pay very little to
have to get images done really quickly
for you
but you're just learning out I think
this is a great start and you know again
another example of how images can help
out when friends of mine do African area
nerds pronto and they worked with a
local designer again pretty cheap to
just create these little illustrations
for their website and it looks good work
there again what local designer made
something and they turned their website
from just simply you know text images a
screenshot its adds a little bit more
delights their home page so don't forget
those local designers you can work with
- they're probably not as expensive si
is big professional all right a little
bit about philosophy if you're sitting
down and working on a design project and
you sleep your deskaway and just float
your piece of paper in your pen and
you're just going to start sketching
something starting from scratch with
nothing to inspire you nothing is
sitting down and trying to pull it out
your brain is a lot like trying to
program something without the use of
Google or Stack Overflow this doesn't
happen this is like it's giving yourself
like a big shot method like you're
you're hinging yourself my books would
not be I mean I'm not gonna say like
they're the best design in the whole
world I'm pretty proud of them though
and I could not have made the design I
did without the inspiration of a book of
priceless I was able to look at them and
see what they did and get inspired and
that influenced my design I didn't steal
anything but being influenced is not
only good for you it's encouraged so if
you're working on design project again
following a form widget cetera there's a
lot of websites out there that showcase
good design that you'd go to and just
look through and see you find things
that inspire you and give you ideas so
recite inspire I'm much style.css mania
there's so many websites out there to
select good design and whenever you find
a design that you particularly like try
to pick out some things are doing well
so for example this flat homepage you
know lots of white space the form has a
dark background the button is bright
green if you just click up
well it has some folding and a Content
default as information those important
tips this so when you find the design
that's working well or even look at your
competitors site picking out the things
they think is working well is going to
help train your design eye and make it
easier for you as well you do better
designs on your own and it's just kind
of funny to this pulley meme then design
and I need Bansky comes along and steals
it there's books on this
like seriously designers don't do a
thing from scratch we all work off each
other last bit I want to do some
research and tell you how my process
usually go about sitting on working on a
new design project first thing to do is
collect inspiration like I just said and
this is my CV and I just go through and
I have all these sites all collecting
into one folder so I can very quickly go
through good designs and get inspired
and take out some things I like to want
to implement in my own design now when
it comes to sketching though this is
this person is showing off like if you
are like trying to sketch and keep ideas
found don't feel like you have to think
something like this this is actually the
sketches I did for the helloweb homepage
again like just really quick boxes lines
etc just helping me remember layouts and
ideas that I had so don't feel like you
have to be in a most amazing sketch or
just do as much as you can to get your
ideas down and then a second thing I
want to say is that you can i
particularly like mock up because easy
to change and try different ideas your
mock-ups don't have to be pixel perfect
they don't have to be beautiful like
this is a lay i did for my husband for
an idea he had and all we did was trying
to figure out with you know this is not
going to like my company those colors
that allowed us to figure out a layout
and move things around and see
essentially how the way it loves website
would be used all the mock ups can be
hectic look like this and then build it
so that's a whole
so again reinsurance every time this is
seriously every single time I work on
design my threshold graph designer I
have a graph design degree this is what
happens I feel like like these ultimate
impostor syndrome I feel like such a
horrible designer every single time I
start from scratch and if you are
sitting down and you're working on your
work on a design project you're going
I'm such a bad designer I'm such a
beginner you're not a designer everyone
goes through this it doesn't like means
that you are a designer okay the first
thing was sorry but hopefully I reassure
- all right this is only a starting
point there's so much to be said I can
only do in a short period of time
remembered of these even you're working
on something visually focus on clutter
and reduce visual clutter and you can do
that by keeping the demurrer colors and
fonts low adding whitespace lining
things up and keeping your content short
easy to skim make sure that your goal
whatever you're designing whatever your
you want your action to be make sure
that you're focusing on making it easy
to find easy to find and use keep your
content short simple to the point and
practice practice this will be the topic
of a third book hopefully and if you
want to be on a dedicated mailing list
just to a book that's hella web.com
flash webs mass design otherwise I
really hope this helped you out thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
