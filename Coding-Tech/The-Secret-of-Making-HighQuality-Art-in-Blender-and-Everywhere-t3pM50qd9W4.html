the secret of making high quality odds
in blender and everywhere so but before
we get started let me just briefly
introduce myself to get it out of the
way so my name is Gleb Alexandrov I have
a wife a kid a cat a blog blender two
point eight Tests built a blind guardian
t-shirt a useless error account a useful
YouTube account some fancy renders some
renders that suck the panic monster to
help me fight procrastination and a
caffeine addiction so why do some
renders suck and others don't
or how should they put it why do some
renders get in the editor speak on art
station receive lots of love our words
stuff like that and others even from the
same artist and up in a grey zone not
bad but not great either I think most
people in this room have had this
experience of creating something in
blender say concept art or a 3d model
for game or just a render and then
realizing that something about it looks
terribly off it looks off but you can't
put your finger on what exactly is wrong
about it so you go to blender artists or
or maybe you go to Facebook and you ask
your Facebook friends hey what's wrong
with my render everybody really adds to
your confusion you get a bunch of
mutually exclusive comments like add
some interests are details or keep it
minimal remove something out of it or
maybe it's about colors or check your
references or my favorite improve
composition
thank you but what exactly so today I
want to talk about one particular theory
in composition that in my opinion has a
great potential for explaining many many
things and for preventing such
situations when you render obviously
suck but you don't know what to do and
where to start so this is kind of a
secret of making high quality art that
is being used I believe by successful
artists from Blizzard DreamWorks
Industrial Light and Magic Pixar by
artists like Tour freak Vitaly Bulgari
of Neel blevins many many others by
blender artists of course like Daniel by
stead master Zee on me so in fact all
these renders that you see behind me
have this thing in common but before we
begin talking about what the heck is
this thing let me just say a it's not a
proscribed mathematical method B it
works see how many of you guys have
heard about Neil Blevins
by show of hands one two just two people
all right how many of you guys haven't
heard about Neil Blevins the rest of you
especially for those of you who haven't
heard about Neil Neil is a professional
3d artist who specializes in robots
alien creatures sci-fi landscapes stuff
like that now working as a digital
artist for Pixar Animation Studios Neil
has a blog Neil Blevins comm where he is
posting extremely useful tutorials on
composition on 3ds max on many things so
a couple of years ago I stumbled across
one of his tutorials that was called
primary secondary tertiary shapes and
the main thought of this tutorial was
that if your image has a nice
distribution of big medium and small
shapes the resulting image will tend to
be more pleasing to the eye
and once I read this tutorial and once I
saw these diagrams of the right and
wrong distribution of big medium small
shapes inside the composition I thought
well that's great I also love
simplifying stuff like that like arrange
your big medium shapes inside the
composition like this you win arrange it
like this you lose and I wanted to kind
of crash test this theory that Neil has
planted into my head so I took a bunch
of top-rated works from CGHUB actually
these are from art station
back then it was CG hub one of the most
popular online galleries like pornhub
for CG artists if you know what I mean
so I took a bunch of top-rated works and
I started painting big medium small
shapes with red blue yellow like this
and after some painting I started to
realize that the distribution of shapes
in all these images really looks similar
it really looks like what neil has
described in his tutorial and I think
that's very important thing that helped
me just in my work and had an incredibly
positive influence on how I tend to the
things but before we ask what the heck
let's try to make sense of it so
definitions first primary shapes are
your big shapes it's a kind of a shape
that you see if you squint at an image
as soon as you blur your eye it's
already reads secondary shapes I or
smaller shapes that break up or sit on
top of the primary shapes tertiary
shapes are again even smaller details
successful images tend to have all these
three levels in place and they are
balanced against each other big shapes
are needed because they help to organize
all other shapes small shapes are needed
because of many reasons one which is
pure curiosity and desire to explore the
image and obviously secondary shapes are
needed to give a transition between big
and small miss one level things go
haywire all bad renders in the world
have this sin of breaking a balance say
whether it's a wall a huge wall that is
covered with tiny tiny bricks without
any middle ground or whether it's a
robot which lacks just intricate details
the successful renders on the other hand
tend to have all these three levels in
place and they fall into a certain kind
of balance and we find images pleasing
that fall into certain kind of balance
just like we find music pleasing that
has all frequencies represented imagine
your favorite song now imagine the
waveform of it like try to cut off the
frequency's and it will sound muffled
and if you cut off the bus it will sound
teeny you can't crank up or cut off a
certain band of frequency without
ruining the sound and appeal InDesign is
no different have big medium small
shapes have them in a certain balance
but then the natural question arises is
there any way to determine the right
size for the shapes say a certain
proportion golden ratio the answer would
be yes and no I tried to calculate using
these renders for example but I didn't
manage to find out for sure is if there
is any kind of common proportion
manifesting itself through all these
images or not because obviously artists
tend to choose different proportions
based on many things on styles on the
scale on personal preference on the time
of the day but that being said I still
see some kind of ratio in play to me the
ratio between big medium small shapes in
this bunch of renders that I have Jerry
Peaks from art station looks something
like 1 to 5 - 1 to 10 so when I say
medium I actually mean 5 to 10 times
smaller than the big and when I say
small actually mean 5 to 10 times
smaller than the medium but don't take
it too seriously it's not some divine
proportion of awesome CG arts or
something like that hey at least we know
that it's a range of sizes rather than
some fixed size so it's very important
to have variety to the sizes of shapes
in each three categories and what's
really crucial is how you distribute
these shapes inside your composition
straight-ahead rhythm gets boring very
quickly if you take a look at these two
diagrams you will notice that the right
distribution is much more natural and
kind of
unpredictable as the result the eye
stays in the image for a longer time
they I have some things to explore the
eye doesn't get ward by this repeating
pattern of small shapes because once the
eye recognizes the pattern and solves
the mystery it's case closed
I mean who still keeps looking for their
shoes once they've found them that would
be stupid so I think the best way to
talk about it is to take a look at some
more examples here you can see the
primary shape broken down into three
rather boring slabs and also you can see
the abundance of small shapes spread out
kind of uniformly across this image and
the uniform distribution like this is
really uncomfortable to look at it
doesn't give the eye any spot to rest
and it doesn't have enough variety to
keep us looking I wonder if you agree
with me but this distribution of shapes
looks much much more enjoyable because
now we don't see this horrible block of
small shapes spread out in the uniform
pattern lots of things is going on here
we see some areas of high frequency
details some areas with practically no
details medium shapes different looking
medium shapes pattern breakers and it
really adds dynamics it adds visual
interest successful images tend to have
a somewhat unpredictable distribution of
shapes with just enough surprise to keep
us watching whether it's a substance
material or a concept art if you allow
me and yet another musical metaphor
imagine you have to choose between two
drum tracks the first one being
and the second one I bet you would
choose the one with more groove because
who doesn't have a good funky beat so so
far we have big medium small shapes
distributed in a somewhat unpredictable
way the next thing we have to master is
an empty space it's very important I
think to have an empty space in your
distribution of shapes because it gives
the actual features more space to
breathe it allows them to speak more
loudly if all areas of your by the way
this is amazing render by masters Eon I
love it and if all areas of your image
have an equal amount of energy you're
doing it wrong you just have to balance
the areas of visual detail with the
areas of visual rest otherwise you will
create something like this dinah board
from the last night and the age of
extinction total rubbish
here's musical metaphor number three if
we guys imagine an orchestra now imagine
all musicians of this Orchestra started
playing at once with maximum loudness
this would sound just like this diner
board if you know what I mean you just
have to balance areas of detail with the
areas of rest if I had to create a
transformer I would have definitely
included some empty space inside the
composition just to make sure that I
avoid this Dinobot effect great renders
always have some negative space to
balance the areas of density some
renders have lots of negative space just
like this by a one-bite or Frank so
let's imagine we have followed through
all the steps of this theory and we got
big medium small shapes with the variety
to the size of shapes in each three
categories we have a somewhat
unpredictable distribution we balance
the areas of details with the areas of
rest the benefit of doing all of this is
having clumps or groups of shapes
emerging here and there and that's the
fourth and final hallmark of high
quality art for today there is a
universal agreement on both ends of the
spectrum from pixel art nerds to
photographers that a having points of
interest is good for your composition
and B it's better to have three five
seven nine objects rather than lots of
objects it's just a better way of
organizing the space and guiding the
viewers eye through the composition and
if you pretty much followed through all
the steps of this tutorial you will get
this as a bonus as Synnex the YouTube
design genius points out our visual
system enjoys grouping objects together
into larger more manageable objects so
clumping can make any much more brain
friendly
hence makes it more aesthetically
pleasing needless to say if you now take
a look at all this editors picks you
will see these clumps or groups of
shapes everywhere and I can go through
this endlessly just just check it out
guys
so these are very important things to
consider when you're basically making an
image let's once again recap them first
have big medium small shapes have a
variety to the sizes of shapes in each
three categories make sure that the
distribution of shapes inside the
composition is somewhat unpredictable
and chaotic balance the areas of details
with the areas of rest and allow these
clumps or groups of shapes to flourish
and of course the rules like this are
just guidelines much like every other
rule in design and composition and it's
up to you as a 3d artist to determine
what's right or wrong for the
composition but the next time you will
have this question don't immediately go
to Facebook just think about big medium
small shapes and their distribution
