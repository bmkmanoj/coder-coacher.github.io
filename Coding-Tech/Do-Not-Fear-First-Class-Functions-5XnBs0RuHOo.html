this and I told you about my opinion for
how configuration options should be
managed and go and the cornerstone of
this presentation started as a blog post
by Rob pike
it's called self referential functions
and the design of options and the last
two years it's been truly wonderful to
watch this idea mature from Rob's blog
post all the way to the GFC PC project
who've really continued to evolve this
design pattern into what I think is its
best form so far but when I was talking
to some Gophers in London at a
conference a few months ago several of
them expressed a concern that while they
understood the idea of a function which
returns a function and this is the
technique that powers functional options
they were worried that other go
programmers and I suspect they mean less
experienced NGO programmers wouldn't be
able to understand this style and this
made me a little bit sad because I
consider go support of first-class
functions to really be a gift and it's
something that we should all be able to
take advantage of so I'm gonna I'm here
today to show you that you don't need to
fear first-class functions so to begin
with we'll really quickly recap the
functional option pattern we start with
some options expressed as a function
which takes a pointer to instruct you to
configure we pass these functions to a
constructor and inside the body of that
constructor we iterate over each
function in order passing in a reference
to the config and finally we call new
terrain with the options that we want
and away we go
so hopefully everyone is familiar with
this pattern now where I believe the
confusion comes from is when you need to
have an option function which takes an
argument so for example we have with
cities which lets us add a number of
cities to our terrain model because
we're cities takes an argument we can't
simply pass with
to new terrain like the signatures just
don't match instead we evaluate with
cities passing the number of cities to
create and use the result of this
function as the value to pass to new
terrain so what's going on here
let's break let's just break it down
fundamentally evaluating a function
returns a value we have functions that
take two numbers and return a number we
have functions that take a slice and
return a pointer some structure and now
we have a function which returns a
function and the type of the value that
is returned from with cities in this
example is a function which takes a
pointer to config and it's this ability
to treat functions as regular values
that leads to the name a first-class
function so another way to think about
what's going on here is if we try to
rewrite the functional Option pattern
using an interface so rather than using
a function type we just declare an
interface will call it option and give
it a single method apply which takes a
pointer to config whenever we need to
call new terrain we and we pass in one
or more values that implement our
options interface and inside new terrain
just as before we iterate over each of
those values and call the apply method
on each of them alright so this doesn't
look too different to what we saw in the
previous example rather than ranging
over a slice of functions we range over
a slice of interface values and call a
method on them so let's take a look at
the other side what does it look like
when you need to declare an option
because we're passing around interface
implementations we need to declare a
type to hold that apply method we also
need to declare a constructor
- return our splines option
implementation and hopefully you very
picked up but this is more code now to
write with cities using our option
interface we need to do a little bit
more work in the previous functional
version the value of n the number of
cities we want to create was captured
lexically for us in the Declaration of
that anonymous function because we using
an interface we need to declare a type
to hold the count of cities and we need
it then a constructor to make sure it's
properly assigned and in putting it all
together we call new terrain with the
result of evaluating with reticulated
splines and with cities now it go for
con last year
Thomasson art spoke about this qu
allottee of a first-class function and
an interface with just one method and
you can see it play out in this example
the interface with one method and the
function out of some extent equivalent
but as you can see dealing with
functions as first-class citizens is
much less code so let's leave interfaces
for a moment and talk about some other
properties of first-class functions when
we invoke a function or method we do so
by passing around data the job of that
function is often to interpret that data
and take some action function values
allow you to pass behavior to be
executed rather than data to be
interpreted and in effect passing a
function value allows you to declare
code that will execute later perhaps in
a different context and to illustrate
this let's look at an example here's a
simple calculator it has a set of
operations that understands and it has
one method called do and do takes an
operation and an operand also for
convenience do returns the value of the
accumulator after the operation is
applied
now our calculator only knows how to add
subtract and multiply if we wanted to
implement division we'd have to allocate
and operate an operation constant then
we'd have to open up the do method and
we'd have to add the code that actually
implements division this sounds kind of
reasonable like it's only a few lines of
code but what about when you want to
implement square root or exponentiation
or any other function that our
calculator handles every time we did
this du is going to get bigger because
and it's going to become harder to
follow because each time we add an
operation we also have to encode in to
do the knowledge of how to interpret
that operation so let's rewrite our
calculator as before we have a
calculator which manages its own
accumulator the calculator has a du
method but this time the operation is a
function and it takes a value as the
operand to work on now this signature of
the operation function might be a little
bit intimidating so I've broken it out
into its own declaration so let's talk
quickly about what that declaration is
the OP func type as you see there is a
function which takes two floats and
returns a third whenever do is called it
calls the operation function that we
pass in providing its own accumulator
and an operand that we provide okay so
how we're going to use this new
calculator as you've probably figured
out we use it by writing operations as
functions so this is the code to add
what about if you wanted to do the other
operations subtract multiply they're not
very hard to do either and as before we
construct a calculator and then call it
passing operations to apply add an
operand all right so now we can describe
operations as functions we can probably
go ahead and extend our calculator now
to handle things like square root
but it turns out that there's a problem
square root only takes one argument not
two but the signature of our calculators
do method requires an operation function
that has two up two arguments so what
can we do about this aim maybe we can
just cheat and just say interesting
ignore the operation that's kind of big
gross I don't think we can do a bit
better so let's redefine add from a
function that's called with two values
and returns a third to a function which
returns a function that takes one value
and returns one value so our du method
now invokes the operation function
passed into it and it provides its own
accumulator and then stores the result
of evaluating that function back in the
accumulator now in main we call calc do
not with the add function itself but
with the result of evaluating out of 10
and the type of evaluating out of 10 is
a function which takes a value and
returns a value and this matches the
signature that do requires so
subtraction and multiplication easy to
implement
as before well what about square root it
turns out that that's now easy as well
this implement square implementation of
square root avoids the awkward syntax of
the previous calculators operation
function as a calculator now operates on
functions which take and return just one
value and I hope that you've noticed
that the signature of square root and
the signature of main dot square root
are the same so now we can so we can
make this code smaller by reusing any
function from the math package that just
takes a single argument
so what's happened to you we started
with a model of hard-coded interpreted
logic we move to a functional model
where we pass in the behavior that we
want and then by evolving this a step
further
we've generalized our calculator to work
for operations regardless of the number
of arguments they take so let's change
tracks a little bit and talk about what
most of us are here at a go conference
for concurrency and specifically actors
and to give to your credit the examples
here are inspired by a talk by Brian
Boram from Guerlain UK a couple of
months ago you really should check that
one out
so suppose we're building a chat server
we plan to be the next hip chat on the
next slack but we probably should start
small for the moment here's the first
cut of the heart of any chat system we
have a way to register new connections
we have a way to remove old connections
and we have a way to send to send
messages to all of the registered
connections now because this this is a
server and all of these methods could be
called concurrently we need to make sure
that we use a mutex or something to
protect this cons map to make sure there
are no data races and it's not corrupted
so is is this what we call idiomatic go
maybe
this is our first proverb don't mediate
access to shared shared memory with
locks and mutexes instead share that
memory by communicating so let's apply
this advice to our chat server rather
than using mutex to serialize access to
this Kahn's map we can give that job to
a go routine and communicate with that
go team via some channels so ad sends
the connection to ad on the add channel
remove sends the address of a connection
to remove on the remove channel an sent
message sends the message to be
transmitted to each connection via the
send message channel and so now let's
look at loop rather than using a mutex
to serialize access to the Kahn's map
loop we'll wait until it receives an
operation in the form of a value sent
over one of these channels and it will
apply the relevant case and we don't
need the mutex anymore because the
shared State this Kahn's map is now
local to the loop function
it can't be mutated by anybody else
there cannot be a race because it only
exists within the scope of that function
but there's still a lot of hard-coded
logic in here loop only knows how to do
three things it Ono's how to add remove
and send messages and as with the
previous calculator example if we wanted
to extend our marks it would involve
adding a channel adding a helper to send
data over their channel and then opening
up the Select logic inside loop and
adding the knowledge of how to process
that data so let's look at a let's look
at our calculator so just like our
calculator example we can rewrite our
MUX choose first-class functions to pass
around the behavior we want to be
executed not the data to interpret now
each method sends an operation to be
exit executed in the context of the loop
function using a single operation
channel
in this case the signature of the
operation function is a map of addresses
the cons probably in a real program
you're going to have a more complicated
type to represent clients but for the
purposes of this example I think this is
sufficient remove is similar we send a
function that deletes the connections
address from the map supplied and send
message is a function which iterates
over all the connections in the supplied
map and calls right string to send each
of them a copy of the message so now you
can see that we've moved the logic from
the body of loop into anonymous
functions which are created by our
helpers it's now the job of loop is
simply to create this connections map
and then wait in a loop for operations
to come in and then execute them one at
a time but there are a few little
problems to fix the most pressing is the
lack of error handling inside send
message if there's an error of writing
to one of the connections that's just
going to be discarded so let's let's
take a look at how to fix that now to
handle the error generated inside and on
weave inside the anonymous function that
we pass into loop we need to create a
channel to communicate the result of the
operation this also creates a point of
synchronization the last line of send
message blocks until the function we
passed into loop has been completed and
note that we didn't have to change the
body of loop at all to incorporate this
we didn't have to change anything about
the existing code and this means that we
can now go ahead and add new
functionality like the ability to send a
private message to one channel to one
client we do this by passing in a
function to loop that tries to find the
find the client that matches this
address and then we wait for the result
to be transmitted back we check to see
if it's nil which is an indication that
that client is no longer connected
otherwise we now have the connection and
we can write our message to the client
so in summary first-class functions
bring us tremendous expressive power
they lets you pass around behavior not
just dead data to be interpreted
now first-class functions aren't new or
novel many older languages have offered
them even C in fact it was only
somewhere along the lines of removing
pointers from object-oriented languages
that somehow we've lost disability and
really if your JavaScript program you've
probably sat there in the audience
wondering what I'm talking about for the
last 15 minutes this is like second
nature to you first-class functions like
other features go offers should be used
with restraint just like it's possible
to make an overcomplicated program by
the overuse of channels it's just as
easy to make an incomprehensible program
with the overuse of first-class
functions but that doesn't mean that you
shouldn't use them just use them in
moderation and first first-class
functions are something I believe every
go programmer should have in their
toolbox first-class functions aren't
unique to go and it's something and
somethingÃ¶ programs should not be
afraid of using and if you can learn to
use interfaces you can learn to use a
first-class function they aren't hard
they're just a little bit unfamiliar and
this unfamiliarity is something that I
believe that can be overcome with time
and experience so next time you define
an API it has just one method I want you
to ask yourself should this really just
be a function thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
