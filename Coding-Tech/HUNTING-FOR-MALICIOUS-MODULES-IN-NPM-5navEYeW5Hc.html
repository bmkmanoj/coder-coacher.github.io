version than this Adam Baldwin that's
where you can find me on the Internet
I run a team called lift security we do
penetration testing and security
auditing of note apps and just about
everything else I also run and started
note secured i/o which is continuous
security monitoring for your note
applications previously it was known as
the node security project which you
might heard of we recently donated all
of our advisory data to the foundation
so a lot of that security reporting is
going to be going through them you'll
see more about that probably in the in
the news in the near future but we're
here to talk about hunting malicious
modules in NPM and this is a research
this is a talk about research that I've
been doing over the last year and I
don't know how applicable it'll be to a
lot of you but it's it's sort of gonna
be one of those who what when where why
how kind of talks on a project that I
took on and so the starting point is is
why should we hunt for malicious modules
I'm gonna give you a little backstory on
some security in the registry you know
for over the over the last five years
I've been doing research in the registry
it's like a really fun sandbox for me
you know and this is gone from sort of
like independent research went back when
the the registry was just an open source
thing run by you know Isaac and and
volunteers too so now my team at lyft
supports ampion registry we do security
auditing all the code that the NPM ships
as well as the infrastructure for pen
tests and so this has gone from sort of
like a hobby thing to you know a
professional thing but I still take time
to do fun experimental things like this
right but we talked about why we should
hunt for malicious code in the registry
right because people every so often
figure out hey I can publish malicious
code to NPM right like anybody can
publish anything right you're like this
is bad right install scripts are bad
javascript is bad right and then it ends
up a hacker news well and you know what
right like they're sort of right anybody
can publish this these anybody publish
modules it has malicious intent
and just like rumor fall did and like
npm install' could be dangerous and it
RM RF slashed all your files when you
installed it the problem that doesn't
get talked about is it you still have to
run this module there's still have to
someway convince you to execute this
code right
and then in 2016 so this is one of the
cases in 2016
us last year there was the threat sort
of that came out was like because of
install scripts and persistent offending
of NPM clients it was like oh there's
gonna be a big NPM hydro worm and we're
gonna could destroy the registry and
there was sort of this fear and
certainty in doubt around and it was you
know found in a bit of reality right
like the fact that you could publish a
malicious module and if you installed it
and it grabbed your NPM RC file it could
then propagate santi modules you publish
and so on and so forth right again you
still have to get somebody to install
and run that code so that's the that's a
little bit of the basis for why and what
sort of spawned me thinking about okay
our people publishing malicious modules
into the registry with a 10th to cause
harm and can we identify them so that we
can help protect the ecosystem a little
bit better right like that was the
premise of this research and so what are
we hunting right so so we know kind of
like you know the background here so
what are we had to get what what defines
malicious behavior like what are we we
got to narrow down our scope of our
research here this is what I did and
this was this was the example of what I
based all of my research on and this was
a piece of code that was found in the
registry not from this research but it
was found you know by NPM and somebody
that I believe report it to them and
it's may be hard to see in the back but
this is this is the piece that we're
looking at right so this is this is just
a piece of code that calls home right so
so the module basically was compromised
one of the files have replaced with this
and what happened was when you installed
it I ran install script that would run
this code and this particular code just
connects to an IP address with a reverse
shell right it connects into a coming
and control server and lets them control
that system which is really interesting
so of this the interesting behavior to
me is that it makes a network connection
right so it it's identifiable by this
network connection and it spawns a
process right it spawns a process NPM
executes this install script which then
executes another process right so we
start getting process trees involved
here so this is the behavior that I was
like okay I'm interested in this right
this is this is one question that I can
ask right so where are we hunting right
so this like I gave it away in the title
of the talk right it's NPM we're hunting
in NPM but I swore duraframe just sort
of how difficult this problem is at
scale and in NPM this is I wrote this a
few days ago so I'm sure it's like a
million by now
but it's like you know it's a half a
million modules that's a lot a lot of
code but that's only the latest version
of those right there's actually he's
like 3.4 million versions of those
modules when you take into account all
the different versions of those that's
two hundred forty two million individual
files that's a numbers actually bigger
now so I had to narrow down that problem
right how can one person sort of digest
and and consume this and answer the
question of is that I was trying to ask
of this data said so I went for modules
that had install scripts that's where I
started I said okay after everything
else install scripts and the reason was
is because everyone was all on fire
about install scripts and small scripts
are bad right yarn you know got rid of
install scripts when it first came out
it was mega secure and then you know
they've finally turned them back on
because it broke everything so let's see
we narrowed it down to this so we know
that kind of you know the premise the
why we're doing it we know some like
what the question we're kind of trying
to answer we narrow that down then we
know we're we're hunting right our data
set so we
we have to go there to go actually do
this so this is this is a process that I
took in doing it and I'm gonna share at
the end the results of that so so how
did I go about hunting in the registry
right well the first challenge is to get
a copy of the registry there's a nice
wonderful module called concurrent couch
follower
you know author right there that's
that's wonderful for doing that you're
gonna need a lot of disk space so I
chose to basically do it all on Google
Google Cloud Google Cloud Storage where
we had a couch follower and listen to
all the publishes on publish grabs it
sticks it in storage that's the starting
point right stick it in storage but you
have but that's just getting the current
stuff you have to back fill all those
modules right all those 3.4 million
versions and so it took a couple of days
to do that I think it took three days
cloud functions are really nice to be
able to do that right where you just say
here you function go get it from NPM and
stick in storage right rather than
downloading through my computer and
uploading it that's a really good way to
shortcut mirroring the registry without
waiting a few weeks by the way so the
next thing is is I wanted to have sort
of like an index of the data in there so
I took and broke down all the tar balls
and we generated we index the file names
the paths the extensions and content
hashes of every single file on the
registry because what I wanted to answer
the question of is that previous example
that we saw that that lint it was called
lint j/s is the file that they replaced
and that file we found in a couple other
modules is that anywhere else in the
registry I want to answer that question
first and foremost like started there
that file did not exist anywhere else in
the registry now of course they could
have changed it's like that hash
wouldn't have matched but that was a
starting point so if we find any other
malicious code examples hackers tend to
be lazy too we reuse code just like
developers so they're gonna use that
same code in other spots so hopefully if
we find one sample we're gonna be able
to look for it very easily and see if
it's any any other module this actually
would turn out to be one of the more
interesting pieces of the research which
I'll talk about at the end
the second thing we catch so that's
again that's 252 million files indexed
in a Postgres database which takes about
a day to do once you find all the bugs
in your code so it only takes a couple
hours to ingest once you go once you
actually get it done but to do all that
we're using Google pub/sub so we're just
basically saying here we got a job that
takes a tarball breaks it down does all
the things sticks in database and then
we published four million jobs right
this is this is the interesting piece
right so we so at the beginning we said
that that piece of malicious code made a
network call and it spawned a process
right so malicious things they have like
if you want to do anything really
interesting as an attacker chances are
you're gonna exfiltrate some data right
you're gonna communicate home you're
going to spawn processes you're gonna
touch disk not always but those are some
indications of malicious activity right
if you look at you know sort of any
examples one good way of actual trading
data that malicious things do is they
they export data over DNS requests right
so they'll basics t4 of things and you
know read a file off disk send it over
DNS well this is what we set up to
capture all of those events and well
basically the the workflow is that when
an MPO publish happens you know we we
throw it into Google Cloud Storage that
triggers an event that flows into
pub/sub pub/sub then breaks it down you
know grabs it index all the files that
we had like I showed before and then we
sent it off to instrumentation so we
start up instrumentation and we start
basically a docker container looking at
every syscall that the module makes so
during install we say yeah did it wait
did it read to do a you know exact CV or
you know all those all the different
syscalls that are happening we then we
do the NPM I which generates all that
data then we shove that back in Google
Cloud Storage cuz that's a lot of data
and then we sort of like you know tada
we've got a ton of data so that we
processed about 24,000 modules takes a
long time
by the way because in npm install' takes
a while right not only that but we're
collecting all these syslog calls which
which generated about 2.1 terabyte of
data for twenty four thousand modules so
I think extrapolated out to do like all
the current versions that's like two
hundred eighty five terabyte or
something like that it's it's a ton
of data which made me interested in the
Machine and wondering talk from earlier
cuz I've got lots of stuff to go through
what's what's interesting about that is
we've got all of this data right and so
did I I miss a slide I don't know I
threw a slide away somewhere here oh
cool all right well whatever so what
does this data give us so again those
sis calls they give us interesting
things they tell us every network
connection so think about TCP dump right
sniffing network traffic we get every
single network connection we get every
single packet in the form of a buffer
right so we get all of the data that
gets transferred across the wire we get
every single file read we know what
files were open and what files were were
closed what files were read from that's
really interesting we so we can look
into those network requests as well and
see DNS we can also see things like what
processes respond and what the parent of
those processes were and it looks a
little bit suspicious when you'd call
say net cat which is you know make a
network connection across the wire from
NPM or some other sub process so that's
what we ended up doing we ended up
cataloging all of those events in a
relational database so that we could do
queries on it so we could ask it
interesting questions and it's not that
exciting to visualize so I'm gonna go
over some of the sort of questions that
we asked and in some of those things so
what's interesting is of those twenty
four thousand modules these are all the
destination ports that things talk to
you right so we could say like you know
what are that's all of them that's the
all the ports chances are that most
things are hidden around 443 if they're
encrypting it right there's also this
this is interesting in unsecure traffic
right and potentially on other things
right like why the you talking to
Mongo you know 25 I don't know
so let's take stand out right so we can
start asking interesting questions this
of all those twenty four thousand
modules it only makes 339 unique DNS
requests so we can go look and see like
is there any module like making a bunch
of ridiculous like base64 encoded DNS
requests that's really interesting to me
because I could actually I can look
through a list of 339 things and be like
that looks out of place
well I took and ran though all those do
me all those domains against like known
like you know malware list and things
like that as part of this as well but
here's something interesting too so
there's things talking to unique
addresses that aren't DNS requests so
also then you got like okay some of
these things for making DNS requests
some of these things are just talking to
talking to host right most people use
DNS right so things are are talking to
something but not making DNS requests
stand out to me is potentially
suspicious right like you get it's
interesting and then also we could ask
it like you know did you did it run
netcat by process name right or did it
run curl with with you know some
arguments for like did it did anything
run curl with you know like adding dot n
PMRC
up to someplace right we can ask those
sorts of questions with very very simple
queries so let's talk about the results
of what we found because I've been kind
of holding back a little bit of of
things just to you know we're talking
about how we did this and how we
collected the data and the questions
that we can ask and the things that to
me are interesting to ask of it so the
first thing that we found was again that
port 80 right that stood out as the
ports we kid that things were talking to
we found a ton of modules downloading
build artifacts over HTTP and one of
these was atom
so the atom editor right anybody use
atom here quite a holy so hopefully
you weren't in a coffee shop with me at
any point in the the past because so we
basically did a proof of concept that
showed a very popular atom native
extensions that have to download build
things like the dist the note gist the
dist and if you go and do a code audit
of those particular extensions
it says the dist:5 is a TTT PS something
something something right so a visual
code audit says hey it's good we're
using HTTP great but when you run it
through you know sis call collection and
you look at it you see that well that
hit an HTTP endpoint and then redirected
to an HTTP s3 bucket and so you capture
that they're also downloading the hash
for that over HTTP so what you can do is
you can man in the middle somebody in a
coffee shop say using atom and if they
happen to install that plug-in you just
replace that dist
backdoor it change the hash and now you
basically we got code execution on a
developer system so that's one way to
abuse or like that insecure traffic
right so so there are modules doing
these sort of like the insecure
behaviors that's one thing that we found
we also found that there's bunch of
modules that call home these are a few
of them they're actually not malicious
they're just kind of just things people
put out there the last ones mine
that I put out there a year before to
see if and see what the bots were doing
like if people were downloading stuff
and running modules or things people
were doing things like I was doing I
wanted to see if they were doing that
caught some researchers at Microsoft and
Berkeley doing stuff is really cool what
these other ones like totally harmless
package just harmless it sends it sends
your username off someplace so you know
you're leaking that if you install it
but again probably no one's installing
it and we found modules that change
registry settings right they're just
like
yeah you don't want this setting it
changes that nothing really that
malicious or interesting but that's
that's what they're doing and so is
there you know the NPM Hydra worm
lurking out there I didn't find it does
it mean that we're safe from that right
like no right I could have missed it I
probably missed it but it it gave us
some interesting tooling a data set and
process for starting to get a picture of
how we can analyze these things with an
ambering registry at scale so now we can
start taking this data sort of
classifying it and maybe we can train a
model on it and maybe we can start you
know doing something interesting in that
space right throw my machine learning
and it solves all our problems
so in on the one hand like I'm sort of
sad that I didn't find anything super
malicious that that you know we didn't
find some you know like the original
example right we didn't find somebody
that was doing that and again I didn't
check run time right so this is this is
a pretty unsophisticated attack
you know replacing install scripts but
it's a place to start right the next the
next step is looking into runtime
analysis just to see what we can do of
course there's ways to evade my
detection and things like that but it's
again it's a place to start
however I am really really happy because
I got about 5,200 bucks on the bounty
and bounty money out of all this
research from from github so ended up
finding because of that remember I said
like this that the hashing and the file
names and stuff like that ended up being
interesting it was because we found some
leaked tokens associated with their
organization that paid out some
interesting interesting cash so that was
kind of fun bonus for that for the for
the year of work all right finally so
what did I learn and how can we improve
right because which is you know that's
what we want we want to know how we can
be better at all of this people are
going to publish malicious things to the
registry we know that's inevitable we're
a big target right we're the largest
like package ecosystem it's going to
happen right so we want to start to like
develop this this way
of see if we can detect it and your
security habits if your module
publishers your security habits have a
lot to do if this gets exploited or not
because again it comes back to the
initial thing you publish something
malicious but if you you have to install
it so as an attacker how I'm gonna how
am I gonna do that I'm gonna take over
your account and you know you might
think that that's difficult
a researcher recently by the name of
Chalker published a blog post in which
he was able to use gathered credentials
leaked credentials from Google from
github and from password guessing from
known lists like rocky breach and known
breaches which he estimates to have
gained sort of impact to about 50
percent 56 percent of the ecosystem I
think which is pretty significant and
normally I like to take the
empathetically approach to having sort
of telling users like security guidance
and things like that but you all need to
use better passwords just and I'm not
gonna stop there so I mean you have to
have good passwords you shouldn't
publish your credentials get up I mean I
like so I'm saying this advice and most
do you're hearing it and you're getting
it's common sense but are you gonna take
action and actually do something instead
of the password manager and do something
because what we're seeing is does it
even though so NPM is taking the
responsibility to notify these you know
invalidate these credentials and notify
these these module authors and you know
what's happening is is password gets
reset and then they change it back the
same thing people in our community are
being negligent popular packages are
being negligent about their security
stance and so you can start by having
good security practice yourself
evangelizing them within your teams and
Ear the other thing too is limiting the
number of publishers the sort of surface
area of the number of counts of access
to your things right that's another way
but also like people people tell me like
so what what about NPM shouldn't they be
doing something about this right and
they are there taking care to receive
this research from from these authors to
enable them to have good communication
channels to reach out to module authors
they're also building to to factor auth
when they when they have that come out
turn it on please write encourage
encourage them the modules that you
consume that you use to turn that on and
also yeah passwords I guess let's just
use some good passwords and stop you
know basically have good good
NPM yeah so I can turn around there I'm
gonna babble till the end basically
they're doing what they can you know
don't fight against a community be a
good community be a member and have
those have good have good security
practices good security hygiene we are
going to enable you to use some of this
data we've got some tooling that's gonna
expose all this research data that I
have about modules and things like that
we're gonna start publishing that and
giving you a way to interface with it
which should be exciting so look forward
to that you know somewhere on these
Twitter accounts that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
