you are in the tech field you might have
seen that these headlines that blocking
projects are getting hacked we're not
talking about tens of thousands we're
talking about tens of millions and
hundreds of millions of dollars being
lost in these projects and that is
exactly what we're going to talk about
today but more about these headlines
later how many of you are active within
the cryptocurrency
space how many of you own cryptocurrency
raise of hands quite a few people quite
a few people so Bitcoin the theorem the
two largest cryptocurrencies currently
when it comes to market cap and this
whole cryptocurrency revolution we see
currently started back in back in 2008
with the introduction of Bitcoin and
what started as a small movement on the
Internet were only taking people
programmer people were doing these kinds
of projects and experiments in with
cryptocurrencies
is now growing to a global scale
whenever I travel and educate
organizations companies financial
situations about this new field I
realized that this is getting bigger and
bigger and now the traditional industry
the traditional finance are getting into
this field and they are interested they
are eager to learn at the end they want
to understand this technology so
cryptocurrencies are here to stay for
sure and it's not only about the
institutions it's not only about the
business aspect of these things that
attract people my personal view is that
this this field is so hot because it's a
combination of three very very
interesting topics number one technology
of course the blockchain is an entirely
new paradigm for the first time ever we
can transfer value to each other on the
Internet so the technology is a huge
part of it all and this is what attracts
tech people like us but then we have the
society part of things this is also a
political movement a lot
the original people were very motivated
by politics and ideology as well and
also it's about economy how the economic
paradigm is shifting from traditional
finance to crypto finance going forward
we are entering Internet of money where
money becomes programmable and money is
also on the Internet and you might be
thinking that right we've been having
this insurance money for a long time
with banking online banking but this is
about permissionless Internet of money
anyone can start programming money now
that we have the blockchain Bitcoin
etherium all of these cryptocurrencies
however what do you think happens when
you take something as money you make it
programmable and you add Internet to it
what happens this happens very much like
with IOT you had a very perfect secure
light bulb you connect it to the
Internet and now you have light bulbs
and refrigerators trying to attack your
organization from within whenever we add
the programmability
to something whenever we add Internet to
something it opens up many possibilities
but it also comes with a lot of
responsibilities as well and so this new
paradigm in terms of money in my view
will help millions of people to come out
of poverty why by fighting
hyperinflation corruption and increasing
financial inclusion but at the same time
we have these huge issues currently
because there are no not no real best
practices and we are all new in this
field in this field of Internet of money
so Who am I my name is Ivan and as the
flag
fabulously in the case I'm from Sweden
and I'm a programmer programming has
been my passion since I was 9 years old
and I worked at different companies I
worked at for example Ericsson you might
recognize Sony Ericsson
we were huge in the phone business
together with our Finnish friends from
Nokia before Steve Jobs came along but
I'm also my current business guarantee
is blockchain
I run the YouTube channel Ivan on take
where educate people about the
technicalities of blockchain projects
and I also travel all around the globe
talking about blockchain and educating
companies organizations and governments
about this new field my partners and I
are also starting a new project called
Stockholm blockchain where we will
invest in blockchain startups in
blockchain ventures and also educate
organizations financial institutions
governments about this new new field so
enough about me how many know this man
how many of you recognize this man so
quite a few quite a few and we have to
realize that Bitcoin it is a
peer-to-peer cash payment system that's
correct but we also need to keep in mind
that Bitcoin has its own programming
language it's called script by design
script is a very dumb stack based
programming language it is so by design
but so vitalik what he was thinking is
guys let's add the turing-complete fully
fledged programming language to Bitcoin
but he didn't get much support that
didn't that idea didn't really grow in
the Bitcoin community so vitalik said i
am going to start my own project and
that is how a theorem was born so
currently harvest theorem which is this
platform for decentralized applications
on which you and I can program so-called
smart contracts and build our own
applications that will run in this
peer-to-peer decentralized manner
without any central server central
entity in the middle and this is where
we see this huge growth currently in
cryptocurrencies smart contracts are
really hot many people are raising money
using smart contracts and this paradigm
has really grown in the last
a couple of years so how do we program
these smart contracts well different
platforms have different programming
languages but because this talk is
mainly about the theorem because many of
these hacks happen on the theorem this
huge ones we're going to talk about
solidity which is the programming
language of a theorem and if you are
familiar with JavaScript
I think solidity will be easy for you to
learn because the syntax of solidity is
very it's very like JavaScript so we use
solidity to build smart contracts and
the smart contract can look like this so
if you're familiar with object-oriented
programming you might you might see this
as a class so we have a contract and we
have some functions that do different
things and this contract lives on the
blockchain this little program in itself
lives on the blockchain anyone can
interact with it and this is how we
program these smart contracts and as you
can recognize it is very much like
JavaScript also there is a huge huge
demand for solidity developers just
yesterday I was I organized a meet-up
for my subscribers and it's just
mind-blowing how many people are
starting blockchain startups they're
trying to do some kind of idea on the
blockchain and there are not many
developers currently in this field so
this quote is very interesting from from
one of the developers on the Dow which
was a big project and so if you if
you're interested if you don't like your
job take a look at solid ism and so the
whole idea is that these contracts this
apps that are on the blockchain the
whole idea is that they should be
immutable it's not like you have the
website and there is some bug and you
can just what fix it and it works fixing
things on the blockchain on aetherium
updating these small contracts is
difficult because the whole idea is that
they should be immutable and to really
understand the need of this inner
ability what we can do
to think about a simple smart contract
them together so smart contracts are all
about eliminating middleman so let's
imagine that you're my parents and I'm
your child and you want me to get your
money when you die so we have an
inheritance situation here we can solve
it currently by going to an escrow and
having a middleman in between solving
this issue and relying on that middleman
so that the middleman keeps track on
which track of when you die but we can
also do it without the middleman on the
blockchain by creating a smart contract
which will take your money you deposit
your money in the smart contract smart
contracts can hold money now we have
programs that can hold money and we can
together program it in a way that each
year you have to log in to that smart
contract to make it know that you're
still alive
and if you don't look in for two years I
will get your money so this is an
example for very simple smart contracts
and here you can see why smart contracts
need to be immutable because if I can
update the smart contract and change the
logic in the smart contract I can
basically withdraw your money before
you're dead because I was able to change
just change the logic of that contract
so the whole idea with smart contracts
is that they should be immutable meaning
meaning that when we're talking about
building these contracts we need to
think about like we're building a house
we cannot easily go and change things
these needs this needs to be carefully
engineered and carefully thought through
before we actually start building so
it's a bit different mindset compared to
when you're building a mobile app or a
web app because these things are
immutable they're hard to change and it
is by design so therefore we cannot
really be lean and build MVPs we cannot
hack a weekend and then we publish some
smart contracts and attract a lot of
money and then we get height so being
lean creating any piece is great
in the traditional programming but when
it comes to smart contracts when it
comes to blockchain everything needs to
be thought through because we're dealing
with money and we're dealing with tens
or hundreds of millions of dollars how
many of you have heard about this story
about a new a new person in the company
deleting the whole database in
production well now we're going to start
talking about these hacks and how they
happen so this has nothing to do with
the blockchain and I thought this was
interesting because a new person came
into the company accidentally deleted
the whole production database basically
deleting the company from existence but
we have our own such case which happened
just a few days ago which resulted in
300 million dollars locked up where
someone accidentally nuked a library on
a theorem and so this is the first hack
we're going to discuss this 300 million
accidental nuking of a library so on
easy room when rebuilding these
contracts they can reference other
contracts so in that way we have
libraries we have functionality being
located in different places and we need
to understand the concept of wallets
because this is central to this
particular event when we have a wallet
we have a program that runs on the
blockchain and it hold holds your funds
but this program references some kind of
libraries it doesn't have all the
functionality it needs inside of it
inside of its internal logic so wallets
they reference other contracts and they
use them as libraries and so what do you
think happens when such a library
disappears well the wallets can no
longer function and there is a
particular wallet called parity which is
extremely extremely popular and it had
is library
you so to speak and this happened just a
few days ago a week ago or so this
little issue appeared on github on
parities github when someone just asked
did you just said that I accidentally
healed your library without really
understanding the impact of that of that
event this discontinued on git er the
same person asking is this a serious
issue also still not understanding the
whole impact of those events and this
continued further and so the whole idea
with this issue is that this person was
able to make him or herself the owner of
that library and as the owner you can
basically kill the library and removed
from existence so there was a flaw in in
the deployment of the library which made
it possible for a random person to make
themselves the owner and by doing that
they were able to destroy it take it out
of existence meaning that all the
wallets that used that library no longer
could function and this is how 300
million of dollars are now locked in
this wallet and I mean there are ways to
fix it they are not easy if you're
interested we can talk after the session
but this is fixable
however it's extremely hard to fix
because the whole idea is that these
contracts are immutable and when we're
building contracts we're building houses
so it's not easy thing to fix and the
question is of course whose fault is it
because the person was able to interact
with the contract in in a perfect
perfectly normal way there was an issue
with the deployment so when we're
entering this internet of many part
money paradigm and we're dealing with
these huge amounts we're facing new
dilemmas and new questions for example
whose fault is this is the developers
not really because in the license it
said that they don't are not responsible
is that the users who weren't careful
enough
when choosing a wallet or
this random person who accidentally
nuked the library and of course when we
say accidentally we we do not know the
clear intentions of that person it could
be the case that is accidental but it
could also be the case that they were
trying to poke and the trying to
withdraw money somehow from the from the
smart contract and accidentally froze
everyone's funds so the intentions are
not clear and we are facing new
questions and new dilemmas when we're
entering this field our next hack so
here we will take a look at the code as
well
our next hack is a very significant hack
in the history of a theorem of this
decentralized
platform for decentralized applications
because this hack resulted in a split of
the community so now we have a theorem
project and we also have a theorem
classic the amount of dollars is a bit
lower but the significance of this hack
is a huge so when I will give you some
context the DAO how did it happen
basically the DAO was this project on
the blockchain and they raised money to
their project by selling their tokens
and by receiving ether as payment then
they had a smart contract a little
program as we saw earlier that held
these funds on the blockchain so they
had a smart contract however there was a
vulnerability in that smart contract
that let anyone to recursively drain
that contract of money and we're going
to take a look at exactly how that
happened but so the whole idea is that
there is this recursive vulnerability in
there is a potential of a recursive
vulnerability in the smart contracts so
how did it happen
let's take a look so this is pseudocode
this is not actually valid solidity code
but we have this function called
withdraw that people can call to in
order to withdraw their funds from the
contract and the whole idea is that when
I call withdraw I shouldn't be able to
take out more than I own
I have in that contract so how does the
contract know how much I have inside how
much money I have inside well it has a
map it has a map called balances and
when I call the smart contract I the
contract fetches the amount by querying
balances with my address so whenever
someone calls a function in a smart
contract the function knows your address
it is the sender so the functions always
knows who calls them so it fetches the
amount it pays out the amount and it
sets my balance to zero so it looks fine
if if you're not familiar with how
blockchain works with how smart
contracts on etherium work this might
look completely fine however the
vulnerability is in these few lines of
code because we have to realize when
we're coding on on the blockchain that
sometimes different methods change the
control flow and for example when we do
payout this gives the wallet that
receives the payment a possibility an
opportunity to run its own code so when
payout happens the wallet can run you
can run its own code meaning that the
wallet intern can call withdraw again
and the amount will be fetched again and
the payout will happen again and the
payout will call withdraw so this line
is never reached meaning that in this
recursive way the hacker was able to
drain the contract of fifty three
million dollars and of course the simple
fix is just to switch those lines so
that the balance is updated before the
payment happens and so even if you
recursively call it's now zero and
nothing more happens and so this is how
we Dowe happened and it is in my view
the most significant hack in the theorem
because it split the community into two
parts why did it happen well because on
one side the community said you know
what we should roll back the blockchain
we should we should make this
event we should remove it from history
basically we should return all the funds
to people who lost their funds because
we're such in your project and even if
the idea is that the code should be law
that the code should be immutable that
it shouldn't be possible to change the
code in small contracts let's do it this
one time and return the funds and this
is the way Assyrian went but if you
don't classic for ideological reasons
said no no no we shouldn't do it because
code is law code should be immutable and
we shouldn't do anything and it is
unfortunate but we do not agree with you
and we will not roll back this theft and
so that is the significance of this of
this particular hack and if you're
interested you can go to my channel and
you can see how we reconstruct the whole
hack together like a 20 minute video and
of course here as well whose fault is it
we're dealing with huge amounts of money
there is no way to find this hacker
release all anonymous and should we
blame the developers should we blame the
users still the community has to grow
and we don't really have a clear answer
for whose fault is it what I want to
make clear here is that whenever we
program on the blockchain really we
really really have to switch our mindset
and although solidity is very light
JavaScript the mindset should be
completely different with JavaScript you
build you build websites we can build
the apps with ionic it's very easy you
can do these hot fixes but with the
blockchain there is no way to do hot
fixes it's immutable it's like a house
and therefore the mindset has to change
and also it's very another interesting
aspect is this dissonance between the
technology and the use use meant use
cases of this technology because the
theorem is still experimental I mean the
founders of aetherium are very clear
that this is still experimental
technology although how many of you know
what this graph chart represents this
represents how much money is raised in
this
razors on etherium as you can see this
is May here is May of this year and as
you can see has completely exploded
during the summer and people are raising
more and more money in these fundraisers
because it's really a new way to raise
money and I think this is the future of
fundraising for sure because now anyone
all over the world can attract capital
to their project and being a part of the
global economic system so for sure this
is the future of fundraising but when it
comes to technology it is still
experimental technology and also this
article from CNBC some months ago stated
that initial coin offerings icos when we
talk about icos
who talk about this new way of raising
money on the blockchain by issuing coins
this way of raising money has already
surpassed VC funding in tech when it
comes to early investments so the use
cases are huge and I'm really excited
because it is this is what will bring so
many people and make them a part of the
global economic system because a lot of
poverty is because of financial
exclusion so by being included in the
global economic system we make so many
people empowered so long term I think
this is definitely a new way new
paradigm in fundraising but short term
we have to keep in mind the technical
limitations of platforms such as
aetherium and whenever we're building
this more contracts we should be
thinking like hardware developers or if
we're if we're developing financial
applications not as mobile or web
developers because of immutability
because we're building a house and this
is also a clash of best practices
whenever it comes to software
engineering what you learn in college
and what you learn when you work with
software normally and security so what
are these clashes for example monolithic
versus modular design as a social
developer of course you want to make
everything modular so that you can
exchange different parts and parts are
independent of each other
but it might create unnecessary
complexity when you're building smart
contracts and it might introduce me
new vulnerabilities new bugs so
monolithic versus modular design is a
clash of paradigms also rigid versus
upgradable of course we want web
applications to be upgradable so it
should be easy to fix it should be easy
to add new features but we do not want
to force more contracts to be that
upgradable because the whole idea is
that they should be immutable if we
together code the smart contract we make
a deal on the blockchain and we publish
our contract I shouldn't be able to just
go ahead and change it you shouldn't be
able to just go ahead and change it so
another clash of best practices and
finally the duplication versus reuse
duplication might be great if you're
working in normal software but of course
it is extra complexity on the blockchain
and as we saw currently with this
library it can cause a lot lot of damage
when it comes to financial losses or
financial funds being frozen as we
currently have experienced also we have
to keep in mind that these are all all
early days on the blockchain there are
no really best practices we're still
learning and if you read aetherium
documentation if you're interested in
solidity if you're interested in trying
to program this smart contracts to
trying to program money you will read
that all vulnerabilities haven't yet
been discovered this is still
experimental and you should be prepared
for that and of course this can be
compared with SQL injections when people
just took the input from a forum and you
know concatenated it into SQL squared
without checking we're still in those
days maybe even before those days so
best practices needs need to be put in
place and the whole community is very
very new very very fresh meaning that
there is still a lot of room to be the
expert to be the guy in your company who
knows everything about blockchain who
can do all of these smart contracts no
one except you knows it so as a
professional growth there is a lot of
possibilities and
please be curious please try it out
experiment you never know what you where
you will end up so we talked about these
fundraisers and we also talked about
that the financial institutions are
moving to the blockchain more and more
are interested in the blockchain the
traditional industry is still also are
also developing their own solutions are
also very interested in the use cases of
the blockchain and I personally think
that 2018 next year will really
accelerate and put blockchain into this
very very serious industrial use cases
so moving it even more from from this
Hobby activity on the Internet where we
just together you know we sit we chat we
do some Bitcoin hacking now we are
actually seen industrial use cases of
this technology both in the industry and
the financial sector because I think
many people in finance for example for
several years have been thinking if we
just you know if we just close our eyes
and we and we pretend that the
blockchain doesn't exist maybe it will
go away
maybe we'll we don't have to adapt or do
anything but as we saw with the chart is
just growing more and more people are
using it more and more possibilities of
the blockchain are being discovered and
therefore more and more institutions
more and more industries more and more
organizations are learning and are eager
to implement and be at the forefront
themselves so guys thank you so much for
attending this session this slide is
mainly for YouTube so if you have missed
the New York event if you have missed
the lift Wayne event I hope to see you
in Singapore in in a week or so also if
you're interested in blockchain the
technology behind blockchain the
technology behind different launching
projects please come to Ivan on Tech on
YouTube or if you're just interested in
blocking technology
you have your own blockchain ideas
please contact me at contact at Ivan on
tech comm because as I told you stock on
blockchain we are investing in
blockchain ventures and we are really
pushing this
that meant further that being said guys
thank you so much for being here and
that's it for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
