I'm Richard Feldman so this right here
is the Apollo bridge right here in
Bratislava it's about ten years old
which in bridge years is not very many
but it's a relatively young bridge but
in software years that's a lot right a
10 year old application you're still
maintaining that the same thing that's
pretty long time and I think the reason
for the difference there has to do with
the fact that software things tend to
change a lot more right projects get
canceled they get redesigned they get
rewritten in fact you got a 10-year old
project probably you're getting people
asking you why have you not rewritten it
in the latest and greatest thing yet but
sometimes every once in a while
something unusual happens project
succeeds now have to maintain it how
many people have had this experience on
you've ended up maintaining a software
project way longer than you anticipated
when you set out to start working on it
yeah me too
it's a pretty common experience I think
and when you do this you end up asking
yourself this question when things sort
of go unexpectedly why did that happen
what's what what happened there that's a
bug there's a some sort of unexpected
behavior going on and ideally as you've
been growing the project you've been
doing a good job keeping things simple
and maintainable right I've been doing a
good job keeping things organized and
you can sort of trace back and figure
out why that unexpected thing happened
and fix it but mmm all too often we end
up with something slightly different
right now we've all been there mom but
nobody wants to get there right nobody
sets out at the beginning of a software
project thinking you know someday this
project will succeed and I will maintain
it as a gigantic mess no one thinks that
right now what we all want to end up
with is if the project succeeds it ends
up nice and maintainable so how does
this happen how do we end up in this
unintended place well for my money it
has to do with the individual decisions
we make along the way we don't know if
the project's gonna succeed we're just
kind of taking it one step at a time and
we sort of tend to reach for the most
convenient thing we got this cable in
our hand we got to plug it in somewhere
we're like oh just whatever I'll just do
that the most convenient one which is
right there and then you say uh which is
the most communal that that one's next
most and sure enough sooner or later you
end up with a big mess even though each
of your individual decisions along the
way we're just pretty harmless you're
just doing the convenient thing I think
that taking the convenience route each
step of the way
ends up with a big mess unintended ly I
think you have sort of insist on
simplicity each step of the way if you
want to end up with a nice maintainable
project if it succeeds and you end up
finding yourself in a position to
maintain it but this is what appealed to
me about react when I first found out
about it back in 2013 this idea of
simplicity and in particular the
simplicity of the render function this
is this really simple yet powerful idea
of passing some state to a function and
just having it return a description of
how you want the Dom to look as opposed
to doing all this wiring within the Dom
talking back and forth between things
two-way data-binding much simpler to
just say here is the state and then here
is how I want the Dom to look I was not
the only one back in 2013 who thought
this was a good idea but we were
definitely in the minority in fact we
were in such a small minority that after
react was announced it got so much
blowback from the community that Pete
hunt went on this speaking tour called
rethinking best practices and rethinking
best practices was not originally
intended to be a compliment as he
describes in the talk this was actually
based on a tweet of someone criticizing
Facebook saying Oh Facebook rethinking
best practices throwing everything out
the window which you know to be fair I
mean this was pretty far afield right
when it came out if you look at that
slide in the background it says meat
react aka the V in MVC MVC short for
model-view-controller so some of you may
remember that this used to be the
dominant paradigm I mean the absolute
best practice back in 2013 this is what
everybody was doing but react was not
react said you know what I don't care
what everybody else is doing we think we
found something better and Pete did a
really good job articulating this I
think he said we've found that there are
certain best practices that deserve to
be challenged really resonated with me I
think this is true and I think this is
especially true in the service of
simplicity of trying to find a simpler
way to do the same thing we've been
doing
so I work for a company called no red
ink we make grammar and writing software
for English teachers and back in 2013 we
first decided we were gonna give react a
try the way that we did that was just by
saying let's ship something small just
get one small thing and take it all the
way into production we just picked one
page put one small part of one page and
said we're just gonna take this one
feature implement it and react on this
one page and get that all the way into
production
not a whole rewrite just saying yeah
just that one thing all the way into
production and the production part I
think is really important because when
you're building toy apps there are all
these things that you can just sort of
forget about but they're important
questions to be asking yourself things
like how are we gonna build this how are
we gonna test it how are we gonna deploy
it
how is it going to fit into our process
of creating software and getting it to
our users and without asking these
questions there's just sort of always
this invisible barrier between you and
the idea of using this new technology in
production but once you've actually
gotten a small thing into production
like we did then these questions go away
they've already been answered and from
there you can take this small little bit
of react you've got in production and
expand it and say oh well now it's not
such a big deal to say we want to do
this on our next feature just do a
little bit more a little bit more until
eventually after about a year we went
from having just introduced react a
little bit do it be only the dominant
paradigm of our front end in 2014 and it
was all just from that level seed we
planted back in 2013 and things
definitely got simpler when we when we
started using reacts our code got nicer
things were easier to maintain life was
just better but sometimes as much as you
try to aim for simplicity you get
complexity just sort of creeping in from
business requirements right this is not
to do with the technology choices we've
made this is just complexity that comes
from the fact that we're building
something that needs to be complex so as
an example of this this is our
assignment form so this is back in 2014
this was how it looked this is all in
react so we have tabs component up here
across the top got assignment name some
questions you can scramble the question
order points got potentially many
different classes here we've got a
component for selecting specific
students within a class to give the
assignment to got a due date you can
have some options here and you got
big accordion component down here that's
got all sorts of different options you
can select with with different topics to
select and all sorts of different
variations just a lot of stuff going on
here but the stuff that's going on here
is not complex because we've done a poor
job Limpy implementing it
it's just complex because the business
requirements are complex so in order to
maximize maintainability we've found
that there are just sort of certain
things that you can follow that lead to
things maintaining as much simplicity
and as much maintainability as possible
as the code base grows and these are
some things that you've probably been
hearing throughout the community these
probably won't come as too much of a
surprise um instead of using mutable
objects a lot of things just prefer
immutable data it's just sort of less to
worry about when you're just handing
data from function to function and
you're not able to mutate it or not
worry about that the function that
you're giving it to is going to mess
with it creates a sort of smaller web of
dependencies I'm also avoiding stateful
components in favor of stateless
components going back to that idea of
the render function itself being
incredibly simple a stateless component
just boils it down to that function it
doesn't have this sort of coupling or
the co-locating of State along with the
the UI logic and finally avoiding
imperative side-effects and instead
preferring declarative pure functions
like we've heard that you should always
use pure functions in your render
function you should always use them in
reducers I'm really just in general the
more pure functions you can do the
simpler your applications gonna be the
easier it's gonna be to maintain then of
course with these best practices these
these ideas that will sort of make life
easier you gotta ask the question how
easy is it to stick to this because
we're human right I mean nobody wants to
end up with a code base it's difficult
to maintain and yet we very frequently
do and the reason for that is that when
one of these is sort of right at hand
it's the most convenient thing you say
yes I know I want to be mostly immutable
but just this once I'm gonna mutate
something and then move on I'm on a
tight deadline and then you know one
thing leads to another and eventually
that one decision ends up biting you
later there's this really really
interesting question of can we do better
than just sort of telling ourselves not
to do this then using discipline to
avoid using these things that are in
tool box and just say well let's just
pretend that they aren't like what if we
just didn't have imperative side-effects
what if we didn't have stateful
components what if we didn't have
mutable objects what if our toolbox was
just the simple things mutable data
stainless components and declarative
pure functions and that was all we had
to work with that swell box sounds
appealing you might understand why we
might be interested in Elm because this
is exactly the toolbox you have in Elm
it's just immutable data pure functions
rendering things that's it so Elm is a
functional programming language if you
haven't heard of it I compile the
JavaScript and it has a very overt focus
on simplicity to the point where Elm
does not have a component system at all
if you search through the guide and look
for the word components the only place
you'll find it is explaining by the way
you might be used to a component system
here's why we don't have one and here's
how you do things instead no component
system at all you might be saying wait a
minute like how can you just have
functions all the way and no components
like that's that's bizarre that's not
how anyone does it like if you throw a
rock you will hit a JavaScript framework
that has a component system it's just
it's everywhere right um and to that I
would like to refer back to our good
friend Pete hunt and say you know what I
think that there are certain best
practices that deserve to be challenged
and in particular they deserve to be
challenged in the name of simplicity so
how did this go this is switching to Elm
just trying it out and implementing
something well let's let's take a look
this is our assignment form from 2014
this is our assignment form today this
is what we have in production right now
it's it's grown over the years because
again the business requirements have
changed we've tried to make it seem a
little bit less intimidating by sort of
using this perfect progressive reveal
but there's actually quite a lot to be
revealed right so we have a bunch of
different students here there's some
form validation going on as I check and
uncheck things a bunch of different
types of practices and quizzes and
things that we can give to users um if I
click this button BAM this this pops out
we've got a whole bunch of topics you
can select you can see we've got these
accordions right here like before as I
check these it's gonna actually be
syncing with the UI in the background
there's just a whole lot of stuff going
on here ok
so this is more complex it's sort of
unavoidably more complex due to the the
business requirements having gotten more
complex but what if I told you that
between comparing this assignment form
to this much simpler one in terms of
business requirements this one
implements it in reacts this one
implemented in Elm that of the two this
one's easier to maintain we actually
used to be afraid of maintaining this
like every time we'd release some new
content would be like somebody's got to
go mess with the assignment for but
don't know divs I don't know not me I
mean it was it was really tough to
maintain it but this Elm based one this
is not something people are afraid of
anyone feels free to maintain even if
they just joined the team
we have no compulsion about saying any
new team member can go in and edit this
thing because element has this
intentional focus on simplicity and of
course I would be remiss if I didn't
mention it also has a fantastic compiler
that's incredibly helpful I'll talk a
little bit more about that later though
how did it go went incredibly well we
now have 50,000 lines of elam code in
production we've been using it more and
more we planted that small seed and just
kept growing it and growing it we've now
been using it for over one and a half
years in production and something that
you may have heard me say before we've
we've got this error logging service
that tells us every time we get a
runtime exception so we've been getting
runtime exceptions for a very long time
we've been you know ever since I joined
the company you know reacts JavaScript
anything in there has been throwing lots
of runtime exceptions and we logged them
every time we get one in production our
elm code these 50,000 lines that we've
been using but one and a half years the
total number of runtime exceptions we've
gotten from our elm code in that entire
period of time is zero that might sound
like a preposterous claim if you've
never heard me make it before but I've
been making it over a year now because
it still hasn't happened yet
we're still waiting for the first case
where we actually find our elm code
crashed except the good production does
not say it's impossible right I mean
obviously you can just like write
something that recursive indefinitely
you can blow the stack I mean there's
plenty of ways you can get an Ellen
program to crash but the point is it's
surprisingly difficult to do it by
accident right I mean if you actually
care about what you're deploying the
compiler just says such a good job of
finding these things ahead of time
that it just hasn't happened to us yet
though in addition to making our code
more maintainable through its simplicity
through the compiler it's also made our
code more reliable we were able to
deliver a better experience to our end
users because of this we did this
exactly the same way as we did with
react
you just started by saying hey let's
ship something small just one small part
of one page and get it all the way into
production get all those questions
answered how are we gonna build it how
are we gonna test it all that once
you've got something small in production
a lot of unknowns go away so 2013 we
started off with a little bit of react
2014 react sort of took over our front
end and 2015 we introduced just a little
bit of element to that mix at this point
we now have react in Elm co-existing so
let's talk about that for a little bit
so you can sort of add a dash of Elm to
any given page we talked about that
earlier here's one of the examples of
that so we've got here our home page and
almost everything you see here is just
plain old static HTML and CSS one
exception the login button here so this
is LM code right here this thing that
just popped out it's this is all just
done in LM so I can try this it's like
gonna validate it's gonna give me a
networker because I turned off the Wi-Fi
but all of this stuff is just a tiny
little embedded Elm application right
there in that one little div that's all
it takes you're thinking about getting
element of direction do it like this
just pick something really small
something really low risk where if you
try it out and you decide you don't like
it you can just say okay well we'll just
rewrite it and what we're using before
no problem that's all it takes
if you're wondering in particular how to
do this with react there's this great
blog post called how to use element work
and it's titled that because this is
sort of the most common way that we hear
people successfully starting to use
element work is introducing it
incrementally like this and I said Elm
Lang org slash blog just scroll down a
little bit there's that blog post and
the way that it explains to do this is
it gives the example of how to embed an
Elm application inside a react component
it's all it takes just adding a little
dash of Elm you can also go the other
way around and add a dash of JavaScript
to an existing elm page so this would be
some case where you need to
Everage the the much larger JavaScript
ecosystem or the react ecosystem so one
amusing example of this is talked about
this 2014 assignment forum built and
react we didn't build the whole thing
and react this little date time picker
right here this is actually jQuery
because we couldn't find something that
had both the date and the time that had
like the UX that we wanted anywhere
except for this jQuery date picker
fortunately react lets you interrupt
with arbitrary JavaScript stuff and so
we were able to do that
it turns out Elm also lets you do that
and this whole page is not actually an
Elm because we still have that same
jQuery date/time picker and the
assignment form that we're using today
we still have that found a better one
that we like better so I you have that
escape hatch and react and you also have
it in Elm so Elm lets you do JavaScript
Interop and you know as we like to say
any page that's 99% Elm and 1%
JavaScript totally happy to maintain
that because whatever anything crashes
you know exactly where to look so hiring
is uh is a good question it's a question
that I get asked a lot actually earlier
on at the conference somebody came up to
me and and said hey so I heard you guys
using element reduction a lot but um how
do you hire people like how do you hire
elm developers and the answer is first
of all that we don't require any elm
knowledge coming in we just you know if
you don't know it we just teach you but
as to the question of you know how do
you find people so this is a
visualization of our our hiring pipeline
before we started using element and
telling people about it and since we
started using element and telling people
that we use element production it's gone
from this to this
we have gotten flooded it with
applications I mean seriously like I I
have to tell you the story so I was
practicing this talk for one of my
co-workers and I had like a much more
toned-down version this visualization he
was like no no that's not enough it's
they're not gonna get it like Three
Gorges Dam that's the only like
appropriate metaphor for what's happened
I mean seriously like good programmers
want to use awesome technology right
that's kind of makes sense Alan was
awesome technology I can't remember the
last time I did an interview where the
candidate didn't bring up wanting to use
Elm as the reason they apply like it's
just incredible what it's done for our
hiring
it's almost impossible to overstate so
the idea of how do you how do you manage
to hire people like I don't remember how
we managed to hire anyone before Elm
because it was incredibly difficult and
now it's much easier this might be a
good time to mention by the way we're
hiring we do hire remote people you
don't have to know Elm on day one
totally not a problem and we hired
several people in Europe so uh no remote
from Europe is totally cool so
onboarding is something you might be
wondering about since I'm saying that
we're onboarding people to Elm if they
don't already know Elm I actually I'm
able to compare our onboarding
experience from react and elm because as
early adopters have react back in 2013
we're also familiar with what it's like
to try and get someone from zero react
knowledge to learning react in addition
to getting from zero elm knowledge and
to being able to contribute on the Elm
side um
granted like this day and age obviously
more new hires already know reacts and
elm that's just sort of a given
something that might be surprising
though is the amount of time that it
takes someone to get productive if they
don't know either of them pretty much
the same between the two and that might
sound like strange and particularly
because Elms a totally different
language like react you still write
JavaScript so if you already know
JavaScript you have a huge leg up Elm
different language obviously more to
learn so how could it be that someone
going from zero knowledge in that
particular area to being able to be a
production contributor is about the same
for reacting Elm the answer is just that
Elms compiler aids beginner learning a
lot let me give an example of this let's
say I wrote this Elm code if string dot
length user dot last name then so this
is calling the string dot length
function on user dot last name to get
back the length of that of that string
and this is actually gonna be an error
let's take a look at what the compiler
tells us says type mismatch this
condition does not evaluate to a boolean
value true or false a little red
squiggly underline under the offending
condition got the line number on the
side there you've given me a condition
with this type int but I need it to be
bool hint L does not have truthiness
such that instance strings and lists are
automatically converted to boolean s--
do that conversion explicitly so not
only does it tell you about the problem
and where it is and give you about as
much detail as you could want on it but
it even has hints for common beginner
mistakes like this right so it's sort of
a built in
teaching aid into the language obviously
we don't just turn people loose and say
just go bang your head to get some
compiler errors and then you'll know Elm
that would be a little unrealistic but
it definitely definitely helps give you
one more example let's say I wrote this
code this would be totally valid
JavaScript code first name plus space
plus last name but it's not valid ellen
code i'm not going to tell you why i'm
just going to show you the error message
let's see if you can learn it height
mismatch the left argument of plus is
causing a type mismatch plus is
expecting the left argument to be a
number but the left argument is a string
hint to append strings in elm you need
to use the plus plus operator not plus
well you all just learned something from
elm and i didn't even have to teach it
to you i just read out loud what the
compiler would have told you so this is
why our onboarding experience with elm
is able to be about comparable to the
onboarding experience we had getting
people to learn react from scratch even
though it's a totally different language
this compiler is just unbelievably
helpful by the way if you're wondering
whether having this level of compiler
support makes our lives easier from the
maintainability perspective oh man yes
it is unbelievably nice i I really never
want to go back so uh from the technical
debt perspective this has some
implications so there's this sort of
saying if it compiles it usually just
works and this is something that people
have had this sort of shared experience
around in Elm if your code compiles
usually it just works now that's nice
when you're building new stuff but it's
incredibly nice when you're refactoring
it means that we end up refactoring way
way more often than we used to way more
commits that are looking like this this
was an Elmarie factor that we had
recently and the reason that it's it's
so much easier to refactor is just that
when you refactor our react code we used
to have this experience where we would
change a bunch of stuff and then a bunch
of stuff would break and also all but a
bunch of our tests would break we'd have
to go rewrite the test and then
hopefully we're covering as much as we
were before bitten maybe not and then we
get an introduction and maybe we would
we would crash we would have some bug
that cropped up some regression and no I
mean the refactor yeah the code is nicer
but it's it's a bummer that we
introduced that regression but with
helmet code we just don't really have
that happen very often like when you
change stuff in elm code no matter how
big the codebase
no matter how many files it's panning
the compiler looks at all of them
regardless of whether or not you have
tests covering those things the
compilers gonna tell you if you hook
things up wrong if they no longer fit
together it's gonna let you know which
means that if you had this experience if
it compiles it usually just works you
feel this incredible freedom to refactor
it's no longer a scary proposition it's
something you can just do and just be
like oh yeah that'll probably just work
out again so you know this story one of
my co-workers who works on the ops team
he knows a little bit of alum but like
just enough to be dangerous as it were
he told me that he actually feels
comfortable making pull requests against
our Ellyn codebase to introduce reef
actors when he comes across things that
he thinks could be a little bit cleaner
because even though he doesn't know elm
very well bio who's got his back right I
mean he's confident that if it compiles
he's not going to introduce a regression
even though unlike the rest of us he's
not working on Elm every day um this
also impacts new features so it is
definitely the case that if I'm building
a new feature from scratch like react
will get me something on the screen that
works that I can try out in less time
and the reason for that is stateful
components right so if I want to have a
date picker and I want to introduce that
to my application in react I can have a
stateful component date picker and I can
just drop it in in one place and it's
just gonna work that's it that's the end
of the story but because Elm doesn't
have that I now have to actually say
okay over here I want to introduce that
to the rendering part of my app and over
here I want to introduce the state
management that goes with that it's sort
of two different steps instead of the
one step where you just drop it in and
it just works well that means that it's
less time to get something rendering and
react than it would be an elm but what
we found is that it takes less time to
go from zero to shipping the feature in
elm and the reason for that is that
although maintainability has a lot to do
with fixing bugs and making your code
cleaner and finding edge cases and stuff
like that you still do some of that on
the way to the first time you're getting
something into production like the first
time you get something up on the screen
you're like great this is pretty good
but that's not necessarily what you're
gonna get when you take it through a
full QA pass when you try and really
push its limits and find out where
things are gonna break because elm gives
us this additional layer of of help up
from the compiler as we're going from
start to finish we end up getting so
much help that it more than compensates
for the amount of additional time it
takes us to set things up
because we don't have staple components
so it's the net cost savings if you
consider the time from zero to getting
something into production which for our
money is the metric that we care the
most about community okay so the react
community is huge the old community is
much smaller but I do remember a time
when the react community was small right
when we first got into react people were
saying the same things about the react
community that we were about Elm they
say well how can you abandon this huge
ecosystem of MVC stuff like how can you
you know blaze this new trail he said
well you know we think it's worth it we
think it's a nicer system and the
community grew over time and now the
react community is huge the only
community much smaller but it is growing
pretty quickly this is a Matt did this
visualization of Elm github repos
created by month so yeah there's a lot
of momentum to this thing still not big
still not as big as react you know but
but growing pretty quickly there's a ton
of meetups happening they like to do a
little variations on the Elm logo -
pretty sweet I'm a fan of quite a few of
these and we also recently had the first
ever Elm conference back and collocated
was strangely so yeah small community
but definitely growing quickly and there
were about 230 people at Elm conf and it
was exciting to just see everyone coming
together and just sort of being a part
of this growing thing so all things
considered we we started off with just
introducing a little bit of react and
then we sort of grew that and expanded
it and and had a going from being in
production to being the dominant
paradigm of our front-end and we
introduced a little bit of Elm the year
later and then now we've actually gotten
all the way to the point that Elm has
become the dominant paradigm in our
front-end and actually most of our
front-end code is now in Elm and react
has become legacy code for us so would
we do it all again where we go through
all that stuff just introducing things
incrementally growing it and growing it
yeah absolutely
they've been a fantastic experience so
if you want to learn more
a couple resources to recommend Elm
weekly is a sort of a weekly mailer just
tells you what's been going on in Elm
community Elm Tallinn podcast just
started up this is a podcast dedicated
to Elm there's a guide for getting
started guide Elm lang org check that
out slack amazing slack channel like
lots of help especially in the beginners
Channel
super friendly people shameless plug I
have to mention I'm writing a book
element action formatting publications
available for early access I believe
they have a discount code for this
conference so uh please check that out
so if you're considering Elm View if
you're thinking about it sounds
interesting but I haven't quite gotten
the the ability to get it going yet what
I would suggest is chip something small
and get it all the way into production
and then you can see whether you like it
or not thanks very much thank you a
trade awesome
so let's go three questions it's since
we have a quite a few of them so let's
see how many we can fit into five
minutes how can you optimize immutable
data structures to be performing a low
Marik low CP environments like mobile
phones or IOT that's a good question
that's a good question for somebody
who's a compiler author which I totally
have not I don't know how to optimize
those what I can say is so if you look
on the Elm website there's a blog post
called blazing fast HTML round two and
it's got benchmarks of LM against like
react ember angular a bunch of popular
frameworks and Elm is outperforming all
of them and render performance on top of
which in that benchmark L most severely
handicapped because it's doing lots of
performance optimizations that Evan
thought would be cheating to show in
there so basically TL DR elements quite
fast I'm sure you can probably do even
better than that if you're optimizing
stuff for low CPU environments but if
you think that things like reacts ember
angular are fast enough for your
purposes then good news Elm is going to
be even faster should I learn Elm or
reason Elm that was fast
I'm gonna continue with why hahaha
um I I don't no reason I I really can't
speak to that I you know had I used both
of them that I could probably say
something intelligent about it but I
used Elma I'm extremely happy with it I
I'm sort of aware of the characteristics
of reason and it doesn't seem like it
has anything to offer me
maybe if I wanted to use it on the
server side like because elm does not
have server side yet and probably won't
for quite a while so if I wanted to have
the same language on the client on the
server that would be something that
would appeal to me about it
but as far as friends language goes I
mean I don't know doesn't doesn't really
seem like I have anything to gain from
switching to it so so continuing at the
question what's the worst part of Elm
for you ah yeah so that ties right into
it um the fact that I can't use a lot
the server so I mean I say that in jest
like I would really love to use elm on
the server like and I'm excited for the
day that I can but that does mean that
like if so I used to have an application
where I was writing note on the server
and and j/s in the browser and so you
know just having the same language in
both places was pretty nice and if you
choose Elam you just can't have that and
so I guess I would I would throw in what
other like extra worst part about
element it like that's that's the thing
that I like the least but the other
thing that is sort of like the hardest
part is just like the learning curve
right so it's it's a different language
and and that means that like if I'm
trying to get somebody to like you know
work at no retain core or talk about elm
with me if they don't already know it
then I sort of have like a significant
bridge to cross before I can like have
intelligent conversations with them but
I'm still sort of like struggling to
figure out how to you know communicate
more effectively when we don't
necessarily have all the same shared
jargon what about dead code elimination
and code splitting it down so that is
sort of going to be the focus of the
next release of Elms of it there's a
0.18 is about to drop and like probably
less than a month the the release after
that is is looking into all that stuff
so right now we basically just like use
webpack and just sort of like do webpack
related stuff and and like there's no
elm specific like dead code elimination
or code splitting but it seems like
there's a big opportunity to get into
those things and so it's sort of like
under active investigation but
TLDR is not a thing yet like in pure elm
and so if you require those things then
honestly you know like I I wouldn't
recommend using elm yet but I would
definitely keep an eye out for that
release because I expect that you know
based on past releases that it'll be
nice when it does exist what about when
is Elm point 18 going to be released how
many more iterations out till version
1.0 gets launched so uh 18 I'm guessing
is gonna be released in probably the
next couple weeks so less than a month I
don't know for sure because it's all
just sort of like you know when it's
done right as far as how many more
iterations until 1.0 so I've talked
about this with Evan the the creator of
elm and basically what what he said is
sort of like 1.0 should be a really
boring release and really you you want
to cut 1.0 when you're saying like we
haven't changed anything in a while so
why don't we just announce that we're
stable now but you know Elam is still
changing it's still sort of like
evolving and you know the last three
feet releases have removed features on
purpose to try and make it even simpler
and as long as that's sort of happening
on a regular basis it seems like it
would be you know like a little bit
disingenuous to say oh we're at one
point oh you can trust everything now it
should be more of a like okay things
have been stable for a while now let's
call it 1.0 okay so fast answers what
about a beckon compatibility can I use
Elm to build notes eg extra SAP yeah not
yet so I mean in as much as Elm can
interoperate with JavaScript like if you
want you could run Elm on the server and
just only put business logic in Elm but
then like do Interop for like database
and HTTP and like everything but that
sounds like a lot more work it's worth
to be honest so yeah basic answer is not
yet and with that answer thank you very
much really appreciate it
