laptop it's actually the laptop I'm
using here to present this talk insulin
over I think pad X 230 T I bought it in
August 2013 so about three years ago
when I bought it
the the battery capacity was at least
the rated battery capacity is 62 watt
hours and when I'm sort of surfing the
web and writing my top slides and all
that sort of stuff I get about a run in
about 12 watts so that was giving me
about five hours of battery life so I
was pretty happy with that
then about two years later the reported
full charge capacity dropped to about
2:1 hours so just let me say it again it
went from 60 to 1 hours to 2 watt hours
I'm not sure whether maybe one of the
cells failed or whether that's just
normal degradation over time but either
way I was only getting about 10 minutes
of battery life out of it now so you
would say ok it's time for a new battery
it's it's run its course so I went
online this is a this battery the
original battery I've got it here it's a
4 in for 5 n 107 9 Lenovo battery so I
went online to about depot.com
I found something that looked like it
was a replacement for this battery add
to cart' few days later it arrived I put
it in my laptop and I switched on my
laptop and this is what it says the
system does not support batteries though
not genuine lenovo made or authorised
the system will continue to boot but may
not charge on authorized batteries now
I'm not sure what May means but the
battery definitely did not charge and
what's interesting is it didn't charge
even when the laptops off like I would
have thought naively that you have your
battery plugged into the power and
starts charging but even when the laptop
was off I'd plug it in and the battery
wouldn't charge so something odd was
going on and so I started looking into
this so just to give you some background
most I think probably all in practice
laptop batteries in
then something called smart battery
system it's a standard industry
specification basically it specifies the
protocol for talking to a smart battery
a smoke smart battery being a battery
with a with a controller in it and every
laptop battery I know there's a smart
battery so it requires a clock and data
pin for sm bus which is basically I
squared C and a thermistor or safety
single pin so if we look at the lenovo a
battery pin out it's got those three
pins and plus and minus it's a fairly
standard sort of laptop battery pin out
so the next thing i needed to do is to
sniff the communication on the sm bus
there sim bus is what the laptop talks
for the battery on and finds out
capacity all that sort of stuff so i
wanted to know why it wouldn't charge
this battery so I needed to sniff the
battery communication over sm bus so
what I did was I took my logic analyzer
which was a little USB SX I don't even
buy these anymore but you can get
similar things and I probed those clock
and data signals now it's actually quite
convenient in this laptop there's enough
run in the battery contacts that you can
put your probes in and while still
having the laptop battery in the laptop
so this is handy I just had it as you
can see here the battery is actually
connected to the laptop but I've got the
probes running out of it to the logic
analyzer and then this is the user
interface for the for this logic
analyzer program I'm sorry about the
windows my my Linux laptop was on the
desktop upside down so I was using I was
borrowing a Windows laptop to to run
this software and basically you can see
it's captured on those top two lines you
can see it's it's captured the the clock
and data signals and then one of the
cool things about these sort of software
packages they have built-in decoding for
protocol so in these cases of I squared
C decoder you can't read that but I'll
show you on the next slide with a bit of
cleaning up it looks something like this
so each each line there is basically a
communication over I squared C SM bus
this is very raw just the raw bytes
going over then I went and looked at the
SPS specification and I figured out what
each of these things that means so when
you write it in a little bit more user
understandable form this is what's going
to the battery so that laptop asks for
firstly specification info which tells
that what sort of protocol is talking to
in this case the battery returns
I'm it's BS 1.1 compliant then it reads
battery mode reads design capacity
design voltage manufacture date all
those sort of all that sort of
information about the battery so that's
fairly straightforward this happens with
any battery in fact even Apple batteries
speak SPS so if if Apple does it then
probably every laptop battery does it
because you know Apple isn't known to
follow standards then we look a bit
further down this capture and we get to
something that looks a bit odd so in the
SPS specification there's some codes the
reserved for manufacturer vendor
specific use so one of those is this
optional manufacturer function for and
so they're sending this optional
manufacturer function for command with
four bytes of data and then this
patchily this is my replacement
batteries returning nothing and then
tries it again and the battery doesn't
even bother acknowledging the command
tries it again the battery returns
nothing and and so on so something's not
quite right there I put my original
battery in and it sends this command and
the battery returns the string Lenovo
Japan and then for other bytes and this
is basically doing challenge response
authentication where it's sending four
bytes to the battery and the battery is
responding with the string Lenovo Japan
and for response bytes which are
calculated based off the of the
challenge
so this is a little bit unfortunate so
what what can I do about this well I
could I could throw that battery in the
trash and I could go and buy a genuine
battery from one over no I had this
battery it seems to work okay other than
the fact that didn't charge so I wanted
to get it working now
I admit there could be safety aspects
too in the gentleman went over battery
may have better quality control than
something random I bought off the
internet
but I mean I can talk a little bit more
about that later if I have time but I
wanted to get this battery working it
was it was a challenge so another option
I is I could replace the cells in the
original battery with cells from the new
battery so use the original battery
controller from the genuine Lenovo
battery but just replace the lithium-ion
cells in it this is tricky for a few
reasons one is getting the battery apart
is is difficult the way these batteries
are constructed they have both both tabs
and glue so in order to break it apart
in order to break the glue apart you
have to apply a lot of force but when
you apply a lot of force you break the
tabs so it's basically designed not to
be neatly D constructible so I mean
mostly it's cosmetic they do actually
click back together so it's possible to
get a get a working battery again but
you end up with a bit of damage to your
case in the process also when you
replace those cells there is there is a
little battery Subbaiah chip in there
and if the text the voltage is going out
of range it blows the fuse so if you
accidentally blow the fuse then you have
to replace the fuse as well and probably
the most concerning thing for that for
me was the fact that the flash in this
battery stores battery calibration data
and I wasn't sure like if I replace the
cells are the new cells going to be
working optimally while the controller
still has the old
raishin data and of course i don't know
how to reset that so this is an option
but i wanted to investigate other
options as well so another option would
be to hack the firmware on the battery
to support authentication this is tricky
obviously it hasn't been done before
there's a great talk at from Def Con
about battery firmware hacking and this
guy Charlie Miller's done it before with
a TI chip he figured out what the
architecture of the microcontroller
inside the battery is and managed to
program it so I mean this is kind of
scary but batteries have firmware
running on them and so you can in theory
hack batteries in my case it was very
difficult I couldn't figure out how to
unlock the firmware update so and even
if I could I have to figure out how to
actually modify the firmware so this is
tricky again something that would be
cool to do but it's tricky another
option would be to add a little micro
controller on the sm bus so that when
the battery doesn't responds that
challenge my micro controller would
respond to that challenge instead and in
my bed in my laptop there's a bit of
space in the mini PCIe slot so I could
stashed all my controller in there these
days obviously you can get boards
they're pretty tiny this is not very
nice I mean I've got I'd have to add
some little little board typing inside
my laptop it's pretty ugly so this is
this is again a bit of a last resort so
the other option was to modify my laptop
firmware to remove the battery
authentication check and I'm
foreshadowing this is what this is what
I this is the path I went down now the
question is what when I say laptop
firmware what do I mean it's it's not
the bias because the bias only runs when
the processors on and I said before that
the battery didn't charge even when the
laptop was off so that means it's not
the bias so there's another bit of the
computer which is called the embedded
controller most
tops have an embedded controller and
it's it's basically a little micro
controller in the laptop that's powered
at all times even when the laptops
normally off it's sort of similar to BMC
baseboard management controller and a
server and it's responsible for power
management type stuff and it's also it
also doubles as the keyboard controller
it sits on something called the LPC bus
which is basically that is a bus I don't
know but for for those for those of you
who like me are starting to get a bit of
gray hay or remember in the 80s and 90s
our computers had a si buses in them
well yes in 2017 is still an ISA busting
your computer it's called the LPC bus
and that's where this embedded control
is connected so if you look at that
diagram in this laptop the sticky is
talking to the South Bridge the platform
controller hub and the South Bridge is
is talking to the embedded controller
over LTC so that's how the CPU accesses
it and in my in my think pad that
embedded controller is a chip the MHz
16:19 it's basically a chip that's
specifically designed for use as an
embedded controller in laptops the
microprocessor control it's a
microprocessor core is something called
arc AR see some of you may be familiar
with it some of you may be less familiar
with it it's an embedded micro
controller it was originally designed
for I believe if my memory serves me
correctly it was designed for Super
Nintendo it was one of the graphics
accelerator cores on the Super Nintendo
and then it got licensed to various
other companies and it's basically one
of these embedded micro purposes the
architectures that's used in various
things like arm and MIPS
you'll find it in set-top box there's
all sorts of things so this has an arc
microprocessor in it it's got some flash
memory 192k flash memory and 16 K of RAM
so you'll notice there's a lot more
flash memory than there is Ram the
program executes out of a flash memory
the RAM is
a little scratch pad RAM in case you
need a bit of RAM so then I went to pull
apart the embedded controller firmware
this is actually quite easy to do
because when you update the system
biased in this laptop it also updates
the embedded controller bus so if you
grab the BIOS update file for the laptop
you can pull the embedded controller
firmware out of that and then I
disassembled that there's there's a glue
tool chain available and also
interactive disassembler supports it so
then I went through this disassembled
firmware and I was looking for where it
does this battery authentication so the
most obvious thing I was looking for is
that optional manufacturer function for
command that it sends to the battery
which the the code is sixty decimal 3 C
hex so I looked through the code for all
the references to 60 decimal and there
was this I found which was the most
likely candidate where so on that arc
architecture the arguments to a function
go in r0 r1 r2 r3 etc and in one
argument it passed 60 and then in the
next argument it passed four which to me
was was a big flag because 4 was the
length of the data that it passed with
the with that authentication sequence so
this was my hypothesis that that's the
code that does it and then I looked
around and in fact when I looked around
the surrounding code I managed to decode
a state machine that looks something
like this so this state 0 to 6 which is
sort of initialization but then in stage
7 it starts this write command to the
battery state a 2 checks whether
succeeded etc then sends the read
command it gets the data back it
validates the battery response so if we
look closer this validation of the
battery response it gets the it gets
response and calls a validate function
then it there's this branch where if the
return value of that validation function
was not equal to one then it branches to
a failure path so basically if I if I
can just remove that branch and it will
fall straight through to the success
path so that that's that seems fairly
easy I just need to remove that branch
and it will fall through and act as if
the battery validation succeeded but of
course the it's it's always a little bit
harder than that this check sums in the
image so if we modify the image I'll
have to recalculate the check sums and
say at a minimum if you look at the
image the last four bytes it's a pretty
obvious flag when you see the s would
basically the the end of the flash
memory that's unused and then the last
four bytes something random and that
changes in each version so that's a
pretty obvious flag that that's the
checksum but I couldn't figure out what
algorithm it actually was that we used
to generate that checksum so that was
Mel's one issue then something else odd
I found while digging through this image
was that there's there's a fairly large
section of this image that looks like
binary gunk and usually that means it's
either compressed are encrypted and if
you look if you disassemble the other
code there's jumps into the binary go
so that makes encryption more likely
compression because you can't really
compress so you can't decompress in
place yeah you can decrypt in place so
my hypothesis was that it's encrypted
and also from a certain offset to the
end in each firmware revision because I
download lots of BIOS updates and
compared them all in each in each
revision from a certain offset to the
end of that encrypted block changed so
my hypothesis was that this cipher block
chaining where each block each a by
block depends on the previous eight byte
block and so once anything changes the
rest of it changes going back to what I
said before that there's code jumps into
this section my hypothesis was it's got
to be decrypted before programming so
the flash in the embedded controller
because like I said before there's a
ninety-two cave flash that the program
executes Salib there's only 16 cave ram
so it can't decrypt into RAM and execute
our RAM it's got to be executing out of
flash and so my hypothesis is that it's
got to be decrypted before programming
so let's have a look at what the
programming process looks like and
hopefully we'll find how that decryption
happens so the way the AC programming
works is the bias update program when
you run it it writes the new update to a
spare flash memory area in in an SPI
flash chip on the on the motherboard and
then the system reboots and it's not
actually the bias update program that
writes the AC firmware it's the bias in
an early boot stage and the reason is
that after certain point in boot as
happens with a lot of these things
things are locked down so you can no
longer do the embedded controller update
so it's done by BIOS early in the boot
now whether or not this is actually
extra security I mean I could just write
my but I'm write my AC update to the
flash memory area and you know next time
the user reboots it'll get a flash so
it's probably not that much extra
security but this is the way they do it
so in order to find that embedded
controller update code we need to look
at the bias the bias is a UEFI compliant
bias like most these days the firmware
update file for UEFI systems something
called a capsule it's basically a
standard format of packing together that
update there's various tools that can
pull that apart I use something called
you at UEFI tool once you pull them
apart you get lots of little executable
modules basically this is how the UEFI
architecture works there's lots of
executable modules each one of those is
a portable executable it's basically the
same format as a Windows XE but
obviously they don't run under windows
they're designed to run in the native
EFI environment and so each of these a
little bit of the initialization and
then they run in a certain dependency
order and by the end of it you have
a working system so in my Lenovo bias
there's a module called EC firmware
update DX e dot EFI which is what
actually contains the embedded
controller update code so I I took that
and disassembled it when you look at
that and you can see we're going like
letter layer by layer down if if you're
getting lost don't worry I'll I'll come
back to a bigger picture in a moment so
in this particular bias module what it
does and this is run early in boot what
it does is it looks for an update that
was stashed in to flash memory by the
update program if it finds a new update
then it uploads a little bit of flasher
code to the embedded controller that
goes into the embedded controller Ram
and it starts executing and then once
the embedded control is running this
little bit of code that that has been
uploaded from the bus then the bias
sends the new update image to the
embedded controller bye-bye but now at
this point it's still encrypted so that
that block that I was wondering about is
still encrypted at this point when it's
sent to the embedded controller so if
it's still encrypted then then the
hypothesis is that it must be the
flasher program a little bit of code
that's now running on the embedded
controller there's doing that decryption
before it writes into flash memory
because remember I said it's got to be
decrypted before writing the flash
memory it's not decrypted by the bias so
it's got to be the embedded controllers
during that do let's disassemble the
flasher program now here we hit a bit of
a snag because the flasher program
itself is also encrypted so when the
buyer stands it down to the embedded
controller the embedded controller and
decrypts that runs it and then that code
decrypts the new image that's coming in
so there's a bit of a chicken and egg
problem here where the flasher program
is encrypted as decrypted by the
currently running firmware and the new
firmware is encrypted as decrypted by
the flasher program so how do we get the
decrypted version of the current
firmware well there is an answer and the
answers JTAG the MACC
16:19 has a JTAG interface
for for those who are familiar with JTAG
it's a common interface in in
electronics for accessing low low level
stuff in chips basically it was
originally designed because you have
these big BGA's these days and you want
to be able to access the pins without
having to try and stick multimeter
probes under under and thing like that
but it's also used for flashing and for
debug and stuff like that so this has a
JTAG interface so we can actually read
out the flash memory through JTAG how do
we get access through JTAG well it's
it's actually quite difficult in this
laptop it's it's located I believe under
the what's the quiet keep thinking card
bus but it's like PCI the PCIe whatever
it is the mobile PCI Express slot so in
order to get to it
I have to not only pull the motherboard
out but I have to pull some of the
hardware from that slot off the
motherboard so it's really hard to get
to this interface but thanks to Russian
hackers I didn't actually have to pull
it apart because I found I dumped
someone had done on the internet which
saved me a lot of effort so that's the
192k flash memory dumped out of MHz 1619
and indeed it was decrypted in that
flash memory dump so I pulled this apart
I disassembled it and look at the
encryption decryption function that's
doing the decryption in the firmware
this is a little extract from it
obviously if you're not familiar with
reading assemblies on this may make more
sense than other bits but it's basically
for for loads and and those the results
of those loads are combined together
with add XOR and add now this is
something that looks familiar to me from
staring at various encryption algorithms
and this is Blowfish
so basically Blowfish takes each each
bar
puts us through an sbox and then
combines with X or and XOR okay I'm at X
or ad so and indeed this was Blowfish
so that was one part that puzzle solved
the actual encryption key I found in the
firmware in the firmware it was stored
in the expanded form so if for a lot of
encryption algorithms including Blowfish
what happens is you have your original
key which is something short and then it
gets put through something called a key
schedule which expands it to the actual
S boxes and round keys that are used for
the encryption in the firmware it didn't
store the original key it stored this
expanded form but the expanded form is
sufficient for both encryption and
decryption so I didn't actually need the
original key I was interested as an
academic exercise of knowing whether you
can recover the original encryption key
from the S boxes and I thought this
would be hard in the cryptographic sense
by that I mean maybe not maybe not
brute-force hard but at least krypton
else is hard in fact I was wrong
it happens occasionally there's a user
that commented on my blog that found a
way to reverse the Blowfish key schedule
and it's it's actually it's actually not
computationally difficult you just have
to run Blowfish a number of times and
and this is the this is the original
case it's a 256 bit k printed in hex is
that a random 256 bit string is it an
sha 256 of something maybe it's an sha
256 of gel Sark's i don't know it's it's
hard to determine that but this is the
encryption key let's use for that
firmware and then once I had that
decryption key I could basically
disassemble the rest of the firmware
check for other check sums I found three
check sums in total so there's is an
outer check sum on that image which is
the thing at the end that's checked by
the bias if that fails that's not a big
problem the bias just rejects the update
then there's a post decryption checksum
if you get that wrong it bricks the
embedded controller there's also check
sums on each section of the image and
that's also if you get those wrong it
breaks the embedded controller so this
is where you get a little bit nervous
because if you get any of your check
sums wrong and maybe it is some other
checks something here that I haven't
found yet and the embedded controller
won't boot so anything has crossed those
are the only three so I wrote some
utilities to calculate those check sums
and to encrypt and decrypt firmware
images I did that simple patch of the
jump with the not so that I could
disable the battery validation I wrote
that back into the BIOS update file
rebooted ran the BIOS up data and then
booted my laptop okay and this is the
this is the first message from from the
BIOS update about the BIOS update this
is an update is not necessary at this
time so this is the first issue I ran
into if the BIOS version hasn't changed
it doesn't do anything so I had to
manually run the DOS flash dot exe in
order to do that to apply that update so
indeed it works image flashing done this
is the first stage before it reboots and
their reboots and actually does the EC
update so at this point my my heart was
beating pretty hard I was a few seconds
away from either sitting something cool
or having a brick in my hand so I guess
we'll find out and it comes up with the
same message as it as it did before so
so back it back to the drawing board
so what it turns out so I'd modified
state 12 evaluate battery response but
some of the time
randomly basically so some boots
it was failing at state eight instead
because the laptop would send the right
command and sometimes the battery
wouldn't respond at all so basically to
be on the safe side I just made state
eight always 16 as well so it goes
straight through that state machine
and then let's try it try this
well it says now the battery installed
is not supported by this system and will
not charge so now it's a little bit more
definite I guess that's progress so it
so let's sniff again what's happening on
there Simba what I found is that if the
first authentication sequence passes it
then sends another one why why this is
well my guess would be that at some
point someone's broken the other one
other ones only four bytes in four bytes
out you can probably brute-force all the
combinations store them in a table so
they've added another one where it's 17
bytes in which is probably 16 plus 1 and
25 bytes out which is probably 16 plus 8
plus 1 and so this is obviously more
more complicated perhaps the
cryptographic scheme that they've
implemented here but I went back to my
state machine and I found some more
states so below that state 12 then it
goes and chooses the a challenge
challenge number 4 the second challenge
it's it sends that second challenge then
it does that exactly the same process
for the second for the second challenge
so of course what I did was an help
patch those same states in the second
challenge so I've patched out the first
right not succeeding I've patched the
first validation I've patched the second
right not succeeding I've patched the
second validation and it works by the
way the battery the battery charges and
this is my bias setup screen and I've
put my initials in the embedded
controller version just because I can so
I placed it a write up is it was read by
a few friends and then one of my friends
shared to hacking news and then my
website got slash started my hosting
service had a maximum on the number of
clients so so it fell over pretty
quickly
there's a there's a fun story about this
the this was early in my relationship
with my current girlfriend I think it
was more like my second or third date
and the next day I I met up with her and
and I was like man oh I was up so late
last night I got slashed on it and she's
like slashed on it is that like slashed
and I had to explain no no it's not me
who got hammered it's my it's my web
site that got hammered so anyway she
thought that was pretty cool once I
explained that and and I got about a
million pageviews over the next few
weeks oh that's pretty nice so for
someone who's not Justin Bieber and then
I uploaded my code to github as you do
these days and other people build on my
work to do other modifications to the
embedded controller firmware so Hamish
has a talk next up about what what he
did with his keyboard now my tools don't
work with the latest lenovo laptops
because I haven't looked deeply into it
but it looks like there's now signatures
on the AC firmware there's an open
question here okay this this does
prevent some malicious attacks modifying
AC firmware but you know it's got a
little bit chilling effect on your
ability to tinker with it what what I'd
really like is for all hard way to have
some sort of means to unlock the
bootloader disable secure boot etc so
that as a tinkerer I can get around that
without without you know doing crazy
things in practice of course anything
that you have physical access to can be
broken with sufficient determination so
I reckon if I had sufficient
determination I'd probably get around
that signature scan somehow like like
connecting to it via a JTAG again so
