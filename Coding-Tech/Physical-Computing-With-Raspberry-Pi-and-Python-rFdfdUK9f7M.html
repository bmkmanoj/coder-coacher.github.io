community manager working at the
Raspberry Pi foundation in Cambridge I'm
the creator of GPIO 0 a Python library
for interacting with the GPIO pins and
Raspberry Pi I'm gonna be talking about
in the talk I write a column for open
source comm a community project that
does all sorts of tutorials and articles
and things and so it's it's well worth
checking out there's lots of great
material on there there's my github
handle and Twitter handle on there as
well and you can reach me by email so we
sold over 14 million raspberry pies
around the world now so things are going
really well so I mean I was looking back
at some of the slides I'd made the first
Europe I thought I spoke at and and we
were sort of about three million at that
point and and and that was seeming
really really big and really like we've
made a real big impact in the early days
and it's great to see how how far we've
come and and similarly the actual number
of staff on the foundation team has
grown rapidly over the last couple of
years and there was a slide I had with
you know three or four people that were
you know the foundation at the time and
now we've grown to this great this is
from just a week or so ago we had a an
all staff to get get together and it's
great to see all the great things all
we've been doing we were founded in 2009
we only sort of sort of hiring people
around around 2011 2012 the resin plant
Foundation incorporates three
organizations now the the trading
company that makes and sells the
raspberrypi computers the there are
people who work in the foundation that
are but I've sort of purely on the on
the education side of things but then
there's also code club and coderdojo two
sub organizations that we that we run in
providing opportunities for young people
to get involved in programming learning
about technology learning about
computers and digital making all around
the world the Raspberry Pi trading
operate company operates as a way to
feed their profits into four
our educational programs that's how our
business model works and it's it's doing
really well as you can see and the
result I found a shion's mission is
about putting the power of digital
making into into the hands of people all
over the world so that people are
capable of understanding and shaping an
increasingly digital world able to solve
problems that masses are then both as
makers and entrepreneurs and equipped
for jobs of the future
now that doesn't just mean people
learning to be software developers going
work for Google and Intel and people
people like that but actually preparing
people for a better understanding of
technology whatever field they end up
going in to work in and we do this by
providing low-cost high performance
computers we've run aid education
programs and do a lot of outreach
activities we provide free resources to
it for everybody and provide teacher
training both in person so people can
apply to come on one of our training
courses and and we actually deliver
training online so anybody can join in
we're not limited to the number of
people delivering the training and in
the team take a look at the the current
models of Raspberry Pi again this is
something we've come a long way since my
first year up - talk but the Raspberry
Pi 3 is our sort of main headline
product it's a 64-bit quad-core arm v8
running at 1.2 gigahertz with a gig of
ram and that's our $35 product it was
the main product that we sell has always
been $35 so we've over the years we've
improved the quality and the the power
and spec of that that main headline
device and this is about keeping the
price the same so that's where we've
we've got on the main product a couple
of years ago we introduced the PI 0
which is a five dollar version of the
Raspberry Pi uses the Raspberry Pi one
chip at a at a faster clock speed and so
you've got a gigahertz there rather than
the seven hundred Meg's at the original
PI I ran out half a gig of ram and that
one's I say that one's $5 not as
powerful as the Pi 3 but certainly
really useful in certain major product
products and projects that you can embed
something you want
imbed the pie inside we recently
introduced a $10 variant which has Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth so a lot more scope for
for connectivity in your projects as
well that's where on the product side
and in terms of the software so again in
sort of 2012 and the pie came out we had
we were in a place where we had a sort
of bog-standard Alex Alex D theme looks
really really traditional Linux desktop
and we did a lot of work recently on
improving that and making that skin look
really nice but still be really
performant it's a very very basic sort
of thing there's no 3d acceleration or
anything special going on there it's
it's it's just doing doing what it does
well and providing you with access to
the education tools and and some of the
software and and things in there it's
looking really nice a nice set of icons
and things we we also recently released
this desktop with this operating system
for desktop PCs so we provide an x86
image you can download you can run in
VirtualBox or stick it on a USB stick
and actually run a live live image on a
on a laptop or PC or Mac so you can
actually you can actually boot this up
and get the sort of near enough the same
experience you'd get in terms of
software on on the Raspberry Pi without
the additional hardware and the physical
computing I'm going to be talking about
but actually get access to things like
Python and and other software tools and
other programming tools in this isolated
environment that you can boot from a USB
stick and if you really like it you can
install it as your main operating system
we've talked for a long time about
moving on from idle which is the the
main education focused editor provided
is actually sort of bundled with Python
if you download Python from from the web
further from the Python website so we've
talked about for a long time I'm moving
on from this and finding finding a
replacement finding something more
suitable we've as a intermediate measure
we've introduced a new IDE called fani
which is now installed pre-installed in
raspbian and I'd always still there as
a lot of textbooks and things sort of
point to that but and it's you know it
is it does work to a certain extent so
it's it's still useful but there's an
alternative there it's a Python 3 only
editor there's no options which is
really helpful for for education and
it's got some great debugging tools and
various other features but on longer
term we're investing in developing the
new editor that Nicholas Tolliver has
been working on so we're we're working
with Nick with a list of specifications
from our feedback from teachers and some
of the teachers that we have have on
staff that are feeding into what and a
Python editor should should look like
for education and it's something you
know the kids and teachers will start
with and they made me move on to more
more complicated more complex IDs more
powerful tools but we hope that this is
a great start you can read the back that
about that on Nick's website as well so
going into physical computing so the
main aspect that makes the Raspberry Pi
different from regular computers is that
is the GPIO pins as the general purpose
input output there's a bank of 40 pins
and you can see there's a little port
label there that labels the pins they
all have different different purposes so
physical computing is all about
connecting up flashy lights motors robot
sensors photo video and enabling you to
do get into the internet of things do
home automation and physical projects so
if you take a look at that Bank of GPIO
pins this is what it looks like this is
a little handy guide from website called
pin out X Y Zed which is really useful
reference if you're hacking with a
Raspberry Pi so there are there mostly
three volt pins as to 5 volt pins if you
want to do something with robotics and
motors you want you want and you're
probably on a 5 volt supply that the
GPIO pins are all numbered so you can
individually trigger certain pins by and
by their number to go high or low and
they're variable 3v3
they're 3.3 volts and we also provide
there's also a set of other protocols
you can use
that for high-speed data transfer buses
and things like that that allow you to
do more complicated and than just
turning individual pins high and low you
actually do a lot more by sending dated
of high speeds down the pins using these
different protocols there's various ways
you can sort of access the pins you can
either wire things directly to the pins
or use a breadboard actually make up
your electronic circuits by connecting
things directly to the pins using
jumpers jumper cables so you can do
something like this and people also make
accessories that you actually place on
top of the pins that sit neatly on a bit
like an Arduino shield if you're
familiar with that kind of thing we have
this standard called hat which means
Hardware attached on top and it's for
the 40 pin header and it sits neatly on
the on the PI with mounting holes in the
right place and it's designed to to just
be a sort of a neat neat sort of
standard way of providing add-ons and
there's also you can you expected to
happen any prom on a hat which is a way
of you can program a device to tell the
PI in the tell the device tree what is
attached so that it can do something
according to what what hardware is
attached so if you will if used an any
GPIO in the early days of Raspberry Pi
there's a library called our Pi GPIO in
Python and there's a very low level
library and it was used for three or
four years as the sort of main way that
the canonical way of doing GPIO
programming from everything from
flashing LEDs to robotics and and sort
of IOT homeowner summation stuff that's
quite for Bost lots of boilerplate code
and so one of the things that I worked
on was this GPIO zero library which
abstracts away the the components and
the devices into into these into these
classes that you can easily easily write
code which talks about what you're doing
with the devices rather than what you're
doing with the pins and this makes it a
lot easier so you get something like
this
rather than the sort of sending pin
numbers that you keep passing around
high and low actually talk about what
you're doing to the device the other in
this case the LED and then you even get
into things like this where you have a
threaded blink you know you have a blink
thread sort of running in the background
it just means you can you can hack hack
on more devices much more easily and get
get going with your project
the GPR zero light library supports all
sorts of different devices everything
from sort of basic components buttons
LEDs ultrasonic distance sensors analog
digital converters remote control
sockets and traffic lights and robots
and motors servos and a few different
sort of bespoke hats and add-on boards
that we can provide composite device
classes for so there's a great term this
isn't even the latest version actually
were there the device hierarchy and GPIO
is quite interesting and it's all in the
documentation if you want to take a look
so the one of the great things about the
way that gy0 allows you to get started
is you can start with really simple code
that there's very easy to read and write
and understand so if I was if I wanted
to gather an LED connected up to a
button so that being the button actually
activates the LED and I'm starting with
a child or a teacher for the who's doing
this for the first time I would write
something I would show them to write
something like this it's very simple to
understand procedural code you can
progress on to other paradigms so
looking at event-driven programming you
can you do the exact same set up or you
create new your LED you've created your
button but you you have it fire off
these events based on when these when
these things happen so when the button
is pressed it fires the led to our
method when released LED dot off and
then you can go off and do something
else you're not stuck in a while loop
and you can even progress onto an even
shorter version of code we're using the
declarative paradigm and again all this
just happens in the background in in
threads
setting the source of the LED to the
button the values of the button does the
exact same as both of these other
examples but it's a in a declarative way
you've declared in one line
however the devices should behave
there's some really interesting stuff
you can do with this paradigm so just to
explain how that how that works we've
got a device like a PDM LED is actually
just a regular LED that you configure to
use pulse width modulation to control
the brightness rather than just turning
it on and off and if we inspect LED
value and we we can see that that's zero
so rather than being true or false like
a regular LED would be and a ppm LED has
a zero to one value which is the level
of brightness every run led to on we
actually change that and then we inspect
the value it's now changed to one but
you can also set that to zero which will
which will do the same as running LED
tail off so that's what dot value is and
what you find is that if you have two
components that have the same value set
so like zero to want or a potentiometer
connected to it like a rotary dial
connected to an analog digital converter
chip the mCP 3:08 they both have a value
0 to 1 so things like LED and button
both have true false values you can pass
one into the other so doing this LED dot
value equals plot dot value sets it once
so that the the LED brightness matches
wherever the dial is at that given time
and what you end up doing is writing
wild loops like this to say I want I
always want the LED to be the brightness
of the LED to be controlled by the
potentiometer and so this is where the
source values thing comes in so
everything has a dot value whether it's
an input or an output and then it has a
they also have a dot values plural which
is and a generator it's just a generator
constantly yielding the current value so
every time you ask for it you the next
one you get a the dot value devices that
can have their state set their value set
have a dot source and that's just a way
of saying where do I get my values from
so you can pass in like the most obvious
cases to pass in
values because it just takes any
iterator so in this case a an infinite
generator yielding the value of the
device into the other device and it just
means that they're connected which makes
this which makes this work you can also
process values in between as they come
out from out of one device into the
other so you can provide you can write
your own function to do something in
between we also provide a set of
commonly used tools so things like
negated isn't an easy example so negate
the boolean value as it comes out of the
button pass that into the LED means you
have a reverse logic of when the button
is not pressed the LED is on when the
button is pressed it's off you can also
combine values for instance if you have
two buttons and an LED and you want the
LED to be on if both buttons are pressed
then you take both sets of values and
them essentially using this all values
function and you can do this with any
number of devices and as long as all of
them are true or both of them in skates
are true then the LED LEDs value is true
it's a really neat way of creating a and
an logic gate using GPIO components and
just a few lines of code a couple of
other examples using this the same sort
of paradigm we have have an LED bar
graph class so there's a that's the idea
that you would have several LEDs in a
row and as well as as well as just being
able to we there's a class called LED
board which is just a series any and
obviously series of LEDs LED per bar
graph is one way you can set its value
from zero to one and rather than
arbitrarily and index LEDs you set the
value zero to one and it lights up that
many LEDs up to the maximum so he said
it did not point five half of them will
be up in a in a bar graph sort of sense
and so we have a another class called
CPU temperature so there's a few there's
a few classes in the library that are
what we call internal devices rather
than GP it sort of gpio components but
they have the same properties and they
can connect up to other devices so CPU
temperature you can read the temperature
like it's a temperature sensor actually
get the Celsius value but you also get a
dot value of that which is a zero to one
on the scale that you've provided on the
on the unit so if it's halfway between
50 and 90 for instance then your LED bar
graph will be half lit and you can see
that go up and up and down as you as you
do things on the on the device but as
the CPU temperature is going up and down
and similarly what one called ping
server which just runs a ping and
returns a true or false value of how the
ping went so you create a ping server on
google.com another thing you can do is
set the source delay which means how
often it goes and looks for the next
value if you don't want to be pinging
Google as much as many times as you
would be reading a potentiometer value
or something you just want to do this
once a minute you'd set the source delay
to 60 set the value of the green led to
the to equal the Google values and set
the red to be the opposite of the green
LED so as what as well as doing negated
Google values instead of getting negated
Google the values I'm just negating the
actual LED rather than looking at that
up twice so either the green is on or
the red is on according to whether it
can ping Google successfully it's a
little status monitor there's an ad on
board called energy knee which is a
little remote control socket and the the
ad on board talks to about via radio and
this is at home I have a pet tortoise
and this is another internal device
class at the time of day that you set up
and say this time of day is active
between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. and then you
say that the lamp which is connected to
the energy knee socket should be on
between those times and again you could
use a procedural paradigm for this and
just say while true keep checking or
something like that I use the event
based that when when this time is
activated then run this function but
this is another way of doing it
another thing we do is support multiple
pin libraries so when I said before
about our PI GPIO this was this is what
the one that people were choosing to use
so previously if you wanted a different
if you wanted to use a different library
because it had a specific feature that
you the one that one of the other ones
didn't you would have to rewrite your
code into that library what we do is but
we provide multiple backends you just
elect which pin library you use and you
get the features of that library so I'll
point you guys the default it's sort of
the most commonly used and in some ways
the most stable that's installed by
default in raspbian so that's the one
that's defi default elected to be used
there's a couple of others other GPIO
libraries that we support and we also
provide a native pin implementation
which is kind of experimental but it it
works for basic things but it's fallback
if you haven't got anything else and
there's also a mark interface so which
we use in our test suite but it is quite
handy for being able to just test that
your code is sort of it's sort of valid
and both of these the native and the
mock pin are um are included in the
library you don't need an extra module
like you do with the others so Pi GPIO
is one of the libraries it's implemented
in C and runs as a daemon on the PI it
will it will allow remote socket
connections that control that the GPIO
pins so using the GPIO API in the nice
and the nice code you can write you can
actually control the PI over the network
and actually run this from your PC as G
power 0 could be installed on on any
machine because it can be used in this
way it doesn't have to be a Raspberry Pi
but it will control the GPIO pins of a
PI using the PI Zico demon and so for
instance is one way of doing it is if
you use the PI GPIO Factory to create a
sort of connection to a apply that has
the daemon running and rather than
creating an LED just on a pin number you
you associate it with that with that
device
with that with that pin factory and then
the rest of the code is exactly the same
and alternatively with some code that
would like on the right here that would
be used normally for running a running
that using the pins directly on on the
PI you can actually so yeah with that
exact code that unchanged just with some
environment variable set you can
actually have it
execute the GPIO commands over the
network so you could change that the the
the IP address there before you run it
again and it would execute the same code
unchanged on it on a different device
here's just an example of using mock pin
so I do this quite a lot on my laptop
just to test that some code over it and
some documentation or something is is
accurate and so if you launch the pin
factory mock and then open your your
your Python shell you can import
something from GPIO 0 quite an LED and
here's an example I've just said led to
blink I've had a look at I've inspected
the value and then you know a second or
so later inspected it again and you can
see that it's in the background it's
doing all the things that the devices
should be doing and I so we use this in
our test suite but it is quite handy
just to be able to test your own code
without wiring up components another way
another thing you can do is is you can
drive the input pins so if you create a
device which is using an input pin you
can tell it you know because there's no
way of telling it that the there's no
way of actually pressing a button that
you've created in there's connected to a
mock pin but if you access the pin and
drive it high although you can actually
affect the state of that button so again
this is how we how we test things in the
library but really handy just to be able
to test out so in yeah and then in the
next release of GPR 0 we will we'll come
with this handy pin out command-line
tool as well so one of the things we do
is inspect the device you're on sort of
find out some information about it and
what what sort of pins you have what
hardware you have and allows you to do
certain
will warn you if you can't do something
if you try to access the pin that your
model doesn't have or something like
that and we use use that bank
information to provide this command-line
tool so regardless of what model PI
you're on it will show you the the pin
out for for that particular device and a
little ASCII art diagram of the of the
pie itself you can also request to look
at other other models by looking at
their revision code and seeing what the
pin outs or what the spec of one of the
other devices is one of the other models
and so one of the one of the most
popular hats out there is one that we
make called the sense hat we've made
this especially for an educational
program there are two raspberry PI's on
the international space station with one
of these sensor boards attached and
they're in these great space grade
aluminium cases they went out with
British astronaut Tim Peake for this
Astro Pi mission this was an opportunity
opportunity for children in schools in
the UK and later all around Europe to
write code in Python which would be run
on the space station the board has a
bunch of sensors so you can look at the
temperature pressure humidity and
pressure accelerometer gyroscope
magnetometer and there's an LED matrix
that you can program and there's a
little joystick that you can that you
can use to as input as well so it's a
really great board for all sorts of
different purposes so it just goes on
the on the PI I really like that it's
always talking about hats earlier so
just a couple of examples so you can
right scroll text across these the the
LEDs you can scroll text across it all
show show letters or show information on
there or just arbitrarily access the the
pixels individually and make your own
patterns and icons you can easily get
again access to the the sensor data just
just by reading the properties on that
on the object and you can do stuff like
this where you show you show a value of
one of the sensors in in in terms of
which LEDs are lit so have a kind of a
bar graph if you like of LEDs according
to something like the temperature or the
humidity and so the the Astro PI program
will be in its third year this year and
we will be on our third astronaut that's
run the program so Tim Peake from the UK
- Marcus gay from France and then
there'll be another European astronaut
running the program in the next term so
this is a competition that anybody any
kids from schools in Europe can enter
and there's various different levels of
what they can do they don't have to do
anything too complicated but anything
from tiny little scripts which interact
with the astronauts or show them
messages or read the sensors and tell
them something or a game that they can
play or something you're they can
interact with we've had some really
interesting entrance and some of them
are doing some really cool sort of
science science experiments and actually
logging the data and then running the
experiments again at home to compare the
results and actually learning about
thinking about space we actually have
two emulators for this this is one of
the things we did to try and engage more
people and into the program actually
without having to buy Raspberry Pi
without any means by sense hats or even
if a classroom only has one or two that
they can the real hardware they can use
the rest of the class can participate in
this so on the website trinket die which
is which is really great on its own for
uhm doing Python stuff in the browser
there's actually a special mode of it
that if you import the sends out module
you it brings up a an emulation of what
the sense hat looks like and you can
program the LEDs using exactly the same
API or using their Python in the browser
you can also use the sliders so this is
a really good way of just testing your
code as well that if you write some code
that says when the temperature gets over
you know eighty degrees this should
happen there's no way of easily sort of
getting your PI to read over eighty
degrees so in order to just test it you
can do something like this
there's also a desktop emulator that
comes in raspbian but you can
install this on your PC as well and run
it offline again you can access the the
joystick and the sensors and control the
LEDs really good way of testing your
code out and and having a go at doing
something like a science experiment
without having access to the hardware so
you can enter the competition with just
having used this freely available
software although the trinket web
service the PI camera is one of the the
other really interesting things about
the PI so the PI as a CSI port for
connecting up a camera module because
the PI originally came from a mobile
phone chip and he had access to two
cameras for the front and back facing
camera and so using one of the sort of
camera modules you would you would get
in a mobile phone you can actually
access the camera run do photo and video
in 1080p full-hd photography but
actually use use your programming to
control when pictures are taken or
change the configuration and settings in
real time according to sensor data and
things like that there's a basic
command-line interface that that you can
use and a brilliant Python library that
has really nice API for for controlling
the camera as an example just some
Python code that would capture an image
and record video and if you want to hook
it up with some GPIO components say wait
for a button button to be pressed before
taking your picture again just very
straightforward and should be feel very
familiar if you've if you used any sort
of a neat Python api's before and
there's there's a lot of interesting
stuff in the library that you can access
that the apply camera gives you that
that are really interesting to play with
so there's a whole list of image effects
that it that it allows to you to use so
you can kind of do interesting stuff
like this use all these different image
effects and
you can also and stream over the web
quite easily so one of the recipes in
the plac camera documentation shows you
how to do this and there's a sort of
more complex version in this github
project that's um there's really
interesting way of being able to to
stream your your camera footage over the
web this is again this is the second
project that I have on the PI that's
connected to my tortoise table and
there's a lot of people doing really
interesting stuff with my camera and
OpenCV so this this blog pie image
search comm as full of tutorials and
just set up guides and and things on how
how to do you know facial recognition
and and an object recognition and
actually you know learn about that kind
of that kind of area using that using
the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV using PI
camera so do you take a look at the
documentation for some of those projects
the gr0 Doc's won't read the docs and
eBooks sense hat library and since emu
is the desktop emulator and then PI
camera as well and read the docs they
all have really good documentation so we
we have a magazine called the magpie and
you may be familiar and we once gave
away the the PI zero came sort of on the
on the front cover of the magazine it
was the first time a computer magazine
that I've worked given away a free
computer with with the magazine and we
do some really interesting stuff with
the magazine as well as just it's out
every month and you know there's
projects and articles and and interviews
and things hundred pages every month and
it's really great but we do some of
interesting things like the giveaway
with the PI zero and one of the things
we did recently with we teamed up with
Google and they put together a they made
a hat called of the core the voice hat
and you've got this cardboard foldable
container that you put the Raspberry Pi
the hat and a speaker inside and it has
a big button on the top and you
essentially make your own you know sort
of Google home assistant so you can
speak into this and have it process your
thing use the Google assistant to
you you know to give you an answer the
same way you would ask ask your phone or
ask your what are these devices at home
ask it a question I'll ask it for to use
something some web service or something
but you can also write write Python code
which processes the the commands the
voice commands and you can you can use
custom commands to do stuff which could
include say GPIO still for camera stuff
so turn the lights on or make the robot
go forward take a picture that kind of
thing so some really interesting
projects people have been doing that
with that recently and you can check out
the stuff on our blog and in the Magpies
blog and and some follow up articles in
the magpie as well and on the aiy
projects website that sounds so that
stands for AI yourself artificial
intelligence yourself there's really
great project that Google did and so one
of the things I just want to mention
briefly is the there's a little so I
project they've been working on I gave a
lightning talk on it yesterday you can
check out my slides online is that based
around the problem that pie pie doesn't
support uploading arm wheels so when you
actually to Python wheels if you if
you're not familiar the way of providing
pre-built binaries for your for your
Python packages and you can upload
pre-built versions to pi PI but the they
if they're if they're written in C then
they have to be when they're built
they're compiled they're compiled for
the architecture that they were they
were built on and so you have to provide
one for each architect type of Akshay so
you want to support Windows 32 windows
64 Mac Linux 32 64 and so on and arm is
a completely different different
platform so so even though you can
actually build wheels for arm that run
on the ARM architecture yourself you
can't distribute them easily using pi pi
so what i've done is written some
software which automates building of all
these of all the packages on pi pi and
provides them in a
in a repository that you can install
from so yeah to check out the more
details in my in my speaker deck or come
speak to me about it if that sounds
interesting to you there's lots of
different ways you can get involved in
all the stuff I've been talking about so
one of the great things is you know if
you have ratted pies at home or if you
if you choose to buy them you know
anything you do that anything you do
with it I mean making projects or just
learning stuff yourself or getting into
you know the electronic side and the
physical computing side is really you
know it's really great and we love to
see more people learning in you know
things that they wouldn't otherwise be
learning and actually doing some really
interesting stuff you can you can also
contribute to some of these libraries
that I've been talking about it'd be
great to have some more eyes over casts
or more eyes over some of the some of
these projects and help help other
people upgrade their modules to Python 3
that's a real problem for us sometimes
in the education world when we're trying
to use Python 3 and we end up getting
stuck and having to go back to Python 2
for a specific module that hasn't been
ported there's been some really
interesting open source projects in
Python libraries forum for Raspberry Pi
things like PI Canberra so yeah anything
like that that you're interested in
making or you know we can end up using
in our educational resources because
that's where the inspiring projects come
from so yeah do take a look at the
source code for some of these libraries
and if you want to take a look at
contributing that would be they'll be
really great as I say I mentioned the
magpie so this is a magazine you can you
can buy in the shops but you can also
download for free it's one of the things
we do try and try to get our stuff the
stuff that we do that the educational
programs the hardware and the software
as many people as possible that's why we
write the emulators it's right why we
provide the x86 image of our distro we
provide pre free PDFs of the magpie as
well and we do a series of books that we
also sell and we encourage people to try
and pay for them if they if they're if
they're able to and because it helps
fund out our educational programs
same way the Raspberry Pi sales help but
you can also download them for free so
they're freely available if you want to
run workshops you want to go and do
something like this in the community
there and this kind of thing is is
really great a great resource as well as
the resources on our website so one of
the things I'm involved is in a lot
lately as the the network of raspberry
jams so these are free community events
that anyone's allowed to set up so
they're completely independent from the
foundation we just promote and support
them and there's a lot of
family-friendly events so they're not
necessarily kind of tech user groups
like maybe you have Python user groups
at home the some of them are which is
which is great as well but a lot of them
are sort of focused around not just our
kids learning but it for anyone to get
access to having a go and learning some
programming skills and learning about
technology through digital making and
there's a guidebook available then I put
together and that helps people start
their own their own raspberry jams and
you can contact me about setting one up
as well and get some support from from
us so do you take a look at the
raspberry jam and page on the website
which has a map of where all the jams
take place around the world so have a
look if there's one near you if there or
if there has been one near you and maybe
you could go along to it or if you have
kids take them along to it and and learn
with them and actually work together
there's some really interesting stuff
that you see a lot of families doing
together at these events and Daniel will
be pleased to see a few a few of those
in Africa as well so code clubbers as I
say is one of our projects so this is a
really easy way of getting some
volunteering that there has a really big
impact on local children so if you have
kids in school you can go along to their
school and say I'd like to run a code
Club those projects provided so you
don't have to come up with your own you
don't have to write your own materials
you can use some materials that have
been created by by educators of the
foundation there's training support
provided and if you just want to try and
do your bit to try and help
help kids learn that you know they do
their foot write their first lines of
code and do some really interesting
projects then this is a great way to get
involved and there's information on the
code club world website about are the
different edge initiatives in different
countries around the world
we also provide a means for you to
contribute translations so we can
actually reach more people with our
materials as well there's something you
again you get involved with and that's
all thank you very much
all right thank you very much for talk
Annie can we have a few minutes for
questions so any questions
do you know off the top of your head of
any specific projects that need help
voting to Python 3 or there was one that
was my go to one that's just just being
ported which is really good news
I I contact oft of my head oh we're
getting better aren't we so it's that's
good
it should perhaps make a sort of Hall of
Shame type thing for where as specifics
but okay do you know of some industrial
projects including the Raspberry Pi or
would you recommend to do that
yeah so we we sort of selres requires
into three three main markets the
industrial market with people using them
in automation and factories and things
like that into the hobbyist community
people making projects at home sort of
thing you'd see at Maker Faire and an
into education so three very distinct
and very but very interesting
communities in industry you see so we
actually use raspberry pies in the
raspberry pie factory to test raspberry
pies so as they come off the production
line there's a there's a pie that just
does a basic electronic test to make
sure it's come out right I do we know
actually do the very same thing so they
have a raspberry pie at the end of the
production line and they test they do
some electronic tests on the edge we
know to do the same thing and we see all
the people doing doing similar things
with with their own products you see a
lot of people actually building a
product around or out of the raspberry
pie either the single board computer
that you would buy thirty five dollar
one or the industrial computing module
that we provide which is a Raspberry Pi
chip on a in a sort of embeddable form
factor that you can build your own IO
board and you know if you if you're
building a smart TV or something you
want it you know you want a well
supported sort of Linux platform in the
TV then you you know you can build a
baseboard and have as many HDMI ports or
whatever else it is that you want and
put them in exactly where you want them
those are your products around it and
then by the compute module and just slot
that in and and you've got sort of all
of the hardware support for Raspberry Pi
for free so there's lots of people doing
things like that so one that comes to
mind is big company called NEC who make
big stadium TV displays they're actually
shipping like you know 70 80 90 100 inch
TVs with the compute module embedded
inside them and one of the things about
that is that they they could you can
design a board like that for
today's Raspberry Pi and sort of the
whatever whatever the model is at the
time and any future upgrades of
Raspberry Pi when the compute module
becomes available you can start shipping
those ones instead without having to
change anything it's just it's actually
a sodium like Ram connector so that the
device the module just slots in to a
baseboard that supports that to the
well-supported and hardware component
there's lots of lots of things like that
yeah get rid of time for one more quick
question
extending to last question what about
real-time programming with a Raspberry
Pi I guess with Linux and especially was
Pisan you don't you are not able to
fulfill our time requirements so is
there any that you know is typically
used or with other plans no so there's
there's definitely a ways that you can
use your as you PI in a project where
you you need the real time you need real
time stuff so a good way of doing that
is pairing it up with something like an
Arduino so if you if you sort of want to
be able to write your programs in Python
or something like that as something
high-level or maybe they talk to some
internet some web services or do
something like that that you couldn't
necessarily easily do with with an
Arduino on its own but actually write
all that logic and all that programming
in on the Raspberry Pi but then send off
the bits that you need
do you know doing real-time to the
Arduino or any you know magnet
microcontroller so that's something you
see a lot of people do is they they say
I did all this this and this in the
Raspberry Pi but the certain search you
know the things like neopixel grids or
something where you need precise timing
and if you've got like loads of other
programs running you know you there's a
chance that it the timer will go off or
something or is ship it off to an
Arduino tell about what to do and let
that do that that they're sort of heavy
lifting on on that part of the the
project but actually still controlled by
all this stuff and written in high-level
languages like Python on that on the PI
there's one option a lot of people
prototype with with stuff like this as
well and then you know perhaps though
they'll do a proof of concept using a PI
but then the real product will use
something else so there's a few
different options yeah okay thank you
very much for the talk
