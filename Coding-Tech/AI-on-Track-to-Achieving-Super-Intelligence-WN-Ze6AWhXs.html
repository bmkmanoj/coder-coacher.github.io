could spell the end of the human race
what humans develop artificial
intelligence should we be fearful of
artificial intelligence and the pace at
which is progressing or should we fear
fear itself from the risk of its
stifling innovation it will not be man
or machine our purpose is to augment and
really be in service according to a
recent report published by researchers
from the universities of Cambridge and
Oxford open AI and the Electronic
Frontier Foundation there's an
assortment of ways AI could go wrong and
in the not so distant future focusing on
what could happen in the next say five
to ten years the paper draws attention
to what may seem like more prosaic
concerns then for instance a global
takeover by humanoid robots with super
intelligence but whether advances in AI
lead to a rise in malicious BOTS
or the weaponizing of consumer drones
just two of the risks listed in the
report we can't help but fear what we
don't understand
so to begin the experts weigh-in is
artificial intelligence actually
intelligent and carefully
I run salivation ventures it's a
high-tech venture capital firm in China
my name is Fei Fei Li I'm a professor
and director of the Stanford artificial
intelligence lab I'm also currently at
Google on my sabbatical from Stanford I
am Jennifer drew Scott Cohen
principle of radium partner and radium
blotch adventure a lot of people ask
about AI and whether is intelligence
I think today's AI based on the current
state of the arts are the fuel
intelligence is really more of an
optimizer it's not intelligent in the
same sense that we think of humans as
intelligent we acquire knowledge we
abstract we create there's emotion
involved and there is judgment involved
and there is a creativity involved frost
only knowledge common sense and ability
to argue the ability to understand humor
and also self-awareness and compassion
today's machine intelligence is far from
that level of complexity it's probably
not most useful if we generalize ai ai
is an umbrella term from machine
learning to deep learning - NOP which in
natural language processing -
reinforcement learning there are many
different technologies coming to this
umbrella and right now we're on the
stage where AI is very good at doing one
single task well concentrated a task and
repeated attacks are really really well
the consensus among these experts is
that AI is far from reaching human
general intelligence currently AI is a
collection of techniques which cleverly
uses maths to create the appearance of
intelligence that along with the
appearance of emotional intelligence
shows that we need to build an ethical
compass into these systems or at the
least developers have to use one in
order to avoid unanticipated outcomes
but wherever this may be heading the
march of progress shows few signs of
slowing down and who's at the forefront
of these advances kai Fuli names the
Internet giants holding the largest
amounts of user-generated data companies
such as Google Facebook Amazon and
Microsoft as well as Baidu Tencent and
Alibaba it's important to note that of
these seven companies for our American
and three Chinese an ear even split
revealing just how fiercely competitive
the field of AI has become over the
summer the Chinese government pledged to
become the world's primary AI Innovation
Center by 2030 though the u.s. still
leads in terms of private investment
experts suggest that several key factors
may enable China to push ahead I think
you know it's quite interesting to see
the do awfully between US and China
China is very interesting it's a it's my
home country and I I see you with lots
of energy where things are in China if
we look at the top hundred people in AI
US probably has eighty a UK and Canada
probably have fifteen China might have
two on the other hand China has four
things going for it number one is that
China has a huge very strong engineering
education and the mass of people with
fantastic engineering training who are
ready able willing to jump into AI its
economy is very entrepreneurial right
now so there's there's an embracement of
new technology and new ideas and that is
a very fertile playground for new
technology the third reason is the vast
amount of data theta is the fuel for AI
and China has more data than anybody
else three times more data because of
three times more mobile users compared
to the United States it's actually 10
times more data in terms of ordering
takeout
times more data in terms of mobile
payments the fourth would be that
there's a lot of support both top-down
and bottom-up in the Society for AI
technology and education the government
will put billions of dollars not at the
country level but at the first city
level to help subsidize AI companies a
land takeoff and also bring back
overseas talent I think the two
countries no doubt have become AI
superpower but there are two very
different beasts in u.s. we have
companies like Boston Dynamics you know
deep mine now is effectively American
company and you have four companies like
you know Hanson robotics etc and what
they're producing is very inspiring it's
very futuristic some might argue it's a
slightly scary especially with Boston
Dynamics you know if we see the robotics
can do all this at the same time most of
the people including myself we haven't
really seen their products being used by
everyone and the difference in China is
the engineers and developers in China
are very practical if what they're
developing cannot be commercialized in
the next year or two they would not
develop it and then you in the u.s. you
see very advanced research being very
well funded and that's probably gonna be
playing a dominant role in the next 10
15 30 years
one such American endeavor showing
promise is being led by Rita Singh and
her team of researchers at Carnegie
Mellon they're building AI powered
technology that analyzes the human voice
why because our voices carry a lot of
valuable information
indeed so much information that Singh
can construct a three-dimensional image
of a person's face by studying the voice
alone
your voice carries a lot of information
about you an enormous amount of
information everything about your
physical stature your facial structure
ethnicity what's going on in your body
your state of health state of mental
health physical health your income
levels it captures everything that
influences your body and mind and is
evident in your surroundings this
information is embedded at very very
fine levels micro levels and the speech
signal this technology says Singh could
have many applications in medicine and
is already being employed by law
enforcement to help identify criminals
not only would it likely reshape the
future but also perhaps the past I was
curious to know what made Hitler so
powerful was it because he said the
right things he was at the right place
at the right time I think the
speculation is that might have been
something in his voice and so I picked
up Hitler's voice and the first thing I
discovered that there were signs of
Parkinson's he would hold his fists
clenched like this that was to hide a
small tremor that he had developed and
from that kind of evidence people have
speculated that he might have had
Parkinson's I think 100% from his voice
I've seen it in his voice
it's clear how does the AI behind voice
profiling fit into the big picture with
it's incredible power and potential for
misuse this technology reveals the
urgency and establishing best practices
across the field as the use of AI in
criminal justice is just one of the ways
in which injustice has been recognized
from the use of biased datasets but
returning to the original question of
whether or not AI is on track towards
achieving super intelligence that
remains to be seen it is a such a young
field it's only about 60 years old from
ground zero to where we are today from
that point of view we have come a long
way I think it's better to think about
artificial intelligence as a single
domain up
miser and that in itself has huge
implications but it is not human
all-encompassing intelligence which we
call artificial general intelligence
there's various disagreement and debate
on whether artificial general
intelligence is ever possible and how
long we'll take I'm personally a
pessimist on achieving that level of
intelligence but I am an optimist on
even today single domain narrow
intelligence creating huge societal
impacts artificial intelligence is about
learning and making the right decisions
using what you've learned we're at a
point where we have the understanding
now to do this and therefore we are in
the new AI era</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
