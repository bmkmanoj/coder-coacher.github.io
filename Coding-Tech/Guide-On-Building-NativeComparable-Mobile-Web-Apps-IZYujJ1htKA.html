days and if your company doesn't do hack
days you should absolutely give them a
try
they're freaking awesome we love them at
tumblr they drive innovation and you can
basically build whatever you like you
have 24 hours build anything one year
somebody built a interactive mirror
nothing to do at tumblr but it was cool
and it worked yes so you have 24 hours
you can build anything
we have prizes and raffles and games at
tumblr we love them so this is me my
first hack day all bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed just started a tumblr and I
thought okay what am I going to do tom
has an API we have a website we have
apps that are powered off the API we
have a different website that's not
powered off the API there's a completely
different code path so why don't I try
building tumblr as a single page app so
I decided to have a go with ember j/s
I'd had that tiny little bit of
experience with it before and figured
well it's says on the website it's a
framework for ambitious Web Apps tumblr
is a web app so why not give it a go and
this is me 24 hours in burning in copied
and pasted HTML and CSS directly into
this brand flashy new application and it
turns out that just copying and pasting
your HTML from your current app into a
new one it's a bad idea don't do that
but luckily tumblr has a facility for us
to be able to take hack days beyond a
single 24-hour period we call them labs
so labs allow us a half a day a week to
work on a side project outside of our
daily roles at tumblr and it's
encouraged to bootstrap projects that
are outside of the you know regular
product roadmap so I decided let's start
a single page app lab and they started
in October 2015 so half a day a week not
very long
started October 2015 and I'm gonna
preface this by saying everything that
you're about to see is still a lab it's
still a complete prototype but it's
proving a point so this is the ragtag
bunch of bunch of guys that started this
project with me they are sitting
somewhere over there fellow tumblers and
we decided the best thing that we should
do is to see if we could build a
super comparable mobile web app and what
exactly is required in order to be able
to do so so the key point here is making
sure that the application that we
produce is as close to a native
application experience as possible and
you shouldn't leave your web users
behind yes provide them with a native
app if you so wish to but don't neglect
your web experience just for the sake of
it so we decided we wanted to make a
first-class web experience so this was
October 2015 there were really two major
candidates at the time we had ember we
had react and we printed them
head-to-head against one another we
decided these are the two major
frameworks they're going to be able to
solve this this problem for us and we
decided to build a simple prototype in
both the basic idea of the prototype was
to fetch data from the API and render a
list of posts nothing fancy just like
title ID that was it and what would we
need to go through in order to get to
that stage like from step one
nothing like NPM install to that point
what do we have to go through can
anybody name these two characters by the
way yes and yes excellent now I don't
have anybody noticed but tumblr has this
really weird obsession with Guy Fieri
and you'll notice he's he's right there
can't get away so we started we started
down this road and this is where I
started we jump in headfirst into the
world of single page apps and this means
everything from understanding embers
build system to understanding how to do
the same thing in react we wanted to
build a similar prototype in both so it
kind of felt a little bit like mr. krabs
here with the fast pace of JavaScript
it's it's kind of overwhelming there's a
lot of things to learn but we decided
let's do it
feet-first jump straight in we noticed
that with ember we were able to get up
and running and be productive from day
one react was a little more difficult if
anybody here has tried to configure web
pack to build react pre react create app
which is a godsend but it didn't exist
in October 2015 and this literally took
us days to get just to the point at
which you could do like
the new and have a full setup build
environment tests and everything so it
was difficult and because of that we
also looked into the backing data stores
that were available for react and at the
time Redux was still in fairly early of
the stages of adoption was kinda
difficult to get started with and M
before us just worked out of the box it
was simple ember knew off we go and in
the first day we had our list of posts
being rendered straight away so
eventually we ended up here we're aboard
the Nebuchadnezzar with immense power
beneath our feet we knew we knew where
we were going we knew what we wanted to
do and we knew that ember was the the
tool to do that for us
ember also has one major major advantage
over react and I cannot stress this
stress this enough and that the add-ons
add-ons provide so much extra for the
reactor yuko system that the reactor
unfortunately doesn't have right now NPM
is not a replacement for add-ons it
allows you to add into your application
through build pipelines through
providing if they're essentially full
applications as an add-on so add-ons
really really allow you to turbocharge
your ember application yeah right
Portland's cool by the way I've got
another cool slide later but so creating
a comparator native comparable mobile
web apps like what is actually involved
in that like what things do you actually
have to do if you want to be able to
something to build something that is as
good as a native app well first off you
have offline support and that was
touched on earlier for a native
experience you need to have the app boot
immediately it needs to load off the
device you cannot be waiting for
round-trip times to your data center to
go and fetch your HTML assets and so on
and so you really should have the app
being bootable off the device no HTTP
requests offline is absolutely paramount
animations users have become accustomed
to smooth 60 frames per second
animations and they provide this sort of
skeuomorphic experience to the user
where you've got like bounces and easing
and so on that that feels good when you
use them and I remember when like iOS 7
was released and and they added all the
gesture support and animation
and all that kind of stuff on it it it
made all the apps feel good the web not
so good there are some solutions to
these but out of the box it it has the
tools but there's no no out of the box
SDKs they're going to make it nice and
buttery smooth for you more children
reusable this is something that native
apps kind of kind of get out of the box
you have a UI kit in iOS or you're able
to build reusable views that you can
drop in anywhere throughout your
applications so if you render a post in
a in a list of posts in one screen that
you use that same view somewhere else in
your application and it looks the same
users like they expect consistency
throughout your application and for it
being modular and reusable within the
application itself so we're talking
about like components and things here
that's really really important push
notifications
we finally got support for this a few
years ago but prior to that it was like
you should outta luck I'm afraid push
notifications were something only the
the native apps Hat we can do this now
and users are expecting this they expect
to be able to have push notifications
popovers are a really really interesting
thing popovers provide in band context
information to your application so if
anybody here has ever used an iPad which
I'm sure everybody has you'll notice
that on the iPad you can tap on a button
and you can see a popover in line
because you have a much more screen real
estate well on a on a mobile device you
don't have that screen real estate
you're transitioning to another page the
difference with web is that you're
really not limited to the screen size
the user could start out small and then
it could get big so popover has actually
become really really challenging touch
and gestures another really big thing
that was introduced with that like iOS 7
and that everybody has become used to
now is that you can swipe to go back and
you can do native scrolling and touch
and gesture support is something that
the native frameworks provide and they
provide pretty good SDKs for them the
web again slightly more difficult it's
all possible but none of this is easy
and the last thing is home screen apps
users expect to be able to have your
icon for your app on your home screen I
mean why wouldn't they
they want to be able to quickly access
your app and you want users to be able
to quickly access your app and use it as
if it were a native app it's interesting
because studies show that users don't
know or care the difference between a
native and a web app realistically what
is the difference from the users point
of view they're clicking an icon on
their home screen and up pops your app
whether they get that through a web URL
whether they get that through an app
store it doesn't make any difference and
fake news I made that up but the
sentiment is true it really doesn't
matter where your application comes from
users expect the same level of
functionality from a web app versus a
native app but they honestly don't know
or care the difference if I ask my mom
for example and sorry mom I'm gonna
throw you under a bus a little bit here
to describe the difference between an
ever web app and a native app should say
that well the web app I get to you
through a web browser and the native app
I install through an app store where I
click on a button on my home screen but
why do users even care well I'm pretty
sure if they have to download an 80 Meg
just to get back to the same place that
they were on your web site and they're
doing that over a 3G connection I'm
pretty sure they care so why are these
things important well users become to
expect a certain level of polish in your
application and right now web apps don't
really live up to that same expectation
so how can we address that well I'm
going to show you some of the things
that we have used throughout our journey
with ember so add-ons as I mentioned
earlier add-ons really do provide you
this extra level of flexibility with
your application to be able to use
pre-existing made components and
utilities and helpers to be able to make
your application perform perform better
so these the add-ons that we used with
our within our application we've got
everything here from animation support
to concurrency we've got a little prick
autoprefixer so you don't have to keep
using your browser prefixes and all
automatically do those things for you
and these are all community add-ons
these are things that others have made
that have made our lives easier
we haven't had to spend the time
reinventing that wheel so the first one
is offline support and we're gonna go
back to school for there we do some
maths so the speed of light three times
10 to the 8 meters a second the speed of
light in glass is 2/3 of the speed of
light in a vacuum so you've got a what's
that two hundred thousand two hundred
million meters per second the distance
from the u.s. to Australia is roughly
fifteen thousand kilometers so speed
equals distance over time if you take
yourself back to your physics classes
therefore time equals distance over
speed so if you're in Australia the
round the single trip from the Australia
to the US 75 milliseconds and obviously
it's round-trip 150 milliseconds you've
got a hundred and 50 milliseconds of
nothing and that's working on the
best-case scenario that all of the
routers and switches between Australia
and America are instantly fast which
they're not verizon actually publishes
statistics on this and they published
152 milliseconds so I think my math is
right
so offline support this was touched on
earlier super super important we're
using appcache in here because app cache
has better support across browsers it's
not as clever as serviceworker you
really need to do a sort of two-pronged
approach there but you can see here that
the app is been put into offline mode
and it still works you can you can
navigate between different pages
obviously things like authentication do
not work you have to hit your server for
that and this is what it looks like
you've got a manifest here you basically
just list these are all the files hey
browser go store all these offline and
the browser will tell you when that's
happened and you can then decide what
you want to do when that's happened you
could present the user with a
notification saying hey how about you
add this app to your home screen now
that you've downloaded all the assets so
app cache great support Service Worker
no great support it will it will happen
it'll be amazing
it'll be great animations animations are
a huge part of your application so we're
using a an add-on here called ember
liquid fire and what liquid fire
provides us is a literal drop-in
replacement for your standard outlet tag
and it provides you animations
out-of-the-box you almost you have to do
almost nothing to actually support it
it's incredible and as you can see here
we're logging in when you click login
we'll get a nice little slide animation
hey that looks like a native app cool so
this is what it looks like you swap out
your needs the laser yeah you swap out
your regular outlet with a liquid outlet
and you right here configure a
transition and we're saying from the
index route to the login ramp you want
to use a crossfade and we want to use
that in the reverse so if the user
clicks forward or back in their browser
they get the reverse for those of you on
this side we're gonna do a transition
from the login route to the dashboard
and we're gonna use the two left's like
the iOS style UI navigation controller
transition next up authentication
anybody here who has an application that
has users has to deal with
authentication so how do we do that
well we used in a application or an
add-on called ever simple or cool Emma
simple auth it provides you with
scaffolding to handle your applications
authentication and session management it
provides the basic hooks to be able to
authenticate with the API it provides
the ability to automatically attach
outgoing headers so you can attach like
a bearer token for your OAuth 2 header
you can automatically sign out about
going requests for things like basic
auth and so on and it also provides
session management such that if the user
logs out in one tab they're logged out
on all tabs now this isn't something
that native apps have to deal with like
if you log out in a native app you're
logged out in a web app the user can
have as many tabs open as they want and
you want them to be logged out on every
single tab being logged in in one when
you've logged out on another that would
be bad imagine if you were at a web cafe
and you'd forgotten to close one of the
tabs after you've logged out and now
someone has access to all your data web
components so off the back of glimmer
we've had this promise of web components
for some time and web components is a
w3c spec that's still in the process of
being finalized I believe and as yet we
don't have access to them but we can get
very very close so we used an add-on
called
component CSS and this is a fantastic
add-on Eric green is somewhere in the
audience here shout out to him thank you
so much this has made our lives a
million times better when it comes to
dealing with CSS anybody here who's had
to write CSS will know they've
accidentally styled an element that they
didn't intend on styling because CSS is
cascading style sheet and it cascades
down through your browser so
accidentally targeting something else in
the browser I'm sorry that's a feature
not a bug just what it looks like so you
have your styles.css in your component
and the add-on will automatically take
that styles take those styles and also
generate a class name and it prefixes
all your Styles with that class mate it
also adds a class name to your component
HTML that's output in the browser and
you'll notice that the class name here
matches the class name in the Dom now
what this means is it's literally
impossible to leak a style outside of a
component and this is awesome for that
modularity that I was talking about
earlier the ability to be able to reuse
components throughout your application
and no guaranteed wherever you put this
it's not going to be affected by anyone
elses CSS of course you can still affect
child components which is why we use the
descendant selector oh yeah you'll
notice that we're using the descendant
selector here so that in the CSS that's
generated we are we know we're targeting
the specific elements that are in our
component itself and not accidentally
leaking anything's further down to any
components that are used within our
component and this is what it looks like
so it looks pretty much like that you
can see you just you can see that I
don't know you should probably have got
the idea from the previous slide but you
can see there that the component name
that's generated there is the same as
the component name that's generating
that alert some dialogues so users are
accustomed to your application providing
alerts and dialogues either natively or
been the app within the application
itself so we usually ember add-on called
ember CLI flash and this is what it
looks like you can see error
thing did not work we also color the
header bar here up here the tool bar
with ember computer property that just
changes the style there you'll notice
that when this will disappear that goes
green pretty cool and you can have
sticky messages which is pretty awesome
so you can stay up there till the user
dismisses it user dismissed it we also
extended this add-on to add dialogue
support so where you can automatically
add dialogue messages of course to your
application this is in line with our
like standard branding on native app to
do this our web app does this as well
and it provides a pretty simple way of
providing flash messages to the user so
we use this add-on embassy life flash
shout-out to Orin tan wherever she is
great work on this this has really saved
us a lot of time with providing a
centralized way of managing flash
messages so if I guess very quickly you
inject your service the flash message
service
you grab the service and you push a
message on to it so this is like a
notice and this can be anywhere in your
application let's say for example you
have some like offline notification
message we then built a component which
outputs the flash messages that are on
the queue and the flash message system
itself handles auto expiry of the
messages cleaning them up making them
disappear and so on really really
awesome it just worked out of the box
well we had to do a stylet just pretty
cool concurrency there's a talk on this
I think tomorrow by Alex concurrency is
a fun thing if you've ever done a
callback with an ember component you
will know you get into problems if that
component is removed from the Dom so
ember concurrency helps with that to be
here we've got a like button and you can
see I'm clicking the like button and you
can see on the right-hand side here the
Status Messages that I just hacked in
there and you can notice that every now
and then we've got a bunch of grouped up
messages here so every time to click
click this we're outputting a console
log and then from the action that's
triggered we're also doing a console
mode and you'll notice that although you
can't see it I'm clicking this button
furiously right now and outputting here
we've got multiple stacked messages
because it's not doing anything the
actual main action itself that's doing
the HTTP
first only one of them is happening per
full run of this button so that timeout
for that animation to happen and then
disappear we only allow one action to
actually happen loss that's running let
me show you what that looks like so this
might be a blues enough to see we import
tasks and we import timeout from ember
concurrency and we define a property on
our component and what this does is we
call the task function and we provide a
JavaScript generator from here I'm just
calling the action data down actions up
this is good so our action is going to
be cooled on this like button and
that'll be handled further up the stack
and then we're yielding a timeout here
so what this does is this yield and this
timeout is actually yielding a promise
and the task system in ember concurrency
is expecting to receive a promised
return from it and it will pause that it
will pause this function whilst that
promise is running so timeout is just a
really simple wrapper around set timeout
that returns a promise
and notice we've got this dropped
keyword on the end here there are
various different ways to configure this
and we can forget it in the drop method
basically what this does is every time
this action is tried to be fired if
there's one already running it'll just
drop the existing ones you can do other
things like stack them up you can cancel
existing ones and so on but this is the
functionality that we wanted and then
from our click Handler we just cool
perform on the task itself they're super
simple and it means we don't end up in
this callback hell nested nested
callbacks or chained then statements it
makes our code very very declarative and
very easy to follow along so next up
popovers
as I mentioned popovers are really
really difficult with responsive
applications you have no way of knowing
realistically whether or not you should
be transitioning to a new route and
sharing a different screen or whether
you should be showing the context
information as a popover so we actually
built an in repo add-on to handle this
for us and this is what it looks like so
you've got our account menu up here you
click on that we show a popover and we
have logic in the pop over to make sure
it stays on the screen and doesn't
overflow the edges and so on and if you
change the size of the viewport and you
go down to mobile size this now actually
does a route transition instead of doing
a popover
and it turns out this is actually a lot
more complicated than it needs to be
doing this in a nice reusable way has
meant a little bit of hacking but we're
using mostly public API is to do it so
it actually works really really well and
I don't really have a code example of
this but if anybody wants to see it
please come and give me a shout
afterwards and you basically invoke this
in the same way that you do a link to we
created a link to popover helper and
that basically wraps around the popover
functionality and it automatically pulls
your model from your router so all you
have to do is define what is the route
what is the component that I want to
render within the popover itself and
that's it it hooks up everything else
for you it'll grab your model it'll
inject it into the component as if by
magic API actions so who here has used
an API that is not a standard rest JSON
API I'm expecting to see every single
person's hand up in here
I call these restless api's it's all
well and groovy if you have the perfect
dress full JSON API and ember data is
like cool bro I got your back if you
don't it's not so easy so our
application has some restless endpoints
namely like that like action you saw
earlier is sending an HTTP request to
user slash like and you can see it
happening here and use a slash unlike
and Emma dater doesn't handle this very
well at all in fact it doesn't even
cover this in any way you are on your
own
however ember data handles like getting
the URLs to send HTTP requests to there
is some like crossover there but it just
doesn't handle the the non restful
semantics so we build an add-on to
handle this for us we call it Emma Day
to add on Emma Day to actions is
currently in repo I'm hoping to open
source it but this is what it looks like
and it's super super simple so oh so
here I haven't imported it up here so
you can't see that but basically you
call action so you define a property on
your model cool action pass it the
that you want to run and you pass it the
property that you want to toggle or
change when the action has returned true
same in the inverse unlike a Mike and
we're going to change the light back to
false then in your adapter you define a
set of actions and here I'm just
defining the like action and I'm gonna
say when this action is fired hit up
user slash like and you're gonna take
the modal Keys ID and reblog key
these are tumbler specific things and
those will automatically go in the post
body you can configure whether it's a
post recursive put request delete
request whatever you like and those
things automatically get added into the
body then in your component the API is
super super simple
grab the post cool like seems simple
right this is really really difficult
with ember data out of the box so we
built an add-on for it and we did it as
an in repo add-on in reap add-ons are
super cool you should give them a try
this is what this Intex look like to
generate one you call ember G in raper
add-on and you call can't give it a name
and then when you want to generate
something within that component you want
to say create a an add-on sorry create a
component in that out on you just add
the - - in repo add-on and give the name
of the add-on that you're generating the
component into and ember will
automatically generate you a structure
that looks something like this this is
our Emma data add-ons very very simple
we've got our mixin for our adapter and
we've got a utility that we use in the
model that action callback that I showed
you really simple way of prototyping out
something that you think maybe I might
want to make the source this in the
future last thing is living style guides
now living your style guide has been
really really useful for us and we're
using a an add-on called ember freestyle
and as you can see here this kind of
looks like what you saw earlier we've
got a lot of different add-ons it shows
you the invocation I love it you see
right there and this is actually
rendering what is in here so you
basically wrap this in a like special
semantics for this add-on and it will
render that add-on in that block and it
will show you the invocation at the
bottom here
this is really useful for both
developers and ferd designers because it
allows them to separate those concerns
designers can decide well actually you
know what I don't want to see
all the code I don't care about that
they can tell with that one on/off
developer can look at this and it
basically provides you a certain level
of like an API documentation for your
components you can see right here list
out all the different permutations or
the component that you might have and
bam you can happily manage change
management make sure things don't break
and as you can see looks looks pretty
pretty snazzy so we still have plenty
more to do and one thing that I really
want to get across here is the use of
add-ons allows you to do one great thing
it allows you to stop reinventing the
wheel unless of course you're in the
business of wheel making then don't go
ahead and read about the wheel build an
add-on use an add-on at the very least
if you have a concern in your
application it probably applies to
someone else as well so consider making
an add-on start off as an it as an in
repo add-on and move on from there so
things are not perfect right now in the
MBA ecosystem Amba data is awesome if
your API is a perfect restful JSON API
Rockley Jess it's super powerful the
documentation isn't great ember works
out of the box but sometimes you don't
want the whole box and mobile
performance for us in this application
is absolutely paramount for 2016-2017
and I know it's something that isn't the
like the forefront of Tom's mind right
now making sure that ember really is a
first-class citizen when it comes to
performance so the question is how do we
get from here
to here well I was just trolling around
on Twitter and I found this guy and he
said this as a tech community we must
treat documentation marketing logistics
infrastructure art etc work as with as
much respect as engineering and this
couldn't be any more true we have a
responsibility as consumers of this
application to give back now that
doesn't mean you have to develop an
add-on it could be that it's it took you
weeks to understand what serializers are
and what adapters are in Amba dator and
then finally you read a blog post
something you're like oh my god I get it
submit a pull request to the guides repo
because it's not that clear another
thing when you're looking at this is
very interesting and I probably should
have done this really prior to this
because I'm in my own dogfood
returning something from a model hook
when you look at how that stuff works an
ember it's just assumed that you're
using ember data maybe you're not it
doesn't actually say on the first model
the guides for the model hook that you
can just return a promise or if it is
there it's very very buried and these
are the kind of things that stop other
developers from being able to get
involved in the end or ecosystem because
some people want to persist and really
dig into the internals and find out how
stuff works and some people don't for
those that don't that's totally okay no
one's expecting you to do so but if you
know the answer just submit a pull
request make things better another big
thing we need to be doing is we need to
break up the monolith and I was really
unsure about this slide because it's
kind of weird and it creeps me out
but for those of you that haven't read
it there's an RFC it's up here it's
number 176 and you can get to it github
slash mas RFC's about breaking up the
ember monolith application glimmer is
going a huge way to accomplishing this
there's a whole bunch of other things
within an ember itself that if you don't
need all of the box don't ship all over
the box and that's imperative not just
from a shipping the bytes down the wire
but from the bigger the payloads the
longer it takes the larger the payload
the more JavaScript there is to pass and
evaluate and the slower your boot up
time is going to
it also means that we can really start
competing in the framework Wars as not
shipping a monolith
I think people nowadays and the
JavaScript community are used to being
able to receive small packages so that's
what we want to be able to do so what
did we learn well it turns out making
web apps it's hard but making native
comparable web apps is even harder there
are so many things that you have to take
account of these days we don't have the
luxury of native applications where they
come with these lovely API s and SDKs
like iOS that comes with UI kiss and all
the animation libraries and we don't
have that we have the Dom if we're lucky
maybe somebody is abstracted into a
library that we can use this is where
add-ons come in we are providing
abstractions on top of this to make
these api's accessible and consumable by
other developers like yourself you can't
simply just get by with jQuery anymore
these are some of the concerns that you
have to deal with if you're building a
mobile web application that you want to
be as good as native there's a lot of
things here and I've covered some of
them but there's a whole bunch of other
things even outside of this slide as
well that you have to be aware of like
security is a huge thing so things like
sub resource integrity go check that out
it's supported a number out-of-the-box
things like cross site scripting you
want to have 60 frames a second
animations you want to make sure that
you have code splitting which we
hopefully will do sometime in the future
you want to have a deployment strategy
you need a build environment you want to
be a potentially have like offline data
and use it like indexeddb you want to
have async bundles so you can submit
your application down into smaller
pieces and only ship the user what they
need so many things that you have to
deal with don't try and reinvent the
wheel so I'm gonna leave you with a few
things here number one stand on the
shoulders of giants you can do it by
using a framework like ember you don't
need to reinvent the wheel you can use
the collective knowledge of the
community and we can all benefit
together we can do great things if we
work together build add-ons as the the
core team said earlier as Tom Anahata
said you who'd have said they're going
to be focusing
on lower level primitives which will
really allow add-on developers to
bootstrap and build out functionality on
top of ember for the entire community
going forwards so let's say check out
ember add-ons comm great resource for
the latest and greatest add-ons that are
on the market and I want to take this
opportunity to give a shout out to Tom
and Yehuda and the entire Ember team and
the core teams for building an
incredible framework that we've been
able to build our applications on top of
so I think at this point I'm just gonna
give everybody a round of applause for
the other four teams
so thank you this is me if you want to
hit me up please do so if anybody wants
to have a look at the application that
we've built
I'm more than happy to demo it and I'll
leave you with one tragic final thought
thanks very much enjoy your break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
