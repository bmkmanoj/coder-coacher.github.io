progressive web apps if you haven't
don't worry about it because the tech
press isn't going to let you get away
from it for long they're already writing
articles about how Google is I'm sorry
Google is plotting and others are
plotting the revenge of the web app and
since I'm here to talk about progressive
web apps that means that I'm part of
some sort of secret cabal out for
revenge so you better watch out later at
the party they're also writing about how
progressive web apps promis'd up in
native mobile applications we will no
longer need native applications
everything will be the web as it was
originally intended thank you very much
or you know which is in stark contrast
to where we were just a little bit ago
we're wired was writing about how the
web was dead well they've updated it and
the web is no longer dead in fact it's
been saved and Google saved it and you
know how they saved it well yes that's
right progressive Web Apps see anytime
there's an opportunity for the media to
sort of pit two groups to get against
each other you know Republicans versus
Democrats native app developers versus
web developers they'll do it and they've
been doing it since the iPhone came out
they loved this idea of having you know
a cage match between web and native and
I I am I'm just I'm so bloody frustrated
with this like I'm tired of this
conversation since 2008 and to see it
sort of peaking again with progressive
web apps is incredibly frustrating
because I'm I mean I'm really bullish
about progressive web apps so take a
moment take a deep breath reset a little
bit see we're really early when it comes
to progressive web apps we're probably
about here on Gartner's hype cycle we've
got a long ways to go before we hit that
sort of peak of inflated expectations
and we need to tamp down the
expectations just a little bit because
if everybody thinks that we're gonna
replace native applications which is
never going to happen that trough of
disillusionment isn't going to look like
sort of a nice fun smooth rollercoaster
that it is on the graph it's just going
to be a cliff that we're gonna fall off
of so I'm gonna cut through the hype and
talk about really why organisations
should be looking at progressive Web
Apps and then
if you start building a progressive web
app the sorts of challenges you might
face from a UX perspective as you decide
what portions of your site or you know
how to make your site into a progressive
web app so first what is a progressive
web app progressive web app is a term
coined by Francis Berryman and Alex
Russell to describe a set of technology
that was previously only available on
native applications there's a long list
of them in their original post I'm just
going to point out a couple of them that
I think are the most important you have
applications that are nearly
instantaneous in terms of their loading
behavior they're available offline
you've got the ability to do push
notifications you have the sort of
prompt to add an icon to the home screen
and companies that are building
progressive web apps are doing some
really interesting stuff with them
Flipkart is like the first sort of big
example and I think the most like it's
particularly interesting because they
abandoned mobile web they didn't feel
like their mobile web experience was
sufficient so they decided to try to
route everybody to to dusta or to native
applications and they're very large
e-commerce company in India this did not
turn out so well for them so they
returned to the web with a progressive
web app and as you can see it's a very
fluid experience it feels great it's
very fast and it actually works offline
as well so the great thing about
progressive web apps is that they are
sort of best practices for the web and
because they're best practices for the
web browsers are providing browser
makers are providing incentives to try
to encourage us to adopt progressive web
app technology some of the incentives
are available right now for example if
you're on Android devices and you browse
to a progressive web app it'll ask if
you want to add it to your home screen
and if you add it to the home screen
then you get an icon now this add add to
homescreen behavior is going to change
over time and this is something that I'm
excited about browsers hope that they'll
be able to monitor how people interact
with progressive web apps and develop
heuristics that will do a better job of
knowing when somebody actually is going
to want to add it to their home screen
so instead of what happens right now
which is we hit webpages and over and
over again people were like at home or
like install our app install her app
install our have instead browsers may be
able to say hey this person has visited
the site multiple times there actually
look like they're engaged with it and
now we're gonna add to homescreen we're
gonna ask if they want to add to
homescreen
now right now the heuristic is
incredibly simple but over time that
promises maybe to increase install rates
another thing that Google just announced
recently is that progressive web apps
are getting an integrated more deeply
inside Android so they're now going to
show up in the trays are gonna show up
in settings and system information
progressive web apps are going to
gradually start becoming more like
first-class citizens
in addition there are things that I
suspect will be coming very soon as
incentives that browser makers are
providing for progressive web apps for
example app stores Microsoft has already
talked about the fact that they're
interested in how they may be able to do
progressive web apps inside the
Microsoft Store they they already have
HTML applications inside the store so
it's not a stretch to say the PWA s
would make sense there Google has said
that they're they're deprecating they're
Chrome App Store in favor of PWA is we
don't know what form that'll take but
that's on its way as well Alex Russell
when he was writing about ways that
people might discover progressive web
apps said that you know he theorized
that we might see a situation where
being highlighted progressive web apps
put them higher in search results like
badged them did other things because
they're fast and they're installable and
they're you know very much the best of
the web he also added the caveat though
that Alex doesn't work for for Microsoft
so he doesn't know what Bing might do it
does work for Google though and they've
got a pretty big search engine so we
might have some insights into the sorts
of things that Google's looking at but
even if they don't do any of these
things progressive web app simply makes
sense irrespective of what browsers
provided as incentives irrespective of
what people do with their native
applications and I'm gonna explain why I
think this makes sense in six simple
statements that I think even a native
app developer would agree with
so the first is that not every customer
or potential customer will install your
native application you might be thinking
well yeah duh of course but sometimes we
have to restate the obvious when I found
in talking to organizations that already
have native applications when they hear
about progressive web apps are like why
would we need to do that and in
particular the native application
developers are like you know stop trying
to make the web into native like native
does it better that web shouldn't be
apps and these sorts of things and I
have to remind them well not all of your
customers are installing your native
application because of that if you
provided a better experience for those
web customers you would probably in
convert you would increase conversion
you would increase revenue plus there
are some problems with app stores right
and progressive web apps might provide
sort of some some some ways to fill in
the gaps in these cracks around app
stores there are over two million apps
in the iOS and Android app stores so
showing up and and just being an app
store it's not sufficient we know that
the average user in the United States
doesn't download any apps in the average
month that's an impediment we also know
that a ploy 'l t is really low that as
people interact with their applications
after 90 days it's less than 10% of
people continue to daily use there
continued to be daily active users of a
particular application that they've
downloaded so the cost of acquisition on
in the app stores has gotten really
really high so it would be great if we
had other strategies in case we don't
succeed in native apps like keep doing
native apps but they're gonna people who
fall through the cracks and for them
like there might be actually a lot of
people mobile web audience there's
almost three times as large and growing
twice as fast as app audiences all right
the second thing you should provide a
secure website or app for your customers
if you're doing any sort of e-commerce
this just completely makes sense right
we got to keep those guys out and maybe
those guys and we should probably
encrypt all the things and the reality
is is that the new features related to
browsers right the ability to
I use HTTP to even old features like
geolocation now only work on on secure
sites progressive web apps require a
secure site that's one of the
requirements third thing you should
provide a fast experience for your users
we know through a ton of case studies
that faster sites being more revenue
higher conversions and progressive web
apps are one of the best ways to provide
a fast experience what the Washington
Post found was that even their mobile
site which had been optimized quite a
bit was still substantially faster once
they did a progressive web app it's less
than a second load time that's nearly
instantaneous people don't notice the
differences or they don't they don't
perceive it as taking time if it's less
than a second all of this is done
because of a technology called service
workers service workers allow us as web
developers to specify specifically the
things that we should cache offline and
when the browser should go out to the
network to get new versions of those and
when they should grab them from the
cache it gives us much more control of
that um and that is in essence what a
native application is right like it's a
bunch of things that are stored offline
so that when you watch that app all the
application has to do is go download new
stuff
well service workers allow us to do that
on the web the fourth thing you might
want to do is provide an offline
experience right it might benefit your
users and here's the fun thing the
service workers are also the key to
providing an offline experience so if
you've already done the stuff to use
service workers to provide a faster
experience actually going and providing
an offline experience isn't much
different you might benefit your
customers might benefit from providing
push notifications if your eBay right
and somebody comes to an auction from a
social link or something like that like
wouldn't it be nice if you could say hey
do you want to receive a push
notification five minutes before this
auction ends right in order to receive a
notification now that person would have
to go to the App Store find your app
install your app go find that auction
item again and then sign up for
notifications and give permission for
that notification but that's a high
barrier for somebody who doesn't already
have that app installed and
from a web perspective we could now ask
them if they want to receive that
notification they get prompt for
permissions and now they get the
notification
all right the sixth thing this is really
simple can you do a text file and make
some icons because that's all that's
left is a manifest file manifest file is
simply a JSON document that describes
where icons are located what the start
URL is what you want your backgrounds to
look like things like that so the thing
that I really like about progressive web
apps is that every step on the path to
progressive web app makes sense on its
own right each one of those six items is
something that makes logical sense and
will provide a better user experience
and early returns on progressive web
apps are incredibly promising
I'm conga for example saw incredible
increases in their performance it's
actually faster than what they were
having from their native application
extra electronics has seen a 12%
increase in click-through rate 100% more
sales from users arriving via web push
4x increase in engagement five miles has
a 50% decrease of bounce rates 30%
better conversion for people who arrived
via add to homescreen there are a bunch
of these case studies showing how
progressive web apps provide a better a
better experience for people and
increased conversion for organizations
now what often times happens is people
will say well that's great but iOS
doesn't support progressive web apps so
we can't do progressive web apps now and
I think that that's a bit misleading
like it depends a bit on what your
definition of support is so the fact
that it's a progressive web app means
that it's using a progressive
enhancement progressive web apps work
fine on iOS they don't have all the same
features that they do on Android but
they still are functional they still
continue to be applications that you can
interact with the browsers that do
support progressive web apps or have
indicated that they're going to support
progressive web apps represent billions
of users in the world
we shouldn't prevent them from having
these features just because iOS doesn't
provide them yet and the Safari team has
hinted at the fact that they're looking
at service workers it's
under consideration and in the roadmap
they talk about how they just like they
were working on the fetch API that they
just released as a precursor for being
able to work on service workers and
service workers are like the most
important piece so we may get some of
the benefits on iOS soon but even if we
don't businesses are finding that when
they convert things to progressive web
apps that they're actually seeing
benefits on iOS
even though iOS doesn't have all the
features so all they express 104 percent
increase in conversion for new users
across all their browsers 84% increase
in iOS conversion the Washington Post
saw a 5x increase in user engagement and
I asked the Product Manager like is that
different between iOS and Android and he
said they're minimal differences so I
did a bunch of research into progressive
web apps to try to figure out why I
think that they're they're operating why
the Washington Post was seeing this
return and I think that it has simply to
do with performance when the Washington
Post spent a lot of time working on
their progressive web app and trying to
make sure that the progressive web app
was as fast as possible it meant that it
was faster even on devices that don't
support service workers I think in many
ways that progressive web apps are kind
of like a Trojan horse for performance
right you get people really excited
about the icon on the home screen and
then you pull up lighthouse which is
this tool that that tests your progress
web app to see how fast it is and how
well it works offline and things like
that and you're like well our score is
really bad like we need to increase that
so now we're gonna work on performance
so there are some benefits from using
progressive web apps as as a tool to get
organizations looking at performance so
progressive web app simply makes sense
and I think they make sense for a lot of
organizations irrespective of what they
do on native applications but the fact
that they simply make sense does it mean
that they're simple to design and build
in particular I'm um enamored with some
questions that I think have been around
since the early days of the iPhone then
we've been able to avoid up until now
but as we work on progressive web apps
we're actually
going to have to face these questions
again so back in the early days after
the iPhone came out a lot of websites
look like iOS are actually iPhone OS UI
right this is wptouch it's a very
popular theme for WordPress it was
designed to look like an iPhone
application many websites were doing
that this is what wptouch looks like now
it's definitely borrowing some
conventions from iOS and some
conventions from Android and probably
some from Windows but it's unique right
it doesn't necessarily feel like any one
of those platforms I think over the last
decade we've developed our own design
language when it comes to the web when
it comes to responsive designs but when
we start looking at progressive web apps
there are a lot of people who are
starting to wonder like how much we need
to make those apps feel like native
applications owen campbell moore who
works for google wrote this really
actually it's an exceptional document
talking about designing great UIs for
progressive web so i highly recommend it
in the midst of it he says some things
that that i was a little surprised by
right for like forgetting every that
when it comes to designing progressive
web apps you forget everything you know
about conventional web design like what
really is that where we're at but he
goes on to make i think a really good
point which is that native applications
give users a certain expectation about
what those interactions will look like
and if you have an icon on the home
screen that's very near very near other
icons you may not the user may not
expect that icon to work differently
than the native applications that
they've been using these questions I
think are questions that we were looking
at sort of in the early days of the
iPhone for example what makes something
an app and perhaps more importantly how
do users expectations change when they
consider something to be an app now
these are pretty abstract questions but
I think that they are the sort of
it's at the heart of many of the
discussions that are going on right now
so I want to look at sort of four
related questions and then look at some
things that I think we can already
assume about what makes user experiences
in progressive web apps work well so
first how much should your design match
the platform Owen and his article made
this recommendation about how you might
want to make your progressive web app
use the system fonts so that they feel
like an iOS application or they feel
more like an Android application but it
makes me wonder right like how many
platforms are we going to adapt to is it
also gonna feel like Windows and Fire OS
and BlackBerry OS and what about desktop
browsers all right like we don't feel
like when we're designing something for
a desktop browser that it has to feel
like a Mac all right we designed
something that feels right to the brand
that we're designing for so in this
particular case I think that the best
way to go about this is to define our
own design and be consistent
this is TripCase it's a it's a Cordova
application and it's just as a
disclosure we've worked on it a little
bit I'm a big fan of the application
even if we hadn't worked on it it is the
same UI consistent from iOS and Android
and it fits in it doesn't feel foreign
on either because it feels mobile ish it
doesn't feel I Oh s ish or Android ish
another question we need to grapple with
is what is the impact of going
chromeless and what does that have on
our user experiences so in our manifest
files we can declare whether we're going
to have our progressive web app work
with the display mode of browser a
display mode of minimal UI which as far
as I can tell none of the browser's
support currently display mode of
standalone or a display mode of full
screen so the browser chrome right which
is the address bar the tabs the the
navigation bar at the bottom as we move
and get rid of those things like we
start losing stuff so in standalone mode
we've got the status bar and we've got
the navigation bar but we no longer have
the address bar we've
URLs we've lost the menu we've lost tabs
move further let me go to fullscreen we
no longer have those things and we also
no longer have a back button what has
previously been described as the second
most frequently used feature of a
browser next to clicking on links so I
should also note just to be clear for
those of you who are not Android users
it is possible to pull down and reload a
progressive web app that's in
full-screen mode or to swipe up from the
bottom and get transparent navigation
bar so you don't get locked into that
full-screen progressive web app with no
way to get out but there there are some
features there that are that are hidden
I think we've been spoiled by browsers
we don't realize how much we've been
spoiled and as we start working on
progressive web apps we're gonna realize
that that's the case there are a lot of
things that the browser provides for us
that we don't have to worry about right
like what's going on in terms of the
system overall the status bar the URL
for the site the ability to just copy
the URL the navigation bar in the back
button I'm even under the menu there are
things that we don't tend to think about
right info on this page is it secure is
it not secure what does the certificate
look like the ability to download to
refresh getting into tabs finding text
on the page um and under the Share
Option not only do you have sharing but
you also have printing and email I
suppose I can tell once you go to like a
full screen or a standalone progressive
web app people can't print those web
pages anymore so it really is a bit of
roughing it out there once we start
going outside of the browser Chrome
we're gonna have to fend for ourselves
in a lot of ways um even simple stuff
like adding a back button is oftentimes
harder than we perceive it to be so
adding a back button into a progressive
web app means managing the browser
history using the history API so that we
can tell what page somebody should go to
or what screen somebody should go to
previously it also oftentimes implies an
app hierarchy which isn't the case
necessarily on the web right so in this
example I went from a category of men's
outerwear clothing to looking at a bunch
of different options and then selecting
one and diving down to a particular
detail that's very different than say
like getting a link directly to a web
page via social or via email something
like that right this same page from this
example site where does that button go
to if I came directly to this site and
how does that button compared to what
the back button which looks very similar
mine to like it's just the same arrow
they actually go to different places one
goes up in that app hierarchy which
because I've come into this app three
levels down and have never seen the app
hierarchy I have no idea that that's
what's going to happen and the back
button would have gone back to my search
or social or wherever I was previously
like should there even be an app back
button in this context I don't know this
is the sort of thing we're gonna have to
figure out as we start designing not
just for a multitude of screens but a
multitude of contexts right like is a
browser Chrome there is it not there
fortunately there is a new media query
for display mode and when am i testing
any of the browsers that support
progressive web apps also support
display mode so you can use this display
mode to say am I in standalone mode am i
in full screen mode
maybe I don't show that button maybe
that button doesn't make sense in that
context maybe there are other changes
that I need to make if I'm in that mode
maybe I need to add things we need to
remember that not every customer or
potential customer will have our
progressive web apps added to the home
screen right like in the same way we
have to remember that not everybody has
our native apps installed like we have
to remember that people will be
accessing our sites in a browser context
we have to make sure that it makes sense
in both of those contexts I am
optimistic that the heuristics that
browsers are looking at will allow them
to to have more people install
applications but maybe we're just all
tired of installing apps
and doesn't matter what we do all right
and we won't see people adding icons to
their home screen that's a possibility
too the great thing though about
progressive Web Apps is even if they
don't add it to their home screen they
will still install your progressive web
app because even if they're viewing your
website in a browser all of that
functionality is still there right you
can still do the push notifications you
can still have offline behavior you can
still have a very fast experience you
don't have to have the icon on the home
screen for that to be to be available to
people all right because we don't have
the URL we don't have the address bar we
also need to worry about sharing in
social media it's no longer possible to
just like select on the sort of share
icon and then inside a phone os just
select Twitter and like instantly do
that sharing so of course that might
cause you to think well maybe we need to
get back to NASCAR right where we're
adding all of the social media buttons
back in on sites but before you do that
we might want to think about the fact
that a recent study found that only two
out of a thousand mobile users actually
tap on share buttons so if we write like
yay progressive web apps boo
we're losing the way that people find
out about our content you know to be
honest I'm not sure that we have a
really good solution for this yet I
think we need to be incredibly careful
if you have a business where a major
function of how you get garner revenue
is related to sharing you may find that
it doesn't make sense to do display mode
fullscreen or display mode standalone
that you'd rather have people inside the
browser still so that they had access to
the native controls for being able to
share content so that they continue to
have access to the URL bore bar even
though doing that means that that Add to
Home screen prompt won't show up but I
think that that would make sense in a
situation where that is really like the
core of your business if that's not the
case then we need to implement those
features very very carefully and
instrument them so that we can tell the
difference between how much stuff is
getting shared in sort of
the experience inside the browser versus
the ones that are fullscreen or or
standalone there's also a new API that
Google has been experimenting with
called the web share API which would
allow us to create through JavaScript
ways to actually get to the native
sharing panes so you could click a
button and it would actually go to the
native sharing um this is really
promising I do think though that we're
gonna have some challenges in conveying
to users that if they actually click on
that or tap on that particular button so
they're not going to be taken to the
sort of poor excuses for sharing that
we've done on the web in the past all
right another question should we app
shell or not app shell for those who
aren't familiar app shell is a way of
sort of defining it's defined some
content right the shell of a web page
and with service workers you make sure
that that stuff is stored offline and
can be loaded as quickly as possible by
doing so then you you affect the
perceived performance of the progressive
web app so by having the app shell
stored offline that first paint is
incredibly fast and then you can get the
content via Ajax and I think that out
shell was actually probably one of the
main reasons why the Washington Post
website feels so fast as a progressive
web app so in this video where I've I've
actually throttled down to 4G you'll
notice that actually both pages take
around the same time to load they're
actually not much different but the one
on the right is actually feels much
faster and one of the reasons why I
think it feels faster is that the
navigation bar or the menu bar never
goes away so I'm going to start the
video it's pretty quick but you can see
like the one on the right they both
actually the full load bar at the top
goes at about the same pace but the one
on the right feels much faster and I
think it's because it's using that app
shell model there are concerns about app
shell Jeremy Keith has written about the
fact that he feels like that the success
criterion for progressive web apps has
changed from what is best for the web to
how
feel like a native application and in
particular this idea that it's it's
being used this idea of app shells being
used as a get-out-of-jail-free card for
doing things sort of poorly for the web
for not using progressive enhancement
because they're using an app shell or
spa and this is I think problematic
right just because we're building a
progressive web app it should be
progressive it should still work in a
browser like Opera Mini Jake Archibald
with the chrome team has made the point
that we need to do a better job to
change the perception that progressive
web apps must be a single page app
client rendered application so app shell
is an option but it's not a must our
site is a progressive web app we're not
using an app show we talked about it we
may do it eventually but our sites
really really fast and we didn't feel
like we would get enough bang for the
development time to do it right now
there's a great article on site point
that came out recently that talks about
how to retrofit your website into a
progressive web app so check that out if
you're interested in doing that
all right the fourth question what part
of your site should be made into a
progressive web app Facebook on desktop
is a single application we move to
mobile of course we've got the Facebook
application but we've also got messenger
and events and pages and and groups and
and moments and and a bunch of things
that I don't even know what they are I'm
right like there are all these separate
applications so as you make the
transition from a website a particularly
complex website into a progressive web
app does it make sense for that whole
monolithic site to become your
progressive web app or do you start
pulling off pieces of it it's certainly
much easier if your site is simple like
browser sync is and that site itself can
become the progressive web app but there
are other organizations where I think
that it would make sense for example
Yahoo's native applications actually map
really well to their subdomains and
their separate products so sports tahu
calm and Finance at yahoo.com like those
are their native applications and from a
progressive web app perspective it would
make a lot of sense for those different
subdomains to actually be the apps and
also I think
bubbly Maps well to their teams I've
also been enamored with this idea of
tearaway apps because we've had a couple
of projects or potential customers where
I thought it might make sense so nest
has a really complex site it's got a
bunch of things it's got product
information support information things
of that nature but if you log in what
you get is you get a responsive
application that allows you to modify
the temperature of your thermostat or
monitor your other nest products this
interface actually is incredibly similar
to what their native application looks
like and I like this idea that that in
building a progressive web app that we
might not need to make the whole site
the progressive web app that maybe I
just want to tear off a bit of
functionality and take it with me on my
phone because it's really important for
me to have the ability to interact with
the thermostat availeth available with
me all the time and I can always go to
the nest site for the rest of the
information so these are for sort of
detailed questions about what we might
face as we start looking at building
progressive web apps and I think that at
the heart of them it really these are
really questions about what makes
something an app and most importantly
what our users expectations and how do
they change when they consider something
to be an app and that last one is
something we don't know yet
we're going to learn as people start
interacting with progressive web apps
I'm often mistake that people won't
assume that a progressive web app has to
be a hundred percent like a native
application because they visited a web
site in the past before they installed
it on their home screen they know what
it was like they know that it was web
irrespective regardless of what happens
with that great progressive web apps
we'll get some details right they'll
figure out what caching and offline
strategy makes sense for them so for
example a simple cache and performance
extreme it--be like what we see on
English accent maps where you go and you
see these videos the videos are pretty
funny I'll show you just a little bit of
this
the site is pretty funny like you can
get all these different accents both in
the US and in the UK if you go offline
though and you try to look at the
British versus American accents you'll
get a page that says sorry you're
offline and this is like a perfectly
adequate and makes sense experience for
this particular application they can't
do offline versions of Google Maps or at
least I doubt that they can with the
licensing and they can't do offline
versions of YouTube videos so they say
hey you're offline and they actually do
a little bit more they provide the
ability for somebody to favorite a video
if they wanted to to come back to that
accent a different strategy we used on
smashing we worked with Smashing
Magazine to make their site have a
serviceworker and progressive web app
and for them they wanted to make sure
that they cashed a series of pages and
then cache the most recently viewed
articles we did the same thing on our
own site
we felt like we didn't know what people
were going to want to have access to so
if you go offline on our site we show
you a notification bar that says you're
off site but you can continue to view
pages that you've previously viewed we
just let you know so that you know that
you can't comment on articles or things
of that nature and if you go to a page
that you haven't visited before and
isn't in the cache we let you know that
you're offline we could also let people
choose what to cache this is a demo that
Jake Archibald did of Wikipedia and
built for mobile where somebody can go
to these web pages and they can declare
what they want to have access to offline
and it sort of adds them to a cache of
things that they could read offline that
then they can delete things from or add
things to and then there are cases where
it may make sense to cache the entire
application ahead of time so this
another demo site that Jake built
pokedex it downloads all of the
different images related to the poker
index a pokemons index and make sure
that it's available to you offline this
is probably the one that we need to be
the most careful with because we need to
make sure that we don't suddenly have
somebody visit our site and behind the
scenes we're down leaning downloading
megabits of information right that would
be a pretty poor experience it's not
what people expect if you're a publisher
and you're doing things with amp you
should look at them amp to PWA install
path so if you're not familiar with amp
amp is accelerated mobile project it's
the things that show up in search
results and top stories they've got a
little icon that says amp it's got the
lightning bolt and they load incredibly
quickly they use a different variation
or some they really limit what you can
do on this web pages there's some
controversy about it but for people who
are doing amp there is something really
nice about the fact that there's now a
amp element that you can use to install
a serviceworker the Washington Post
wanted to do this so that what happens
is in search results somebody sees an
amp page they go to the amp page while
they're reading that article behind the
scenes the progressive web app is
installed and then if the person
proceeds onto the Washington Post
website they get that less than second
load times so if you're doing things in
amp it makes a lot of sense to make sure
that you've optimized for this path and
then finally in terms of the details we
need to get right we can't screw up push
notifications don't immediately ask for
permission when somebody visits your
site YouTube was doing this like a week
or two ago and thankfully they stopped
doing it but like it's it's like you
walked into a room and you meet somebody
for the first time and you're like hi
I'm Jason will you marry me
alright like I'm not ready for that
long-term relationship right I just
arrived at this site it doesn't make
sense and we need to keep in mind that
just because push notifications are new
on the web doesn't mean that they
haven't been around for a while users
are actually a bit annoyed by push
notifications um we need to make sure
that we use push notifications
responsibly showing that we use push
notifications responsibly is one of the
ways we can convince Apple
to implement push notifications on our
site when we implemented them we decided
that you know push notifications aren't
that big a deal like they shouldn't be
up in the banner we were like hey you
know subscribe
instead you read an article you get to
the end maybe you like it then we've got
a button you have to click the button or
tap the button in order to get the
prompt to ask you for permission we send
you a note that says thank you for
subscribing and then you can turn off
notifications from that exact same
interface that last a little bit that
last a little bit is a key detail that
you need to make sure you do if you
implement push notifications because
browsers are implementing kill switches
and if the user goes in and and uses
that kill switch inside their browser to
make sure that they no longer receive
notifications from your site you will
never be able to send that user
notifications again right so you need to
make sure you provide a way for people
to manage notifications inside your site
Owen who I mentioned earlier wrote a
great document that describes best
practices for UX push notifications and
permissions I highly recommend it
alright so assuming that you're not
scared by those challenges but you're
really excited about wanting to build it
like what is a plan what does a roadmap
look like for doing a progressive web
app and here's where it's exciting for
me because I think progressive web apps
are like like have so many layers of
puns in them they're like progressive
web apps are progressive because they
use progressive enhancement and they're
progressive because they also they also
progress in a relationship with the user
so they just start out behind the scenes
and then they kind of ask hey would you
like push notifications
hey this is available offline hey would
you like to add this to the homescreen
and they're also progressive because you
can progressively roll out the features
you don't have to do it all at one time
so when we worked on a progressive web
app for our site we knew that that's
where we wanted to end up but the first
stop was actually this redesign that we
were working on so we did a redesign and
with that redesign we went to HTTPS and
we also made the site faster using HTTP
2 and we added a manifest right like
it's not the
in manifest but we added one because it
makes it easier to bookmark on Android
then we added a serviceworker about you
know a couple months later with that it
was available offline and an offline
fallback it was technically a
progressive web app but we weren't
satisfied a couple weeks later we added
offline pages and we added an offline
indicator we did some stuff to improve
performance again and then we added push
notifications and again we did some
performance tweaks we keep doing these
performance tweaks and then a couple
weeks after that we announced that we
had a progressive web app now what's
important about this is that each one of
those milestones we were delivering
things to the user that improved their
experience we didn't have to wait till
the end to bundle it all up into some
big binary and roll it out we could do
this a long time we could put together a
plan actually execute on that plan and
we're not done we're still making
improvements but this is why it's
important like every step on the way on
the path to progressive web app makes
sense on its own and not only that but
it provides every step actually provides
benefit to your users so I started by
talking about the hype around
progressive web apps and how it was
annoying me and it's not that the hype
is overinflated necessarily it's that
the hype is just completely looking at
the wrong thing right all the hype is
about native versus web and I'm tired of
that discussion what I think the height
should be about is how building
progressive web apps actually allow us
to build better experiences and not only
that but when you combine progressive
web apps with features that are now
available in browsers that we've never
had before like the payment request API
and Apple pay on the web and Bluetooth
web api and physical web api and like
these features we're finally getting to
the point where we can actually have
frictionless fast fluid beautiful
experiences right we can do these on
mobile devices these are things that
we've never been able to do on desktop
and now we're at the point where we
could actually do that more somebody
could get a link and buy something with
their fingerprint right those types of
experiences are now coming to us on the
web
and progressive web apps are a big part
of that and a big part of what's
possible in the future for the web so I
don't think that they've been overhyped
they've just been sold in the wrong way
and I hope you feel the same way about
it and you go back to your
organization's and you build a
progressive web app right now thank you
