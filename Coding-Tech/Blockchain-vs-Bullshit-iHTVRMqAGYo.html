going on here
is this the greatest technological
innovation and explosion of innovation
since the mobile internet or maybe even
the internet itself or is this the
greatest load of hype ever arranged
around the technology in the history of
Technology both and in fact that's a
characteristic of advanced technologies
I often say that we're Bitcoin and the
other open block chains are today is
approximately where the internet is in
1992 in terms of Technology in terms of
infrastructure deployment in terms of
adoption patterns this technology is
approximately where the internet was in
1992 but the hype around blockchain is
exactly where the hype around the
internet was in 1998 you know what comes
next
there will be a shakeout when the waters
recede you can tell who on the beach
wasn't wearing a swimsuit they stand
there naked it's an empty promise this
will happen in the blockchain space
there is a lot a lot of
being peddled to VCS to investors to
initial coin offering buyers to
uneducated investors there's a lot of
Ponzi schemes there's a lot of pyramid
schemes there's a lot of empty promises
there's also a lot of business as usual
disguise this innovation disguised as
disruptive technology and so we're at
this strange moment where the underlying
technology really
is truly is massively disruptive
massively innovative the amount of
research that's happening today in
applied cryptography is unprecedented we
are looking at the largest civilian
deployment of public key cryptography
ever because it turns out that people
only protect keys when those keys are
attached to value and nothing teaches
someone security fast enough than having
their Bitcoin on a Windows machine
holding your own Bitcoin very quickly
changes your attitude towards
information security you didn't care
about your photos some didn't even care
about your sexy photos you didn't care
about your location the fact that
everything you do was track you didn't
care about posting your entire life on
Facebook you use the same password
password one two three four on 17
different sites you didn't know what
two-factor authentication was and then
bitcoin happened and suddenly you're on
a steep learning curve and getting
better every day
now you're telling your friends about
two-factor authentication and you're
horrified to remember how you used to
practice security because storing value
has this unique ability to focus your
mind on the aspects of security that
matters so this technology is driving
this groundswell of security awareness
it's driving the most incredible
research and applied cryptography we've
ever seen some of you are probably quite
technical you're involved in computer
science you've seen what's happening
here nobody thought that we would be
doing Applied Schnoor signatures nobody
thought we'd be looking at advanced
elliptic curve applications nobody
thought we'd be doing things like ring
signatures and range proofs for
confidential transactions the state of
anonymity and
the sea is advancing rapidly we're
building a whole new world in terms of
cryptography and this is applied
cryptography on the largest
cryptographically secured network the
world has ever seen
that's not business as usual it's highly
disruptive now out of that came this
fantastic saying blockchain is the
technology behind Bitcoin which is
incorrect blockchain is one of the four
foundational technologies behind Bitcoin
and it can't stand alone but that hasn't
stopped people from trying to sell it
blockchain is Bitcoin with a haircut and
a suit that you parade in front of your
board it's the ability to deliver a
sanitized clean comfortable version of
blockchain of Bitcoin to people who are
too terrified of actually disruptive
technology and so you get into this very
strange world where the words no longer
mean anything can you define blockchain
for me I think a few people in this room
could probably define blockchain but the
real challenge would be can you define
blockchain in such a way that I can do
search and replace with the word
database and still make that sentence
work because that's the challenge if
what you're doing is a database with
signatures it's not interesting it's
boring what is the essence of Bitcoin
it's not blockchain the essence of
Bitcoin is the ability to operate in a
decentralized way without having to
trust anyone the essence of Bitcoin is
to be able to use software to
authoritative lis independently without
appeal to Authority verify everything
yourself you don't trust the other nodes
you're talking to you
assume they're lying you don't trust the
miners you don't trust the people
creating the transactions you don't
trust anything other than the outcome of
your own verification and validation and
through that you end up trusting in
something more important the network
effect Bitcoin introduced the concept of
decentralized security through
computation and this has not yet sunk in
what Bitcoin does is it allows you to
replace a security model that is based
around concentric circles of access and
control with an institution in the
center with a security model that is
inside out open and accessible to
everyone a security model that is based
on market forces and game theory it is
the first market based security model
where a series of incentives and
punishments ensure that the ultimate
result is you can trust the platform
itself as a neutral arbiter that is not
controlled by anyone without third
parties without intermediaries Bitcoin
revolutionizes trust now it's difficult
to have that conversation if you only
focus on Bitcoin and arguably a lot of
people have said but it's not just about
currency what about the other
applications and it's not just about
Bitcoin what about the other block
chains and so in that sense the term
blockchain means something but only if
you define it very very narrowly I use
the qualifier open to talk about open
blockchain what I'm interested in is the
applications of this technology that
enable you to run a decentralized
trustless system that does not rely on
anyone as an intermediary of trust
because that is the disruption here that
is the essence technology
so that essence is seen in other Systems
Theory exhibits it for the application
of smart contracts but those smart
contracts only work if you don't have to
trust anyone to execute the smart
contract correctly and you can only
trust that that's going to happen if
everyone can participate in an open
manner and verify each other if access
to the underlying consensus algorithm
and mining is open to everyone and so
out of these characteristics come the
power of these blockchains technologies
open and that's the key word borderless
there are no borders transnational this
is no longer about nation-states this is
about network centric Trust without
third parties the network is the trusted
party and only if you verify everything
neutral because it isn't serving the
goals of any one organization or
institution it follows the consensus
rules neutrally everyone follows the
consensus rules neutrally your
transaction there's no such thing as a
good transaction or a bad transaction a
valuable transaction or spam transaction
an authorized transaction or an
unauthorized transaction a legal
transaction or an illegal transaction in
these systems there is only a valid or
an invalid transaction based on the
consensus rules and it doesn't matter
who the sender is who the recipient is
or what the value or asset or smart
contract that's being executed is
neutrality radical neutrality and of
course censorship resistance the ability
to ensure that in order for the system
to be open and borderless and
transnational and neutral it must be
able to defend these properties
by making it impossible for any actor or
even several colluding actors from
censoring disrupting blacklisting
restricting ceasing freezing
transactions users countries from
participating in this network those are
the important characteristics of these
new open decentralized systems of trust
that do not depend on institutions so
what I'd like to equip you with is a set
of criteria to understand when you are
being presented with something perhaps
to invest or to be employed or to engage
in some way and it calls itself a
blockchain or a distributed ledger or
one of these other names that are coming
out how can you tell block chain or

they both start with a B what's the
difference if you can replace the word
blockchain with database and the
brochure reads the same it's business as
usual it's not decentralized it's not
borderless neutral censorship resistant
open its reestablishes trust in
intermediaries it's just the database
and that is not disruptive the idea that
we're going to take this technology and
use it to improve the operating margins
of centralized institutions of trust so
that they can continue business as usual
and I'd say it's apparent but that's a
strong word it's just boring really
really boring
no one got into this in order to make a
few billions for a financial services
Clearing House and if you did I'm really
sorry
that's boring what's really exciting is
the possibility of fundamentally
changing the way we allocate trust on
this planet opening up the ability to
collaborate transact engage on a global
level with everyone simply by means of
downloading an application you can
become part of a giant platform of trust
that doesn't care who you are where you
came from that doesn't require
permission to participate or innovate
we're a 12 year old JavaScript
programmer has the same influences power
as JP Morgan Chase more in fact because
they're doing open source and feeding
into a community of collaboration that
is creating a tsunami of innovation
taking this technology and using it to
strengthen the same centralized
institutions so that they can improve
their bottom line is boring that is not
what blockchain is that's just the
database and it doesn't change anything
in fact there are some rather disturbing
possibilities in this model let's think
about it for a second the most commonly
expressed application for these new
distributed ledger technologies is to
replace the function of a centralized
clearing house with a consortium of n
participants where n is 2 3 4 5 10 known
permissions controlled participants who
will assemble transactions and sign them
rather than compete through market
forces in a security model like Bitcoin
we discard currency as the underlying
mechanism for building market based
secure
we discard proof of work as wasteful
because all it allows you to do is the
centralized secure and neutral
censorship resistant blockchain and we
trust five named parties to sign
transactions at that point they don't
need to assemble these transactions in
blocks they can just sign the individual
transactions they don't need to chain
them together because absent proof of
work and a system of currency incentives
rewriting that is easy there's no
immutability so it's not a blockchain
anymore because there's no blocks and
there's no chain now that's at a
technical level but let's look at the
more important level what do you achieve
by replacing a Clearing House with a
consortium of players you know there's
something unique a clearinghouse does if
you understand the role of a Clearing
House one of its most important
functions is that it is not a
participant in the market it has no skin
in the game
the New York Stock Exchange is not an
active trader that's not an accident
that's called separation of concerns the
Clearing House is an independent party
with oversight that is not a market
participant if you take that party out
and replace it with five banks all of
which have skin in the game how do you
run a consensus algorithm when the
incentives to cheat front run manipulate
the market and break the consensus rules
even adversarially against the other
four parties are so high there's no
incentive to keep the consensus rules
all you're doing is you're saying trust
us we're in a consortium trust us these
five banks
where were you in 2008 where were you
when Lieber was fixed where were you
when the gold markets were fixed where
were you when front-running and high
frequency trading was creating these
monsters of crony capitalism trust us
hell no removing the Clearinghouse and
replacing it with what's the word it's
not consortium cartel that's the word
with the cartel of the same market
makers who have manipulated and
compromised every market in history and
doing that in a way that closes this
from transparency that's not a recipe
for efficiency immutability security
transparency that's not a blockchain
that's a it's a very profitable
 it requires you to have
confidence in the game a con game as
it's known be careful what you evaluate
when you see these technologies taking
something whose fundamental purpose is
to remove trusted intermediaries and
create an open borderless neutral system
and turning it into a tool for a bunch
of untrustworthy trusted parties to
manipulate markets is going to be a
disaster and they're going to do it I
have some consolation in the fact that
their keys will leak
because when you centralize a system you
have to keep the security of those five
keys and none of them have ever managed
to do that
all of the companies involved in this
brave new business as usual space have
been hacked breached leaked whistle
blown a dozen times they can't keep
information secure
no one can the whole point of a
decentralized blockchain is you don't
keep the information secure you spread
it out so thin there's no place to
attack it directly that's what makes it
secure so what happens when you
concentrate it among five participants I
can't wait until the anonymous wikileaks
collaborative dump of the Titans of Wall
Street and their ledger of every
transaction they've ever done
I can't wait it's gonna be so much fun
and it is going to happen you cannot
secure these things so does that mean
there's nothing there no again we go
back to the other side there is an
incredibly promising technology and that
technology is based on an architecture
of openness people are examining this
market and they're grasping and reaching
out in darkness when you have a brand
new disruptive technology you can't see
the margins it's like stumbling around a
dark room somewhere in there is a
billion dollar company somewhere in
there is an opportunity and you have to
figure out what market exists the will
create opportunity that will change the
world that will have an impact on
humanity entrepreneurs look at other
people's problems and see them as
opportunities when journalists in 1997
were writing a
the imminent failure of the internet
because of the impossibility of finding
anything Larry Page and Sergey Brin were
finding stuff and building a
multi-billion dollar empire on solving
the unsolvable problem of search there
are seemingly unsolvable problems in the
open decentralized public transparent
neutral censorship resistant global
trustless Network platform that is the
blockchain and these other block chains
Bitcoin aetherium and the many other
systems that are gradually trying to
find their niche where are those markets
there are three elements to success in
this industry the first one is
identifying a viable market right
you've got to stumble in the dark and
find something useful and very often the
people stumbling in the dark they don't
find anything useful
all right in 1997 Petco was building a
online commerce empire for pet supplies
it was too early the market didn't exist
web grocer web van was delivering
groceries to homes in San Francisco
failed miserably was that the right
market maybe but it was the wrong time
so that's the second important element
right timing you can identify something
that at some point will be enormous but
you're off by a decade and then the most
important factor sequencing the
prerequisites why did Facebook not
happen in 1992 you didn't have enough
density of adoption you didn't have
mobile devices that were permanently
connected you didn't even have
home-based internet that was permanently
on you didn't have a dense social
network in order to engage with the
people you knew because the people you
knew barely had email or didn't have
email right so you can't bill
a system of complexity that depends on
many too many interaction with high
density when you're still doing
applications that are one-to-one with
low density right it's like trying to
fuse hydrogen directly into carbon can't
do that
you've got helium lithium beryllium
you've got a long way to go keep
smashing things together before you get
enough density that you can start doing
interesting things in organic chemistry
right to use an example from science
bottom line is you can't do advanced
real estate title applications voting on
the blockchain retail markets you can't
do consumer to consumer dense markets
you can do points of sale retail with
these systems yet you can do most of the
things yet there might be very
interesting markets and the reason you
can't do them is because there's not
enough liquidity there's not enough
users is not enough adoption the user
interfaces are terrible the applications
are still at their infant stage that
doesn't mean these things can't happen
it just means they're not happening this
year we're going to see this play out in
order for people to have the trust to
put the title of their home on
blockchain it has to be able to secure
not billions but trillions of dollars in
assets and in order to be able to secure
trillions of dollars in assets it has to
have liquidity and infrastructure it has
to have broad adoption you're not going
to get adoption on a transaction that
most people do twice in their lifetime
when you can't even get them to use it
for transactions they do every day right
we're not going to be doing digital
identity so that everyone can have a
bank account because it takes a long
time until you have adequate adoption
for the first 15 years of the internet
the application was email
and not until everybody had it had to
have it needed it for work did we see
the second layer emerge because that
created the density of adoption and
currency is the email of blockchains
payments are the fundamental
infrastructure that will enable density
of adoption it's very very enticing to
say this is about more than money it is
absolutely in the long term the vision
of this technology is far beyond money
but you can't build that unless you
first build the money part that's what
creates the security that's what creates
the velocity the liquidity the
infrastructure that's what funds the
entire ecosystem and in the end when we
do deliver perhaps digital identity to
people it won't be so they can open a
bank account because this isn't about
banking the unbanked
it's about D banking all of us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
