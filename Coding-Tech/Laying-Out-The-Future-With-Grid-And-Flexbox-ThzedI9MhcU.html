and about flexbox these are some of the
places that you can sort of find me and
some of the things that I do and so as
mentioned I've been working quite a bit
over the last five years on a little
specification called CSS grid layout and
I was talking about it long long before
it ended up in browsers as going around
to different events and saying yes this
is coming it's gonna be really really
good when it lands and this is what it
does and I think people started to think
I was talking about some kind of CSS
vaporware until March when I was very
very happy because this happened and we
got grid into all these browsers and
edge on the end there is shipping their
implementation they updated
implementation in October so this is
great it we've never really had a big
spec like this be shipped into so many
browsers all at once this is fantastic
for the interoperability of the web and
photos building websites and using new
specifications and grids a massive spec
and works alongside these other
specifications things like flex box and
box alignment and so on I can't teach
you it all in a few minutes some of you
who are coming to my workshop will learn
a bit more there so what I'm going to do
is just try and deal with some of the
top questions that people have when they
start to look at grid and work with it
alongside flex box and the main question
that I get asked by people and
repeatedly asked on Twitter and at
conferences and in q and A's the people
on Twitter will say to me well flex box
exists why not use that surely that's
the spec that's going to solve
everything for us and they also asked me
well it's grid a competing specification
to flex box as if the CSS working group
are creating some kind of specification
deathmatch now which one will win and
that's not really the case they work
together and this is why defined in the
spec we here that flex box is for one
dimensional layout and grid is for two
so what does that really mean this is a
flex box example so you've got a bunch
of things you've laid them out you've
allowed them to wrap but as they wrap as
we get odd numbers of items on the
bottom row they don't line up in a
the grid they don't line up underneath
their columns and that's because space
distribution happens across the row when
we're working in a row now grid is for
two-dimensional that means that you're
laying things out as a row and as a
column at the same time so if we have
the same kind of layout you can see the
items are staying in their columns
they're not spreading out all the way
across the bottom row so that's the real
basic difference between the two
specifications and for grid that's all
we need to create that layout we're
using repeat syntax for auto-filling
columns that are a minimum of 200 pixels
wide and the extra is all shared out
between them and you might be thinking
if you've used flexbox for a grid well I
can get round that problem because I can
add wits to my Flex items and then
they'll all line up and it's at that
point that's exactly when you should be
saying I probably should be using grid
here if you're restricting the
flexibility of flexbox then you probably
need a grid layout because you're not
using flexbox or what it's really good
at another way to look at this is that
flexbox works from the content out and
grid typically works from the container
in so you've got a collection of things
and they're all different sizes and you
just want them to be spaced out well
that's what flexbox does really well
I've got my list of mythical creatures
here and they're being spaced out evenly
or we could allow items to grow and
shrink from a Flex basis of auto and we
get this kind of layout again which is a
bit like that layout in the first
example where things are just taking
their size and spreading out but you can
see that's not a grid the lines aren't
all in nice neat grid lines so if we're
going to do that sort of thing with grid
we're gonna say here is my grid it's got
these columns and I'd like my things to
fit into those columns so here I've got
a four column grid here and if we placed
the items in they then lay out in that
neat grid we don't need to add anything
to the items they're just fitting into
the tracks and we can cause some tracks
to be bigger than others here I'm using
that fr unit and I'm saying
- f r1 f r2 f r1 o faster the two fr
ones are going to get soar to parts of
the space over one part of the space the
whole thing is going to be divided up
and we'll end up with this again we're
not adding anything to the items where's
a flexbox should we having to make that
change on the item itself rather than on
the track and this is really why
everyone's confused about grid layout
because everything else we have in CSS
what we do is we add sizing to the item
and then we say well how many items have
we got and how do we fit them into the
row we make sure they're the right size
and that's how we get what so that looks
like a grid this is a simplified to a
float grid example so if I want to
create a three column grid with floats
I say float work left and I give it a
width of a around 33% so that the things
will all line up using inline-block
exactly the same we have to give it a
width for things to line up and while we
do say display flex on the parent to
make it into a grid we again have to go
to the items and either give a Flex
basis which is a size or you know user
width on the item and a Flex basis of
auto and to stop those sort of
flexibility happening so grid is
different we do all of that definition
on the parent and then the items fit
into it the only other layout method we
have in CSS which does anything that a
roughly similar is multi-column layouts
which will split something into columns
inside so grid is all about the
container and so once you know this then
that decision whether I need to use grid
or whether I want to use flexbox is a
lot easier because you think well do I
want my items just to sort out their
spacing or do I want to declare a grid
and fit the stuff into it and have
sizing happen on both rows and columns
and the thing about containers the thing
about controlling layout from the
container is you can do all kinds of
interesting things and I wanted to look
at this particular interesting thing
because there was this article I saw
posted breaking out with CSS grid layout
and this is a technique for doing a very
common design pattern where you have a
sort of a narrow content column maybe in
your blog
and then when you've got like a big
image or something it takes full width
of the screen and there's various
techniques for doing that with different
layout methods and this was a nice
method of doing it with grid but the
thing was it didn't explain how it
worked it was one of those articles that
just say here is a cool thing paste this
into your document and magic will occur
and I like to explain the magic that's
the new that I enjoy doing so I had a
look at this and once I kind of worked
through it and figured out what was
going on because it was something I
hadn't thought of doing with grid I
thought well I'll show other people how
this works because it's quite
interesting so I've got some markup here
this is a simplified version of what's
in that tutorial and I'm going to create
a grid and it's going to have three
column tracks and I'm going to set all
of the direct children to start after a
grid column line two and anything with a
class of full to be full weights at line
one to four so that's the grid with the
line numbers on and so the content goes
into the center have to line two and
then full width things stretch right
across the grid so the thin the third
item the bottom there again is a regular
content item going in the center so just
like this but that example didn't use
line numbers it use names they're named
the areas so to get there you need to
know that you can name your lines any
named lines in your square brackets and
you're naming the lines not the actual
tracks or not the content area you name
the lines so then that means we can swap
their numbers for names so we have the
grid there with the names and we can
position like that but that's not the
same as the example either the example
is more like this it's as if we're
targeting the track or tracks that the
content goes into and line based
positioning whether by number or by name
are always targets the lines and we seem
to be using line names that don't
actually exist anywhere and to
understand where they come from you need
to know something else about grid layout
if you name lines with - start and -
end four columns and rows you will get a
named area of the main name used so in
this diagram
I've got named grid lines four main
start and main ends both four columns
and rows that gives me a good area
called main and those names could be
anything you like as long as they start
and end with - start and - and so I
could end it with code like this
creating the lines and then placing the
item with grid area main but that isn't
quite what we want either because the
example uses grid column not grid area
and so we can finish our trip down this
rabbit hole with two of the bits of the
spec if you specify row or column start
as the name of a named area in our case
main the start line will resolve to the
start edge of that named grid area so we
get a fill with columns starting at line
one if we give grid column a value of
full and we're using a shorthand grid
column and if you give a shorthand grid
column only one ident is what we've got
with main then the grid column end is
set to the same ident which means that
we can say grid column full and that
makes the end line the end edge of that
area which looks like this which
actually is this we're saying grid
column start on main end on main grid
column start on full end on full and if
you look at the code I'll be giving up
the links to these slides you look at
the code later the Firefox grid
inspector which is a useful tool if
you're working with grids and you can
actually see if you look in the tools
how that naming is working so that's a
pretty deep rabbit hole for one little
tutorial but shows the sort of stuff
that happens once we can control things
from the container and also give some
sort of insight into what goes on in my
head as I'm delving into these
specifications so these powerful tools
around the container is where a lot of
the initial complexity of grid comes
from when you sort of look at grid
layout and think good grief there's an
awful lot of new stuff in here how am I
going to get my head around it what is
it for why do we even need this stuff
it's because all of this stuff has been
invented
to let us do things form a container
which is actually what you want to do if
you're dealing with grids you want to be
able to create a grid and put stuff onto
it and so you need all of these new
things and there's a whole lot of them
that I'm not showing today that are all
about dealing with containers so that
you can actually create powerful layouts
with grid so that was a few little bits
about grid layout and why we might be
using it instead of flexbox and and I
wants to talk a bit about using grid in
production because since March this year
we've had grid in browsers and we've
been able to start using it for real at
websites and there's a surprising number
of production websites and parts of
production websites even very high
profile sites that have started to ship
bits and pieces using grid layout and I
redesign my site using grid of course
because I've as much as anything I
wanted to have something real to build
with it and actually put it out there
and see what problems I had so the
examples that are coming up or
essentially the bits and pieces I worked
on as I was putting together the design
of my site and sort of design patterns
that I used there as I was starting I
think when my site is mostly lists of
stuff its lists of podcasts I've been on
and books I've written and conferences
I'm speaking out so I kind of have all
these at the boxes anyway and my
previous design looked like that so I
started putting together in my pattern
live with some ideas for different types
of boxes I might use in my layout and I
identified this item this featured item
I wanted to have an image and be able to
overlay some text over the top of that
and so that we would have something like
this I could have an image that
described the article with some text
over the top and my image is almost
always of hot-air balloons
I come from Bristol where there's lots
of hot-air balloons I like to take
photos of them they're pretty and it's
the end up in all of my slide examples
so anyway I've got a wrapper here and
the classic box feature and inside we've
just got an image there and then we've
got some markup wrapping the title and
the content so the books that's our
container so we turn on grid with
display grid I'm using grid gap too
create a gap between the tracks it's
worth noting the name of grid gap is
going to change there's a shorthand for
it this is a short term for grid rogue
out and good column gap those are
changing to become row gap and column
gap and just gap browsers will alias the
old names the new names but basically
this is so we can have the same ability
to create gutter tracks between flex
items in future without having to create
a flex gap and so on so we're renaming
those I think the edge implementation
when it ships will support the new names
as well as the old names thus we've got
a gap we've got this gutters between
tracks and then we then define column
tracks with grid template columns so I'm
going to create six 1fr tracks and this
fr unit again is all about containers
because we've got a container which has
got available space in it we have the
ability to say well how many sort of
parts of that available space should
this item have and you can see I've used
again the fact that grid inspector in
this to see where my tracks actually are
now you can see that assigning available
space happening you can see the second
column looks a bit bigger we haven't
quite got six equal columns and this is
because there's a longer bit of text in
and because we're dealing with available
space that's going to push wider whoops
we need have enough space to layout that
item once we start displaying all items
the columns will go over free equal and
that's kind of the nature of this fr
unit it's not quite just share out my
space equally so then going to use my
line based positioning to stretch the
image over the grid area from con like
column line one
to line minus one which is the first to
the last column line of the grid and
then from row line one to four and so
that it's worth knowing that grid lines
respect writing mode all of our new
specs have sort of recognized that not
the entire world is working left to
right so all of our new specs use
writing mode and we'll if you are
working say in Arabic right-to-left line
one is going to be on the right-hand
side of
grid and -1 is going to be on the left
so if you do work in with documents
which use two different languages which
have you know working left to right and
right to left you need to be aware that
if you use that line based positioning
it's going to actually flip the grid
which might be exactly what you want it
might not depending on the type of thing
you're laying out this is worth knowing
we're also seeing in this example an
example of the explicit and the implicit
grid now the explicit grid is the grid
that you define when you use grid
template columns or grid template rows
you create grid tracks
that's the explicit grid if you just let
content go into a grid say you just set
up your columns as I have in my example
and you don't set up any rows then grid
will just create extra lines for the
content and so you'll get extra tracks
this is called the implicit grid and it
is this created grid now the two were
mostly in the same way but you can't
target the end of the implicit grid with
minus one you will only ever target the
end of the explicit grid which is pretty
much the main difference in production
that you'll come across so that's my
image they're stretched over and you can
see again I'm use the lines on the grid
there are from that Firefox grid
inspector so you can kind of see how the
grid is laid out and then we just
position the content again I'm using
line based positioning here and I'm
placing the content into the same tracks
that the image occupies so I'm layering
up the content and we get this again
with the tracks highlighted so you can
see how the items are sitting and you
can see how the second auto-generated
track and the implicit grid is growing
to accept how much content gets put in
there which is important I don't know
how much content I'm going to have in my
feature so this little box it shows us a
few thing it shows us that we can layer
things up on the grid we can position
items into the same grid cells now
pretty much as you'd expect things
further down in the source will appear
on top but you can use that index just
as with absolute positioning in order to
change that stack if you want to so
we've used if our units and repeat
notation to create this this example
you've seen how grids auto place
things if we don't position them or
views line based positioning there
you've seen how grid respects writing
modes and we've also used some the box
alignment prop so you go back and look
at that code there's a whole bunch of
stuff going on for one little box so
this is how I'd like this box to layout
with the rest of my layout what not to
sit at the top and then the other things
there well yeah there's not a lot going
on in those they're fairly simple items
so now I'm going to work out well how do
i lay those out in overall layout and
i'd like to use auto placement here i'd
like grid to deal with this stuff so i'm
gonna chuck a bunch of content out i
don't know how many items i'm gonna have
and i'd like grid just to lay those out
nicely
perhaps just with some rules around the
items to sort of change the layout
slightly depending on what type of item
i've got so the first thing I do is I
create my should have overall layout for
the page and here I'm going to create a
twelve column flexible layout so I've
got 12 one of our units and this is what
I'm going to try and get to so you can
see that the this is a title there's
taking up three tracks and then we've
got that featured item and then we've
got those boxes laying out below
now if I just take all that content and
create a grid on the parent I will get
this that's auto placement because what
happening if you don't have if you
haven't said how you want the things to
layout grid will just take each item and
stuff it into a track because that's how
order placement works so we now need to
start tweaking the auto placement and
positioning some things and creating
some rules so that everything isn't
going into a little skinny column now
I'm going to actually position my first
two items as the first things I've got
box title and box feature I'm going to
actually position those onto my grid
again just using line based positioning
so they lay out nicely as we want them
and again everything underneath grid
just carries on trying to stuff it into
the cells of that it's got so I want
grid to do that Auto placement thing I
want that to happen I want grid just to
deal with those items I just don't want
them to be in one tiny track so I have
to do that I can set up some rules
so for my boxes this of the the larger
boxes I've got the top I'm going to say
grid columns start auto and that means
start on the line that you would
naturally start on which will be the
kind of next available line that would
put the item into a free space that's
how what a placement works so I don't
need to worry about the actual start
line and then my end line should span
four tracks so start on whatever line
you would normally start on if you were
going to get stuffed into a skinny
column but actually span four tracks I
can do that with rows as well so with
the Box media I want that to be tall
looks it's going to have an image in
I'll say grid row end spam to now those
two things are pretty much the same if
you don't specify grid rows start either
with a short hand or with the long hand
grid rows start then the default is auto
because things auto place by default so
I've got some smaller boxes and I'm just
going to set those to span three tracks
again they start on auto and so that's
what we get
good just sorts that out it finds a box
that's going to be one of the four track
ones it gives it four tracks and then
any smaller ones they go into three
tracks and grid works through keeping
the things in in source order and just
lays them out for me so this is really
useful with grid layout you can
specifically position some things that
you want to have placed and then you can
just let grid place the rest of the
stuff with some rules set up around that
it's incredibly useful and and really
kind of respects the sort of content you
know as mentioned in in my intro by Phil
I would work with content management I'm
very used to the fact that stuff comes
out of a database that needs to be
displayed on a page you don't always
know how big it is and how much stuff
there is and actually that was what got
me excited about grid layout in the
first place because when you work a lot
with content that's nicely structured
you just want to be able to display it
and without having to set a load of
rules on it or add loads of classes to
everything in order to be able to do
that and to be able to sort of pick it
out and make it sized correctly so so
far everything was being foots off of my
wider breakpoints I've been showing
they're things to the wider breakpoint
but then
thing with CSS squared is it's really
easy to define different things at
different break points if you want I
think in grid layout you can get away
with fewer media queries because we've
got this natural responsiveness for
things like the fr units and being able
to use them in Macs and so on on the
container but where you do want to start
to introduce breakpoints it makes it
very easy to you know redefine the grid
or redefine where you place items on the
grid it's all there in CSS so what you
could do is you could actually
completely redefine your grid you'd say
I don't want to have 12 columns anymore
I want to have six and then change where
things are or what I'm going to do is
what you tend to do with other layout
frameworks where you say well I've
always got 12 columns but at smaller
breakpoints that things are going to
span more columns so that's what I'm
going to do in my example so I start
with my very smallest breakpoints with
my title spanning right across and as we
get more screen real estate I'm just
going to change where I place it and we
can also change the way those boxes Auto
place so it narrow breakpoints they span
six tracks and then drop to four as we
get wider and so what we get by doing
that is something looks a bit like this
so you can see that we've still got 12
columns at both of these great points
but as we go wider things just take up
fewer columns and we can get more boxes
across and all of that done there right
in the CSS so you can really play around
with it there seems to be a bit of a
push back against media queries I'm not
really a hundred percent sure why but do
play around with media queries I think
you know flexbox and grid do make it
much easier to not use as many we're not
I'm finding that in production I'm not
sort of peppering my CSS with media
queries all over the place to fix things
but when you do want to introduce one
you can do some quite neat stuff because
we can do all of this redefinition right
there in the CSS without having to worry
about sort of putting things onto the
markup so it's quite useful for just
tweaking things at different break
points so we've got a bit of a layout
and we've made it responsive but then
there's always old browsers I love this
image I took this photo I was I was at a
triathlon and I was locking my bike up
to the fence and I turned around and
there is the old ie steam roller it's
like I'm being trolled in real life you
know these things following me around
it's gonna show up in many many a
conference talk yes so old browsers I
think probably the the second most asked
question really you know after wife we
got grades we've got flexbox is well
that's all fine for you but I have all
of these old browsers I have to support
and yet old browsers aren't gonna vanish
you know we've we've been very fortunate
with grid it's got out there into into
all of our sort of main browsers very
quickly but you know most of us have
projects where we're having to support
old browsers you know my own project
perched the UI we support that to ie9 so
I know what it is like I certainly don't
live in any kind of sort of ivory tower
of shiny new browsers all the time
however new CSS specs we've written into
those specs how we should deal with old
browsers how the spec actually deals
with you writing stuff for older
browsers and then overwriting it with
new CSS so to find in the spec because
we're doing things on the container if
you've got an oh say you're using float
or inline block or display table as a
fallback
you've got items inside there which are
going to have sizing they're going to
have floats applied and so on so defined
in the spec is what happens if
something's parent becomes a grid
container so that item becomes a grid
item so that means that you know float
stop being floats and vertical align
stops having effect flex items between
grid items so all of these things start
to happen once the thing becomes a grid
item and this means you don't need to go
around building two layouts or
completely forking your code grid works
very well as an enhancement so we'd have
a look at that here's our list
page in a browser that doesn't support
grid layout so I said expect everything
just displays in document order because
that's what browsers do with CSS they
don't understand like I have no idea
what this is I'll ignore it and I'll
just lay things out as best I can so I'm
going to just use flexbox as a quick
fallback for this because it yeah this
is my site
I've got reasonably decent browsers come
into it so I'm choosing flex layout flex
items will become grid items if grid is
supported so that's that's pretty much
okay the app the Flex properties will
just be ignored once it's a grid item I
don't need to remove it or anything but
one thing I want to do is remove that
margin I've added two flex items because
the grid gap is controlling spacing and
so I'm going to get extra spacing if
I've got margins the problem with doing
this over writing of old things with new
things when you've got things that both
old browsers our new browsers are going
to understand
so widths and margins are the typical
thing and it is here that feature
queries are going to become your new
best friend feature queries are
wonderful if you have ever used
moderniser you know how to use feature
queries if you've ever used a meteor
query then you understand the syntax and
feature queries have fantastic browser
support and it doesn't matter about that
I 11 because what you do with feature
queries is you write your old CSS then
you say hey browser
do you support grid if the browser says
yes I do you do your grid stuff inside
there so you can remove any margins you
can change the widths at that point so
you're kind of you're using a
progressive enhancement approach it
doesn't matter the browser doesn't
support the feature you're checking
whether it has got support for the
feature and you can use feature queries
for any new bit of CSS that appears from
now on because of this really great
support so here's how it works we don't
need to remove those Flex properties I
say once it becomes a grid item the Flex
stuff is just ignored anyway we just
need to override stuff that would make a
difference in the layout and in this
case that's the margin I'm going to set
my margin to zero
I say do you support grid the browser
says I do indeed say well we'll have no
margin on that
so we get of this layout and so a final
thing I want to do is to make the title
and feature box have similar proportions
to our grid layout and I can basically
do that by just giving the Box a larger
Flex basis again that's gonna be ignored
once it becomes a grid item and so we
get this sort of flex version it's not
quite the same we could go further we
could trannies absolute positioning to
pull that content up over the image and
you could go as far as you want and the
thing with doing support for older
browsers is look at your statistics you
know is it a tiny amount of people who
have got the old browsers or is it a lot
if it's a lot you're gonna need to do
more if it is not very many I would
suggest you put that time into
accessibility or something which is
really going to benefit people rather
than chasing users of i9 you need to
look at your own statistics though to
decide where that lies you know what
what choices you have that's really
important but the point is you don't
need a lot of additional CSS to do these
overrides and you can take advantage of
some of the stuff that you can only do
with grid layout and still provide a
decent experience for older browsers and
so it's a quick guide to some of the
things you might use as a fallback float
and clear to say they've got no effect
on a grid item so here I'm floating an
item but once it becomes a grid item the
floats just ignored you don't have to
take it off inline-block
very useful once that becomes a grid
item the things that are about inline
block the thing with inline block it
preserves whitespace you have to be very
careful that you have things you remove
all your whitespace otherwise you get
extra spacing that's just removed once
the thing becomes a grid item you don't
need to worry about it anymore display
table I think table cell is an excellent
way to provide overrides for older
browsers the thing about using
display:table-cell
on an item is that it creates anonymous
boxes you get a row and an anonymous
anonymous table at wrapper if it becomes
a grid item then that happens before the
anonymous boxes are created so you won't
get them lying around they won't become
sort of weird anonymous grid items or
anything odd like that
again all defined in the spec so that's
how browsers are supposed to do it
you can use vertical-align on inline
block or display:table-cell items once
the thing becomes a grid item first
proline doesn't take effect anymore and
you can use the box alignment properties
multicom because that does actually work
on the container that can be quite
useful way if you've got say a card
layout like mine that you're using grid
layout for you can potentially lay it
out with multicolor for older browsers
it's gonna go column wise rather than
row wise but that might be a reasonable
fallback and if you've used those column
properties once it once it becomes a
grid container there just ignore what
you don't need to remove them as I say
flex layout obviously grid is also
displayed grid so it's part of display
you've overwritten that and any flex
properties on the item will be ignored
and what this means is that your stuff
inside feature queries is pretty much
resetting widths and margins it's that
there anything else that you've done
specifically to make your older browser
layout look nice so we've got this here
and this is a sort of an obvious example
if you've got a floated item so here
we're creating a three column floated
layout we set widths on items and so
they all line up nicely once you go to
they become a grid item the floats
ignored but the width isn't so what
happens is it becomes 33% of the grid
tract so it goes all little and skinny
and that's not what you wanted so inside
your feature queries you set the width
back to auto to remove that and then it
will all just layout nicely with the
grid I made you a cheat sheet to help so
you can go and see all of those
different overrides and fall backs and
so on and so what of edge and ie
because I mentioned that edge is
shipping their updated implementation
and this is the interesting thing about
grid layout it actually started with IE
10 it's a Microsoft thing
the modern implementation of grid layout
started with Microsoft and the IE team
so in I 10 and 11 and current edge until
October when they ship without dated
version we have a sort of early version
of grid layout it's MS prefix so you can
target it specifically and
it works it's pretty solid it just
doesn't have all of the features and it
then there's loads of things have just
changed name and so on but it is
workable if you want to create a grid
light layout for ia 10:11 and sort of
current edge or edge up until October
you can do so with that ms prefix layout
it works it's simpler but it's certainly
there to create fallbacks with so these
are the sort of current things about it
and say they've what's currently an edge
is currently tied to a ten its prefixed
it doesn't have auto placement and
doesn't have the grid template areas
ASCII art style layout but for simple
line based stuff works pretty well and I
get up I've written up some stuff about
that so if you wanting to use grid
layout and your older browsers are I
1011 then you can use this stuff as a
fallback and it's not gonna be as simple
as doing something like adding
autoprefixer because it is just
different
if you auto prefix it did implement a
support and if you have it turned on
it'll base just blow up your layout in I
attend because the two things are two
different you're going to have to treat
that that ie version as a different
thing really but you can use it very
nicely for a fallback and it's it's
pretty solid it works windows developer
speak we're using it for the sort of
touch device type things and that's
really where it came from so so don't
forget that that's there if your concern
is oh I've got 10% of people using I ten
eleven or something then that might be a
way for you to start using grid layout
sooner rather than later if you can
create a fallback with that version so
anyway I mean go back to this slide you
know this is really great you know all
these browsers actually support this new
layout method the number of
interoperability issues are very very
small it is nothing like the problems we
had with flexbox from that first shipped
you know we do have some small things
that have that are different a lot of
that to do with stuff that is wasn't
settled when it shipped into browsers
but we're doing pretty well and I'd
really just like to sort of finish by
touching on how this happens you know
why do browsers decide to implement
certain features why hasn't a browser
implemented a feature that you really
can you wonder why on earth they haven't
done that you know how does that happen
how does interoperability happen and
what I'd like to say is that we as the
web development community have far more
influence than you might actually think
if you want features especially things
that in one browser and not in another
browser you need to let the browser
vendors know that you want this stuff
and you can do that in a variety of ways
you can write about them you know write
them on your blog or if you speak it
conferences or meetups or whatever
mention those features and actually use
them in projects because all of these
vendors are looking to see what has been
used out there on the web if you're not
using a feature they're like well nobody
wants this no one uses shapes so we
don't need shapes or whatever it is you
know so if you actually use the feature
even if you know that a lot of people
aren't gonna see it that sends a message
because that stuff is being tracked you
can also go and just actually vote
things up this is the edge user voice
you can go along and say hey I want this
in edge so if the browser's got that
tool available go and do it go and find
the features you want to make sure
you've added a comment or added a vote
for it because often the engineers who
work on the project they would like to
do it know the engineers want to do the
new features they want to do the stuff
that we all want but they have to make a
business case to their boss as to what
they should be working on so be able to
say oh you know everybody out there is
asking for this thing that makes easy
for them to make the case for it as I
say using features even if they're not
implemented everywhere this is this is
Microsoft data you know looking for data
on the usage of various properties
they're looking to see what you're using
use them and in the interest of that I'm
going to show you some who that ayat
this is this is my current pet feature
that I'm sort of showing everyone in the
hope that it will get implemented this
is exclusions if you use edge which is
it's implemented in you can do this you
can float an either you can basically
wrap stuff all the way around the
outside of a floated item makes great
sense when we've got where we're using
grid because actually what we're doing
here we're not floating the item we're
positioning the item with something and
then we're wrapping text all the way
around so it makes
lot of sense with grid because you can
position the item with grid layout and
then you can make the exclusion it's a
tiny tiny little speck basically and you
do this you say you'd save app flow both
its own Liam from advice you have to say
MS rap flow both and that basically
excludes that area and lets the text
wrap all the way around it doesn't
define positioning itself it just
defines how the item kind of interacts
with stuff around it it's very very nice
I think that'd be really useful I like
that but chrome platform States has says
there's no public signals web developers
do not care I think we could change that
so I sort of think you know if I talk
about it enough people other people
might also talk about because I think
it's a really useful feature makes a lot
of sense with grid so I'd like you to
tell your friends or at least the ones
that are web developers the others would
think you're a bit strange you know this
is a pet feature of mine there's loads
of stuff like this there's tons of stuff
in CSS that has an implementation you
know in one browser they've just
experimented with it if you spot those
things don't just think oh I can't use
that shame actually write about it and
talk about it because that's how we get
the stuff you know that's how we get new
features into browsers a lot of the time
and it's not just about those things
that exist you don't need to be part of
the CSS working group to influence what
ends up in a CSS spec you know as you
start working with grid you might say
why doesn't it do this so here's an
example one of the things that people
run into when they start working with
grid is you can't yet style like the
backgrounds and borders of grid areas
themselves you have to put an element in
there to style it and very commonly this
comes up people say why can't we do this
or what you need to do is get over to
the CSS working group github repository
and you can raise an issue against the
spec so here's the one for that the
decorative grid sale pseudo elements
because to be able to style a cell or an
area we'd need to actually have some
kind of pseudo element to put into there
to style it so there's a discussion here
where we're sort of working out how that
might work anybody can come and talk on
those discussions or raise your own and
this means that when this comes up for
discussion at the CSS working group
meeting
we can look and we can see what web
developers actually want out of the
feature that's really useful that means
that browser vendors don't really build
websites on all the people who are
making the decisions about this stuff
the voice of the community is also heard
and you can also see there's a tag on
their CSS grid too because this would go
into level two of the specification
level one is it's kind of finished
things do move a little bit slowly with
things like CSS there's an awful lot to
think about
but you can rest assured that we do
discuss the stuff that is raised by web
developers you know at meetings as that
thing comes up so you know do get
involved comment on those issues and
raise bugs against browsers vote on
features when you can write about them
this stuff is being listened to it's
certainly saying that I try and do at
the CSS working group is try and get a
bit of information from the community as
to what you're interested in are
typically I'm doing that by talking to
people of conferences and also just
searching the web reading people's blog
posts and so on so all that said this
year I'm basically celebrating that we
finally got a grid and say I didn't look
like the purveyor of CSS vaporware it's
been really great to see it out there a
lot of sites are now seeing 70 to 80
percent of grid support if you're
starting to build a website today then
really you know you should be looking at
whether grid solves some of the problems
you've got you know and do look at your
browser statistics and make those
decisions for yourself because we think
how long a website sticks around
actually starting to build with grid now
you know makes a lot of sense if all of
this stuff was totally new to you and
you're now completely baffled
I've made some resources lots are not
just have a grid by example including a
full video tutorial
I wrote the guides for mdn the missour
developer network is fantastic they've
got loads of stuff on there there's
lotsa stuff on my blog I'm also
collecting interoperability issues on
grid bugs there's not actually that many
as I mentioned those we are finding I
want to collect them so we can get them
raised of browsers and get them fixed
and if you're interested in layout I
have a new book it's book number 22 for
me
with a book afire in October which is
all about layout using grid alongside
all of these other layout methods and
the slides and resources can be
found here thank you very much for
listening enjoy the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
