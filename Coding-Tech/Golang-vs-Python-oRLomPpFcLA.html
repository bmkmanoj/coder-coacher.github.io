working on so Ned in Auckland and I have
spent a couple of months learning the
golang and I want to share my experience
let's start it so just I want to mention
that go and go out is the same thing and
I believe Galang was created for the
sake of googling cause it's really hard
to Google about go when you just have to
use go especially now when one famous
game was introduced so no Google I'm not
googling about how to catch back him up
pokemons I just want to know about the
programming language so I will go it go
through all this presentation though
there is going on the name of the
presentation
preface so I Python developers since
2010 and I have experienced with the sea
and assembly in the past
I tried C sharp and C++ and I wasn't
really happy with that and as every good
developer I want to have different
languages on my arsenal so I would kind
of have a to chain to so the different
problems and I was thinking about which
language I should learn next here what
was in my mind it was Java because Java
is quite profitable and quite popular
language but when I was looking at the
book and documentation I realized that
it's probably not - I will I will spend
some time to pick up it and it's a bit
obscure when you look at the code and it
scares me a bit so functional languages
functional language is a quite popular
now even cats want to learn it and if
you if you started in the functional
language I believe you probably will be
even God as some programming skills
which help you to structure your code
your existing non-functional better and
with functional languages you can easily
move to the programming scientist side
but I wasn't really sure if I'm ready to
from web development what I was doing
currently to the scientific data science
machine learning which is actually
amazing but don't really so how I can
use the functional language in my
day-to-day web development so go I
started to read about it and I really I
saw that creators of go is Mike Robert
Griesemer and Ken Thompson which you
probably know they was working on a
different stuff on the operation system
like the UNIX printer plan 9 C++ and C
and B languages they was working in at
Bell Labs for some time but end up all
together on a Google company and
programming on C++ and they get
frustrated with a C++ future bloating
like for every task C++ seems to have a
different feature and there are also
features and programming languages
became so complicated so every
programmer have his own set of features
to learn to use and they have a big
really complex programs than Google so
they like compiled for hours and legends
say that at one time during the
compiling especially a big program they
thought like oh why not to write the new
programming language which actually will
compare fast and we don't have to spend
time waiting for that so here's the
points for the go it should be compile
and execute fast should have in court
and simple concurrency should have a
step it should be a static data type and
garbage collected and should have a
simple type system without any to
obscure hierarchy and it's based on C
it's basically look like C you will see
it later in the code and overall it
should be clean and simple code it
should correspond with the modern
computers it should use their ability
their power of multi-core computers and
it's really not about scientific design
and putting in this language a lot of
features it should be really simple and
easier to learn and like you should
start to work with this straightaway and
it reminds me that so I was thinking
okay probably that's the language I want
to learn
so let's look closer go is come is
compiled
unlike Python statically typed unlike
Python and does have curved braces and
like by then so this is the hello word
looks like and go it's a little B it's a
little bit more verbose but still plain
and simple and as you can see it's a
reminded probably reminds about C for
those of you who knows ghost code
structure it's pretty strict you have to
have this structure you have one go path
and you have all your packages on
workspace on the package folder all your
sources on a source folder and all your
compiled beans in a bit folder and rules
say that your program is typically
should have only one workspace and oh oh
this workspace can contain multiple
packages multiple sources and so the
path when you import in the package will
show the whole way not just import
something but import a github and that's
it so you can easily get the package
using this path and this is how it looks
like when you have a lot of sources
that's a little bit frustrating for the
Python developer I think but you can get
used to that and about testing the
testing is not frustrating at all it's
basically looks like Python tests and it
got go got his own test framework and
special comment in a call in a tool
chain which called go test and go
recognize the test if it start from the
capital test and have the test a pointer
to testing T as receiver
pretty much like Python and yes you
should use this comment to run all your
tests dependency management there is
nothing like pip but you can get this
using the comment from go-to chain go
get package and go get update in a new
version a part of the part of this
folders you will have special vendor
folder which will separate the external
packages from your from your own from
your local one and you still can control
the versions of the goal but
unfortunately for now by third-party
tools go code deployment that's fairly
easy in the easiest way you can just
have a binary which is statically type
which you can easily check with every
Linux comment and in simple case you
just can use the go-to chain and go
install and you don't need eggs in peep
running but in real life you probably
want to deploy the configuration file
you want to deploy the assets so as in
Python you can use the turbos deep and
docker
what about syntax probably and learning
is the most important part it was for me
so Python and go are similar and in this
part I want to show you so it's not
frustrated to frustrating to learn go so
as you see have a word it's quite plain
and similar and slices by the way if you
have a problems to see in the code just
yell I can make it bigger slices go
doesn't have lists well it has a race
which is type of this less the the thing
is you have to you have to determine the
type of the list and you have to
determine the length but how can you
even work if you what if you don't know
the length of the lists then you can use
the slices and slices under the hood
it's basically like structure which have
on the pointer to the array
so we have with each slice we have
underlined array which is basically
sliced it's just a part of this array
and we have capacity and we have length
and capacity is not like a length length
is what actually how many how many
elements you have and capacity how many
elements you can extend this slice if
you will use extent comments or append
dictionaries dictionaries are pretty
much like in Python so the only
difference you should have you should
make it with a special comment make and
unfortunately you can't get all keys or
values so you don't have this syntax
sugar you have to iterate through them
while loop so go syntax is quite simple
and while in Python we have a while and
go we actually read showing the same
logic with the for we use for for
infinite loop as well we just not
specify anything and we use for for the
range look as well if statements don't
get me wrong
ago have if statements if else and
everything else and it it does even have
go-to but it does have switched as well
so if you may switches in Python it's
really nice and it has a fault through
thing of what for me was quite
interesting so if you want to hit in the
case one go straight away to the second
case you can yes you can use fall
through so you like hitting two cases at
once but Python ago are different and
here's the thing which can be both
enjoyable and frustrating to learn like
you have to use it so exceptions here's
the Python exceptions and go sorry there
is no exceptions and go there is
something else though different panic
and recover which you can
much make the magnet program act the
same
so differ is the function which differ
is the method which push a function in
stack
like for instance opening the file we
have the same logic when we use with in
Python and after the logic which was in
like under the width will finished you
will have you will have it will close
file for you it worked like clear the
memory and it specifies somewhere in
width
I believe but here you can specify the
differ function and it will it will say
that it will execute after you're done
stuff and if you like wrap your logic in
a different function like specified
before this different function will
execute after this logic was done panic
make panic function make the piece of
logic or the function you doing like and
straight away and it's just go up to the
stack of the your program but you will
you will just like basically how help
the program but if you want to control
it like not just how it with some kind
of ugly error you can use the recover
and recover is the function which
returns the literature returns you there
power to manipulate your piece of code
which you just halted
so it's basically you can make it look
like try except finally using these
three functions no exceptions but in a
simple way you can check errors state as
well so the thing is the methods a
function returns actually two variables
it's actually the result which is f and
error if it if it if it happened so if
ever happened you have to do is
something if not you just want to go
further and I read that some people
complaining that and for some people
frustrating and well I'm not lying here
for me it was frustrating to at the
first time I have to check every time if
my role is new if not but then if you're
doing that it would try accept is it is
it the same thing like basically the
more text it's just a bit different text
object oriented programming that's the
thing I really like goal doesn't have
something called object or class it
doesn't have self this inheritance types
hierarchy no exclusive the relationships
between the other interfaces and no
method overloading and when I was
reading about this for the first time I
was like mmm
just another functional language not
really it's just a bit different so in
Python as you can see you can have a
class person you can have a class
attendee which inherit the class person
and have access to all the class person
data and have his own method say hello
about which we'll do with the data on a
person by inheritance in go you will
have struct person with the early data
on it you will have struct attendee
which have its own duress topic and and
you can include the person so you're not
really required that they that attendee
is inherit from person you just include
this on it
and there will be function hello which
will receive which have receiver a
struct attendee and function about so
they kind of all separate pieces you
just compose them how you want to and
this is the main principle principle of
the goal that the composition over
implementation and this is how it looks
like in the code understand that's a
quite a big piece so let's go through it
so this is this trucks with the data
name city company topic and person
included you define the data structure
then you define the function and pay
attention this is a 10 G as a receiver
when I say receiver you probably want to
think is the argument it's just a go
terminology and in the main function you
still can use the data from the person
we
cause you have this person included on
the attendee so it's everything fine to
the guy being attendants to be able to
say hi and about so but I should mention
that any type of the goal can have that
his own methods not on this tract but
it's really uncommon to have to any
method to have the methods not only
strides but you can do it and you can
add methods of for a type which is only
exists in this package but you can avoid
this rule using anonymous fields so
you're not really including on your
struck like instance of this say of the
type of the different package it is
including like some anonymous kind of
thing through through which you can
actually enter to this to this type data
mm-hmm
yeah this is a composition of
implementation make your room I was
hoping to make you remember that from
with the animation and there is actually
more you can so let's imagine that it's
our struct person have say hi and about
methods and there is struct attendee
instruct listener which have their own
data and person included and listener
have own method young and drug person
have say hi and attendee say hi so which
method will be will be like more which
method will be executed when you will
call it from attendee so here's the
thing the outer methods have a bigger
privilege than the inner methods I
covered in a coda say hi inner method
because person is kind inside the
attendee and here how it will look at
the code and this is the function pay
attention that I define say hi to times
and once the receiver was it's a person
and other it was attending so in the
main program
the attendee Norman when he will he will
say hi he will actually mention his talk
his topic because he has it and that
previous say hi has it as well so yeah
it's it's a bit like methods overloading
isn't it interfaces so we want to
organize our of methods a bit and say we
have a interface as a set of methods and
def interface have say hi and about and
listener interface have say hi about and
young like something new and as we
remember the structure changes tracked
listener a struct person was having a
person included so they have these
methods and the interface type def can
be applied to them but only listener
have the Yuen method so listener
interface can be applied only to listen
or struct and here's the thing actually
you can interface is not only the set of
methods it's actually the type and you
can assign this type to any variable
which have this set of methods which
this interface have so here sorry so
here the John Dylan and Steve because
they all have the person are included
and they all have a def interface
corresponding to them say hi in a bar I
can actually declare the slice of this
interface and put all this oldest trucks
on this slide and iterate through them
which is looks looks a bit like generics
and duck typing here's the thing logo is
like have a strict type language you
could duck type with the interfaces
because it has empty interfaces the m2
interface doesn't contain any single
method since so we actually can declare
anything by this empty interface because
it will implement all 0 its methods for
instance you can actually you can
make interfaces receiver two methods as
argument and this behavior usually used
for the storing struts or methods inside
not really for behavior changing and for
instance you can use interfaces to
functions reloading for standard
function rewarding as I said there is a
say let's remove the standard print
print method it's probably when I was
reading about this first I was thinking
like oh is it looks about
monkey-patching not at all you can
actually like inherit this like inherit
and other write it a bit I will explain
that print F have a stringer interface
and this interface have a string method
inside so I make the string method on
person which have received a person and
because person have a string method and
interface stringer has this method to
they can both apply for the interface of
printing and that's why I can actually
mark it and modify the function and make
this person print it like this not just
like John 29 years but use this funny
special effects on it mmm
concurrency concurrency is like the most
acclaimed the most powerful feature of
go and I can understand why when I was
introduced into this future and reading
about this I I couldn't find myself that
I don't really see the difference
between concurrency and parallelism
I was thinking quite the same thing I
was thinking it's all about the doing
stuff paralleling so parallelism is a
def and definitely doing many things at
once but the concurrency is about
dealing with lots of thin advanced like
scheduling right so in go concurrency is
really easy to use because you can turn
like a simple simple function in a
concurrent one just with two letters so
this here we've go say hello you
actually initialize go
routine and it's nothing changed and
it's quite simple because I was dealing
with a concurrency in Python and there
is so many ways especially nowadays it's
like I think your stack lives by then
just classic method with Reds and it's
it was a bit every element to learn but
in go it's just one way in quite simple
ones and the cool thing in concurrency
is goroutines and channels and go
routines a kind of greenish and white
wait my thread and you will avoid the
login hell because you shouldn't think
about sharing memory like a lot you
shouldn't think about what lock now and
what make wait or something it go will
make it for you and can carry coda looks
as I mentioned before quite the same as
a usual once so for instance and with
the channel switch actually like a
bridge between go routines it could be
it could have certain load capacity it
could not it depends which channel you
use buffered or not so this is the
example of using channels and as you can
see it's quite simple and you can
specify even strongly having one
direction of channel like only receiving
or only sending which is quite useful
sometimes and make your program simpler
and the feeling synchronization like
both sender and receiver should be ready
when logic is happening otherwise they
will wait until they are and the real
life example is generators yes you have
to write your own using the concurrency
and go there is no such a thing as
generators like in Python unfortunately
but well you can do it and as you can
see the the main trick here that you can
actually pass the channel to the
function and that make all the logic
work and here's the thing sometimes you
don't really want your program like to
stock and wait while
suburban channel will be free you want
to do something in a meanwhile and here
you go the selects which actually which
K this each case will execute if see one
is ready and c2 or c2 is ready if they
both already at the same time it will
just pick the random but if they're not
really at all you will just fall to the
fold and do your default logic meanwhile
yes and here is the example example of
executing this program differ differ is
actually quite the same as explained
before it commonly used for cleanup and
as I will remind you now it will execute
the functions which you put an on stuck
after your mind logic or happened so you
don't have to really worry about this
and you can put any logic on the fire
function yep so what have you two or
what have you choose or have to have you
choose anything or like have I ended up
like oh my god god is amazing I will
stick with that and teach the Python oh
no not really I don't think you have to
choose and I I think you should have
both and that's what I was going for
they both have benefits this is what I
really like and go I really like how
object-oriented programming the
structure it reminds me the leg a
computer sorry the leg a constructor and
it's really neat and nice and clear go
actually teach you to make your code
really simple and understand it's it's
easy to pick up it's easy to understand
and yeah I like the deflection it makes
everything plain but it's just for me I
don't really like try except finally
thing but it's not because it's bad I
just don't really like it and I really
like to chain especially go FMT you
can't really have a different styles and
go because if you run go affinity it
will style the code for you and in the
right way and there is a certain strict
rules like you don't have to change
argue about the Egyptian braces it
always just one way and it's easy to
pick up and really fast to learn and
yes I really like concurrency it's not
frustrated there at all but some things
I really miss from the Python lots of
syntax sugar I really miss it like list
and dictionary handling you can you can
extend it you can append it you can't
just append it and go and fortunately
you don't have to care about capacity
you don't have to think that this vice
is just have underlying array and I have
to do something with that and you have
dot keys you have values python is less
verbose again look simpler no brackets
no semicolons but it's like tasting and
yes I miss duck typing though probably
it will prevent you from making your
work from the first time if you're not
really experienced so introducing go in
Python you can actually mix this too
because Python can talk to see and go
can talk to see well go can talk to
Python there is a third-party libraries
I was listening to talk about the rust
and the first thing I was awesome in
rust that you can easily embed the rust
code in Python and easily code that
unfortunately that it's not that easy
and gold language you have to use go
third-party packages but then they not
really up-to-date and it doesn't have
the co-routines conversion and there is
a the memory sharing is not really
advised to use yeah this is how it works
for nerds if you want to see details
yeah I probably won't do that because
embedding go in Python is quite immature
but when I was just started to learn it
I was so excited I was thinking okay I
will now write super fast web crawler no
I favorite so the further reading I not
only kick including the official Docs
which is really easy
- real and plain and you can find
basically everything there and even the
good things is a goal playground which
is basically like a fiddle you can put
your code you can change it you can play
with that and do without any IDE but I
included the talks I really enjoy and
which helped me to understand the goal
better and some articles - so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
