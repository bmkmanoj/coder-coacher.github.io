engineering manager at Twitter and I've
spent the bulk of my engineering career
as a full stack web developer but now as
a manager of internal web tools teams I
have the pleasure of coaching many full
stack web developers this is a question
that I recently posted on Twitter what
made you want to be a leader on your
team I asked people on Twitter and I
would like to know before I show you
what my favorite response was how many
people here are interested in being a
leader leader manager types a few all
right if you raise your hand you've
probably given some thought to
leadership skills and you might even be
currently pursuing a leadership role but
here's the answer that my friend Taylor
gave I didn't want to lead but nobody
else is doing it and this really
resonated with me and I imagine it
resonates with some of you because a lot
of times leadership happens you get
thrust into a role that you never really
asked to do and then you might find
yourself not equipped with the skills
that you need to do it so this talk is
actually for those of you who didn't
raise your hand it's for engineers who
find themselves kind of needing to shore
up some things that turn out to be
leadership skills so when I have
one-on-ones with engineers I hear people
wanting these things they want
recognition compensation promotion
respect influence and to help other
people but they really struggle with how
to do some of these things especially as
they get into the higher leadership
roles like tech lead or staff engineer
so generally those people are really
focused on technical skills and so I
find myself coaching people to equip
them with the tools and the strategies
that are leadership related okay
so now I want you to get out your phones
laptops whatever you have handy and go
to this URL pull evie comm slash ICD
team which has nothing to do with this
talk so it's just that it's my friends
pulling a
count anyway so go to that URL please
and if you could start entering what is
challenging for you about being or
becoming a leader on an engineering team
I'll give you like a minute and we'll
kind of see what develops here in this
word cloud so far contribution
developers balancing oh no disconnected
what that's no fun
mmm suppose if I oh wait oh there we go
hey it's so curious to see what you guys
put all right I see mentoring I see
trust people consensus skills time
technical skills time is getting bigger
people oh my god how you deal with these
people these people in code are kind of
different awesome this is right so
here's what I did I wanted to come up
with the top leadership skills that we
need that we find that we need and I
didn't want to just pluck them out of my
head I wanted to pull out some data so I
had access to a survey of over a hundred
senior software engineers so I pulled
all the there were basically five
questions that I boiled down and I chose
three and took the columns in the survey
responses dump them into text files and
I use a little Python library has
anybody use word cloud it's really fun
it's easy
so we're cloud is a Python library that
makes our clouds sure super fun and so I
cloned it and had those text files are
ready to go and this is like I barely
had to modify the example file I just
added some stop words I didn't want to
get things like team and leader and
stuff like that I wanted to extract that
out and then it just generates these
awesome word clouds so I'm going to show
you three the first one is
worst qualities because a lot of what we
learn about leadership is from people
who do it wrong and so what we see in
this word cloud is not giving good
feedback lack of empathy lack of
communication lack of trust and
confidence micromanaging arrogance lack
of technical ability that's really big
that inability there and oriented to who
self it was lack of orientation others
and more oriented toward self so then
the next question I analyzed was what
are the best qualities of people's
favorite leaders and we see some of the
opposites right we see empathy care
listening trust there's feedback and
humility and honesty and technical
ability is really big we want our
technical leaders to be competent and
oriented to who others finally I asked I
saw the question that was very similar
to one I asked you here today and we'll
see if there are some similarities here
so what people really struggle with and
those things look like they were
emerging to be time management having
those right technical skills that
ability giving feedback because it came
up all the way through communication and
developing trust so many of these skills
appear on purely technical engineering
promotion ladders that's the thing right
you don't have to be being beyond the
manager track when you're looking at
those higher levels of being a tech lead
people are starting to expect you to
lead and so you can only get to a
certain level if you don't start to pick
up these skills and learn how to work
with others so now I'm going to fly
through the top five and it's just a
high-level touch point on all of these
things because I have 25 minutes with
you all I'm hoping you can kind of take
these ideas and go do your research read
some of these books and see what you
where you get to so the first one is
communication here we're going to talk
about written communication and so first
we're going to think about emails and
technical Docs I'm going to show
this email and if you can read it I hope
it's big enough basically this is email
to me from Sam fictitious dude named Sam
and the subject is doc and Sam's telling
me that Claire is concerned about the
schedule and there's some stuff about
the time and we're maybe gonna have to
change the widget service and move it in
relationship to the loader and there's
just a lot of information and then
there's an attachment anybody have any
thoughts about what's not great about
this email no call to action what else
that's awesome yes what's that the
subject is useless I don't know about
you I get a thousand emails I run four
teams that'll have different
stakeholders and different projects and
if I got this email like oh my gosh I
have no idea what it is and even when I
read the email I'm not really sure which
of these four projects and which person
I don't know we're talking about there's
a lot of words in here like oh my gosh
what am I supposed to do no idea I'm
probably not gonna do anything is the
thing and Sam's not gonna get what he
needs so I'm gonna break this out into
two ideas one is gonna be I just think
this email could be one idea and then
there's a technical problem he's
discussing discussing could be another
idea so let's take just the email what
if you look like this what if we could
say that the subject was the image
cropping feature requirements and what
if we could say that there's a draft of
the product requirements dock for the
image cropping feature there's the
context and that I need that he needs
comments and questions and he needs them
when but hinted the day Thursday no I
know what I'm supposed to do and now
there's actually chance I might do it
and give some what he needs
so in K in the term in terms of the
wordy technical explanations how about a
diagram wouldn't it be great if we could
show the current state of the widget
service which is at the end and the
proposed solution which is to put it at
the beginning and I can understand that
instantaneously from a picture like this
which might be a design doc and then
also I get some other information and a
list which is really easy to
parce instead of that big blob of
paragraph' uh you know who authored it
who the reviewers are what the estimate
of time is so it's easy to scan it's
easy to understand so I give you a
communications checklist emails Docs
some things to think about so who's your
audience is a non-technical person a
colleague a junior engineer that'll help
you understand how much detail to go
into I find engineers going way too far
into technical detail with customers who
don't care what about the context does
the audience have the necessary context
doc what doc for who for when I don't
know anything about what you're talking
about assume I know nothing what is the
intent what do you want the person to
know what's that call to action and what
do you want them to do and when do you
want them to do it
length TLDR too long didn't read that's
all of us all of the time so can you say
more with fewer words can use bullets
bolds lists make it skinnable skimmable
or scalable scannable and then how about
visuals oh my gosh please add a visual I
find myself like draw it on a whiteboard
in the meeting or please draw it in a
visual on the dock don't use all those
words and have a customer service or
teamwork attitude - that really helps it
just if you react with customers in a
way that says we're all in the same team
we're gonna figure this out together
it really makes a big difference okay
and then I'm only gonna say one thing
about code review don't be a jerk right
you just follow that one rule and code
review instead of saying this is wrong
this is stupid you shouldn't do it that
way why don't we just say things like
you might want to consider this
framework or have you checked out these
Docs or this is the preferred syntax
using language that's not so corrective
and not putting people down because I
find that the more we put people down
and make them feel stupid the more they
close up the less they ask questions and
the more mistakes and problems they have
all right we're moving on to time
because time is a big thing that comes
up for people and we're going to talk
about estimation and we're into
about time management so first time
management almost every single person on
my team that gets more responsibility
says I don't know how to manage my time
and it comes down to ruthless
prioritization you can't do all the
things and we hear that and we know that
but we still try to do all the things so
we have to choose the things that we're
not going to do and so that's about
saying no which is a little bit of a
practice practicing disappointing people
practicing saying no to things figuring
out what to say no to choosing like okay
this is not important for today I'm
gonna do the thing that's really
important today and I'm gonna worry
about that tomorrow and also what to say
yes to just being really deliberate the
book essentialism says more than I ever
could in this talk I really highly
recommend it I think I'll probably read
it again soon it was good enough I want
to go back to it so I recommend that I
have another question for you all phones
laptops this is about estimation of time
and I'd like you to try to guess and
maybe you know some people who contract
or might have a better a sense of this
how much time do you think you spend
doing heads down coding and development
like actually coding or designing the
thing you're about to code and just just
that activity not testing not building
not messing with your environment not
setting up your sublime packages cool
we're coming in around 25 to 24 kids are
pessimists that's pretty low mm-hmm
where does F work
yeah okay so you guys are coming up at
20 to 25% so there was a survey of in
2013 of by a software development
services vendor called electric cloud
and they surveyed over 400 people
software engineers and these are the
estimates that they got from the survey
so they found that people said they were
spending six point seven hours
brainstorming and collaborating per week
five point eight hours doing emails and
meetings three point seven hours waiting
for tests right we have a puzzle area in
my office
so people bring their laptops over when
they're running tests are doing builds
and they like pull into the puzzle and
wait for the you know how that is right
so there's another three point five for
the builds and then two points to have
an environment management right like new
OS you've gotta upgrade new packages
what have you so that's a grand total of
twenty two point four hours out of a
forty one point five hour a week just
for administrative stuff not doing
actual coding so you guys were really
pessimistic this comes out to forty six
percent of time is actually spent doing
design and coding which means that when
we estimate things it's gonna take twice
as long as you think it's going to take
and that's if you really know what it is
right there's a whole nother issue so if
you really know what the task is and
you're pretty good at assessing like
okay I've got to build this module and I
think it's gonna take me four hours it's
gonna take you eight hours the other
piece of it is really knowing how to
estimate when you don't really know what
something is going to be and that comes
down to breaking things down into
smaller pieces and understanding all the
different parts of a task writing very
detailed technical design dog to help us
do that a lot better and agile t-shirt
sizing we don't ever ask any engineer to
give us an hour estimate for things this
is more of a theoretical idea of it's
going to take twice as long as what you
think and I buy
that I need sighs so we do agile t-shirt
sizes at work we say it's either small
medium large extra-large we use
Fibonacci numbers to assign points and
then we kind of get a sense of how many
points people can generally do so the
more we do this the better we get at
kind of estimating at the front the tech
leads are the ones who are often trying
to do this estimation the better we can
be at setting out customer expectations
and the better we the better tech leads
are at leading so what about feedback
feedback is very it's a very challenging
thing and again as we're talking about
people who are more senior they're
starting to have to give their teammates
more feedback and they're having to give
them critical insights into what other
people could be doing better so whose
job is it to give feedback it's not just
the manager's job so it's just my job
I'm always telling my team like I need
you guys you guys observe each other and
you work with each other in ways that I
can't even see or view and you need to
be honest and help each other get better
because otherwise it's Bob who's like
what I got fired and no one told me that
thing I was doing wrong and now I have
no job because I had a chance to get
better and nobody told me how I could so
you want to be that person who can give
people feedback that they need to get
better my best advice for this is to use
this this concept from radical candor
there's a book by Kim Scott I have a
picture of it later her way of thinking
about feedback is there's these two axes
one is to care personally and the other
one is to challenge directly so if you
care a lot about somebody and you never
give them any good feedback you're
getting into this ruinous empathy area
where they learn they're never gonna get
better and they kind of get ruined they
don't grow and if you're a total asshole
that's the challenge directly but don't
care at all then you fall into this
obnoxious aggression area and nobody
likes working with that person so you
want to hit that combination of I care
about you I'm gonna give you this
feedback because I want you to grow
because I like you because I want you to
succeed not because I want to cut you
down
and give you bad news and make you feel
bad about yourself right so you can get
more information about that from radical
candor calm the other feedback mechanism
that's been really helpful for me is
this SBI framework I use this at home
with my kids and use it at work and the
breakdown is basically describe the
exact situation that you were going to
tell somebody some feedback for and then
talk about the exact behavior you
observed the words they use the scenario
you know exactly what they did the way
they looked the way they touched someone
or I don't know what the problem is
right and the impact was the impact that
it had you know so here's where we were
here's what you did and here's what the
effect was so the example would be at
yesterday's meeting you interrupted me
several times when I was sharing my
design with the customer and the impact
is that I wasn't able to effectively
share my designs and I think now the
customer is not going to have faith in
me we're in us or our team so that gives
a person something to work with they
know exactly the words they use they can
think about this scenario and remember
what they said and think okay how would
I do that in the future really really
super helpful I use this all the time
some more information there's a radical
candor book and then difficult
conversations because it's not just that
how you give the feedback but it's also
like it gives lots and lots of examples
of what types of difficult conversations
you might need to have with people these
are very helpful resources all right
then we get into the area of building
trust sometimes we think about this as
soft skills so this is about empowering
other people so I would say that the
more you take on leadership roles the
last thing you should be worrying about
is yourself I know as a manager one
engineer on my team is valuable to me
but the engineer who can empower and
multiply five other people is five times
more valuable to me and the way they do
that is they teach they listen they
coach they give credits
and they solicit ideas from everyone and
everyone gets better so this is that
others very other focused is something
we need to be more and more as leaders
and in order to be focused on others we
need to listen to them so some ideas
around active listening again people
tend to think managers are the only ones
who should have one-on-ones with people
I really encourage my team my tech leads
to have one-on-ones with people too
because then they can I what I noticed
is that when a tech lead has a
one-on-one with a junior engineer the
junior engineer feels safe to kind of be
like I'm really struggling with this
thing and I don't know what to do and
they can get some of the advice that
they need it's easier to do that in that
small context than like in a big meeting
or something like that
so it can be coffee can be lunch it can
be meeting whatever works
and in those one-on-ones to give people
our full undivided attention with eye
contact and no distractions and no
phones and really asking the person
questions and being curious about them
and what they want to learn and how they
want to grow paraphrasing back what you
think you hear I have one very wordy
person who gives me lots of information
and it's hard for me to understand
exactly what he's getting at so I write
I just come back with like it sounds
like you're frustrated with that and
sometimes he'll say no no I just want I
just wanted you to know I'm not
frustrated I just wanted you to know
okay or it sounds like you're upset
you're mad you're angry and you know we
can kind of get to what is the actual
thing you're trying to convey to me
because sometimes it's hard to
understand what someone really means
when I paraphrase back I know if I'm if
I'm understanding them properly
and I would like you to try this at
dinner tonight it'll challenge you to
when you go out afterwards and you meet
some people at your table and you get
their name and you find out where they
work and maybe hear about a project that
they work on and then you go home or to
your hotel room can you remember the
stories that you heard if you can't
remember a single person's name that you
met you need to be doing a better job
listening here's a book about listening
and crucial conversations it's a
different type of conversation book but
again like how do you really engage with
people how do you really
coach them connect with them and so
finally let's talk a little bit about
increasing your technical competence so
you can have all these things you can be
a great leader you can have great soft
skills vision and communication and time
management but if you're not technically
competent people are not going to follow
you and you might have a hard time
understanding the challenges that your
engineers are facing so and you're also
expected to see some red flags in
architecture and decision making so you
do need to have this technical
competence right so usually what we
think about is and we think more about
this so expanding your skill set
especially for juniors out there care
program as much as you possibly can with
anybody who will pair with you you will
learn so much so fast I try to get
people to validate their approaches I
think there can be a lot of pressure
especially as you're more experienced to
have all the answers and just have it
all inside your head and know how to
build everything but even the more
senior people can validate approaches
with everyone on the team and learn new
things through that process or even with
other teams sometimes one senior
engineer on this team will validate
their pitch with another senior engineer
on another team and that works really
well too you're here you're attending a
conference yeah you're expanding your
skill set right now you're reading
articles probably and anytime you can
apply a higher level design pattern or
framework or that first principle
thinking to your problem instead of
taking the problem by itself and trying
to problem solve it thinking about it in
the larger span of things like design
patterns and maybe programming design
Theory seven languages in seven weeks
doing that sort of an exercise can help
you kind of see the strengths of various
different languages and maybe even think
about you know what we saw earlier like
combining Fortran and C and Python to
see you know which one is best at what
and maybe even taking some ideas from
the way Fortran is good at loops and
maybe you can build that into or pull in
libraries and other languages that will
help so those are you know technical
resources but also I find the getting
to the why of the reason we're building
the thing in the first place is not the
thing that a lot of people think about
so there's one mechanism called five
why's I included the link here from Six
Sigma it's all about how do you get back
to the root cause and the example they
give is there's a car someone's got
their car in that it broke down by the
side of the road and why did it break
down that's the first why the alternator
broke well why did the alternator break
because it hadn't been maintained well I
hadn't it been maintained well because I
didn't know I was supposed to maintain
it and then the moral of the story is
that drivers need to understand a
maintenance program and they need to be
taking their cars in every six months
and then that will avoid the broken-down
car on the side of the road but it's
just this idea of like how do you get to
the root cause of a problem or how do
you get to the root reason why we're
building the thing another resource I
really like is the start with why Simon
snik TED talk he talks about Apple and
why Apple products are you know they're
doing pretty well I got one right here I
got one right here I got one right here
and they build products about why you
know they start with the why instead of
that what products were gonna build he
does a better job explaining it than I
can and once you understand the why of
what we're building we're not just gonna
ship a thing we're gonna try to move a
needle we're gonna try to make it impact
on our company or on our team or on our
business then you can get to the purpose
and then you can get to the how we're
gonna build it and all the details of
that so these are the skills we talked
about I would like you to choose one of
these skills because you're gonna have
to ruthlessly prioritize pick one of
these skills to try to work on this week
maybe using some of the resources that I
shared we just scratched the surface but
hopefully this gives you some starting
points and just remember leadership is
not just for managers it's about
influencing and directing others for
positive impacts or positive outcomes
and high impact so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
