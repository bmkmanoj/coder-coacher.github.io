problems we just can't solve today even
using our biggest classical
supercomputers take for an example
accurately simulating the bonding and
large molecules it sounds like we should
be able to do this but the computation
required for the job grows exponentially
the bigger the molecule you're trying to
simulate that's because to do this
properly you have to account for the
effect of every single electron on every
other electron the more electrons you
have the exponentially more computation
is required in the fact that there are
problems we can't solve today is why
exploring fundamentally new ways of
doing computation might open up new
doors so enter quantum computing
let me summarize it as follows quantum
computing is a technology that encodes
information into complex quantum states
it uses operations performed on those
states to process the information and it
uses a measurement of the final state to
record a result seems simple enough
actually no it's still pretty
complicated and it's an
interdisciplinary problem and even just
the theory alone is interdisciplinary
it's built on a foundation of the
physics of quantum mechanics and quantum
information and it's written in the
language of linear algebra which we use
to represent a quantum state and how it
transforms throughout an algorithm and
we weave in computer science to
translate the theory into executable
commands that we can run on a machine an
experimental quantum computing is
interdisciplinary - we're building real
systems that can implement the theory
meaning real devices that behave like
qubits or quantum bits with quantum
properties that can be manipulated
this requires physics material science
and device fabrication expertise and we
need to be able to control the qubits
which requires microwave signal
processing and electrical and controls
engineering and we need to cool these
chips down to 15 milli Kelvin or 460
degrees below zero Fahrenheit which
requires advanced Frey Oh Jen --ax my
point is that quantum computing is not
just a game for physicists and building
it into a scalable technology is gonna
require breakthroughs across a whole
range of STEM disciplines and it's gonna
require that we fundamentally change the
way we think my friend and colleague Jay
Gambetta leads our quantum theory and
software teams in IBM q and I've often
heard him say to people including me
you're thinking to classically what he
means by that is that
you're trying to apply linear classical
logical thinking to understand something
quantum and it doesn't work and he said
this phrase enough times but it's become
a mantra and a sticker that adorns all
of our laptops you're thinking to
classically hashtag IBM Q and as funny
as it is thinking to classically is a
real problem that hinders progress so
how do we get people to change the way
they think well we start in the
classroom when Einstein first discovered
relativity I'm sure nobody intuitively
got it and understood why was important
and today it's in every modern physics
classroom in the world within five years
the same thing will happen with quantum
computing
not only will physics departments offer
quantum information classes but computer
science departments will offer a quantum
tract electrical engineering departments
will teach students about quantum
circuits and microwaves signal
processing and chemistry classes will
teach students not only how to simulate
molecules on a classical machine but
also on a quantum computer I did my
undergrad degree at MIT and I majored in
material science and I remember that the
class that really inspired me the most
and made me want to pursue a career in
this field was 315 electrical optical
and magnetic materials and devices it
taught me about every device of
technological importance transistors
lasers LEDs magnetic hard drives you
name it what is it made of and how does
it work
within five years that class will teach
students about qubits what are they made
of and how do they work and the same
thing will happen across a whole range
of disciplines and these changes will be
enabled by the fact that more and more
teachers will use quantum computers in
the classroom students and teachers will
use quantum computers in the classroom
and they'll have access to tools that we
never had
thanks for the IBM to experience they
can already access quantum computers
today it's a set of three prototype
quantum computers that we've made
available through the cloud with two
different ways of programming them a
graphical interface with drag-and-drop
operations and an open-source software
developer kit called quiz kit today over
1,500 universities around the world have
people with registered accounts on the
IBM Q experience and more and more
universities will join the ranks of
Oxford and ko universities and the
University of Melbourne as hubs in the
IBM Q network to access our more
advanced hardware a few months ago I was
working late one night
changing flat messages with Jay when a
photo popped up in my slack window it
was a photo of Jays nine-year-old
daughter sitting on the couch playing
with the IBM cue experience and it came
with a caption that read she's always
asking to play with the quantum computer
she was nine years old and this photo
really stuck with me because she
represents a generation of up-and-coming
scientists that are going to grow up
without being constrained by thinking
too classically the existence of tools
like the IBM QED experience in quisque
it mean that she will have the resources
and then the community that she needs to
learn about and then shape the field of
quantum information and the fact that
these tools are open and available to
everyone means that she could have been
anyone's son or daughter and that's
pretty cool over the last five talks
you've heard a lot about AI and quantum
computing and the thought I want to
leave you with is that these fields are
not fully independent we believe that
applying AI to the development of
quantum computing will help accelerate
our rate of progress in that field and
we also believe that by developing
universal quantum computers we'll have
new tools that we can use to accelerate
our rate of progress in AI thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
