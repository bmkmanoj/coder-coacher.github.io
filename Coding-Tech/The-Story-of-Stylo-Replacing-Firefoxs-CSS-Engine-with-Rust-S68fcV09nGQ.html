project there's a reason why people keep
talking about Oh something big is coming
into Firefox something big is coming
into rest into Firefox and that's
because Firefox is a really big C++
project it is over nine million lines
just of C++ by itself and then there's
other languages of languages on top of
that and the engine that's written
mostly in C++ we tend refer to as gecko
and gecko has a style system which is a
component I'll explain a little bit
which is by itself about a hundred sixty
thousand lines of C++ code and this is
something that's been around for almost
two decades now and has like evolved
over time and grown larger and larger
and more complex so the new thing stylo
is 85,000 lines of handwritten rest and
that is an important qualifier which
will explore later but this is what is
coming to Firefox in about two weeks
it's gonna be shipping and that's really
exciting it's been a number of years of
effort to get to this point so let's
talk about what a style system actually
is a web browser so a web browser
basically contains a pipeline to get
bytes from the network and then turn
them into something that shows up in
front of you so starts with the HTML
parser and this takes the source code of
an HTML page which contains their HTML
tags and everything as an input and as
an output it turns that into a tree of
what are called Dom nodes and these two
these correspond to those tags
everything inside of a pair of matched
tags becomes an element and everything
or everything inside of that that pair
of match tags becomes children child
nodes of that element
so here the HTML has two children and
each of those children each have one
child by themselves so after that if we
come across any CSS text while parsing
the page will then feed that into the
CSS parser CSS is the language that
allows you to style your page based on
this contents so we might see that there
is there's there's some CSS text that
says oh make all spans turn red but make
any div element that has a header ID
make the text green and so that's the
input and the output of the CSS parser
is what we call a list of style rules
and these are rules that are easier for
the CSS engine to interpret later
without having to parse the text over
and over so the next step we go through
is the Cascade and this is from the name
of CSS that stands for cascading style
sheets that means that for every element
in the tree we will proceed through the
tree and apply these style rules based
on these inputs were given and figure
out what the actual computed styles for
each node should be what color in this
case is each element going to be based
on these rules so we look and say oh we
have received that we have a div with an
ID header so we can apply the style rule
to turn that green and that gets
inherited by all of its children but
that gets overwritten by the span which
says oh I should be red so we take the
result of these computed styles and then
we feed them into the layout component
and that's what takes both your your
tree of nodes and and they're their
actual style information we've computed
and then says okay based on these
computer styles where should we actually
draw boxes what is the size of each box
how does it relate to which children and
parents what how are they aligned
together that layout is what takes all
that information and turns it into
something that you could end up visually
seeing and so the style system when we
talk about it encompasses a number of
these steps it encompasses parsing the
CSX parsing the CSX CSS they also
incorporates the Cascade and turning
everything into a series of computed
styles it also incorporates
introspection so JavaScript is able to
ask your web page what is the computed
style of a particular element and it can
also look into what are the contents of
the style sheets that the browser knows
about furthermore their CSS animations
and the style system is responsible for
processing those at any given time and
figuring out what the values that are
being animated should be and finally
whenever a page is modified then the
style system is responsible for
determining what is the most optimal way
of recomputing all that information
because it turns out it's not actually
very performant if you go and either
rate over the entire tree of all nodes
every single time you make a change to
just one of them so you might ask if we
have this thing which has been working
for decades and Firefox what is it was
the reason we would want to go to all
this effort to replace it and really the
answer is performance performance is a
key driver of all web browsers and
anytime we see something which could be
improved we start to think maybe we
should be improving it
maybe we're just leaving performance on
the table otherwise and the reason why
performance is so key here is that the
Cascade that I talked about it actually
fits the model of what we call an
embarrassingly parallel problem and what
that means is we iterate over each node
in the tree and all we're doing at this
point is just reading some data from the
parent and reading some data from the
style rules that we computed earlier and
reading some data from the actual node
in the tree and then we create something
new based on combining all that
information which means that it should
be possible to distribute that that work
throughout a bunch of different CPUs and
get potentially even linear speed ups
based on the number of CPUs you have so
if you have two CPUs in theory we could
do the Cascade twice as fast if we use
both of them at full capacity if you
have four CPUs we might be able to do it
in a quarter of the time that's a pretty
exciting prospect however as much as it
sounds like you should be a
straightforward a straightforward
operation to perform it turns out that
it is more complicated than that and
there's been two attempts to do this in
Firefox itself in C++ in the past few
years so one was a group of grad
students at UC Irvine and they had an
advisor working at Intel and they
published a paper on their efforts to
measure and and do more of the work in
parallel and it seemed to go really well
except that the resulting code was
difficult to maintain there was a lot of
duplication it was difficult to reason
about and in general it didn't actually
look like the most
thing to spend time on given how many
other parts of Firefox we could be
focusing on
similarly in 2011 we decided to give it
to an intern which surprised me but came
up with a patch and it seemed to be
working but there were these mysterious
crashes they were really difficult to
track down it was hard to debug it was
again hard to maintain and so again it
just languished there because no one
really saw this as a high priority when
it turned out to be more complicated
than people assumed so let's talk about
servo servo is the web browser engine
we've been building since 2012
completely from the ground up in rest
with a couple minor exceptions but in
general we're we're learning we're
taking lessons we've learned from
building browsers over the past decade
no matter Firefox or Chrome or WebKit or
something we're looking at the best
choices made in those browsers and
trying to build something new in rust
that gets the benefits of more modern
hardware in particular we're trying to
build things in parallel from the start
and we have a strong focus on building
things in a very modular fashion and
what this means is that the style system
in servo not only did we build something
in parallel in 2013 but also it exists
in its own crate and it's got strong
trait interfaces and this means that it
is much more feasible to look at
extracting just the style system from
servo and putting it into another
project like Firefox as much more
feasible to contemplate that than it is
to do something like the reverse of
taking something out of Firefox which is
sort of a gargantuan monolithic thing
and try to extract it into something
else
so we started looking into whether this
would be possible in 2015 and that was
our the sort of lead developer of this
project he did a bunch of investigations
he said ok if we make these changes to
these interfaces I can get this very
basic demo styling the Wikipedia page
for Barack Obama and using multiple CPUs
and that'll be great and then there then
he came up with a list of all the
different things we needed to do to make
it actually fit everything the Firefox
could do and so in 2016 that work
happened and the team is been growing
and growing
to get this work done but in order to
ship in two weeks so the actual process
of integrating this code is is
interesting because Firefox exists in a
single monolithic repo all the Firefox
code exists in a mercurial repo and the
servo code exists in a github repository
and has a bunch of different crates and
some of them are important as some of
them are not and servo also chooses to
make use of the crates at i/o ecosystem
it's been really great but what it means
is that for Firefox this is a problem
because Firefox uses continuous
integration servers which don't have any
external network access and that goes
against the model that is traditionally
followed by cargo projects so what
happens is Firefox actually vendor the
entire source code of servo into the
Firefox repository and then also vendor
all of the dependencies of servo into
the Firefox repository which is an
interesting stress test for all sorts of
different systems it turns out and
honestly I wouldn't actually recommend
following this path it I'm glad we did
for servo but it's actually quite a pain
so let's talk about how this actually
fits together there's a crate in the
servo source code called gecko lib and
that contains all of the API is that the
gecko C++ code can invoke in order to
call in to the servo style system
there's a header file called servo
binding list at H in the C++ gecko code
which has equivalent C declarations for
all of those functions because the way
you can do cross language
interaction like this is by pretending
that you have a C function in rest code
and then the C code goes oh I know how
to invoke C code that's great I'll just
be able to color right into that so all
of the API is that can be invoked from
gecko code start with the prefix servo
underscore and the only interesting bit
here is that we don't have any automatic
synchronization here so if you make a
change to the servo API is that are
provided in the rest code and you chain
like you had an argument to something
that means you also need to update this
header file otherwise you can get
surprising program
Savior and sometimes even crashes so as
an example here is the API that the
style system or the the code in gecko
that invokes the style system from servo
calls it says it's called servo Traverse
subtree and it is given a a root node to
start traversing from and it's given
some data that servo needs in order to
do that and some other things which
servo also needs and returns a boolean
which I presume means either the result
is like needs need some more processing
afterwards or is ready to go similarly
then we have the equivalent C
declaration that lives in the header
file for this and it uses types that
that map's the types that the Ross code
receives so everything should just be
passed across this this sort foreign
function interface boundary without
having any problems so on the other hand
it would be nice if we could just
encapsulate all of this new behavior
inside this function you know traverse
subtree and then just have that happen
and when when it comes back it's done
that'd be great however turns out that
Firefox is a bit more complicated than
that and turns out that the rest code
also needs to call back into C++ and
sometimes go back and forth a few times
and that means that we need to declare
API is that the rest code can call
because it knows how to invoke C code as
well so there's another header file
called server bindings which has the C
api's that can be called from rest and
these I'll start with the Gecko
underscore prefix and these on the other
hand are generated by using the program
bind gen or the rest side declarations
are generated by by engine which looks
at a c header file and spits out all the
rest declarations you need in order to
use those types and in call those
functions it's very handy so the C API
for creating an error reporter because
in Firefox a CSS error that gets the or
if there's an error in your CSS code
that gets processed then we want to
notify the developer tools in the
browser about that
so servo doesn't know anything about
Firefox is developer tools it needs to
just have this interface of this error
reporter and it says ok gecko create me
an
reporter I'll be able to use it later
and so there's the C API for doing that
and then similarly there's this rest
declaration that allows servo to
actually invoke this when necessary so
as I said we use bind JNT to avoid any
mistakes it just generates everything
automatically and if you ever update the
C api's or the that gecko provides then
those automatically get reflected into
the rest bindings at Build time which
means that if you add a parameter to the
C ones then you'll get a compile error
in any uses of that API in the rest code
because it says oh there's you know
you're not passing a parameter that's
necessary and that's very convenient you
don't get any crashes or unexpected
behavior that way it's also extremely
slow because we end up processing dozens
or hundreds of header files and it's
extremely easy to make a change to a
header file which doesn't actually
matter to rest but is transitively
included by something and then that you
have to run this whole Banton process
again so that's a bit of a frustration
for us so there's sort of two main ways
that you can focus on doing your cross
language interaction you can either
encapsulate these these operations
behind functions or you can dive
directly into the types and manipulate
them like manipulate C types from the
rest code or rest types from the C code
either one is possible but it turns out
that there's a bit of a trade-off either
way that usually revolves around
performance versus safety so it turns
out that every time you call a function
in general if you're calling like a rest
function from rest code the compiler
says oh I know what that function is I
can see how big it is it would probably
make sense just to inline that code
directly rather than going through the
process of performing a call pushing
things onto the stack
jumping returning back all these things
that usually happen and that's fine but
every time you do a cross language
function call the compiler doesn't know
anything about that
and can't avoid this that means that if
you're going back and forth between
languages during code that is
performance sensitive than the
can be a problem I mean the benefit of
using a function is that if you have in
very very insalata was doing around what
do types are supposed to be doing
you can assert those you can have safety
checks and that is very helpful so
there's a bit of a trade-off there so as
an example of this there's there's one
piece in in stylo where we need to talk
to gecko to say okay this particular
thing we need to make sure it is marked
as being an image element and there's
too much involved there for us to really
do that from the rest code so it's just
a simple function call to one of these C
api's that were declared earlier and the
actual gecko definition first asserts
that you're actually passing a valid
image and secondly then invokes a method
C++ method on that type and does
something funky with reference counting
related to the kind of or the name of
the the element that you're interacting
with this is all stuff that is much
easier to just push on to the Gecko side
rather than try to replicate that into
the rest side so on the other hand if
you're using types then you have the
option to just dive directly into the
memory and start modifying things and
there's no performance penalty for this
it's just it's just a memory you have
pointers to it you can reach in and set
things or read things and it's up to you
to make sure that you're actually
following the model and not breaking the
system
I think the downside here is that if you
do have rules around what's allowed and
what isn't suddenly that logic is now
distributed between by two completely
separate files and two different source
trees and that that might not be a good
trade-off but for performance sensitive
code maybe that's what you want an
example where we do this I particularly
like that like there's this comment that
explains what properties of the model
that we're relying on I'm in order to do
this mucking around inside a C type from
the rest code in this case we have a
pointer to a C type and we're getting a
mutable pointer to a field inside an
array that's stored inside that type and
then setting a particular field of of
that sub field to another rest value
that the
c-code will eventually understand when
when it gets back there so we actually
did something interesting with dealing
with these with these types between
languages so by Amgen we'll typically
just give you declarations which involve
raw pointers everywhere and that's fine
you know raw pointers are thing that
you're used to using in C for example
and it's not that bad to go back to
using them in rest but we did something
where we started naming or creating
these types in in rust which wrap raw
pointers but they have particular extra
meaning associated with them so for
example we created this the so generic
type called owned which represents a a
raw pointer that was originally created
from a value like a box in rust and so
the idea here is we create this value in
rust as a box and then we turn it into
this own value and then pass it over to
the C++ code and it gets moved around it
gets stored places and eventually it
comes back to rest in the form of a
known value and we say okay we know that
it is owned therefore we can turn it
back into a box and it'll be
de-allocated safely and properly and we
have this idea of ownership that
persists across the language barrier
even though C++ does not have the same
kind of ownership model as rust does so
by I'm Jen does this for us
automatically we have a list of types
that we'll just see the C++ type for
example raw Sphero style set owned
you'll say okay I know that I need to
turn this into this actual more complex
rust type which is the same under the
hood so in C++ it's just a raw planer
but it has the same name and we have a
function which is declared from rest
which says oh I accept this raw servo
style set owned wares on the rest side
we say okay it's not just a raw planer
it is actually this type called owned
that specializes on this underlying raw
pointer and in the actual definition of
servo style set drop we accept this
owned value and then turn it into a box
which will be de-allocated because we
know what's going on here and we do the
same for other interesting types so we
have types that have borrowed attached
to the name and bind and we'll turn
those into
traditional rest references for us and
similarly borrowed or null which will be
a raw pointer which might be null we
then turned into an option value around
a rust reference which gives us much
nicer ergonomics and prevents us
accidentally dereferencing null pointers
so let's talk about this parallel style
system stuff we built it back in 2013 it
was handwritten and it worked fine but
we switch to rayon in 2016 and that's
worked out really well for us
rayon is the library that's written and
shared by lots of different projects
that do things in parallel
it provides a safe abstraction over sort
of unsafe operations of distributing
work around multiple workers and so not
only did we make some changes to rayon
to better accommodate our use cases we
also have made use of changes that other
people from other projects have added to
rayon and that's been a really nice sort
of synergistic relationship there so the
idea in certain stylo is that we have a
queue of unstyled nodes and it will
literally be a single node and they'll
be the root of a tree so there's a pool
of worker threads that are waiting for
work and as soon as work becomes
available they'll start trying to grab
it off of the queue so when a worker
grab something off the queue it'll say
ok this is my node no one else can style
it I will now proceed and do the Cascade
on this particular node and I can always
reach the parent which is already styled
to get that information and when I'm
done styling this node I'll write that
information or I'll write the computer
style to the node and only then will I
retrieve the unstyled children of that
now styled node and add those to the
queue for other workers to then access
because this now provides a safe day of
the dependency where no other workers
will be trying to interact with a none
style parent while it's being styled so
the problem of trying to deal with here
is that parallel code in general has
some problems and that's that code
executes simultaneously and and sharing
data is a problem so if if they only
read the same data that's fine everyone
can read the same thing you get a
consistent view of the world but if
you're reading and writing then you end
up with a problem because you can get
any consistency showing up or if
different things are writing at the same
time still more inconsistent
that's no good the rest compiler
protects us against these problems but
there is an issue and that is when we go
into C++ from a worker thread that's
running on a thread we lose the ability
of the rest compiler to protect us and
that me is that a C++ method like get
brute element as shown here it turns out
it's a problem because it actually has a
little internal cache the first time is
called it'll look for a root element
you'll say oh great ok we can do this
faster next time if I just store this as
a member in this class but what happens
if you have two different workers which
both call it at the same time for the
first time and they both try to write to
the same thing together or read it at
the same time
turns out this causes a crash and it's
really difficult to actually spot
problems like this for a while early
developer was trying to keep track of
like reading through the code thinking
really hard about what would be called
at any given time and thinking okay is
this safe this is probably safe this
might be safe maybe this isn't safe and
that doesn't really scale it turns out
so so it turns out we came up with some
simple rules to avoid this if we said
that the the code being called from
these worker threads was only allowed to
write to local variables those would not
be observed by any other workers they
can read from anything because no one's
writing to anything and the main thread
which is usually the one doing all the
writing doesn't get to run if we follow
those rules could we get the compiler to
help us do this and the answer is yes we
have a compiler plugin for GCC which
performs static analysis on all
functions that start with the Gecko
prefix so all of those API is that can
be called from rest it will go and
explore every single possible code path
that could ever execute in any universe
and it will see ok are any writes
occurring in any of these code paths to
anything that is not a local variable if
so that is an error and that means we
now have the compiler helping us and
telling us whether anything could end up
causing a crash by being culled from
these these rust workers and this is
kinda scary because we found over there
preexisting problems from code that was
like a decade old that was only now
causing us problems because we were
doing this on threads and it saved us so
many times as we kept trying to
introduce new problems we were like oh
this is great I'll just call this
function and it's like nope you can't so
let's talk a little bit about some pain
points that came from this this this
work first one to memory usage Firefox
is really sensitive about memory usage
there's a sort of a long-standing meme
that like there's a leak in Firefox and
it'll just keep growing over time so we
fix that a few years ago so that's no
big deal but we're really careful not to
like keep having memory users increase
and we have infrastructure which is good
at measuring current heap usage
throughout the program but it needs
pointers to the actual allocated buffer
in order to be able to report those and
that's fine in in the gecko code because
we wrote our own standard library so we
have all those pointers everywhere we
can dig into everything rest doesn't
actually give us that in all cases
though and turns out that hashmaps both
are extremely important to the style
system and are pervasive everywhere and
they also get really big sometimes so it
turns out that we were lacking
significant ability to measure the
memory usage of this new style system
that we created so another problem that
we came across is that we really love
enemies like enums are fantastic and
being able to match on them is wonderful
and every every new rest developer that
worked on stylo
got really excited about enums and you
know sang their praises but it turns out
that enums have a ability to like grow
over time as you keep nesting them so
let's imagine a CSS property called
borderless style which could have three
different values it's either none or
solid or a dashed border when you might
represent that as an enum with three
States you know none solid or dashed and
it has you know a pixel value for like
how big the spacer should be so under
the hood this is gonna be eight bytes
you've got four bytes for the actual u32
value that is stored in the enum and you
also have four by
for the tag which indicates what kind of
what kind of what state this value is in
at any given time and that's unavoidable
so we might look at that and go okay
well the none state that seems redundant
why don't we just put this inside of an
option options are much nicer to use to
get better ergonomics so if we just have
an option around this enum we only need
two states inside of it and now it turns
out that border style value is still the
same size it still has a four byte tag
and it still needs to store four bytes
for the u-32 value but the option value
is also has its own tag and that's four
bytes and then you need to store the
eight bytes for the nested enum so in
total your option value is now 12 bytes
even though it's still still
representing the same amount of data now
we will look at this and say what if the
dash width was optional what if you
didn't actually like what if there was
like a default that would be specified
automatically you might say okay well
let's make the option inside the dashed
thing so now we have an option of an
enum that contains an option sometimes
so this adds up the option u32 is itself
8 bytes 4 bytes for the tag 4 bytes for
the value then you've got the border
style value which has 4 bytes for the
tag and now it stores an 8 byte enum and
the overall enum is still 4 by tag now
it stores 8 bytes for the value so
you've got 16 bytes for storing the you
know almost the exact same amount of
information now so our option here is
that we could flatten this automatic or
not automatically but we can flatten
this manually and put this all back into
a single enum that contains all the
different states you have none and then
you also have a - none State instead of
having an option inside of it and so now
you're back to 1 in um hands back to 4
by or in fact - 8 bytes in total because
you only need to store 4 bytes for the
u-32 value but this isn't this isn't a
delightful solution because you no
longer get the ergonomics you associate
with option values so trading off
between organics or space is you know
not my favorite thing so another thing
we came across is that the the ark
values contained
pointers and this is something a silo
doesn't actually use and this means that
there's an extra 4 or 8 bytes per thing
you allocate inside of an arc wrapper
and we do that a lot in servo so there
there seem to be some discussion going
on about whether this is necessary we
decided that we should just fork arc to
get rid of it
compiling time kind of not wonderful all
the time there's you know 300 thousand
lines of rest code after you go through
all the code generation just for the
largest crate and that isn't easy to do
quick work on you know minute 34 debug
build but performance is terrible
meanwhile six and a half minutes for a
release build if you get good
performance and we only use stable rest
so we can't try a lot of the new things
which are coming out recently and
finally fallible allocation is really
important for Firefox because we need to
be able to not break the browser if you
know you run out of memory or some web
content says you know gives you content
that is really really large that's no
good
and this isn't particularly important on
Windows for us because has very
different behavior than other river
platforms so you know this isn't great
there's an RFC being discussed but it's
not ready yet and we needed to be able
to ship and we were seeing crash reports
of failed allocations coming up heavily
on windows standard library doesn't
allow it so we forked hashmap it's
disappointing also we duplicated some
stuff to do that with X as well things
that went really well
deriving traits has saved us so much
time been able to fix entire classes of
errors and make it impossible to do them
that's been really great thread safety
like I said earlier it has saved us so
much time not making mistakes when doing
things with threaded code the fact that
people are really happy to write asserts
in their code means that we've caught
bugs that have been lurking in Firefox
around the old-style system that were
just swept under the rug but they now
panic in the new style system and we've
caught bugs are a decade old because of
this that's pretty cool
increased IO has been very helpful
there's lots of really great packages we
depend upon so I want to leave you with
this final conversation I oversaw I
overheard in in an
see channel from some of the long-term
Firefox developers who have been saying
that they they have found using rest for
stylo to be an incredibly positive
experience the lead developer someone's
been working on Firefox for like seven
or eight years at this point he said you
know the best part about stylo has been
how much easier has been to implement
these optimizations that we needed and
it's like it's because of rust that
that's possible and like can you imagine
if we needed to do this in the timeframe
that we've been if we need to like
rewrite all this in the time frame but
in C++ like that would be ridiculous
and additionally like we run fuzzers
against this new code and it's actually
extremely rare for those buzzers to find
bugs in the rust implementation itself
and that's really impressive like we
have a long history of seeing lots of
fussing bugs in the C++ code for the old
style system and you know imagine if we
could just like save time by trading all
of those compiler errors for like just
bugs we find later it'd be so much
easier to ship and yeah someone else
pointed out that like this is we just
put this on a billboard this is a great
ad for for the powers of rest so thanks
for listening I hope this has been
useful I'd love to talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
