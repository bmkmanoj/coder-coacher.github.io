dev and if you're here at django con
then you're already familiar with django
of course but there's lots of other
Python web dev frameworks out there so
django is actually influenced by several
earlier frameworks like soap and plone
and in turn it has inspired lots of
other frameworks that came after it like
pyramid turbo gears cherry pie bottle
and web to pie but the one that I'm here
to talk about is called flask now flask
is a micro framework that has some
surprising beginnings that actually
started as an April Fool's joke if you
can believe it the author of this
framework had written two other
frameworks called Vox ugh which is like
a server framework and Jinja 2 which is
a templating library and he figured it
would be kind of fun to take these two
libraries put them together into a zip
file and then write this denied
framework that when you ran it it would
just automatically unzip these libraries
onto your computer and run them and
thought everyone would just laugh and
instead everyone said this is fantastic
we need to actually use this in
production so he turned it into an
actual production ready framework that
has actually gotten surprisingly popular
if you look on github today you will see
that if you list all of the Python
repositories Jenko and flask are both up
there and flask actually has more stars
than django does so if that's your
measure of popularity than flask is more
popular so you might be asking yourself
why is flask so popular is it actually
better than django and the answer as you
might imagine is it depends django is
large flask is small both of them are
good you know we're a friendly community
and we love each other so let me give
you some examples to introduce what
flask II is and how to use it I'm
assuming that you have some familiar
some familiarity with Django but that
you know little to nothing about about
flask so where do we start with
programming we always start with hello
world here is the hello world
application in flask as you can see it
is literally five lines of code and you
run it by calling flask Run and setting
an environment variable to let the flask
command-line screen
to know where to find your application
so in this case I've taken these five
lines of code and put it in a file
called hello dot PI so I just say flask
app equals hello dot PI flask run and
that will start a local development
server on port 5,000 and if you visit
the root of that website you'll see the
string hello world in your browser it is
really that easy by contrast if you want
to do hello world in Jango you start by
installing Jango and then you do Django
admin start project project you go in to
your project you make your Hello app
which then of course you have to put
that into the settings PI then you write
your hello view which requires importing
this HTTP response thing and returning
it and then you have to deal with URLs
pi which means writing regular
expressions which is always a pain
especially for someone who is new to
programming and doesn't necessarily know
how to do regular expressions so I've
actually found when talking with people
who are new to web development in Python
that Django is more intimidating to
beginners than flask is Django has a
steeper learning curve because you have
to go over settings and regular
expressions you have to understand the
concepts of projects versus applications
flask is much simpler to get started you
can actually have your entire project in
a single file and that works really well
so by that account flask wins out with
the simplicity factor for getting
started but projects are generally more
complicated than hello world typically
you want to store some data in a
database modify it and render that data
on the front end so how do you do data
modeling well let's start with Django
this time well in Django we're gonna use
the Django ORM so you do from Django DB
import models and here I'm defining a
very basic blog post model this is code
that you've probably seen before to
manipulate the data you just create an
instance of it assign information on
properties and do object dot Save and
then you can query the database by doing
blog post objects and you can do filters
and you can do selects and all sorts of
standard things that you can do with
database query so how do you do the same
sort of thing in flask well the answer
is you don't
so flask actually doesn't have data
models now you're looking at this and
you're wondering how can
be how can a web framework not have a
data model how can a webform with it's
apparently more popular than Django and
not have a data model well the answer is
that J is that flask has a very
different perspective and ideology from
django django bundles everything
altogether and flask is much more
modular so here's an example of how you
might handle data modeling in django
versus flask you can see that the Django
ORM is built into Django itself so you
install Django and you've got it
flask doesn't have that but flask has
connections to other Python modules in
the Python package index that will do
data modeling for you
for example the sequel alchemy ORM is a
very popular one if you want to do
non-relational databases with MongoDB
you can use Mongo engine there's a
smaller framework called pee-wee that's
been getting some attention lately so
the idea is that flask is very very
minimalist it has almost nothing in
there it has only the bare necessities
for what you need in order to do a
simple static website essentially it
includes templating URL routing error
handling and a debugger that is all
however it is designed to be incredibly
extensible so that you can plug and play
and choose which components that you
want to plug into your website and make
it work exactly the way that you want so
let me give you an example that shows
you how you might do data modeling using
sequel alchemy and flask so there's an
extension called flask sequel alchemy
which is designed to cleanly integrate
these two different modules so you would
just install that and that install seek
welcome e itself as a dependency and
then you do some basic setup to
configure it so I'm gonna import that
extension and I'm going to configure it
on to my flask application and as you
can see the flask application also has
this dot config object where you can set
information that your application or
extensions can read and use so in this
case I might say that I want my my
database to be a sequel Lite database
that uses the test DB file under the
temp directory whatever the thing that's
really important here is that you notice
that yours
importing the sequel alchemy class and
you're creating a variable called DB
that you you get by wrapping your
application with sequel alchemy so now
that you have this DB object you can do
some very familiar things with it so
here I'm defining a data model a blog
post data model and you can see that it
looks very familiar
to the same sort of thing that you would
do with the Django ORM in fact I'll take
the previous example and I'll put it on
the same slide so you can compare and
contrast they're not identical but
they're very similar to each other and
if you've used the Django R M you can
use sequel alchemy in almost the same
way you can also manipulate data in very
similar fashions so you can create an
instance of a blog post an instance of
the blog post class assign information
to it and then instead of calling dot
save on it you have to add it to the
database session and commit the session
it's the same basic concept sequel
alchemy is just making you sort of be a
little bit more explicit with how this
database interaction works and you can
query data in the same way so you do
query instead of dot objects and you can
do dot filter order filter by and
there's a lot of the same basic things
that you can do in Django and you can do
the same sort of thing in sequel Kamiya
in fact i'm of the opinion that sequel
alchemy is a more powerful object
relational mapper than Django or M but
that's another topic for another time
so so by comparison
so to talk about data models here on the
higher level Django's data models are
easier to get started because they're
built in so you don't need to import and
install anything else to get started
however flask allows you more
flexibility to choose whatever you want
to use django assumes that you're going
to use a relational database flask you
can use whatever you want you can use
Mongo you can use Google App engines
datastore you can use whatever it
doesn't matter but of course the more
options you have the more flexibility
you have the more chance you have to
screw something up so you know it's a
trade-off there let's keep going
most web applications have users and
they also have an admin to be able to
view information in your database and
modify
so how do these compare can you do this
sort of thing with flasks well with
Django we have your familiar Django dead
contrib death
it's built-in it's easy I'm sure you're
all rather familiar with it if you need
extra models if you need extra
information for users you can swap out
the user model it's a little complicated
you can also make a user profile to
attach to it that's also a little
complicated but it works pretty well
with the admin you have Django Tekonsha
admin also built in an easy very
customizable and there's a lot of
documentation out there with a
fine-grained permission system so that
different admin users can get access to
different objects to administer so how
do we do it in flask well as you might
imagine you don't have users built-in
because you don't even have a data model
built in but there is a very popular
flask extension called flask login which
is generic and works with just about any
data model including sequel alchemy if
you'd like so here's an example of how
we might do that I'm going to define a
user class and you can see I'm importing
this user mixin from-from flask login
that gives it a couple of extra little
superpowers so that we have some
standard usage that you can use across
your framework regardless of whether
you're using sequel alchemy or Mongo or
whatever so for example in my route I
might say if current user dot is
anonymous now current user is something
that's provided by flask login it's a
pointer basically to whatever user is
currently logged in and the is anonymous
thing is provided by that user mixin
that I showed you earlier
so here's a simple view where I'm saying
if you're anonymous just render the
splash page otherwise show the user
homepage flask login will also give you
a login required decorator which you've
probably seen from Jango as well so it's
just a decorator that you apply to your
view if the user tries to access the
view and they're not logged in they'll
get a 403 forbidden exception again very
similar to Jango but the idea is that
you build this piece by piece
with user permissions you can also use
the principle extension that has a very
similar fine-grained permissioning
system the same way that django django
use it django contrib off models do so
the idea is if you don't want a
permissioning system you don't need to
have it
Django users have that built in by
default and you have to sort of deal
with it whether you want it or not with
flask you can decide if you want to add
that it or not
and with the admin as you might expect
there's a flask admin extension as well
so you want to use that you install it
you set it up and you decide which theme
you want to use it has a couple of
themes built in based on bootstrap or
you can write your own and work with
several different database backends
including sequel alchemy and Mongo and
Pewee and that's designed to work with
or without any sort of other denny user
extension that you want so it's very
common to have it work with flask login
and fly off last principle but it's not
required here's some screenshots of how
it looks here's the list view so you can
see all of your users here's how you
edit a user as you can see it's all
standard bootstrap so it's pretty
familiar and it's pretty powerful now
there's a lot of different extensions
that I've just gone over and having a
user and admin system is pretty standard
so there's actually an extension called
flask security which all it does is it
takes about five or six different flask
extensions and bundles them all together
into one package so they're already
designed to hook up together properly so
you can just install this one extension
and bam you've got your users your
permissions your admin it's all there
it's great and of course it works with
sequel alchemy Mongo engine or pee-wee's
so you've got a lot of flexibility here
so again django has a user a user
framework and admin built in and they
work very well they're not maybe they're
not as flexible as personally I would
like but for a lot of people they work
great flask requires a lot of different
extensions working together in concert
which makes for a steeper learning curve
but it means that you can define your
user model and your permissioning system
to work exactly the way that you want so
it's basically a question of do you want
off the shelf or do you want extensive
customization there's also the idea of
reusable apps so Jango has got this
nailed with the whole django apps system
that you have to have an app every time
you create your project all code related
to one concept lives in one place like
for example you might have all the
registration logic in one place how does
that compare so with django you install
your thing and you get it set up in the
installed apps list in the settings you
have the django packages website
available which is fantastic and shows
you a lot of good information about the
packages available but it's a little
hard to figure out which packages you
actually one which ones are maintained
with a higher quality and so on and of
course if you're writing your own
application it's very tempting to just
stick everything into one app rather
than organizing it into several it's
sort of complicated to figure out how
you want to move all those pieces around
by contrast blue flask has something
called blueprints which are not quite
the same thing but they're pretty
similar it's a way of organizing the
views in your application so that you
can again group logic together into
similar places but it doesn't require
that you move models into different
places it doesn't require anything about
migrations in different places it's
basically just views so it's it's much
smaller and much more lightweight which
might be a good thing or bad thing
depending on how on how you look at it
it's also a very familiar syntax so let
me go back to our basic hello world that
we had before and I will take this
application and I'll transform it into a
blueprint just like this you can see the
only things I had to change was turn the
app variable into a blueprint variable
and I can still do the same basic route
decorator on top and now once I have
this hello underscore BP blueprint I can
attach it to an existing application
just by importing it from the file where
I have it defined and I can call app dot
register blueprint of the blueprint that
I've defined so it makes it much easier
to take an application that was
originally defined as one monolithic
application and separated out into
several different blueprints although
you might do the same sort of thing with
Jango apps so to compare Jango apps are
more comprehensive there's a lot more of
them out there especially if you check
the Jango packages website but they're
also more complex and sometimes it's
hard to refactor your own application
into Jango apps by contrast flask
blueprints are simpler and they're easy
to integrate with a project but maybe
they don't provide the power that you're
looking for again it's it's sort of a
subjective thing another thing that a
lot of websites need is api's they're
increasingly common for babba
for web applications and they have
different user patterns compared to HTML
web pages so how do these two compare
well when you're dealing with Jango you
want to use Django rest framework it's
great I'm sure you've all heard tons and
tons of praise from this framework over
the past few days it's multi-layered
abstract
if multi-layered abstractions so you can
choose which layer you want to go with
it has tons of documentation and it
works great so what about with flask
well as you might imagine you want to
use multiple different extensions
working together to provide the
experience that you're looking for with
Django rest framework typically the
thing that sort of forms the core of how
your api is structured is the serializer
and in flask you would probably want to
use the marshmallow module which is as
you might imagine a serializer framework
and the ecosystem has integrations with
flask with sequel alchemy with Mongo
engine with a whole bunch of other
things so no matter what sort of
structure you've decided for your web
app flat marshmallow will work properly
with it so let me give you an example
this is a fair amount of code but this
is an application written in flask that
returns a JSON based API endpoints to
return information about the currently
logged in user now annotate this a
little bit you can see at the start I am
importing a whole bunch of stuff and
then I'm going to initialize the flask
marshmallow extension and save it into a
variable called MA then I'm going to
define my schema which is basically the
serializer Django rest framework uses
the word serializer marshmallow uses the
word schema it's the same basic thing
and you can see I'm telling it to just
find the fields defined on the user
model and exclude the password field
because we don't want that being
displayed on our API and then in the
actual API view I can just say
initialize this user schema and take the
current user and output it as JSON and I
also have the log-in required decorator
that I talked about earlier which will
make sure that you can only access this
API endpoint if you are currently logged
in so this is one page you know this is
maybe 15 lines of code and we have a
basic API set up in such a way that you
can understand every single piece of the
puzzle of how its put together so django
versus flask when it comes to api's
Django rest framework is amazing I
really wish that flask had something
that was as well put together and as
clean and as abstracted as Django rest
framework we don't have that yet
maybe someone will put that together the
same way that people did that for flasks
security but as it is you can still use
all the extensions that you want to put
together something just as powerful as
DRF if not more so and you have more
flexibility as well because you're not
constrained to the constraints that
jenga puts upon you you can use a non
relational database if you want to you
can use any sort of different components
that you want to mix into your
application to make it taste exactly the
way that you want so the question you
might be asking yourself is which one do
I choose and of course it's up to you it
depends on the project but let me give
you a couple of brief bullet points so
that you have an idea of which to go for
you generally want to choose Jango when
you're happy with all the choices that
Jango makes for you so I've been talking
about how Jango restricts you to using a
relational database maybe you like using
a relational database if that's the case
go for it
Jango makes you use Django templates
although that's changed recently you can
swap out different templating systems
but general you want to go with the
things that jenga provides for you the
more that you do that the happier you'll
be if you're not doing anything too
unusual Jango will work great for you
because the more that you try to fight
the framework the more pain you'll
experience and also Jango sort of sets
up a whole bunch of different things for
you you can peek under the covers and
you can learn how the ORM works and how
the templating system works and how all
the different pieces fit together but
you don't necessarily have to by
contrast you might want to choose flask
when you disagree with one of Django's
choices and you want to do things
differently if you want to use sequel
alchemy instead of the jingo ORM for
example or if you have unusual
requirements like using a non relational
database or doing something else that
seems a little bit odd or unusual for a
web framework Jango will fight you a
little bit on this flask will say yeah
do what you want great or it's great to
use flask when you're doing a hobbyist
side project and maybe you're less
concerned with having a working project
and more concerned with understanding
all the different layers and how they
work together it's great for really
making you learn how all the pieces fit
together and it'll make you a better
programmer by having that understanding
so I'm about out of time
but that's all I have to say does anyone
have any questions I only have a little
bit of time to take questions and I will
also say I'm sure there are people here
with a lot
of opinions so I'm going to be out in
the lobby to host an argument session
