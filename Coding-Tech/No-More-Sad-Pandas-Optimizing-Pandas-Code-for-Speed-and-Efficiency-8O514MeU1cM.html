actually use pandas almost everybody
awesome so for those of you who is less
familiar with the library pandas is an
open-source library that offers data
structure support and a fantastic set of
tools for data analysis in particular
pandas is great for the analysis of
tabular data in other in other words
data that's arranged in rows and columns
and pandas provides a lot of the
functionality that until a few years ago
was only available in more Statistics
oriented tools like R or Stata or SAS or
MATLAB for example so a lot of these
tools pandas is now able to use the same
function and provide the same
functionality within Python as a result
pandas is used in just about everything
from simple data manipulation to pretty
complex machine learning so why do I
care to optimize my code well that
actually kind of depends on your use
case and maybe if you're doing data
science where your runtimes don't matter
and your data isn't huge maybe it
doesn't actually matter all that much
whether your code is running in a few
minutes or a few seconds whatever you'll
go get a cup of coffee come back and
it's gonna be done but the bottom line
is that pandas is capable of providing a
lot of efficiency because it's built on
top of numpy and it has a lot of
procedures built into it that are
optimized in size on which means that it
can be very fast when it's used
correctly and those optimizations that
you can put into it can make the
difference between your code running in
minutes or your code running in
literally milliseconds so before we
start talking about how we would
actually optimize our code let's talk
about how do I know whether my code is
slow and how do I know whether I'm
making it faster in other words we're
gonna talk a little bit about how you
would do benchmarking so to start we're
gonna be looking at a bunch of examples
that are based on a data set that I
pulled down off of Expedia's developer
website and it pretty much just contains
all of the hotels in New York states
that are sold by Expedia there is about
1600 of them turns out there's a lot of
hotels in New York State and our dataset
is going to contain some information
with one hotel per row an ID for each
hotel a name and address a latitude and
longitude and some information about the
hotel such as a star rating and some
high rates and low rates that are
calculated by Expedia and to search
we're just going to grab a function that
we can benchmark from this is an example
of a normalization function it's pretty
straight forward what it's actually
doing is not actually all of that
relevant for our purposes other than
it's taking some means and some standard
deviations cutting off outliers and
taking a log to normalize what we care
about is how do we actually figure out
how to time this function and which
parts of it are slower or faster than
others so we're going to do that was
something called magic commands so how
many of you guys have used magic
commands in Jupiter great so a lot so
magic commands are available through
Jupiter notebooks to provide additional
functionality on top of Python code that
may running that code or doing other
things with that code extra awesome and
useful magic commands you'll see start
with a percentage sign the single
percent sign is just code that's
executed on one line or double
percentage that's executed on an entire
cell and the first function that we're
going to talk about is the time-it
command so a time-it command just reruns
a function over and over and over again
and it shows the average and the
standard deviation of the runtime that
it obtained as a result what the time
that it calculates can serve as a
benchmark for a bunch of further
optimizations so let's look at an
example so here we've done a time it of
our normalized function I've fed my
normalized function the data frame that
I created my set of hotels and I've told
it to use the series high rate in order
to actually apply this function
and I've assigned the results to a new
series within the data frame have run
the payment and it's letting me know
that it the function on average took 2.8
eighty four milliseconds and it ran it
seven to seven runs of a hundred loops
each so now that provides a baseline
from which I can go to figure out how to
make this function run faster or slower
and figure out whether I'm actually
succeeding at what I'm doing so the next
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna feed it
through an extension called line
profiler which gets abbreviated as % LP
run as a magic function an aligned
profiler will run through run my
function line by line and give me a
bunch of useful statistics about what
it's doing and in particular it's gonna
tell me in that second column my hits
it's gonna tell me how many times my
function has been actually each line in
my function has been rerun so if I'm
running the function on a bunch of loops
I'll see a number greater than one here
and in the next to the last column it's
gonna tell me what percentage of the
time each line actually took so over
here for example if you look let me see
I don't have my pointer here but if you
look about four lines up from the bottom
you'll see that my line 11 and 12
actually took well close to 80% of the
time that this function was running for
which means that if I were going in and
trying to optimize this function I would
certainly look at those two lines and
tried to start there because I would get
the biggest bang for my bum for my buck
trying to optimize those two so now that
we sort of get the sense of how we're
gonna go about trying to optimize or
trying to benchmark our functionality
let's talk about some of the slower
methodologies that i've seen used in
pandas so we're gonna start with a
different practice function this is the
hammer sign or Great Circle distance
function all this is basically doing is
taking into
of coordinates and is calculating a
straight-line distance between them
taking in the curvature of the earth
again the details of the implementation
aren't actually all that important for
our purposes other than to know that
it's doing some addition some
subtraction and it's doing a bunch of
sines and cosines and other trig to
actually calculate the distances and
it's returning the actual number of
miles between two coordinates so one
thing that I see people do a lot
actually as they start out in pandas is
start iterating through all of the rows
to apply a function which kind of makes
sense right because you're working with
a data frame that has a bunch of rows
and a bunch of columns and why can't I
just loop through all of my rows just
the same way that I would loop through a
list and actually figure out and
actually apply the function to each item
on that list the thing is that pandas is
actually built on numpy which is
designed for vector manipulation which
means that loops are inherently
inefficient
that being said pandas will give you
methods to loop through row by row if
that's something you really want to do
so for example it will provide you with
an it arose method or inner tuples
method which will give you essentially a
set of things to loop through but it
will be quite slow so over here I've
basically created a blank a new
dictionary to feed our mileage into and
I'm running through my rows within data
frame it arose command and I'm just
feeding it a set of coordinates and I'm
running it calculating the distance
between a particular set of coordinates
and every single hotel and my data set
if you're curious a particular set of
coordinates happens to be the Brooklyn
superheroes supply in New York it's a
fantastic place you should go there so
now at this point we know that our
function with it arose has taken 184
milliseconds we don't actually know
whether that's slow or fast at this
point right but all we know is that it
took less than a second I guess that's
good
but we can try a different looping
method a nicer way to have done this
would have been to use a ply which
applies a function along a specified
axis which is to say a set of rows or a
set of columns and is a lot more
efficient than it arose it's much more
optimized even though it's still looping
through over and over again a plot is
best used only when there is no good way
to actually vectorize your function so
let's try looking at that so over here
I'm essentially having the function do
the same saying it's applying the
function to each individual row and it's
comparing the distance from that hotel
to a particular set of coordinates and
it's running its through a row by row
but just by swapping out apply for it
arose I've gotten my run time down to 78
milliseconds and by comparison to the
184 milliseconds that we saw before
that's a two and a half times
improvement for basically changing
nothing about my function just changing
the function that runs it and now if we
look at the actual line profiler we can
see what it's doing well apply is doing
a lot of repetitive repetitive steps
where you see that one hundred and 1631
hits
that's the apply function hitting the
each individual row and doing the same
set of things over and over and over
again
and if we could just get rid of that
repetition we could make it run a lot
faster and that's what vectorization
actually does for our functions so what
is vectorization well before we start
talking about that let's take a step
back and just talk about what it is that
makes pandas so great the basic unit of
pandas is an array so there's two sort
of basic objects in pandas one is a
series which is a one-dimensional array
with axis labels so a series would be a
column with a column with some labels on
it for example we're a data frame which
is a two-dimensional array with labeled
axes in other words that
would be a table with column labels and
row labels a vectorization is the
process of performing operations on
arrays instead of scalars in other words
my vectorized operations are going to
take my entire series and perform an
operation on the entire saying
simultaneously instead of running
through it one single item at a time why
would I want to do that
well many pandas functions are actually
built to operate that way they're built
to operate directly on a race so the
built-in pandas some functions the
string string processing they're all
vectorized functions and they are
inherently because of the inherent panda
structure much faster than regular
looping operations or trying to operate
on one piece of the data frame at a time
so let's look at how we would vectorize
this function we actually don't need to
do much all we've done is we've said
we're gonna grab our have a sine
function we're still using the same set
of coordinates but now instead of
looping and applying the function on one
row at a time we're going to feed it the
entire vector latitude and longitude
that we've grabbed from the data frame
so at this point my DF latitude and ZF
longitude are individual arrays they're
the contents of both of those columns
whole and this brings our time down to
actually 1.8 milliseconds so if you
recall in our previous and our previous
looping runs we got it down to something
like 73 or something like that now we
are down to a tiny fraction of that and
in fact if we look at time it well the
function is no longer looping it's doing
exactly one hit to every single line
that were in the function and that's
what allows that huge increase in
efficiency and so now just to summarize
with it arose we were starting out at
184 milliseconds with a vectorized
implementation of the exact same
function we're down to 1.8 milliseconds
which is a 43 times improvement over
even loop
was apply so that's already pretty great
but could we make it even better well
the answer is actually yeah we can and
we can do that by vectorizing with numpy
arrays instead of series
so why numpy you might ask well numpy
calls itself a fundamental package for
scientific computing in Python numpy
operations are essentially executed an
optimized pre compiled code and
fundamental objects in numpy are also
arrays are called NZ arrays and they are
highly efficient and they skip out on a
lot of the overhead that gets incurred
by operations on pandas series in Python
pandas series are great for a lot of
things they provide their own indexes
there they have a lot of functionality
but they do have a lot of extra overhead
that numpy array skip and so what we can
do is we can take again our old good old
hammer sign function and we're going to
convert our pandas series back to numpy
vet numpy arrays by applying this dot
values function to them this is just the
built-in pandas method and now we are
down to actually 370 microseconds which
is to say we've effectively gotten up to
a 500 fold improvement from our original
version of the function by not changing
the function essentially just changing
the way that our inputs are read in so
that probably is pretty great for what
we're trying to do and for that
particular function but you might say
what if I actually really wanted to use
a loop and there might be a couple of
reasons for why you might want to do
that and then this hammer sign function
might not actually be the best example
for that but there are other reasons so
for example maybe your function is
really complex and it doesn't yield
itself easily to vectorization maybe
you're calling an API and there is no
way to vectorize this process may be
trying to vectorize your function would
actually incur a lot of memory overhead
for example your data frame is huge and
it contains a lot of really complex
float operations and it's too much for
you to handle and so you're actually
it's actually preferable for you to loop
even though it would be slower or maybe
you're just plain stubborn I don't know
so one of the things that we could use
to actually speed up loops is size on so
size on language is a superset of Python
that additionally supports calling C
functions and declaring C types and I
think there is another slice on talk
following directly after this I'm sure
they will know a lot more than I do
about it but this is my abbreviated
version so any almost any piece of
Python code is also valid size on code
and the size on compiler will
effectively convert Python code into C
code which will make if equivalent calls
to the Python and C API so we're still
using Jupiter notebooks and I've PIP
installed this Ison extension I'm gonna
load my sights on extension and then I'm
going to open a new size on cell I'm
gonna initialize it as running in size
on and I'm going to grab my entire have
a sine function and pretty much just run
it through that size and compiler I've
not really made any real changes to it
other than to define it in my death as a
CP def which is a size on Python
function instead of just a straight
price on function so let's time this
once that's been done I can basically
just run my function exactly the way I
did before with an apply and I'm down to
76 milliseconds well unfortunately
that's actually not very good it's about
the same thing we were getting with
Python and that's a little bit
disappointing because so the sights on
compiler was supposed to be doing a
bunch of work in the background to
convert our code to 2c or slice on and
try to optimize it and make it run
faster so what happened there well if I
add the - a option
my sights on magic command the sizin
compiler will actually show me how much
of this function has been able to
convert from Python to size on and those
yellow bits is everything that it's
still running in Python that's a lot of
yellow we did not do very well and
that's exactly why we didn't cut any
time off so let's see what we can
actually do about that well for one
thing we know that as long as Sai son is
still using Python we're not gonna we're
not going to improve the time much so we
need to make the function more size
unfriendly and there's a bunch of ways
to do that you know anything ranging
from taking the real function to
converting it to pure C but two of the
things that we can do fairly easily is
we can add explicit strict typing to the
function or we can replace our well or
and or we can replace our Python and
numpy libraries with C specific math
libraries so if you recall our function
was using a whole bunch of numpy math to
calculate a bunch of those trig formulas
we're gonna take those out and we're
going to replace them with actual C math
library so this is what our converted
function looks like now and you can see
that I've basically taken all of the
variables that are declared within the
function and I've added strict typing to
them they're all Floop so it's easy
enough and I've imported the Lib C masse
to bring in a bunch of sine and cosine
functions that we're going to be using
to replace the numpy library other than
that the only thing I've really done is
there was one function which was a
degrees to radians conversion that
exists in numpy but not in the original
C library I've just taken it out and
rewritten it and defined it as a
function separate function within here
so now let's try running that so we're
going to time the size a nice function
again the actual apply statement looks
exactly the same
before and now we're actually down to 50
milliseconds which if you recall is not
nearly as great as 300 microseconds but
you know it's an improvement we've
gotten it up to 1.6 times the previous
version which was just running the
Python function with apply or running
the row wise function Python function
directly in the size and compiler
without doing anything and so at this
point if you're really attached to loops
you can go into a lot more probably
seisonn optimizations but they'll get a
lot more complex or you can see if you
can figure out a way to vectorize your
function which will give you a huge
boost and improvement in performance for
very little work and once if we actually
look at our code at this point well we
see that there's a hell of a lot more
yep a less yellow and more white on the
screen so our changes that we made
including the data typing and the
conversion to a different library have
actually done a lot to help the function
convert to actual size on code and run
more efficiently alright so here we are
let's sum it up so again this is our
scoreboard we started out with 184
milliseconds we got it down to 0.4
makers 0.4 milliseconds overall about a
500 time improvement we started out
looping with it arose which you should
pretty much almost never do we moved to
looping was apply which is a fairly
efficient way to loop through things we
tried looping with a function that got
converted to size on which gave us some
performance boost but not a whole lot
and then we vectorize their function
with pandas and with numpy arrays which
gave huge boosts in performance so to
summarize the general Zen of pen
optimization is one avoid loops if you
can if you must loop use apply not
iteration functions if you must apply
use size on to make it faster
vectorization is usually better than
scalar operations and vector operations
on numpy arrays are more efficient than
a native pandas series and was that just
a couple of words of warning to quote
xkcd premature optimization is the root
of all evil so before you start
optimizing your function make sure that
it is doing what you wanted to be doing
otherwise you will find yourself having
spent a week on trying to make it run a
few minutes faster just to find that it
actually wasn't running and doing things
that you wanted it to do at all you will
regret it another caveat that I should
put in here all of this was done in
pythons 3.51 pandas point 20 so anything
any of these results will obviously vary
depending on exactly how you're using
your functions the system that you're
running it on the size of the data frame
the type of the function that you're
using and so take it with a grain of
salt I can't promise you the exact same
performance performance boosts that we
saw in this particular data frame in
this particular function for every
single thing that you might ever apply
these methods to and that's pretty much
it and since I have a few more seconds
I'm gonna give a bonus pitch we are
hiring and check us out at upside comm
where a fantastic small travel startup
located in Washington DC and if you're
interested come talk to me thank you
