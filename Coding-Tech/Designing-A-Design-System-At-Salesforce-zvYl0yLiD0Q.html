Salesforce is a really big company we
have offices all over the world in fact
we have one here in Israel it's a very
large large problem to solve so product
design I've learned in an enterprise
organization can be tricky and in the
world of what we're doing we're actually
dealing with 17 years of legacy because
we've been around for 17 years and as
you can imagine 17 years ago 4 was
pretty archaic and now we've grown to
over 20,000 employees so lots of excuse
me lots of people involved we also have
a lot of products I'm not going to read
through all these but we have a lot to
consider you know we're always seems
like it almost every day we're acquiring
a new company and we want to align our
brand across all these products and all
these platforms so things I've learned
to design at Salesforce is to consider
the whole ecosystem when I first joined
the team a few years ago we launched
Salesforce 1 which was our mobile
application which was the first product
to bring a more modern updated look to
the UI we learned a lot from this
process the designer developer
communication that was mentioned before
was pretty tricky like we would hear
questions all the time like where can I
find the icons what color is the button
border where can I find the icons and
you just hear these same questions over
and over and over again so a common
technique that a lot of companies use or
what are known as red lines and if
you're not familiar with red lines
that's basically where you specify a
design all the pixel dimensions font
sizes spacing etc but as you can imagine
on an enterprise scale this is not a
very fun process and red lines promote
designing pages which for you know
enterprise product design or even
smaller startup product design is not
the way to go about it so you may or may
not have seen the Salesforce one style
guide it's not around anymore because we
took it down but this was out a few
years ago and this is actually what I
saw that made me want to join the team
because I thought it was really cool I
thought it was really beautiful and it
was and it got a lot of traction but
when we shared it you know we have a
conference in San Francisco called
Dreamforce its massive and all these
customers and partners come and talk to
us they kept asking questions like where
do or how do I get my app to look like
this and can I use the CSS in my app and
the reason they were asking us this
question is they're often building apps
that will live inside Salesforce so it
needs to kind of look and feel like it
belongs there because if it doesn't look
like it belongs there people aren't
going to trust it so we learned that the
style guide wasn't really quite solving
the problem and it didn't really give
our developers an official way to even
use it or refer to it so as you can
imagine it was ignored and it was
basically a nice fancy portfolio
showpiece that we could share but it
wasn't really practical so last year we
launched what's known as our lightning
experience and this was basically our
revamped UI that was not just for our
phone but also for tablets watches
desktop UI we're even looking at things
like TV you know Internet of Things all
sorts of things and in conjunction with
launching this UI we created our
lightning design system so if you
haven't seen it check it out later it's
at salesforce.com slash design system
this is the product that I work on at
Salesforce it's also open source so you
can check it out github Salesforce - UX
as a repo our repos it there so I'm
gonna use an acronym SLDS that means
Salesforce lightning design system so
you know what I'm talkin about
we didn't use LDS because we're not
wormans
so we slept the SM hair to kind of
distinguish our acronym from them so
design systems this is what we want but
how do we create one of these how do we
design one of these so again I'm gonna
share how we did it and this is how we
did it to scale so it's important from
the very beginning before you even
embark on this journey is to have a
clear vision to align efforts so at
South Spurs I have a mentor named Craig
Villa Moore he's the chief design
architect he's been at Salesforce for 10
years and the thing he often says is the
more decisions you put off and the
longer you delay them the more expensive
they become it's really important to
make better design decisions as quickly
as possible and to do this properly we
found that it's important to drive
design decisions with design principles
this is how you can bring designers
engineers product managers all around a
single goal so the design principles
that we landed on which I think are
applicable for any company are clarity
which means eliminate ambiguity enable
people to see understand and act with
confidence efficiency streamline and
optimize workflows intelligently
anticipate needs to help people work
better faster and smarter consistency of
course create familiarity strengthen
intuition by applying the same solution
to the same problem and beauty we want
to demonstrate respect for people's time
and attention through thoughtful and
elegant craftsmanship so one of the
practices that we do on my team or we
all anytime there's a list of anything
whether it's a list of tasks list of
goals list of design principles we
always try to put those lists in
priority order and so these design
principles that I mentioned to you are
in a very specific priority order for a
very specific reason
so number one clarity
clarity's core to our experience our
users need to clarify need clarity to
complete their task to reach their goals
and if we can ensure that users are
successfully reaching their goals over
and over and over then we can earn their
trust their loyalty and their gratitude
and we found that this was more
important for us over everything next up
is efficiency and this came up
repeatedly as we talked to her customers
during our research and we almost put it
at the top because it came up so much
but when we started thinking about like
doubling down on efficiency we noticed
that there were some drawbacks like you
can create a lot of design shortcuts for
expert users but then you're forgetting
about your beginners so if we took
efficiency to the extreme new users
would be overwhelmed so we don't want
them to make mistakes because mistakes
are costly so efficiency came second
clarity being number one and then
consistency of course any talk about
design systems consistency is always
brought up and it is important for us
which is why it's in the list but for us
we felt that clarity and efficiency are
much more important than consistency
because if something is like
consistently bad you're not really
helping your users so we wanted to make
sure that we do pay attention to that it
helps make make us have better quality
by being consistent but clarity and
efficiency for us outweigh that so our
fourth principle being beauty beauty is
of course important to designers but
it's not the defining characteristic of
our product it's about getting things
done and then design standards comes up
a lot when you're talking about design
systems and style guides but we feel
very importantly that design principles
outweigh design standards they're way
more important and they're how you're
going to really make sure that you're
doing the right thing and of course it's
important to evangelize
a line within your company and so at
Salesforce we have posters up with these
design principles and they're hung up
all over the office especially in the UX
area but we've found that our developers
engineers our product managers like
other people are starting to communicate
through this system as well which is
great so Luke W said design
considerations yes
design considerations beat design
patterns test and decide don't just copy
things like the hamburger icon we all
like to hate on the hamburger icon and
it's for good reason I think a lot of
people saw it thought it was trendy put
it in their UI and a lot of apps have
pulled it out of their UI because they
found that it didn't really work so it's
important to do your research
I mentioned earlier the quote by Nathan
Curtis that it's a living product so you
treat your design system as if it were a
product you still do your research so we
interviewed a lot of our users and these
range anywhere from designers engineers
writers our partners that are in our
ecosystem face to face interviews taking
lots of notes asking questions
understanding pain points so always
important to do that first and then I've
also learned that from the very
beginning it's important to embrace what
your constraints are so for designers
like sometimes constraints can be very
scary you want to be very creative and
have all the room to do whatever you
want but we've found for us that
constraints can actually be a catalyst
for a different type of creativity so
some of those constraints which are
actually in my mind features not
constraints are things like
accessibility so color contrast is
really important to us things like
making sure you're using the component
that's proper for that type of
interaction if you're using a modal once
you're in that modal you're trapped in
that modal until you perform the action
or get out of that modal so you have to
be careful about where you're applying
these types of
things at my clarity conference I
mentioned earlier one of the speakers I
had was Cordelia McGee tab who is that
Dropbox and she said a really awesome
metaphor that I really liked which was
saying you know it's like baking a
blueberry muffin if you bake the muffin
first and then realize oh I didn't put
them up sorry the blueberries in there
you cram the blueberries and later it's
gonna be a really crappy muffin but if
you bake it in from the beginning then
you're gonna have a really great muffin
and that's how she was using that
metaphor for accessibility you got to
bake it in from the beginning things
like localization and
internationalization things like
cultural significance for color text
expansion even how words are capitalized
like some people will use CSS to
capitalize or change the capitalization
of words but you could actually affect
the understanding in another area
so I mentioned color so for in the u.s.
when we look at stocks we usually we use
red to indicate that the stuff is going
down and green to indicate the stock is
going up but in a lot of Asian countries
red is actually a symbol for luck and
prosperity so in their applications
they're going to use red to indicate the
stock is going up versus green for down
ana Picard who works at slack is the
editorial content director and she also
gave a talk at that conference and I
loved what she said about using puns
like if you're trying to have a very fun
engaging UI the thing about puns is that
it relies on a cultural understanding so
it might make sense to some people and
they'll get it and the laughs but other
people won't get it and they'll feel
excluded
so there's all these considerations to
take into account and in especially our
world of enterprise we have things like
allowing the customer to brand and theme
the UI admins to configure where certain
things go what navigation items are seen
and our partner community is using our
tools our open-source community are
using our tools so there's all these
different excuse me constraints and
things that we have to consider
so back in September
Nathan Curtis who I mentioned earlier
wrote this fantastic article called team
models for scaling a design system and
he goes through the different models
that he's observed at different
companies that he's worked with the
first one is what he calls the solitary
model which is like the overlord and but
it's really more about their roadmap and
their workflow the second model is what
he called centralized which is a
centralized design team which produces
supports it as part of their job and
they're kind of like in service of the
rest of the organization and the third
model is known as federated in which
designers from multiple product teams
decide on the system together and work
on it together at the end of the article
he asked I would really love to know
like how your organization or your
company does it so please let me know
and so in true medium fashion
I wrote a response article which I
called the Salesforce team model for
scaling a design system but I wasn't
really introducing a brand new model it
really was a merging of the last two
models that I mentioned and I referred
to it as a cyclical team model so this
is where we have the centralized team
that works on this system but we also
have federated contributors throughout
the organization that collaborate with
us and it's cyclical because through
this pairing model that we have our
design system is informing our product
design throughout our organization but
then they're out in the trenches doing
their own research they know their
feature areas really really well so they
in turn inform the design system so it's
this very cyclical model it's much
better than just being like in service
of the company or like dictators
like it's a more collaborative pairing
model so the centralized design systems
team which I'm on is really important
for us I believe that even the best
automated systems still need human
guidance to succeed and survive so our
team sort of acts as like a librarian'
distributor facilitator we make sure
it's maintained and crafted with quality
and our current team breakdown we have
the overall Lightning design system team
we have my team which is called Design
Systems this includes our creative
director Design Systems director visual
and interaction designers and CSS
framework developers and then we have a
sister team which we referred to as more
Design Systems ops so this is the team
that's focusing on things like testing
and automation and linting and
distribution and all that which is
really important and I'm gonna go into a
little bit more about that and later on
we also have our accessibility team this
team used to be separate from our team
and historically our tests that would
get flagged would happen towards the end
when things are about to go into
production and there's this whole like
testing blitz that has to happen we
moved the accessibility team under our
umbrella and now this happens at the
beginning of the cycle instead of the
end of the cycle because as I mentioned
it's important to make it in from the
beginning so it's really great because
they can might work with us to make sure
that the code were writing is proper and
semantic and accessible very much like
the the previous stuff which I thought
was awesome
and then we have a prototyping team and
this team consumes what we create and
like rapidly prototypes and test designs
that the designers are creating and then
we have our federated design systems
contributors and these are distributed
throughout the organization they help
keep the design system honest accurate
useful because it's really solving the
problems that they have
so this federated team is made up of our
product and our platform designers
our user researchers we have what we
call embedded UX engineers and these are
additional prototypers that kind of
dotted line report under these teams
even though they're also reporting to us
so they can kind of help make sure that
the system the design system is being
used and people are using our patterns
our production engineers these are the
actual engineers working on our code of
our actual product that goes out and
things like doc writers localization and
so on so we have all these people from
across the organization that contribute
and collaborate with us so that was the
team model the next initial thing that I
think it's really important especially
if you're not starting from scratch
you're trying to implement a design
system for a product that already exists
is to conduct a UI inventory you audit
your I you I categorize everything by
the different types of components and
their variants so these are things like
collecting all sorts of popovers and
overlays tab sets things like indicators
which are like showing a state of
something or something loading or the
progress of something you collect all
these together you group them and then
you can standardize and consolidate and
it's important to take copious component
notes so this is you know all the things
like you know what are the responsive
behaviors of that component what are all
the variants what are all the states
what are the keyboard navigation
requirements the accessibility
requirements any other open-ended
questions who are the people involved
working on this thing a really great
quote from my good friend Miriam Suzanne
says if you don't document something it
doesn't exist so it's important to
document that because if you don't it's
just it's just not gonna happen I also
think people get really caught up on
terminology like it's a sanella it's
just a component is this a region is
this is in in my eyes of doing this UI
in Vitoria it's really all components
you might have tiny components can
seen by bigger components it's all
components and then I think it's really
important to mention what we like to
call special snowflakes sometimes you're
gonna have something that just does not
really need to be a component in the
system this could be like your very
unique always changing homepage or maybe
you have a very specific component for a
very time-sensitive feature that's out
very like very limited it's not really
being shared it's good to document those
and keep you know be aware of those but
it doesn't really need to be in your UI
library so with all that knowledge that
we've gathered we created our design
guidelines and obviously these are
things like color type icons or patterns
for things like inner interaction
patterns navigation when D is a modal
when D is a drop-down when D is you know
basically anything in our design system
so I see a lot of awesome style guides
that come out and they always show
they're like beautiful color palette and
it's good to show that it's good to see
like okay these are our brand colors but
I think it's also important to indicate
like how do you use color and when do
use these colors so when do these colors
get applied to visual messaging or how
do you use color to show visual
differentiation how to use color for
visual hierarchy and by having this
documentation we found that it's really
awesome for when we hire new designers
they can get on board very quickly
Katie Basie has a designer that joined
her sales cloud team wrote a medium post
of her own and she talked about how
design systems she has found helped her
like onboard very quickly and hit the
ground running as a interaction designer
she said freed from some of the daily
tedium that can come with being a
designer I can shift the bulk of my time
and energy to looking at the bigger
picture and so what she was meaning like
she doesn't have to think about how many
pixels is this UI element from
right or from the top what color is it
supposed to be rather instead she's
sketching user flows and thinking about
navigation patterns and like what the
feature is actually supposed to achieve
so sketching is also really important
I love seeing designers just take marker
to paper and not think that they have to
photoshop something to pixel perfection
right away just thinking through like
what does this feature supposed to do
and it allows their designers to focus
on the right questions at the right time
dianna mounter is a designer that works
at github formerly of Etsy and she wrote
a series of presentations and articles
called empowering designers to code and
in that one recent article about
empowering designers code she said true
collaboration isn't throwing designs
over the wall its designers engineers
and the rest of the team sharing the
responsibility to build a quality
product so empowering designers it's
really important if if you can get your
designers working much more efficiently
iterating especially if you can get them
in the browser like this is really
awesome not just for efficiency but it
you know if your designers understand
like how these features are really going
to work it's it's amazing and empowering
our developers you know if you can
provide scalable responsive accessible
code at the beginning of the development
cycle rather than trying to push them
towards it at the end let's our
developers focus more on like the logic
and you know there's things conditionals
and things that are supposed to happen
rather than how things look we also have
a lot of platforms and devices that may
or may not be web you know I mentioned a
lot of stuff about web but we also have
tablets and phones and other things to
consider and as I mentioned before a lot
of products so how do we maintain
consistency across a massive
organization
and how do we make feature visual design
changes faster and in I mentioned
earlier that we have developers that are
building in our ecosystem we don't know
what stacks are on they could be in Ruby
they could be in C they could be in PHP
they could be a node they could be in
all sorts of different stacks so we need
our design system to be agnostic to what
they're doing and minimize our
dependencies so that our design system
can be leveraged in more places so for
us our single source of truth or what we
created and refer to called design
tokens and design tokens are starting to
get used by some other organizations
Target Walmart Nathan Curtis who I
mentioned earlier is starting to use it
with his agency so I'm really excited to
see this starting to take off so design
tokens are essentially like the
subatomic elements of a design system
they're basically named entities that
store design values so if you're
familiar with CSS preprocessor
preprocessors or even you know CSS
variables they're essentially variables
but we use them in a way that helps a
scalar design across not just the web
but also native applications so these
are everything from your typography
Styles your color Styles shadows spacing
sizing animation durations Z indexes or
Z&amp;amp;X is depending on where you're from
breakpoints like all the things that
like in CSS would come after the Kohen
you could store as the design token and
our designers refer to these tokens in
their specifications so instead of
specking that a button has 16 pixels of
padding on the left and right they say
that it has spacing medium from left and
right and this way the their design
system is or the design specs are always
accurate and if we make any changes that
will propagate through this we found
this was like super awesome like we have
automated testing the check if
a color is not contrasted enough like
text color against a background and
before we would have to notify like 30
different teams that they needed to
change this color and now we change it
on RN and it propagates through the
build system and they just get that
change for free the way we did you do
that it's a tool called Theo that we
open sourced it's how we generate these
design tokens so the way that works is
you have a JSON or a llamo file
depending on your choice and you store
these design attributes that I mentioned
before and we then convert that to
lightning which is our internal platform
sass lesson stylists JSON for iOS XML
for Android our style guide is generated
off of it and we even generate color
swatches for Photoshop and sketch users
within the organization this is just a
continuous integration environment so as
we make these changes they come to the
developers for free so an example of
what that looks like in the top left
sorry I'm running out of time I'm gonna
carry we have our JSON file which names
and names the token gives it a value
give it a comment if you need on usage
guidelines on the top right you see SAS
the version of that in the bottom you
see our lightning version which is what
we use internally and we've taken to
account things like what do those color
formats need to be for each of these
platforms like 8 digit hex for Android
versus RGB a things like dimensions you
know using androids density-independent
units versus using REMS or m/s for CSS
so you can go to our documentation later
to see what our tokens are so I'm gonna
just go right through that and here's
the swatches so in naming these tokens
we found semantics definitely matter we
use a generic to specific pattern so we
can we started with the category prefix
which is like color texture color
background
where's his token use
a button but is this a variant of a
button like button secondary are states
like hover and things like maybe this is
an inverse button on a dark background
so we named them all in a very
contextual way so we know how these
tokens are used and then if you have
common things that are shared like maybe
you have multiple uses of the same blue
we create what we call aliases so here's
where we name presentational e what are
tokens are and then the semantically
named tokens will reference the
presentational aliases so we store it in
a very raw format or it's all caps and
underscored but then we can Thea will
convert to hyphenated and lowercase for
SAS less and then like Ora uses
camelcase for very specific reasons so
it can like do that format for you so
basically anything that's before the
colon like any CSS property like that is
something that you could consider a
category for your tokens so I'm gonna go
through these real quick for time sake
as I mentioned these will be available
later so the important thing is that we
have no more hard-coded values if you
want to check Theo out and contribute
back or give us feedback you can go to
write github and let me see that so for
a CSS framework we felt it was very
important to keep just be very lean
about it only build things when we need
it don't build a kitchen sink framework
if you're only gonna use like three
things in that framework and you might
have known to notice I mentioned tokens
icons HTML CSS but I didn't mention
JavaScript and this was a very conscious
decision because we have to be agnostic
and we have developers using lightning
react angular jQuery and so on and so
what we do instead on RN is we rely on
our information architecture and
documentation to demonstrate what the
outcome should be and then let the
developers use the framework that makes
sense for their environment when we show
a component in the code for that
documentation
the right we have States invariants and
so we can say okay I want to see what
the focused version of this is and we
change out the example to show the focus
version and as you can see here and then
we also change the code so you can see
okay I need to use JavaScript to swap
these classes out and then underneath we
go into more detail if you have any like
Aria roles or like tabindex changes or
anything like that that needs to happen
and any other JavaScript or
accessibility needs we put in the
overview underneath that component we
have to be forward-thinking well being
backward compatible I'm sorry I'm going
over we always because of the nature of
our work we have to support three
versions at the same time because we
release three times a year which for
small companies that seem slow but for
big enterprise companies that's actually
really fast so we're always supporting
our current production release which is
what you see now we always support our
previous release because we don't want
to leave any of our developers behind
and we have to support our future
releases so a thing that comes up a lot
with this is deprecation so it's a very
common technique in software development
we always flag our components if they're
deprecated so people know but that also
requires a lot of you know reading the
manual to know and we were also thinking
we would just comment like to do remove
this inversion blah blah blah it's not
really maintainable so we created
another open source tool called SAS
deprecated because we use SAS on our
team since we're using SAS why not use
that for what it's good at so the way we
do that is we store a variable called
app version we say this is the version
we're on right now and then we store a
variable of a future version this is
where you want the code to deprecated
and then you can also add a message
which is like this is deprecated because
of such-and-such use this instead so in
version one you might have a button icon
and then in version 2 you might decide
you know I'm gonna deprecated this
because it's no longer necessary so you
wrap it in that mixin you say deprecated
this in version 3 and here's the comment
people will see instead and then once
you hit version 3 that code will no
longer compile and you'll get we have
tests running to let you know ahead of
time like hey you're using deprecated
classes and the great thing about this
is if you don't do this like CSS can
kind of just grow and grow and grow as
you move on because you deprecated
things but you don't really make the
effort to remove it by wrapping all your
deprecated things you kind of keep your
CSS at a more maintainable level by just
not outputting those things anymore once
it hits the point that you want it to
disappear so that's also on our github
if you want to check it out and then
there's a design ops article where you
can read about what design ops are I'm
running out of time so when you get the
slides later go read the article and it
describes like how design ops basically
helped fidelity get to the user at a
much higher quality and the important
thing around design ops is like keeping
things alive so I see so many style
guides get released and published and
then they just die of really slow and
painful death and I like to call these
zombie style guides it's really
important to keep your style guides
living and a lot of this is done through
automation but I also think again as I
mentioned before human guidance is
really important to really make things
succeed and survive and so as I
mentioned this is a product like it's a
product serving other products so that
involves support any good product has
good support so we support our adoption
through education and consultation so we
have what we refer to as advisory boards
like twice a week developers and
designers can come meet with us and show
their designs we give them feedback or
they can ask us the assess questions
it's like are a lot of time to help the
organization keep this going and
evangelizing this internally to not just
your internal teammates but if you
have an external developer ecosystem
evangelizing to those external partners
and of course you always want to show
things like metrics and like how things
are improving like how many lines of CSS
are getting deleted how many features
are getting shipped faster because of
this cloudiness Sarai who's one of the
core SAS team ever says patterns are not
dogma they can change in adapt so as
much as like I like to make things very
consistent and standard I think a really
good design system must be allowed to
evolve and iterate so don't be just like
a dictator about it be collaborative and
allow people to contribute back I
mentioned things are open-source you can
check things out I think it's good to
open-source your design system and share
if you're really into this kind of stuff
I have a slack called Design Systems you
can go to design systems that Heroku app
calm and just automatically be invited
and next year I will be doing another
Design Systems conference for clarity
I'll post more details about that later
