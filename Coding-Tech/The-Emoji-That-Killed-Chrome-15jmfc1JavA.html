debugging story with you and I just it's
it's not really maybe in the end the bug
is not terribly complex but I still feel
it contains all of the essence of what I
find exciting about programming you know
and that is the unexpected so one day a
bunch of my co-workers came back from
lunch and they discovered that
everyone's coffee of Chrome had crashed
and it would just keep crashing I was
like no you could not open crash
so obviously productivity plummeted to
zero and and I thought this was
wonderful already but but you know first
principle of debugging you isolate what
changed and you know so the question was
what was there just like a chrome update
and that killed everything but there was
nothing online no no evidence that this
was anywhere else but here's we're like
well what else you know what else
happened you know in our environment and
the only other thing is we had bought
this printer and then we got suspicious
because we had named the printer an
emoji we had named it printer emoji
so we unplugged the printer right and
chrome stopped crashing and then we
plugged it in again and boom all
everybody's copy of Chrome on the entire
network crashed and so okay hey you know
obviously we start debugging this but I
have to say okay I said this is this is
the greatest day of my life that's how
excited that's how excited I got I get
about issues like this so what was the
first thing first approach for this so
the first thing that I did is they dope
into gdb on on the system now this is
actually only Mac OS Chrome this was a
company with a lot of almost everyone
was running Mac's so pretty pretty
dominant on Mac OS you'd usually use ll
DB but old dogs new tricks I'm sort of
more comfortable with gdb so anyway we
see here that like chrome is crashing in
str ln the c standard library function
get the length of a string and so that
initially is really exciting because
something terrible is
happening right but we go into a chrome
he's an open-source although we'll get
to more of that later but at the very
least we can always we can always
disassemble we can always look at the
registers that's one of my favorite
things to do the the registers after a
program has crashed often tell such a
fascinating story they tell us all sorts
of places it's been but in this case I
actually it's a pretty boring registered
at we can see that in particular like
the stack is fine all these things are
fine and RTI which is the first argument
to STL n is zero so we just have a null
pointer dereference it's still exciting
because we can reduce productivity in
the office to zero anytime we want but
you know we can't we can't necessarily
make chrome dance for us so the next
step is well what's happening what is
the printer doing and so we turn to an
excellent tool called TCP dump and there
actually is a an amazing zine that just
came out
that's that should be available here I
think maybe that will talk that will
tell you all about TCP dump and how
wonderful it is and and and how to use
it so I won't tell it say too much about
that but I do want to mention paired
with that is another tool that I really
love which is called TCP replay which
allows you to replay packet dumps so you
TCP dump spies on your network shows you
what packets are going by your
networking interface a TCP replay lets
you replay those packets right so this
is a way for us to figure out what what
traffic is actually causing this problem
and so we apply an idea from property
testing and if you don't already know
what property testing is and you don't
already do it you should come up to me
afterwards and talk to me about it
because I think it's a really important
idea and actually we have the author of
an excellent C property testing library
called theft here with us as wonderful
libraries you should check it out but a
really interesting idea from quick check
and all these things is the shrinking of
inputs so you have some we captured a
bunch of traffic where the printer was
spewing out its weaponized
Mogi and you know and then we we bisect
it and we we chop it down until TCP
replay is just playing back you know
just the packets that are causing this
problem it turns out it's these two
packets and then nicely we can package
into a script you know Starbucks Sh that
triggers the problem wherever we like
you know it's very very convenient but
so what are these packets so these are
these are mdns packets which is the
multicast DNS and of course it's like
notable I immediately looked at the RFC
oh actually I'll get back to that I
would be looked at the RFC and there's
this sort of quote that I enjoyed that
you know the the obvious elegant
solution is that everything should be
encoded as utf-8 and of course so we
look at these packets this is what the
the packet looks so and mdns is the you
know basically so DNS is this glue that
that sort of essentially keeps the
internet together em DNS is this is this
is a very similar protocol but just for
local service discovery but something
that's interesting about it is it sort
of changes the kind of the inverts the
relationship between servers and clients
because basically unlike DNS where
you're asking a server for something in
EM DNS you're just constantly being
bombarded by packets from every device
on your network like this printer right
but anyway so this printer is
advertising itself we can see that the
service name 1f v a8 downstairs printer
downstairs that actually worked right
but this TX TTY registers so this is
some kind of Google Google Cloud Print
thing that I don't understand that's
some new feature but that the type
record here is obviously not encoded
correctly and so we look at this so
something that I mean I noticed emojis
have been a part of every successful
talk here right so we can't deny their
vast importance but you know so one of
the right ways that you mode
are represented is Unicode which has
this large space and then you have
different ways of how do you actually
represent Unicode on the wire so the
most common way and what mdns is
supposed to use is utf-8 which is
actually this really elegant encoding
except for the fact that there's lots of
there's lots of sequences of bytes you
can generate that aren't valid utf-8
right and in this case the printers is
spewing out f 0 8 D a 0 BD F 0 8 D v6 a
8 so this sequence it's twice as long as
what we would expect and it turns out
that this is like a utf-8 encoding of a
utf-16 encoding of the printer emoji
right so some classic a classic kind of
problem but wasn't wasn't caught in time
anyway why does this cause chrome to
crash so luckily of course there's a
sort of an open source version of chrome
called chromium and we were able to
reproduce the problem there you know and
it turns out that it's like this very
simple problem so we can see here that
we're creating this this string and
initializing it with these bytes that we
received off the wire which is always
always a tenuous thing I think you
always want to be very careful when
doing that although in this case it's
not nearly as much fun as we had hoped
the key thing here is we're asking for
this NS utf-8 string encoding and if we
actually look at the core foundation
documentation this says well this
returns nil if record bytes isn't valid
utf-8 and so it isn't so that's where
our null pointer dereference comes from
so turns out the the fix that you know
restores productivity in the office is
just this like almost a one-liner kind
of thing and so yeah I said you know
submitted that and unfortunately the the
because it was technically a security
issue the the bug was sealed for a long
time and it took some poking and patches
before it kind of finally got fixed but
you know and so all's well that ends
well except that actually you know this
printer is still lurking right it's
still sending out its weaponized packets
and I tried to contact HP to report this
there was just no way to get in contact
with anyone responsible
and probably it's hard to fix anyway
it's probably you know the upgrading
that firmer is difficult but consider
this their their public shaming in any
case you know it was a really simple
thing in the end but it just was lovely
going through all these systems and
having this such an unexpected huge
result from such a tiny thing I think is
is really be the essence of you know
they be unexpected which is is what's so
exciting about programming so anyway I
think if there's a moral to that story
it's that everyone should go out and
stuff every input field with emoji thank
