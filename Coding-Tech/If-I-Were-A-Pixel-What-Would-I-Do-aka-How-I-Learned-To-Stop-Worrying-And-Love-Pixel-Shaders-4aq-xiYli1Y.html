rope Ixil what would I do or how I
learned to stop worrying and love pixel
shaders and the reason for that is that
pixel shaders are essentially thinking
like a pixel or something along those
lines at least it's the decision process
of like how am I going to choose to
color this pixel on the screen and it
it's kind of surprising actually like if
you look at this scene that I created
here it's it's fairly complex you've got
like a landscape and clouds and stars
and a sunset and that kind of thing but
I made this in a Sunday afternoon and
that might might be a bit surprising but
I want to take you through some of the
techniques that you actually go with can
use to produce graphics like these and I
think that once you get past a certain
stage of understanding then doing things
like this becomes incredibly easy so
yeah so the purpose of this talk is to
just introduce pixel shaders and the
OpenGL shading language also known as
GLSL to provide an intuitive
understanding of 3d graphics algorithms
so so you might not get all the details
but if you can kind of gain an intuition
on how this is done then that's that's
what I want you to take away from this
and to demonstrate that it's easier than
you might expect to create complexity
from simplicity so first up is thinking
like a pixel so pixel shader like I said
it runs on the GPU and its purpose is
just to calculate an RGB a color value
that's all it does so if you're familiar
with like the C programming languages it
should look immediately obvious to you
we've got this type here called a vector
that's basically an array of four
numbers essentially and so this this
vector is basically producing the color
output when I assign it to the GL frag
color I can actually change this in real
time and kind of just explore different
color options but it's not especially
interesting when you're only looking at
one color right so that's
the beginning point of your shading but
it takes all kinds of pixels to make a
world and how do you know which pixel is
which if this is the same code that runs
on for every single pixel on the screen
shaders have two kinds of inputs they
have varying inputs which for each pixel
will have have a unique input and then
they have uniform inputs which for all
pixels they receive the same input data
so a good example is the GL frag quad
say that that tells you your current XY
coordinate for your pixel and if you
input it into the shade of the
resolution of the screen and you can
kind of divide your frag coordinate by
the resolution of the screen to find out
where you are on that that screen in a
normalized grid between 0 and 1 so in
this example I'm just taking the the
frag coordinate to generate the R and
the G colors and then the blue way just
use a sine wave with a time input to
kind of fade the blue in and out and you
just get like a little bit of variation
that's how you kind of know where you're
off when you're in a pixel shader and
it's kind of interesting but like you
can't really do too much with that I'm
sure you can but you know it's it's just
early days yet so so how do you make
shapes with these kinds of algorithms so
we should all be fairly familiar with
like like how to find the length of a
point from origin so X the square root
of x squared plus y squared so to do a
circle you're basically just saying my
shape is described by the lengths of
this point from origin as long as it's
less than the radius then you're in the
circle we're there so if I look at my
circle function here that's what what
that is we've basically got this great
built-in function that will calculate
the length of a point so just like
abstracts away all the details super
easy to work with and then we've got a
step function that says so if this
argument is greater than the second
argument it returns zero otherwise it
returns one so that's how we know in our
now circle
if we take that there take the tint that
we had from the last slide and take the
shape that we've created with a radius
of 0.8 if we multiply them together than
we are tinting our circle so this is
just like the kind of decision-making
that you go into creating shapes and
creating colors and gradients and that
sort of thing so the thing about pixel
shaders that's kind of a little bit
different to the way you'd normally
program things is that loops are
expensive because you want to put all
those pixels on the screen you want to
put them on the screen at the same time
otherwise you end up with tearing and
all kinds of weird weird artifacts so
loops are best to be avoided when you're
working with pixel shaders sometimes
you'll need them but try to minimize
them and you can get away with it by
taking your space your XY like between
zero and one if you scale that space up
but then take the fractional component
you can just repeat this space so at
very low cost I can take that circle
that I made before and I can just repeat
the space and have like as many circles
as I want so if I wanted to I could go
in and like change its number here for
instance and just have a lot more
circles yeah so that's that's how you
can get away with oops yeah that's how
you can get away with avoiding looping
with a really really quick
method but if you use the floor function
so if you remember the fraction you just
taken the fractional part of your your
number the floor function you're taking
the integer along the grid and so you
could use that to manipulate the
different cells on the grid so you can
get variation in your repetition as well
so these are some of the basic tools
that you start to use and just from
these alone you can start to make really
really complex things but we kind of
want to take it to the next level that's
just kind of 2d graphics 2d graphics of
fun I've done lots of like fractals and
all that kind of stuff in the past and
you can create really interesting things
but they generally become
very abstract quite quickly unless of
course you're using neural networks and
art then it's really interesting but 3d
is the kind of stuff that I'm really
interested in and I'm I became
interested in a couple of years ago and
how do you do these algorithms how does
what's behind making a 3d scene so the
two techniques that I came across that a
very is surprisingly simple for making
3d graphics one is that you have
distance fields and the other is Ray
marching and these are kind of two tools
that you can use to create really
interesting 3d graphics and yet you can
just see an example here we've just got
a sphere nothing particularly
interesting but yeah so about distance
field so a distance field takes a point
in some kind of like 2d or 3d or forty
halvard in many dimensions of space and
returns a scalar value back telling you
how far away you are from something so
in this example that I've got here you
can see that it gets darker and darker
and darker
up until this line here so this is the
zero point of the distance field and my
distance field is like morphing between
a circle and a square so at this point
here we know that we're touching the
surface of our distance field and this
this other colored part inside the gray
color that means that we're going into
negative values now we're going well
less than zero we're inside whatever
object we've got and I'll actually just
quickly like jump over and kind of show
you you don't necessarily need to come
up with all the shapes on your own
there's heaps of really good resources
you can just kind of like go and find
how to make various shapes there's also
a lot of techniques for combining
different shapes so you like just look
them up and use them it's it's super
easy once you've got that going and so
the next point we want to do is we're
gonna set the scene we want to like
create a 3d scene we're actually having
with we're modeling some 3d space and we
need to project it onto a 2d surface so
how do we do that well we we we have a
camera we decide where are we going to
put our camera in the case of this green
it's kind of a good idea like you use
the Z
xs/s depths so you place the camera
behind the screen and that's your origin
that's in it's actually kind of funny
with these algorithms because in the
real world light is emitted from a
source and bounces around a whole bunch
of times and then you receive it in your
eye but we do with computer graphics as
we do it in reverse because otherwise it
would be far too expensive so we shoot
rays out from the eye of the camera and
then we see what it intersects with so
this is what we do we decide where we're
going to place our count our camera and
we just use a three-part vector to place
it in 3d space and then we shoot from
the Ray origin through our pixel
coordinate and from the the Ray origin
and the origin the coordinate of the
pixel we can calculate the direct the
direction of that ray
so in GLSL this is just these three
lines
what's these three lines here so the
focal length if I was to change that to
one it's gonna be a weird fish I kind of
you it's gonna look really bizarre but
to is kind of a pretty good focal length
in general then we've got our Ray origin
which is just like placing the camera
when it's minus one and depth and then
our redirection we just subtract our
pixel coordinate at the zero depth and
and throw out the Ray origin times by
the focal length we we subtract that
from our pixel coordinate so that's all
you have to do to set up your most
simple camera but you can get a lot more
complex than that you can have like
crazy matrices and rotations and all
this kind of stuff this is just to get
you started and so the next technique is
Ray marching so ray marching is you've
basically you've got your your origin
you've got your direction and then you
just kind of step it forward forward
forward forward until it hits your scene
so I've got my kind of cool little house
on a hill thing and I step my Ray closer
and closer and once I've intersected the
house then I'm done that's that's what
rain watching is you're finding out when
you're going to hit your geometry
rain marching isn't especially efficient
there's some optimizations you can do
but it's really good if you want to do
sort of volumetric things so you're
imagine clouds that are kind of
translucent or have you know not not
completely opaque if you're integrating
from the point of the Ray origin to the
point at which it becomes opaque then
you can kind of see depth to things but
you can kind of optimize very marching
there's a technique called sphere
tracing which is really really useful if
you want to just render solid shapes so
you use for your tracing to like speed
up the number or reduce the number of
steps that it takes to hit your geometry
so in this case we take the distance
field that we have before and at step
one we calculate how far the distance is
and then we move our Ray closer by that
amount so this is the distance to the
geometry this is direction that we move
it we move it by that space and we know
once we get there okay let's check again
how we hit our geometry and so we
recalculate we run the distance field
again okay it's it's that far away let's
move a closer to here and you kind of
keep iterating until you intersect your
geometry but you can generally reduce
the number of iterations significantly
with sphere tracing so it's actually
really really useful if you want to have
common like real-time 3d graphics so in
in GLSL this is the Ray marching
function we've just got a for loop so we
start with the current distance of zero
and total distance of zero and we have
an upper limit to how far we want to
march our Ray before we go F you're not
gonna hit anything so we're just kind of
looping and we calculate our current
distance from our distance field which
is just a sphere then we increment our
total distance and we break the loop if
we've if we're less than or equal to
zero then we've intersected if it's gone
too far then don't keep going you know
just give up on it and that's it that's
all you have to do so the next part is
lighting and shading so once you get to
this stage
you've intersected your geometry now
what you need to do is you need to
calculate the normal vector so the
normal vector is like the surface of
your shape you want to calculate what
what's perpendicular to that point on
the surface so in this case here we've
got
this point here and that's the normal
vector
once that ray is intersected and then to
do lighting you take the direction of
your light source and you compare it
with the the normal vector and you can
see this this equation here essentially
you're doing a dot product of these the
normal and the light Direction vectors
which is basically just the same as a
cosine theta function so when the angle
when the angle is zero you've got one
you've got like maximum intensity of
your life and at a right angle the
you're going to end up with zero out so
that's how you shade the surface of your
geometry yeah so as you can see as a
length angle gets lighter the color on
the UM the color and the sphere is going
to get darker and this like a really
intuitive example it's just to think
about the moon it's a really good
example of lambert shading obviously
there's some cool textures and patterns
and stuff that are very rich but it's a
very intuitive way of thinking about
lambert cheating
so in GLSL what does that look like
we've got a white color which in this
case is just one we've got a position of
our light which is basically above and
behind the camera and then we've got the
direction of our light which we
calculate from the position of the white
and the point that were of interest or
the point that our Ray is at and then to
calculate our lambda shading we
calculate the dot product of the normal
in the light direction and we clamp that
between 0 and 1 so that we don't we
don't end up going out of bounds and
then we mix the ambient color that we
want for our scene with a light color at
the intensity of the shading and that's
how you make that sphere that's that's
all that's doing but how do we go from
spheres to sunsets I mean it's kind of a
bit basic but I think once you get past
part to the part of understanding how to
do a sphere it's actually not that much
of a jump really and and you'll be
surprised so the next part is like we
have fractal millions this is like the
secret source of making really really
rich geometry making things look like
natural
landscapes so I've just got a really
primitive noise texture but if I sum the
noise at different octaves and different
frequencies or different octaves of the
noise at different amplitudes and
frequencies and I can create more and
more rich noise and it starts to look a
little bit more like a cloud now but
that's just a really small simple
texture added to itself at different
frequencies and amplitudes and you can
just take this stuff and apply it to
your geometry to make really really
interesting shapes so we go back to our
sphere and if you look at my sphere
function here it basically got I'm
adding some some noise to it from my
point just a tiny bit of it though I
like I just add a tiny little bit bit of
noise to the surface and it kind of
looks pretty interesting but you can
also do some pretty interesting stuff
where like if you put noise inside your
noise then like you get some really
interesting shapes almost kind of like
turbulent shapes so you start getting
these these shapes to your um like we
had kind of cloud shapes all kinds of
stuff like that and it's just like put
your function in your function hang off
you go and what if you just add time to
that well n ends up becoming a lot more
interesting this is starting to look
kind of like a planet and if I go and
play with the color of this thing maybe
it'll look like us maybe it'll look like
something else so you can you can just
take noise and make us feel look really
interesting that easily it's it's loads
of fun so yeah Wow noise is really
powerful what if I make my own noise I
mean I make noises all the time why not
just like make some and see what happens
so so I also write music and I became
interested in this idea of how I can
make music and visuals interact with one
another so this is just a track that
I've written I'm playing kind of from
the midway point
and
and generating a noise texture from the
music and I'm using that to feed my
Machado and the this this shader is
basically created from just having a
plain deforms by noise and the clouds
they're basically the the noise inside
the noise creating these patterns in the
sky and then manipulating with this time
but it's kind of interesting that you
end up with like this sort of emergent
complexity when you take the sound from
your music and you create a texture from
it and then you feed it into your shader
every single time I do this it's
different it's kind of perplexing
because you're dealing with randomness
so sometimes it looks really cool
sometimes it looks less cool but like
yeah you I try to like manipulate the
randomness so that it always looks good
but it kind of varies all the time and
you end up with this kind of system that
just kind of does its own thing and
creates its own kind of landscape but
the cool part is that it kind of just
moves in time to the music and that it
kind of it's actually quite a simple
idea really it's not as complex as it
looks we've created the complex by
recursively making noise essentially
so just let this playthrough of it
so that was just like an interesting
thought experiment of like what if I
just made my own noise and manipulated
dynamically and created some kind of
motion and movement from that so what
are the main takeaways well you can do a
lot with just a pixel shader you don't
even have to look at the full GPU
rendering pipeline there's a lot more to
it but with just a pixel shader you can
create a 3d scene with distance fields
they're basically like the vectors of
geometry like most 3d graphics you'll
use a mesh and just like have points
everywhere and it's very meticulous to
create it with distance fields you're
dealing with pure mass and so you're
dealing with very discrete and
descriptions of things and so what
happens with that is you create this
kind of emergent complexity
some people use these techniques and
they use physics equations for example
Rayleigh scattering which describes the
way light scatters through the sky to
create sunsets and things like that and
and I was looking at these examples and
going like how did you make it look that
realistic and beautiful because I have
spent a lot of time trying to find the
right colors and do all this kind of
thing but actually when you just use the
physics equations the right colors fall
out like magic and it's just like you it
you've got this discrete tiny little
example to create something as beautiful
as an earth for instance and the the
really interesting part is because
you've got this discrete amount of data
like the output is many orders of
magnitude higher than the code that
generates it so that was only kilobytes
of code but it generates gigabytes of
visual output which is a really
interesting kind of property so with
that if you're a pixel shader what would
you do hopefully this kind of demystify
is all that kind of thing and maybe you
can kind of pick it up and approach it
for yourself you can add me on social
media I've got my soundcloud and my
shader toy count if you kind of want to
have a look at how the sunset shader
works it's a bit messy it's just like I
go in and tweak things and you know but
you can just comment things out to
understand what each part does and if
you want more resources
I really recommend checking out in IDO
kilos
he's got a lot of great tutorials on
this stuff um the book of shaders will
give you a much more in-depth view of
how to deal with shaders and how to
create millions and this tutorial here
on YouTube it's completely mind-blowing
you can create entire cities using
signed distance functions with enormous
emergent complexity just from simple
rules and it's surprising because for
the artist it's linear combining these
functions but the output is exponential
the complexity gets richer quicker than
you would anticipate so yeah that's it
