know you know this technology has been
around for a few years it was actually
sort of inspired by a guy named Satoshi
Satoshi Nakamoto who invented blockchain
or actually applied blockchain I should
say an event at a protocol called
Bitcoin a cryptocurrency now people have
been since that time people have been
trying to figure out well could we apply
this technology to various other use
cases such as in finance
not just for a cryptocurrency purposes
but to facilitate in healthcare right
you could use blockchain technology to
securely transmit you know things like
you know drug dispensing activity at a
hospital to ensure that that can't be
tampered with and then supply chain you
know think about supply chain
transparency understanding where did you
get these potatoes that went into your
but you know into your french fries and
and we have the ability to think about
how we might instrument all these
different types of activities in
essentially antagonistic type
environments and yet know that the
information could be trusted that
everybody actually shares the same copy
of information this is essentially what
blockchain of distributed Ledger's are
all about now
as I mentioned you know before we
started the hyper ledger project last
year and in fact it was almost exactly a
year ago this week that we launched the
foundation the technologies that were
available many of them open source but
here's the problem many of them had
limited throughput so Bitcoin for
instance Bitcoin can sustain about a
grand total of seven transactions a
second woohoo so anybody who's been
working on any kind of enterprise
systems know that ain't gonna cut it for
just about anything right so if you want
to apply that technology to your ERP
system for instance to track all the all
the shipments and invoices and whatnot
that that go on in your enterprise it's
not going to do it slow transaction
finality or confirmations so in the
Bitcoin world for instance it takes
actually a min
ten minutes to finalize a transaction
and it could take as much as 20 or 30
minutes before you know that if I went
and tried to exchange some Bitcoin with
Todd that that actually went through and
it actually happened and that means that
that money can't really be used for the
next 10 or 20 30 minutes it was designed
for cryptocurrency and this is something
that actually freaked out a lot of the
enterprise CTOs and so forth that we're
starting to think about how they might
apply this technology in their
enterprise cryptocurrency I mean
essentially was designed by anarchists
right and so you know the bank and to
disrupt banking in particular and so the
banks aren't going to go down the path
of embracing Bitcoin poor governance
right this is you know this is inherent
in something like you know the DAO
attack that happened late last year
actually where somebody actually got in
and you know that they had set up and
established this distributed autonomous
organization where the software the
smart contract essentially was the
governance for this community this
distributed community and there was a
known bug in the smart contract and some
guy exploited it and started draining
money out of the account of the etherium
foundation to the tune of about 50
million dollars now you could say
ethically whether or not that was a
right or wrong thing to do but it was
legal right and so then you have this
problem that the rest of the people in
the Commuter like well that was bad he
shouldn't do that let's let's vote him
off the island and so they effectively
did that and they forked and now there's
two different communities that's sort of
the classic and the the next generation
but again there was no real decision
beforehand about well how do we handle
the dispute like that where somebody
legally takes advantage of some loophole
or a bug in the software right and
figures out well how are we going to
manage that how are we going to manage
any kind of dispute resolution around
something like barching we have for most
of the technologies that were available
there was no real privacy there was an
on em
right but there wasn't really privacy
and confidentiality so you know if if
we're exchanging information universally
well if I'm to financial institutions
and I'm trading bonds or other kinds of
instruments I don't necessarily want
anybody to know what I'm doing just the
two of us Todd and I should be the only
two to understand what we're trading and
Jim should have no idea right because if
Jim finds out that Todd and I are
trading on IBM he's gonna either go buy
and sell IBM right so we need to have
that and again if we're going you heard
what Bruce said earlier if we're gonna
rely exclusively on cryptography and
encryption to provide confidentiality
well most banks most financial
institutions are just just unwilling to
go down that path so we need better
solutions for confidentiality and
privacy now again most of the
technologies have been designed for this
sort of permissionless environment where
anybody can join right and they join
anonymously right and that was actually
a problem for most enterprises they want
to have a network that people understand
that they understand who is involved
something we call a permissions network
where it's basically by invitation and
we can build you know we can construct a
governance model maybe a legal framework
for how we're going to deal with dispute
resolution within the confines of this
particular private network something we
call a consortium Network and again as I
mentioned there was really no settlement
finality in a lot of these systems
because you can indeed and in that in
the Bitcoin world or in aetherium as we
saw with the Dow you can permanently
Fork and so therefore there is the
potential that if somebody doesn't like
the outcome they could convince
everybody else will this all go this way
instead so that was the problem again
this is a technology that is essentially
perfect for open source right it's
potentially very revolutionary we don't
want to have any one player in the
ecosystem that controls all of it we
don't want it to be monetized only by an
IV amber somebody like that
we want it to be used universally by
multiple parties it requires special
skills and it requires a diverse set of
special skills right you have to have
deep cryptocurrency crypto crash
cryptographic capabilities deep
understanding of distributed computing
containerization databases database
query engines and so forth there's a
whole lot of different disciplines that
are required to build this technology
effectively and it needed a strong
governance model so you know I about a
year ago or next year and a half ago I
gave Jim a call and said hey we're
thinking of doing this and he was like
this is like this is perfect this is the
perfect project so we established the
hyper ledger project or organization
almost exactly a year ago this week and
again it's the intent is to develop open
source for blockchain and distributed
ledger technologies hosted obviously by
the Linux Foundation and it would be a
global initiative right and in fact it's
it's it's turned out to be exactly that
again our goals obviously to develop and
create open source solutions for these
technologies right to provide that
neutral open governance model to sustain
these things to develop a diverse
ecosystem of communities to educate the
public and government and so forth on
what this technology is how it can be
applied and to educate ourselves by
bringing people together to help us
explore different ways that the
technology might be used in various
industries right and then again to
provoke this notion of a community of
communities and in fact that's exactly
what we've done I'll get to a second in
terms of the leadership but brian
behlendorf who Jim mention a little bit
earlier sort of came with this notion
that this isn't just about one project
or even just a couple of projects we
want to create sort of this umbrella
organization where we're dealing with
potentially bringing together all
different diverse approaches to how we
might solve this problem because again
as I mentioned we are trying to solve so
difficult gnarly problems a lot of the
consensus research that's going on today
is really sort of bleeding edge right
nobody really knows how are we going to
get past seven transactions a second to
get to the scale of this technology
that's going to be usable and useful to
enterprises that are trying to get to
thousands of transactions per second or
even beyond and so we've created the
hyper ledger project with this notion
that it is an umbrella organization
where we're gonna have a set of
framework so we've about three and I'll
talk about those in a bit and then maybe
we have a number of different other
capabilities that we build out around
whether it's tooling to help provision
and deploy it like cello two to deploy
chain code or what we call you know
smart contract languages things these
are tools that essentially facilitate
the use of these other platforms and
that's exactly what we've got mandala
tersh 'ip so a year ago today we hadn't
yet hired an executive director and I
know Jim has really psyched about this
but brian has really been sort of the
perfect person to fit the role of
executive director for the hyper ledger
project and I think he actually travels
more than I do which is saying something
but he's out there really sort of
constantly helping people understand
what we're doing and he's really done a
fantastic job of growing the
organization Blythe masters who is a
chief executive of digital asset
Holdings is our board chair that ugly
buy the third one there chairs the
technical steering committee and then
Deanna pray also from digital asset
Holdings is the chair of the marketing
committee we started out with I think it
was eleven Premier members and we're now
up to thirteen and I think there's a few
others in the pipeline some really
interesting ones most recently we had
Airbus and American Express join us as
premier members but most importantly
we've been growing the general
membership population considerably
we started with 30 which was in and of
itself it was amazing
we started with 30 we're now over a
hundred and ten members total almost a
hundred general members have joined
since which is a two hundred and seventy
percent growth that's really fantastic
and then we've we established a new
class of membership for associate
members so that we could get other non
nonprofits and and NGOs and and various
regulatory bodies to come and also
participate in join and what we're doing
there and so actually this afternoon
Brian gives his talk on hyper ledger
he's gonna talk a little bit about
sovereign and the role that they're
going to help play in setting up some
identity work in the hyper ledger
project you know from a marketing
perspective it's been a huge hit it's
really garnered a whole lot of attention
surprising amount actually with about
600 or more hits in any given month I
mentioned that we had two hundred and
seventy percent growth this just blows
my mind because actually you know the
the largest open source Foundation which
is OpenStack didn't grow this fast so
that's just something to sort of keep in
the back of your mind there we now have
five top level projects and I'll talk a
little bit about those 149 engineers
contributing to these various projects
we've got a diverse technical leadership
you know we started where each of the
premier members got to designate an
individual to represent them on a
technical steering committee and about
halfway through the year we said no
we're gonna have an election those who
are contributing meaningfully to the
project get to select their leadership
and we actually do have a very diverse
technical steering committee over 660
500 commits now this isn't sort of
OpenStack territory yet but it's it's
getting there
we our SWAT community had fifty four
hundred plus people in it and we had a
problem because we actually couldn't
keep more than two days worth of history
in slack so we got rid of slack and we
now are using rocket chat and self
hosting that within the Linux Foundation
again a really solid example of why it's
so fundamentally important to put these
projects in an open governance situation
that's funded
so that we can actually run and stand up
our own tooling and not be dependent on
some third party providers like slack to
give us hope you know free free chat
services but you know to think about you
know we get 10,000 messages that can be
in searchable archives from slack and we
use that up in two days that's mind
blowing we have nine different working
groups including a technical working
group that we established in China just
sort of help bridge the different
communities there's an awful lot of
interest in blockchain in China and
there so they're doing a lot of work
around translating you know the output
the minutes of the technical steering
committee some of the documentation for
the various projects but they're also
there to help bridge these two different
worlds where the engineers are speaking
very different languages and they're
separated by at least 12 hours of
timezone we have a global meetup
community ecosystem with 38 different
meetup groups scattered all around the
globe with 80 600 plus members and and
these you know there are you know this
is in addition to the sort of the
generic block chain type meetup
communities but there's an awful lot of
interest as I mentioned the hyper ledger
we have had eight bimonthly face-to-face
meetings of the technical community
where we all sort of get together and
not only sort of share what it is that
we're all doing and updating everybody
on on the various status of the various
projects but also to work on talking
about and starting to engage in cross
project collaborations you know that
start to fulfill the vision that Brian
has for this notion of an umbrella
organization where we have multiple
projects and we drive towards inner
integration and interoperability we had
a member summit back in December which
is the first time to bring the entire
hyper layer community together over a
hundred different members came and
participated in that that was really a
quite a quite a great event from my
perspective it wasn't your typical
conference it was an awful lot of sort
of interaction out in the hallways
really and it wasn't just about the
presentations it's really more about the
just like this this event here
is where it's really about people
getting together and talking about where
they're gonna go with this stuff so I
mentioned we have five top level
projects you know when we started the
project there was proposals from a
number of different members of the
initial members of the community to
contribute various projects to be worked
on IBM was one of those Intel was
another and they had something called
sawtooth Lake which is a distributed
ledger technology platform that's was
implemented in Python in Intel research
with the with the with the intention of
providing an environment that you could
use to experiment with different
approaches to consensus for dealing with
smart contracts so a very flexible type
thing and they actually invented
something called poet so for those of
you who aren't deeply familiar with how
Bitcoin works but it does work on a
consensus model that's called proof of
work right with basically you solve a
puzzle all right something that's
designed to take about ten minutes so
you're gonna compute a hash basically
and it takes about ten minutes to do
this by most computational sources and
whoever gets it first wins a Bitcoin and
they get to mine a block well the
problem with that is it's very expensive
generates a lot of heat use an awful lot
of energy to do this computation and
again you've got thousands upon
thousands upon thousands of different
nodes all doing this Intel came up with
this really great idea of applying their
trusted execution environment SGX
to this notion that said a proof-of-work
we get a proof of a elapsed time so
we'll randomized essentially sleep come
up with some predetermined time for how
long you're going to wait before you say
I won oh no I didn't sorry and so they
developed this thing called poet out of
sawtooth lake and then they've also
developed some interesting things around
smart contracts
Aroha is our most recent addition this
was contributed by a fin tech startup in
Japan called Sri Mitsui and
collaborations with some academic
institutions in Japan
along with Hitachi and NTT and this is
sort of a very simple sort of hyper
ledger fabric if you will it's an
implementation of some of the very are
of the architecture of the hyper ledger
fabric I should say but it's designed to
be much more simpler less flexible less
modular but more applicable to solving
sort of point problems but their primary
focus is on sort of the the mobile side
of things and and the clients they've
developed for Android and iOS are
potential for building out clients that
can be sat atop of our third platform
which is fabric which was contributed by
IBM and digital assets and is probably
the the most active project of the three
the three the three projects and again
the fabric essentially is a blockchain
distributed ledger platform designed to
the architectural II modular orsucci can
substitute consensus encryption you can
substitute the backend data stores
pretty much in a plug in play mode with
the with the intent of being sort of
truly enterprise-grade software the
final two projects are that sort of
modular level that I talked about one
it's called cello which is orchestration
for deploying and provisioning
blockchain networks and then the final
one is blocked in Explorer which was a
user interface that allows you to sort
of introspect into the blockchain into
the into the ledger to understand what
the state is and how its how its
performing and so forth from a sawtooth
perspective they've had a couple of
stable releases published they just
published one in January they're
exploring adding these new transaction
families transaction families is what
sawtooth calls a smart contract they've
they've been working on improving this
notion of proof of elapsed time and
they've actually sort of got a version
two of that that they just predict
introduced to the rest of the community
last month and they've been working on
enhanced performance again the platform
itself wasn't
designed to be performing it was really
designed for experimentation but they're
finding that it actually has use
potentially is something that you might
deploy in your enterprise
Aroha is again their newest one the the
project was only added in late November
December timeframe and so they're
working on some improvements of their
deployment using darker swarm they're
working on some of the network stability
they also have a very unique approach to
consensus and they're trying to tune
that and then they're working also on
aligning the api's that they use with
the hyper layer fabric project to
improve the potential for
interoperability and integration of
those two and then finally fabric we
published a stable release in the fall
version zero six but we then embarked on
sort of an architectural refactor based
on a lot of the feedback we've been
getting from people who had been
deploying and using that particular
version of the software and we're on the
cusp now of driving towards our version
one at O that the release that we hope
will be sort of general availability
grade suitable for deployment in an
enterprise in a production context and
in fact we actually have our first
production deployment in the IBM global
finance solution is basically iBM has
has a program where we essentially
provide loans to some of our customers
and partners to buy our stuff and this
is you know it's about a forty four
billion dollar system overall but at any
given time you can have a hundred
million dollars in dispute and so we by
putting those transactions on a
blockchain we share the information with
all the different partners and we've
actually reduced the dispute resolution
time down from about thirty days to
about ten has actually netted us about
forty million dollars so that's you know
that's real money
and we're driving towards consolidation
right so we've been talking with Intel
about integrating poet into the hyper
ledger fabric we've been working with
Sarah Mitsu and the community around
Roja to integrate their api's
so that they can actually instead of
having to have their own unique bespoke
back-end they can apply their front-end
their client technology on top of the
hyper ledger fabric and then again
blockchain is looking the blockchain
Explorer is looking to sort of be able
to sort of sit on top of any of those
three top-level projects and then cello
is offering to support multiple backends
in its provisioning so come join us and
please come visit Brian session this
