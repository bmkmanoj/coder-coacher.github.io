my name is the animals own I have about
40 minutes worth of material that I have
to do in about 20 minutes so let's do
this so I'm an animator I don't have
time to show you my actual showroom so
just believe me this is kind of a
collage of the past three years there
are different shots that I worked on
anyway this is Frank and Ollie so like
Disney Legends back in the day they are
to the nine old men and in 1981 they
they published a book that is kind of
this compilation of things they learn
from like way back when like in the 30s
or whatnot and this kind of compilation
consisted of a lot of different concepts
and there's this famous list that you
can find they recalled like the Disney's
12 basic animation principles the it's a
list of course because humans love to
make lists and the number in which it's
put there is it's a little bit
nonsensical because it's not like if you
learn this thing you need to learn first
question stretch or what not so let's
just get rid of the list so think of it
as all these different concepts things
that you're gonna have to learn to to do
to master if you want to be a good
animator I am still learning you know
I'm not I'm not on some mountaintop
you know shouting down at everybody I'm
still a learning young boy trying trying
to do better every time and the thing is
if I had to like think about the all
these different concepts they all get a
little bit jumbled up because the way
they connect to one another there's like
that Venn diagram going on where it's
hard to explain something in a vacuum
you might remember let's see last year I
had a talk there was a massive failure I
had massive technical problems but the
the kind underpinning idea of it was
that as a hypothetical what if I had to
take those principles and I had to teach
it to a younger version of myself so
this guy doesn't know anything about the
principles at all
so that's kind of the challenge that I
put forth a little bit and this is the
way I would do it right now as of today
doesn't mean I won't change it up and do
something else like three years later or
whatnot so it's you know there's a
better
subjectivity going on there but let's
just start off with the list so if I had
to hypothetically talk to young caste
you know past version of me I would
strip away the numbers just for a second
just think of it as like individual
concepts and you know I would take away
straight ahead action and post opposed
because those things are workflow
related things they are not principle in
and of themselves
also it's missing layered action or
layered animation also appeal is the
thing you strive for it's not a
principle enough itself so take those
things out follow through an overlapping
action are two separate entities that
should not be combined so splitting
those two things up stating it was is
one of the broadest things out of all
the things there and it's it's insane
how many things it touches upon
cinematography directing acting choices
all those things so there's some
subjectivity in if I want to split them
up I could split them up in like ten
different things but I decided to split
them up into two categories two things
and then renaming some of these things
because if I go back
things like ease-in and ease-out better
name for it is spacing which is the term
that is used for animators in in the
field also it just threw a symmetry in
there because that's stuff that I use a
lot and I use it as a principle and I
get a lot of appeal out of it so you
know suck it that's what I'm gonna do
and then this is the way I would kind of
order things it was not easy to come up
with this list and I had to redo it a
couple of times also I don't want to
throw at you some definition some like
quotation marks from the masters or
whatever that you know spacing is the
blah blah blah as an example for this I
just want to show you examples that's
all I want to do and this is the list I
came up with given that constraint so
timing in rhythm just like a painter
just like an illustrator or whatnot you
have a canvas that you have to work
within it could be measured in
centimeters in pixels whatever it is but
that's your canvas so it's very much our
canvas also but the framerate is also
our canvas so it adds another dimension
to it another for stuff that I can't get
into now because of legacy or whatnot 24
frames per second has become kind of the
standard for frames
second and if you're learning animation
I would recommend starting off that way
and then going on from there if you want
to go 40 60 whatever it is or 12 frames
per second there's certain ways that you
would tackle that differently than 24
frames per second 24 frames per second
is a good starting place so you know
it's do the the kind of boring thing a
bouncing ball okay so you we're gonna do
just a basic bouncing ball so there's
gonna be a and a B that's gonna be up
and a down so it's basically as if you
just let go of a ball so there's gonna
be the extreme pose up and then let's
just say eight frames later whatever
good go down now we know these because
of gravity or whatnot it's gonna go a
little bit less up every time so a
translator up a translator down okay so
if you play it something wrong of course
inherently so it's doing all the right
poses but it's not actually doing it in
the frame rate in the dimension of time
it's uh what you it should be happening
of course is that those things shouldn't
be that even it should be squashed
together so it kind of punk bump up up
up up and if you do that or what's on
your thinking in those terms of thinking
in time now rhythm also kind of comes
into it because if you have a lot of
different acting beats happening let's
say you know you have a character is
who's doing this that this that this so
it's like five different things the way
those things happen if they're very even
you do this that this that this it's
going to be not as interesting as to
split up and do some it's do something
else with that rhythm so if you just
beat it out and you go hit hit hit it's
not gonna be as interesting as dun dun
dun dun or you know you can do different
things didn't then that does it as a
hypothetical layers and this is like an
acting exercise you know there's a
stream in front of you and you're
imagining what is the most interesting
way of crossing that stream so you do
you know you ask a lot of people to do
it and the least interesting way is
step step step step step that's like the
least interesting way of seeing somebody
do it more interesting is step step step
step step there's changes up the rhythm
a little bit so you cannot get a grasp
of that okay next up I don't have a lot
of time spacing that is you have the two
extreme you have like two extreme poses
and between every single keyframe
there's going to be some space in which
that thing travels so that's the space
now if I move my hand from A to B I
might slow it down so the spacing gets
really narrow the the the more I get to
the end final position which is kind of
slowing down so the further the spacing
the faster I'm actually traveling so you
might think of this as being kind of
blocked meaning these are all the
posters that we really need and then we
need to figure out what is happening in
between those poses so we got the
computer to just do it linearly you
would get something like this this
doesn't look good the spacing is all
kind of flat so if you just kind of look
at what what is happening there and I
put like lines there just to indicate
where it's the kind of center of mass
it's putting a breakdown in the straight
in the middle and then of course there's
gonna be a second breakdown it's also in
the middle and then you have some
in-betweens it's all kind of it's all
exactly the same space but what if you
just splined it it looks a little bit
better at the top gives a little bit
more natural but of course it gets all
wonky and looks kind of weird so we just
look at that it's gonna be exactly the
same way there's gonna be that breakdown
in the middle and then it's favoring the
beginning post in the favoring the end
post now these two versions are examples
of Spacey difference pacing but they're
automatic they're giving to us by the
computer and we need to do something
more intellectual I guess we need to
come up with what should the spacing be
so if I take a ball and I drop it it's
gonna favor the the topmost part so I'm
gonna do a breakdown there I'm gonna
favor the first part and then I'm gonna
do another breakdown that favors
and then the in-betweens and then it
looks better nice topic squats and
stretch
anything can be squashed and stressed to
a certain extent I mean if it's a
bowling ball then maybe not but maybe
you're exaggerating it it a little bit
of it but you need to remember it squats
and stress it's not squash or stretch by
that I mean you don't just take whatever
it is and just scale it down and you're
done it scaled down and scale out so it
always keeps the same consistent shape
or volume if you will you can push this
further of course and it always should
feel like it's the same density going on
so you don't want that you don't want
just scaling down scaling up because
then it starts to feel like if you just
imagine a liter of volume of something
it just feels like it's losing mass and
and gaining mass so out of the examples
that we just did how do we apply that to
this so we have exactly what we did now
we take the post where it kind of pushes
down hits the floor and we just squash
it down and stretch it out and then the
one just before that that's the one
where it has gained the most amount of
momentum so we do the flip side to that
exactly the opposite and on the way down
it's gaining that momentum so all the
other ones need to kind of go into that
and then come nice next topic arcs let's
say we have exactly the same thing but
now we have the ball and we just want to
push it give it a little bit of a nudge
in that direction okay so now we kind of
just have the blocked version of it we
have where it goes up where it goes down
it's all the same thing but now it's
just pushing it to the side so here all
the different extreme poses the thing is
you know you might take what you just
learned and apply it to this and go okay
draw straight lines figure out the
spacing the breakdown the problem is
you're doing straight lines when it
should be an arc because the momentum in
one direction is not necessarily going
to affect anything in the other
direction so if something's dropping
down and you push it that push in that
direction is going to be
it's it's physics it's physics it's
basic okay keep on going
so that looks more appealing looks cool
there's something wrong though based on
what we just learned we did there's this
question strats it's happening but it
looks weird it's because the squats and
the stretching should always be in the
direction in which things are happening
so just by tilting it because now we're
kind of going in this tilt yeah it's
just follow that okay that looks better
it's almost but it's better any given
like this failure here from last year
he's moving and if you pick any point in
his body he's moving in arcs and if you
if you forget that and you're animating
a character he's gonna feel like kind of
rigid and stiff and weird but and I am
actually a little too stiff at this
mission next topic let's say everything
is the same except like we have the ball
and it's going in one direction off I
guess
it's flip that direction but we're gonna
start from the ground so what happens
when we start from the ground it looks
like somebody just kicked it it came out
of nowhere like there's a lot of energy
that it got exerted but it came out of
nowhere so we're gonna squash it down
first and then we're gonna go there so
this is all about winding up if I want
to throw this thing I'm gonna go back
and then throw it so this is the
anticipation and this is exerting the
force it's like coiling a spring and
then spinning or whatever it is
this gives inanimate objects a lot of
agency so be aware of that so if you
have a ball and drop it and it just
bounces down you won't think that ball
is a human being or person or character
but if you do something like this now
all of a sudden that ball want it to
jump so there's a certain level of
agency that the viewer is going to give
it to it
next topic draw and follow through so
imagine that I imagine that I have a
yo-yo and you know and it's not actually
spinning but it's kind of on the string
and I want to go here and I want to stop
so if I start going that yo-yo it's
basically inertia that yo-yo wants to
stay put so it's like god it's like an
annoying toddler that doesn't want to do
what you say you want to do so you go
and the toddler's like no and then it'll
drag along finally with you
but at some point you stop you're like
telling the toddler stop and as I know
and it keeps going so that's so this is
the track where you have to drag that
toddler around and then when you stop
the the toddler is going to do that
follow through so there's not
necessarily a lot of agency in it but
it's it's basic inertia so here's what
it looked like with nothing animate at
all so I gave I gave this ball a little
weird pink ponytail thing so let's say
the ball is pushing up but instead of
just having it do nothing it's actually
wanting to be we're used to be so it's
dragging behind same way if it reaches
the top it reaches usually kind of an
ethical equilibrium and then on the way
down it wants to be there at that
equilibrium so it's like no I want to
still be up there and it kind of drags
behind that is drag but the
follow-through is when you as the ball
hits the ground and wants to go in
another direction that little annoying
toddler keeps wanting to go in the same
direction it used to be so it kind of
pushes down when it should be going up
and that's it a symmetry copy-paste it
the exactly the same saying the ponytail
thing but now it's kind of like bunny
ears and this guy's just kind of jumping
up and down
easy peasy problem is it's it's very
symmetrical and like if you thought of
it very objectively this is fine it does
what it should be doing but if you gave
it a symmetry then it's more appealing
like you strive for that appeal and this
is not just in the like the first
posting or the last posting this is like
throughout the entire animation you're
making sure that they're behaving
differently this also applies to poses
this applies to I mean all of these
things I'm really breaking it down the
bay to the bare bone basic levels and
this everything applies to bigger idea
so it applies to posting for example and
facial expressions in this case you have
exactly the same or pretty much the same
facial expression but the difference is
I went in there and I tweaked a lot of
these different little bones to give it
that ace
the tree so if I just flip it just
something a little bit more appealing
about it
next topic overlapping action this is
not to be confused with follow-through
or second direction but I'll talk to
talk about that later or the ball has
now graduated in becoming a ball boy
sure why not and if I post him in a pose
so this is pose a and then I want to end
him in a pose B so there's another post
there and if I just out of these two
things are these two connect streams if
I just made everything move at exactly
the same time it would feel weird it
would be like so like all these
different body parts all this stuff
would just flow I like to start and stop
at exactly the same time it just looks
weird so you have to do a breakdown post
and that one will start inferring what
is gonna be the overlapping action what
is leaving the action and what is kind
of being delayed and comes after
everything else so in this case for
example I'm doing the the eyes I'm
making the eyes you eat so going from
one post to you know making making the
eyes go first and by the way this is the
simplest version of this the more
breakdowns you then add to it the more
you start making all these smaller
decisions like the hands might not stop
at the same moment or what not but this
is one decision another one might be the
hips are leading the action
so maybe the hips go first and maybe the
arm swings first and then everything
catches up to it so overlapping action
starts touching less about inertia and
more about agency and acting choices and
just an example in the wild this is
Dixie and when he rotates around he's
leading with his chest so his so his
head kind of swings around catches up
with him so second direction
this is this is such a vague term just
on the liquid stick scale I'm giving a
talk right now but my second reaction is
drinking iced tea so think of it this
way so in this case you have you have
parents and the child and they're
talking to one another and what they're
talking about is what the scene is about
but they just happen to be eating right
now or not eating like picking their
food and that's the secondary action so
it's more of an acting choice you know
the this dude is putting himself some
iced tea while he's engaging with the
guy and and the cliche the the cliche
that will stick in your mind is actors
using cigarettes that is the cliche
because it can be kind of a crutch to an
actor so they're giving a performance
and they might give a performance but it
just happened to be smoking it doesn't
really interfere at all but they might
also use it to complement the primary
action or the primary acting choices so
in this case I think she's saying
something about paying and you can see
she splits upper line does a little
thing as you're paying so it now
complements the way she delivered that
line so by the way a secondary action
doesn't always have to be something like
the primary one is there talking and the
secondary one is like a thing they're
doing you can have you can be you can be
like dancing on the dance floor and you
happen to be smoking so like you're
dancing and you know the seeker is there
but like you know it's not the main
thing but you might be a smoker that
hasn't smoked the whole day and you're
like a heavy smoker and it's all about
the cigarette but you're on the dance
floor so you like smoking but you just
have to be dancing because so now you
flipped it around is it acting choices
alright
exaggerated everything I just thought
you told you about it can be pushed
further so squash stretch you could push
it further you can you can take arcs and
you can make them more extreme and push
them further you can take timing rhythm
and just wrap it up usually you take
posis and you wrap them so far that they
break like they don't make sense anymore
than you take them back the tendency for
for beginners is to just go a little bit
further a little bit for a little and
then you
don't end up where you need to be like
it takes forever just as an example
smile happy hungry more smile more happy
more hungry this also has to do with
like you know if you do a breakdown post
or whatever you know maybe it's leading
with the hips but maybe it's really
leading with the hips use it just push
it further
next topic consistency this applies to
like the world the characters the
animation style also so if you have if
you have a character it's very minute
this is why they do model sheets for
example so that Cinderella is the same
one from this shot to the next shot
otherwise you're like really confused
like who who at the slipper who with the
glass shoe I don't know understand
what's happening
so you do these model sheets and you
make sure it also bends on a lot of
variables like from what angle are you
seeing the character but this also is a
broader thing because if you have even
the same intellectual property and your
enemy this is the top one is from 2014 i
animated that one and i animated the
bottom one from 2060 that's the same
same guy and he's searching for things
or whatever but it's different animation
stuff so you can see it and I'm not just
talking about the character design but
the animation style itself though they
would not belong together in the same
world so there were choices being made
deliberately and then you have to stick
to those choices and work within those
boundaries so you know maybe stuff like
gravity is not a thing you know when
it's serves the purpose of a joke you
know you can't take things for granted
next topic this is this such a freaking
big one but just as an example so like
here you got eighteen three to seven you
got you got a shot where Bohr is the big
white guy he just got punched and he
fell on a dresser and on that dresser
there's gonna be a figurine holding a
razor blade and he's gonna notice it
he's gonna take it up and he's gonna
start using it into the fight okay let's
just talk about the elements that are
there so there's kind of a foreground
element going on there with a bust
there's the little figurine there's
poorest of course there's the agent and
then there's you know background stuff
you know sometimes that background stunt
will interfere but sometimes not it's
fine
so what if what if I think the you know
we can adjust this a little bit more
this it looks actually kind of weird
what if we took the camera a little bit
in change the lens and moved it a little
bit to the side that already feels a
little bit better now rotate borås so
it's facing us a little bit more the
figurine is facing him which would be
great if we saw things from his point of
view but we're not him so you know maybe
turn it around so then we have a like
nice silhouette of that figurine and
right now it's kind of in its no so
let's push that to the side and the HN
is kind of coming out of the frame so
let's push him back so yeah now we got
our frame took awhile and it's the same
information being relayed but one is
more appealing is the actual final shot
by the way so this applies also to just
clarity of posing I'm condensing so much
into small time so you know you're if
you're doing posing if something can
read just on a silhouette level that's
great and you want to strive for
something like that can't always do it
but you know that's great that's topic
readability and focus so if something 24
frames per second if some things there
for one frame it can kind of pass along
and then you you notice it but not you
don't read it it needs to be there for
at least two frames if it's 24 frames
per second that's gonna be 112 112 of a
second but if you hang on to it longer
it's going to be more readable to the
viewer so these are the three bouncing
balls first one is just one we've done
before second one it holds that extreme
pose of squeezing down for two frames
works within that post third one for
three frames so you can see the
difference so if you want to emphasize
that downward pose of that squashing
maybe you can maybe you need to go with
the you know three frames but you know
this is also you know if one if
something is a bowling ball is something
that water balloon it's gonna be
different but that's besides the point
but maybe you are extending your
plausibility of your world so much that
you're kind of breaking it in that case
you maybe want to hone it back down so
there's a lot of choices to be made
there in just readability this also
applies to like if you're doing a walk
cycle and
I have character that you know when you
have the extreme post of extending the
leg and then he's pushing his weight on
the leg if that straight foot post is
only one frame then it's not gonna be as
readable as having it be roughly two
frames working within that post and then
you get that extra weight down on it
this also applies to like lip sync for
example if you're doing like MPB or
sometimes like ma Papa you you want if
you can depending on dialogue you want
to hold it for like two frames just
makes it more readable where am I yeah
so it's also if you have a thing coming
up in your screen and the viewer might
not already know what it is like it may
be the viewer didn't know this was a
razor blade it wasn't really established
so how long do we have to linger and
make the viewer catch up to this
information so if he just kind of lands
there takes the thing and kind of runs
away with it we what happened it's just
motion blur it's like watching a
Transformers movie so just as an example
you saw the agent throws towards the
punch and it gets kind of blocked by by
Boris so you can I graphed it so I did a
lot of experiments with how long should
that stay because if he if he does it
and just right away it goes to the next
move we didn't really see what happened
it was very kind of confusing it's just
a lot of motion blur but if he lingered
for too long this is by the way it holds
for roughly nine frames if he if he
started lingering a little bit longer
than that then it starts feeling like
the agent is just punching he got
stopped and he's waiting to be punched
again or whatever he's not actually
reacting to the situation so there's
this fine line sometimes where you want
to push the readability but not so far
as to whatever the urgency of the scene
is now there's also the matter of focus
I am you know when I'm animating that
thing I'm leading the eye towards that
focal point of where he catches the Hat
now if something else happened on the
right side of the screen and maybe at
the same time
you're gonna be kind of distracted by
that thing that happens on the right
side and your eye is gonna be like I do
I look here I don't like there and
that's gonna be a problem because if
things happen exactly at the same time
and you won't have time to go back and
forth and really like understand what's
going on then it's just gonna be a
missed opportunity so you know if you
have any kind of a shot there's only
gonna be a one focus focus points that
the reader that the view we're gonna
look at and this might not be the best
example but it's one example at least so
you know you're looking at the dog oh a
chicken comes in now we're looking at
chicken and you know the dog is laughing
and then the chicken is doing that thing
and so it's not that he laughs at the
same time as the chicken comes in it's
at least going and that's where the
rhythm thing comes in also this happened
this happens this this this is this and
I hope there if I met my younger self
here somewhere
this would be something that would be
kind of helpful and this is not I mean I
I'm not I don't want to put myself on
any kind of a pedestal this is something
that is a bit subject it's like these
are all principles that already exists
and I'm just rearranging them a little
bit to cater somebody that might not
know them in a way that I think makes
sense so I don't want to do what the
whole clique baby thing of being like
these are the new principles so maybe
this is like the very subjective list of
your TAS of 2017 right now and it might
change in the future and you know
everybody so I'm gonna meet a couple of
new animators out there at the bar
you're gonna punch me in the face for
doing this anyway so that's my thing
