the code base in this case is
deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA and it's
literally a picture of DNA it's the
famous photograph 51 taken by rosalind
Franklin the incredible x-ray
crystallographer and you can browse
through notebooks online you can see her
breaking the code like figuring out DNA
this this base for coats are not like
binary that we work with computers right
for building blocks adenine cytosine
guanine thymine
I'm from those four building blocks what
we get is all life on this planet every
single person but also every single bird
every single lizard every single insect
everything made from that simple
building block right pays for and
despite its incredible diversity in life
across the planet you can start to see
trends in life over time as life evolves
through the process of natural selection
you start to see a trend toward
specialization right where a life-form
will evolve to be really good at one
thing in its environment trend towards
ubiquity right life finds a way I try
life trying to spread and really
interesting you tread toward a trend
towards cooperation where the actions of
a group can be greater than the actions
of an individual so this process
evolution through natural selection is
amazing and results in what we see
around us in the world today but it's
it's a slow process and it's kind of
messy right it relies on mistakes in the
genetic code then gets selected for by
the environment wonderful process but it
it can be slow now it's one species
that's kind of found a way to hack the
system here we found a way to kind of
get a leg up on evolution through
natural selection through the use of
technology and that's humans right we
don't have to wait to say evolve a sharp
cutting tool at the end of a limb we can
make a sharp cutting tool and
essentially augment ourselves this is a
shoe alien hand axe very early piece of
technology so it's very different to the
evolution through natural selection you
imagine something and we we create it
and we we augment ourselves why we shape
our tools
and then the tools shape us and it's
pretty much the way the technology works
right we think of something want to
happen and we make it the issue alien
hand axe is a very old piece of
technology here's a more recent piece of
technology that I really like the pencil
it's great I mean it's got a very clear
affordance so you know which end to use
it has an undo which is always good and
the built in progress bar is probably my
favorite part and what's interesting
when you look at technology any kind of
technology like this you start to see
the same kind of trends that you see in
the world of biology right trend toward
specialization of pencil is really good
at one thing ubiquity you can find
pencils all over the world and really
interestingly cooperation that that's
key when it comes to technology fact
there's a book by Leonard read called I
pencil and it's told from the point of
view of a pencil and the whole point of
the book is that nobody can make a
pencil as in no single person can make a
pencil it requires everyone's come
together right you got a fell the trees
to make the wood you got to get the
graphite you got a you know this does
too much involved for any one person to
do it so when it comes to technology
like that cooperation is part of the
deal right we get this kind of division
of labor and then we get we reap the
benefits from that you can try to create
technologies by yourself in isolation
you're probably gonna have a bad time
like there's there's an English artist
called Thomas Thwaites you might have
seen his most recent project where he
tried to live for years of goat but
before that he he did the poster project
where he tried to make a toaster from
scratch and I literally mean from
scratch right he wanted like smelt the
steel and make the plastic and do the
wiring all by himself
it was prohibitively expensive and it
didn't really work so you know
cooperation is part of the deal
now so you see these parallels between
biology and Technology right
specialization ubiquity and cooperation
and it'll be tempting to then infer that
it's the same process at work here right
but actually they're very different
like I said evolution through natural
selection doesn't imagine an end product
right nature doesn't imagine an elephant
or an ostrich that just happens to be
the current best selected life-form for
its environment we like to think that
we're the most highly
of all species on the planet but the
truth is that every species that's still
around is the most highly evolved
species on the planet because it's still
around right so with technology it's
different technology you think of
something you want to exist and then you
can create it with other people right
who requires cooperation
I won't my favorite sort of schools of
thought around technology about
imagining something making it real in
the world is the school's thought known
as Qin Dogu right it's started by a
kenji Cal commie in 1995 the Qin Dogu
Society and it kind of has a yeah the
principles behind it this idea that what
you've build should be not exactly
useful but not altogether useless it's
probably as if I Illustrated these are
things that look kind of crazy like that
doesn't make sense but then you're like
you know actually and I think about it
right you're looking like not that's
stupid but is it though is it I mean why
not why not protect your foot we're in
the ring
why not harness the kinetic energy of
your toddler to keep your floors clean
if you don't have a toddler that's fine
you know it still works with things but
of course you can't really imagine these
things being used in the world right
they wouldn't make very good products
being used by people like I was looking
through the Qin Doga book and I found
this device which was kind of like a
stick you could put a camera on so you
can take self-portrait pictures with it
but come on you can't picture anyone
actually using that but whether we're
talking about a shoe alien hand axes
pencils toasters or tchen Dogo it's kind
of the same trend you have humans
augmenting themselves through hardware
right the tools the technology are the
hardware but something interesting
happens in the 20th century we start to
get a new layer which is software now
the human can interact with the software
which interacts with the hardware and
vice versa
and these three things working together
can be very very powerful I think maybe
the most powerful example would be the
moon landings right the Apollo project
required incredible cooperation by the
way seeing us I was just showing a
selfie stick I should point out this is
a rare example of an everyone else
this is a picture taken by Michael
Collins of Buzz Aldrin Neil Armstrong
and every other human being on the
planet except Michael Collins
it's an everyone else II so yeah the
Apollo landings right I mean it required
incredible human beings
it required incredible hardware to
Saturn rocket you know it's still the
most powerful rocket ever built an
incredible software created by Margaret
Hamilton creating entire new schools of
thought for software engineering and
ever since then I think there's been a
trend which is that all these three
layers the hardware certain becoming
less and less important as I get you
know Moore's law comes into play this
idea of design dissolving in behavior
that the it's the software we interact
with we we kind of don't want to think
about the hardware that much that the
hardware becomes irrelevant now this
idea that the hardware should be
irrelevant is sort of if you squint at
it right the idea behind the World Wide
Web
when Tim berners-lee is working at CERN
European Center for Nuclear Research
that's the problem is facing everyone
there is using whatever they want yeah
it does there's no hierarchy at CERN
everyone can use whatever computers they
want and it's hard to get interrupt
right between seeing all these different
operating systems these different
computers and Tim berners-lee came up
with this information management
proposal so that the hardware would be
irrelevant we take it for granted today
right we take it for granted you can
build a webpage and yeah it's gonna work
on Mac and it's gonna work on PC it's
gonna work on Linux and it'll work on
Android will work on on iOS right take
it for granted but actually that's
that's quite an achievement to make the
hardware irrelevant and the world wide
web as a piece of technology so it's
classic example of you know building on
what's come before just since we build
on the World Wide Web right you can't
have a Twitter or Facebook or Google
without first having the World Wide Web
but you can't have the World Wide Web
till you've got the Internet but you
can't have the Internet and you've got
computers you can't have computers free
of electricity you kind of electricity
without industrialization right building
on top of what's come before the author
Steven Johnson talks about this idea of
the adjacent possible right that these
you have to build in what comes before
why why you can't have a microwave oven
and medieval Holland because
not enough steps have happened first and
make a microwave impossible so the world
wide web itself is built of different
building blocks these pieces not
Hardware right not really software
they're more like agreements right
things we all agree to use these things
you got the hypertext Transfer Protocol
right the protocol layer URLs as
identifiers and HTML there's this format
that we write on the web with now not to
belittle Tim berners-lee and his work
but coming up with the technology isn't
really the hard part the hard part is to
convince people to use the technology
how do you get the adoption of this
great technology you've just invented
and when I think about trying to
convince people I always think about
Grace Hopper right where Admiral Grace
Hopper inventor of COBOL the compiler
right change the course of computing
history and she was always frustrated by
people being kind of stick-in-the-muds
she used to say that you know the most
dangerous phrase in the English
languages we've always done it that way
right and she used to say humans are
allergic to change and I think she's
quite correct we tend to have an inertia
towards things particularly as we get
older right so Grace Hopper would try to
battle that she try and fight the fact
that humans are allergic to change now
Tim berners-lee he completely
acknowledged that humans are allergic to
change but he sort of went with it it's
very smart so if you look at the
building blocks of the web they build on
what people are already familiar with
instead of being a whole new paradigm
it's just a slight shift in what you're
already comfortable with so the the
protocol layer HTTP obviously is built
on the Internet right so underneath
we've got tcp/ip building on the work of
Bob can and Vint Cerf and URLs use the
domain name system that John pastels
already put all this work into right
it'd be crazy to come up with something
else an HTML your simple little format
right that people are writing documents
in well it was based on sgml and a
markup language had already existed and
was already being used at CERN there was
a flavor of sgml standard generalized
markup language that people are already
writing documents with when they're at
CERN in fact if you were to look at some
of these sgml documents you would see
these elements in those documents right
body title Pete
Tim berners-lee just took them wholesale
just borrowed them completely from sgml
and said okay now it's HTML in fact you
could take an sgml document change the
file extension the dot HTM and it would
work in a web browser so that was really
clever right that's how you get the
adoptions it was familiar to people just
familiar enough to people who get
started now of course HTML has grown
over time and we've got a whole bunch
more elements to give extra semantic
richness to the documents were marking
up which is great where it gets really
interesting those when we get these
powerful elements that have behaviors
associated with them right really cool
stuff like being able to play videos and
audio the canvas element now all of
these elements powerful as they are they
have something in common which is that
they all have a fallback mechanism built
in between the opening and closing tag
of any of these you can put fallback
content for the browsers that don't
understand these elements yet that's how
you could start using these elements
before every single browser adopted
these elements it was a safe thing to do
because they thought about this they've
thought about the fallback content to go
in between these new opening and closing
tags and that was not an accident that
was very much by design and there are
design principles underpinning HTML and
part of those design principles is this
idea that the content should degrade
gracefully an older or less capable user
elements user user agents and I love
this I love the fact that these design
principles exist and that they're
documented and that you can you can look
and like Brad was talking about this
morning right the design principles can
really be this this star to sail your
ship by I'm somewhat obsessed with
design principles I collect them at this
URL principle started back tear calm and
I think what obsesses me about design
principles is where they sit in the
collaborative process because you start
and you have you've got goals right
you've got you've got the the mission
what you're trying to do so in the case
of the world wide web that would be make
hardware irrelevant and then out of that
you get the principles so the principles
are kind of built on the goals you get
the HTML design principles as an example
and then out of that you get the
patterns what you actually end up
building in the case of HTML the
patterns turn out to be the individual
the patterns built on the principles the
principles built on the goals so look
for design principles when you're
evaluating technology and when you're
evaluating technology you got questions
to ask and probably the most common
question you'd ask you you know trying
to decide whether to use a particular
technology as well how well does it work
how well does this technology work and
it's a good question of course you
should ask this question but there's a
better question to ask the question you
should really be asking is how well does
it fail so if you think about those HTML
elements they fail really really well
because they've been designed to fail
well the fact that you can have fallback
content right and that helps adoption
when something fails well it's probably
more likely that it can be adopted let's
so let's use this as a lens let's ask
this question how well does it fail and
use it to sort of interrogate some web
technologies that you might be
evaluating yourself so let's take an
example from the world of CSS let's
start with CSS shapes who's heard of CSS
shapes okay good few people who's using
CSS shapes fewer hands so the rest of
you put up your hands first time not the
second are in the process of evaluating
the technology now what you might do is
you go to can I use calm you type in CSS
shapes and you see what the browser
support was like great you see some
green you see some red and maybe you
make your decision based on the amount
of green right but this only tells you
where it works it doesn't tell you what
happens in the instance of the red what
happens when it fails how well does it
fail so let's take a look at CSS shapes
here's an example of CSS shapes in
action I'm using shape outside circle to
get the text kind of curving around the
image there okay so this is an example
of CSS shapes when it works but how well
does it fail well here it is in a
browser that doesn't support CSS shapes
and you see the text just goes in a
straight line so that's what it would
have done anyway so in this instance I
can treat the support of CSS shapes as
an enhancement and go ahead and use it
even if we're only supported in one
browser or two browsers
I'm not harming the browsers that don't
support
CSS shapes by using it so I would say
CSS shapes fail well okay so let's let's
go to another world and sort of apply
the same question let's look at the
world of JavaScript service workers
whose heard of service workers quite a
few hands who's using service workers
far fewer hands so again the rest of you
are evaluating this technology you've
heard about it you're wondering whether
to use it service workers I mean I'll
admit it there are a weird thing to get
your head round right because I mean
it's JavaScript but not like your other
JavaScript don't treat it like your
other it's more like it happens to be
written in JavaScript it's more like
it's more like it's a cookie because the
user goes to your website and then the
service worker gets installed on their
machine like a cookie would accept they
can execute JavaScript code so it's
actually more like a virus but a good
virus so a service worker is like you're
gonna do a man-in-the-middle attack on
your own website and then the next time
that browser makes any requests to your
domain you can intercept that request
and do other things so you know don't go
to the network go to the cache or if the
network isn't available you can make
some nifty offline page and have them do
something fun like the Guardian has a
serviceworker
if you try to read an article but
there's no network connection they have
a crossword puzzle for you to play all
right some real bit of delight
ok so service workers I personally think
pretty great but ok how well does it
work well like I said you have to put
the work into it right so you can't just
plug and play here's your service worker
you've got to learn the concept of
service workers which is a bit bizarre
then you got to write the code yourself
you get nothing for free with a service
worker you got to write at all but it
does work well I mean if you add a
service worker to a website you can get
the enormous performance boosts you get
your website to work even when there's
no network connection I would say it
works very well but how well does it
fail right so here's the browser support
and with there's some green and there's
some red right and you might look at
this go not enough green I'm not gonna
use service workers but remember from
CSS shapes the green and the red doesn't
actually answer the important question
how well does it fail so how well the
service workers fail
they fail really well they like I think
this is the secret sauce of service
workers they've been designed to fail
well because no one's describing how a
service worker works is that the user
visits your website for the first time
and then a service worker gets installed
on their machine so for that first time
visit you can't use service workers
initially you have to consider the
situation where the service worker isn't
supported in fact for that first visit
no web browser supports service workers
then you have to use the service worker
in such a way that it's an enhancement
added onto what your site is already
doing and I think that's brilliant
that means you could again go ahead and
use service workers even if it were
supported in one browser or two browsers
because you will not harm the browsers
that don't support service workers by
using service workers so service workers
fail really well and they're just kind
of awesome if you take anything away
from stop service workers are awesome ok
so let's ask this question again to
another kind of web technology probably
heard a lot about who's heard of web
components who's actually using web
components Monica's using web components
that someone else back there is using
web component if I'm not a web
components expert by any means
Monica is if you have any questions on
web components Monica is the person to
talk to so web components are kind of a
weird thing to get your head around as
well because they're not a technology
web components is this umbrella term for
a bunch of different specs in browsers
so you got the custom elements is one
spec you have the very sinister sounding
shadow DOM and then there's other things
like HTML imports templates and all this
stuff but the idea with web components
is that you you kind of get to make your
own HTML right so we get these powerful
HTML elements like oh saying canvas
video audio great but it kind of takes
time this is like the evolution through
natural selection right it takes years
we've got to try to stuff out standards
process browsers have to implement this
stuff it's slow and it's messy but at
the end we get this very highly evolved
thing the idea with web components is
you just make up your own elements
okay it's a bit more complicated than
that but it begins with you just coming
up with a new element the only the only
thing you have to do is make sure the
element name has a hyphen in it it's
kind of an agreement between the
standards bodies browser makers and us
developers that there will never be an
actual HTML and in the future that
contains a - so it's like it's a safe
namespace to play in okay so you got
these elements this is the custom
elements part of it and then this other
stuff comes in the shadow Dom HTML
imports at a template whatever you
decide to use and the idea is with these
that these are as powerful potentially
as the native HTML elements you can have
behavior and style associated with them
and really importantly encapsulated
within them so the Styles in the
behavior don't leak out I mean this is
the holy grail right this is what we're
chasing with react and view and pattern
libraries in our modular design right is
to have that encapsulation that
reusability that we could take something
and just drop it somewhere else and it
would just work so web components sound
pretty great how well does it work how
will do web components work well again
you might go - can I use comm and start
typing in the different specs and see
what the browser supports like and yeah
there's some browser support the stuff
some browsers don't support this stuff
but that's okay remember we were looking
at CSS shapes and serviceworkers and the
amount of the green or the red doesn't
answer the important question which is
how well does it fail so how well do web
components fail this is where it gets
interesting because the answer to the
question how well do web components fail
is it depends depends entirely on how
you design your web components how
they're used so if you were making a
fancy carousel image gallery web
component and you implemented it like
this where you've got your images in
your HTML and then you wrap it in this
new element you've created called image
gallery then you can add in all your
behaviors you're swiping your animation
all that good stuff but if a browser
doesn't support say custom elements or
any other part of the web components
umbrella term at least the images are
still available so I'd say oh yeah that
fails well like the HTML
it's been designed to fail well but when
I see examples of web components online
and tutorials this is what I see right
basically an opening and closing tagging
and then the complexity is put into the
JavaScript which makes sense but there
isn't thought given to how does it fail
this where this would fail badly right
it's still the same technology it's
still web components but depending on
how you design it how you use it it
could fail well or fail badly that's
interesting and it's exciting it's a
little scary like the the really amazing
thing about web components is that they
it gives us developers the same power
that previously only browser makers had
but the scary thing about web components
is that it gives us the same power the
previously only browser makers had and
we need to match the power of
responsibility right maybe we need to
have design principles just like HTML
has design principles and it's early
days yet with web components so maybe
it'll happen I hope so because you know
like a lot of examples I see sorry
Monica but polymer project which is a
polyfill and library web components they
build a whole shop using web components
but this is the markup for the shop open
shop app close shop app nothing else and
then a script element and it's a single
point of failure but it doesn't have to
be this way we can set the course for
the future and here's something to ask
when you're evaluating technologies like
this who benefits from the technology
right people trying to get you to use
their technology use their technology
it's awesome who's benefited from it now
in the world of the web I would say
there's kind of two sides of people who
could benefit from a technology
developers users nine times out of 10
the technology is a benefit to both but
sometimes there's a clash sometimes this
technology is to favor developers
sometimes the technologies to favor the
user I would say serviceworkers an
example of a technology that favors the
users right because they get better
performance they get you know offline
pages and all without harming any
browsers that don't support service
records but it's kind of damaged to
developers because now you got something
new to learn right now you have to learn
how service workers work and learn how
to make your first service worker so it
favors users over developers I have to
say I'm okay with that
right I tend to look for the
technologies that they do favor the
users over the developers don't get me
wrong I'm developer I like developer
convenience but not at the cost of user
needs in fact in the HTML design
principles there's my favorite design
principle because I'm that much of a
nerd I have a favorite design principle
it's called the priority of
constituencies which says in case of
conflict can consider users over authors
over implementers over theoretical
purity users that's who we should
consider first authors that's us of
implementers browser makers theoretical
purity I think that's a pretty good
pretty good priority of constituencies
but the thing is we this will be this
will be too black and white to apply to
just technology in general even web
technology in general because I think
there are kind of categories of
technology that we use on the web I've
been trying to think about how to how to
name these categories and the best I can
come up with is that we've got kind of
the internal tools that we use on our
own computers and the external tools are
the ones that the users directly
interact with so to give an example of
what I consider they're sort of internal
tools these are tools that are in your
laptop they help you work faster but at
the end of the day they still spit out
HTML CSS and JavaScript right so you got
your build build tasks you got your
version control systems you've got your
pre processors all this kind of stuff
but like I said it still spits out
websites now you could argue that these
are these affect the user because the
better a developer works the better the
user experience will be sure but I'm
talking about technologies that directly
affect the user and these don't directly
kind of touch the user so when it comes
to evaluating any of these kinds of
technologies the internal technologies
my attitude is like use whatever you
want go crazy whatever you like or
whatever makes sense to your team you
know more to the point of what Brad was
saying you know that's what that's what
matters that your criteria can be
whatever makes make sense to you
but I don't think we can apply the same
criteria when we're talking about these
outward facing technologies these are
you know the CSS frameworks JavaScript
libraries CSS frameworks are built in
CSS jobs confirmes are built in
JavaScript and the user has to download
the tool for you to get the benefit
although interestingly in the case of
the JavaScript based libraries we start
and see this trend where you can do them
on the server side and once you do that
they kind of go back to being internal
technologies right and then you can
apply the same criteria and say hey I
like this framework I'm gonna use that
framework fine but when it's something
the user has to download I don't think
you can apply the same criteria I don't
think you just go hey I like it so I'm
gonna use it I don't think that's fair
on the user there's a whole bunch of
different questions you have to ask of
the technology of course you have to ask
you know what's the what the browser
support like are you gonna leave users
behind if you use this technology what's
the file size like if it's something
that you use it has to download that's a
really important question
what's the community like you're gonna
be asking support questions you're gonna
get a quick response really important
questions but not the most important
question
the most important question to ask of
these technologies is what are the
assumptions and I guarantee you all of
these technologies have assumptions
built in I know they have assumptions
built in because all of these
technologies were built by human beings
and we can't help it even if we don't
want to we imbue what we build with our
own biases my software like all
technologies is inherently political you
can try it's actually a really
interesting exercise to try not to you
know pick and choose when it comes to
software clear:left we built this this
piece of software called fractal it's to
make pattern libraries help you make
pattern libraries and our hope the
design principle of fractal is that it
should be as agnostic as possible
shouldn't matter what templating
language you want to use or what build
tool you want to use or any of that kind
of stuff be completely agnostic it's
really hard to be completely agnostic
every time you show an example in a
piece of documentation you've made a
choice to favor one thing of
the other right but you can least be
aware of it so you can attempt to be
agnostic but actually all software has
these things built in we talk about
opinionated software all software is
opinionated I don't want to make it
sound like there's these technologies
and they have these biases they have
these sort of ways they want to be used
because they were made by humans who
imbued them with that and there's
nothing you can do about it right
there's no way you can use the
technology for any other use because the
history of technology shows us the
opposite that the street finds its own
uses for things so you know when
Alexander Graham Bell invented the
gramophone he thought that started the
telephone he thought that people would
use it to listen to concerts at a
distance right and Thomas Edison with
the gramophone he thought that people
who record conversations you record one
half of conversation send it to someone
they record the other half of course
those technologies ended up being used
in exactly the opposite ways that they
that they thought it wasn't my favorite
example of a technology finding its
place that comes from the early part of
the 20th century from Hedy Lamarr the
star of the silver screen in Europe
right in the first half of the 20th
century married to an Austrian arms
dealer and after the Anschluss she's
she's taking notes in those meetings and
she manages to escape which is a whole
adventure in itself makes her way to
America and she wants to do her bit for
the war effort particularly after
there's a ship full of refugees got
torpedoed by a u-boat so she worked
together with George and teal to come up
with a system and this is four torpedoes
that were supposed to try and take out
these u-boats they were guided by radio
now the problem was if if you could
figure out the frequency that the
torpedo and the controller are using you
could jam that frequency and now you
can't control the torpedo anymore so
this this system they came up with
borrowed from the technology and player
pianos use the idea of frequency hopping
we're about the controller and the
torpedo switched frequencies constantly
in sync right and kind of at random and
now it's much much harder to jam that
transmission all right fine you might be
thinking what what has this got to do
with anything but you know I see you got
devices with you
you know those devices have got Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS all of those technologies
use frequency hopping right this
technology kind of found its place
afterwards so you know it's not
necessarily all down to what the creator
of the technology intends so people go
further and say it's it's not about the
people creating the technology it's
about the technology that the technology
itself has a will and this your school
of thought I guess is best exemplified
in the idea of technological determinism
that when you look at history the
driving force has been technology and
there's nothing you can do about it
right it's the future take it get out of
the way or get on board this technology
is coming there's nothing you can do
about it right and it's coming faster
and faster happens on the world of the
web what you're not using the latest
JavaScript library you have to use that
library get on board it's the future
take it chatbots so hot right now not
using chat pots it's the future
take it machine learning why aren't you
ready for machine learning it's the
future take it VR what's your VR
strategy are even beyond the world of
the web self-driving cars drones
synthetic biology artificial
intelligence drift out currencies it's
the future take it but I don't like
feeling you know I'm just this cog in
the wheel of technology is progressed
through history I think we can change
our outlook on technology so it's it
gives us more agency change our attitude
towards change turn and face the change
technology is not destiny it's may seem
like that because it seems so inexorable
right but we can help shape it there is
an inevitability to technology right we
looked at you know the stack of
technologies that led to the web and you
could say oh yeah
the web was inevitable and sure you know
after you've got industrialization
electricity and computers and networks
then you expect something like the web
to come along
not necessarily the web we got you could
look at the history of computing say the
internet was inevitable no something
like the internet was
maybe not the internet we got the iPhone
you look back now and say oh yeah the
iPhone was inevitable now something like
the iPhone was inevitable and I take
comfort from that it is an author called
kevin kelly and he writes these books
about technology in fact I was think
about it during Horace's talk because
one of the things he claims in one of
his books is that there's no technology
has ever gone extinct which sounds kind
of crazy but actually you can try and
prove him wrong but now that somewhere
in the world somebody is using a really
ancient technology and so when I say
technology hasn't gone extinct I don't
mean I'm sitting in a museum somewhere I
mean somebody's actually still using it
you know taking that we talk about
technology as being killers oh this is
the this is the the phone killer I just
a desktop computer killer now
technologies wax and wane but you know
the old technology sit alongside the new
technologies and Kevin Kelly writes
these books with these titles that sound
like they're very techno Tudor monistic
like what technology wants and the
inevitable right those kind of scary
titles but his point is is more subtle
than that it's like yes there is a there
is an inevitability to the general sweep
of technology on our world but the
specifics are within our control right
that we can do something about it
technology doesn't have to control us
that we could control the technology and
we look at Kevin Kelley and his very
impressive facial hair you might think
that Kevin Kelley is Amish he is not
Amish but he describes himself as our
mesh who's he spent time with the Amish
who get a very bad rap when it comes to
technology because people think that the
Amish reject technology it's not true
they don't reject technology they
evaluate technology and they do adopt
technology if on balance they think it's
the right technology to use the Amish
are steadily adopting technology at
their pace they are slow geeks I like
that
slow geeks I think we could be slow
geeks I think we could all be a bit more
Amish ish I don't mean in our facial
hair or dress sense
I mean I'm being slow Keeks in asking
questions of our technology asking yeah
how well does it work but also asking
how well does it fail to ask who
benefits from this technology and maybe
most important of all to ask what are
the assumptions in this technology
because when I look back at the sweep of
history I don't see technology as the
driving force
I see people as the driving force
remarkable people it's true
the people nonetheless and you know who
else is remarkable you're remarkable so
your attitude shouldn't be hey it's the
future take it should be it's the future
make it and I'm looking forward to
seeing what you make thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
