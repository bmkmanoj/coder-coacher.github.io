folks to see it this is my life I
basically spend my time I don't have a
real job
I build things and I try to get people
to see them and try to be people to buy
them like my books hello web app I run
the hello hello web books website that
sells my books I also run a website
called wedding lovely and this is my
role that's just trying to build things
which I love and then do the hard part
of getting people to see it so this
session is for people out there who also
have the skills to build something and
then are jumping into that daunting oh
crap how do I get people to see it for
designers and developers you know
marketing is hard marketing takes a lot
of mental energy a lot of us are
introverts we're much more comfortable
working on the code working on the
computer working in the design building
something making it perfect but you know
the mental energy of taking it to
someone and potentially get bad feedback
working people be like I hate this or I
love this like that whole game can be
exhausting and it's easy to avoid a lot
of people just build something and
launch it and then hope it goes viral
and then nothing happens because things
don't really you have to put effort into
something to get it seen and be used
even if you build something that's super
awesome
sorry I hear a little like bump noise I
hope that's not me with my microphone
marketing is worth it the feeling that
you get if you build something and
someone uses it like when I I built
wedding lovely and I've been running
this website for the last eight years
and died feeling what is that
that me sorry I'm just gonna keep
bugging me so I'm gonna trying to fix
this did something that I'm hitting okay
okay hold it your mouth let's make that
help sorry about that guys
alright marketing the feeling you get
when you launch something and it goes
into someone's hand that person comes to
you and is like yet what you built
changed my life what you've built is
helping my business has helped me launch
my own thing getting that feedback from
other people that is totally worth it
it's such a good feeling it's like I
said I've run these these are my two
main projects wedding lovely is my
startup I started eight years ago that I
did fundraising for and now I have a
little team working under me
it's a wedding planning app in wedding
vendor marketplace and then I also build
Jesus this is not working how does it ah
putting a mic there we go no there we go
yeah podium mic it is and then hello Web
books is my book I wouldn't call it
publishing so I'm self-publishing but
this is that so the project I run so how
do we market what we build how do you
get what you built into the hands other
people without say you know selling your
soul or turning into one of those smarmy
marketers you know who I'm talking about
you don't want to turn into that so here
are some really practical steps to help
you take what you've built get in
people's hands so the first step this is
not really marketing per se this is like
way before any of this like trying to
instead of a mailing list or any as
other things happen the very first thing
you do when it comes to marketing is to
understand your customer especially if
the customer is not you for example
wedding lovely it sounds like kind of a
weird cliche I'm a lady I launched a
website for weddings spoiler I actually
really do not like weddings I launched
wedding lovely so I could change the
wedding industry because I think the
whole process of wedding planning is
awful and broken and we has turned this
you know event centered around love and
do something that's a little more
corporate I can go on for ages about
this so the funny thing about running
wedding lovely is I still have to stay
abreast of what's going on in wedding
friends I also have to understand a lot
people love that process of wedding
planning and you know I have my own
feelings about weddings but the wedding
lovely customer isn't me I have to stay
abreast of what's going on understand
the customer that I'm targeting so this
is one of the things that I do is I
follow wedding blogs and again not
really my favorite thing to read but
it's important for me to understand that
customer I see what's going on in the
wedding history what people are talking
about what people are recommending what
the new trends are and so I can continue
to understand that customer because I'm
not building something for myself if you
build something for yourself say you're
you're building something that fulfills
a need it's a lot easier to market your
project because you're that customer but
there's a lot of people out there who
see a need in a different field and you
have to spend the time understanding
that customer and making sure that what
you're building if you see that need and
different feel that's and your customers
not yourself you might not be seeing a
need that doesn't actually exist aim you
have I heard about startups the constant
startups who fail that the blog post
mortems will say that they built a
product that people didn't want and this
is step one to knowing that you're
building product that people need is to
understand the customer so how do you
understand a customer before you you've
built your project number one talked to
customers go to trade shows go to events
and meetups join forum slacks subreddits
follow industry leaders on social media
try to stay involved in the conversation
that area they're jumping into I met
someone who is building a developer
building slang for the auto industry so
I meant a lot of traveling to auto shows
and talking to people on the ground
floor and making sure that they that
what they're building was something that
the auto industry actually needed needed
don't make assumptions
don't make assumption that because
you're a developer and that you know
that you can totally make this process
way better and that they'll totally need
it don't make that assumption that they
actually will actually use what you're
built I talked to people running by them
and see if you're missing anything and
don't forget to add analytics again not
really like a getting your product into
the customer
hands but this is the thing that's going
to help you determine whether what
you're doing is actually working so of
course Google Analytics is you know the
the big one and you should to add
analytics as early as possible whatever
landing page whatever you do have
analytics so you can see what's going on
if you and learn a little bit about the
terms around analytics like the bounce
rate the number of people that hit your
website immediately if that number is
high you might have a problem with your
design you might have to go and revise
it so Google Analytics but Google
Analytics can be well there's a lot of
other things other than Google Analytics
so taking a step back instead of
installing Google Analytics on its own I
actually recommend to install taken
called segments so I've instead a little
snippet for Google Analytics and the new
site later on to do KISSmetrics or mix
panel or any of the other analytic
services they're out there there's a
billion you can install the segment that
io tracking code instead and then in
segments you could say hey share my data
with all these other services and when
one snippet rather than constantly
installing new things music all right
then fYI this one is a little bit of a
disclaimer this is a project that my
husband built and he built it because
both him and I build and launch things
and try to launch it and brief metrics
is just our way of trying to take Google
Analytics noise and they're like cut it
down into one email on Monday that says
here's how you're doing here's your
traffic here how how it how it went
versus the previous week versus the
months
here's your bounce rate all these like
little pieces of data in an email at
Monday so again I'm bias my husband
built this we built it for our projects
but fYI if you want to you know if
you're overwhelmed by analytics you're
overwhelmed by Google Analytics and the
billion different pages that it has and
things that click through we built brief
metrics to help people understand their
data
and the next step when it comes to
building a project so you'll have an
idea for something you want to build and
you'd immediately just jump into code or
design take a step back stop working on
the code and try to set up a landing
page and start building an email list
this is a way that if you come to a
conference like this and you have this
thing that you're building you talk to
someone and they're like oh what are you
working on and you're like oh yeah I'm
working on so-and-so and that person's
like wow that's awesome I would love to
use that let me know do you launch if
you don't have any landing page and you
don't have a way of grabbing their email
list it's fun it's like likely that the
person just gonna disappear off than the
ether and then later on when you're
launching you're like oh yeah there was
that person who was it do I need to send
that you know email to them to let them
know that this perfect product for them
launched and maybe they'll pay you want
to start have a place to collect emails
as early as possible so you can get that
interest you can keep those people in a
place I collect people into the email
list as you build your product as you
meet people so then you can send
notification out when you launch and you
already have a group of customers that
are interested in your product this is
there's a lot of different services that
help you build and maintain your email
list I know that there was another
session earlier today I believe I talked
about unitless totally awesome
there's drip there's a convert kit
there's MailChimp there's campaign
monitor there's a billion and a half
different services out there to help you
you know they give you a tracking code
from your website that helped you grab
those emails immediately goes into your
email list and then you can send out
campaigns are really simple to set up
shouldn't take more than a couple hours
and then boom you have something to show
people at least get their emails while
you're still building your product now
if you don't if you're not really
skilled with web design the whole aspect
of having a website up for your product
when your product is not done whatever
you're building your book your your
open-source project whatever having a
page up to share may be like really
intimidate you don't want to work on the
design don't think about branding you
don't want to think about like a place
the hosts website
which is why I like github pages they're
really easy to set up really easy to set
up a very basic website and then put
those tracking codes and then you can
even go farther into the I don't want to
build something myself just yet and go
use a service like launch rock or you
just assign it for launch rock and you
you know put your name of your service
in and then boom you have a landing page
like there's a lot of services to make
this step really easy so you have a
place to sign people up for your email
list another one that just launched I
think like a week ago is shipped by
product hunts
I believe it doing something very
similar to launch Rock or you say hey
I'm gonna build this product and product
hunt now has a service to help you build
a landing page and get an email s and
start getting interest in the product
you're building so that's very good
product hunt to set up main thing here
is once you have an email list and I'll
tell you i am actually terrible at doing
this myself i had to constantly remind
myself that you have an email list you
need to keep it active you need to make
sure that the people don't forget that
you exist now sending them a month any
monthly updates saying hey thanks for
sending for my email list here's the
current progress of what's happening
what's going on right now here's what
I've done in the last month I will keep
your email list active and it'll prevent
you know say if you left it to go stale
and then a year later you're like whoo
hey remember me you signed up a year ago
here's my product you were like huh who
are you and then I'm subscribed keep
your mailing list active don't let it go
stale you can set up automated messages
so you don't have to remember to do a
bunch of emails I did this in MailChimp
where you can say hey after a person
sends it to the meet email list send
them a message
one week afterwards one months
afterwards six months afterwards
something small and easy and that way
that I can both do my update emails but
again I'm bad at and I'm smacking myself
in the head because every time I give
this presentation I'm like oh yeah I
need to do that but also you can set up
those monthly emails with an
so set up your automation so that list
stays as active as possible
there's also convertkit is that's one of
the services for emails I have mentioned
before they are really into the
automation stuff and they're probably
the best one for helping you set up
those automated emails to make it super
simple so only if I do is set up once
and then just go back to development and
design you want to worry about doing
that ongoing marketing as you're
developing your product and then big one
when you're developing a product
something you want to launch launch as
early as possible and it's really hard
to do when you're building something you
want people to use because it's really
scary when people actually start using
it there's a couple things there's quite
a few is for reasons I talked to people
reasons that people give me when I talk
to them when they say oh yeah I haven't
launched because you know there's this
other feature and if I had that just up
one more that one feature my product
will be way better and then they finish
that feature and they like wait what
about the other feature oh they'll make
my product even better and then oh the
other feature you know years go by the
product still hasn't launched it's
tempting to continue to add features
it's kind of like this weird
procrastination preventing you from
launching you know you in the audience
you might have heard about the whole
Minimum Viable Product not theory but
new mobile product idea where instead of
adding features and you have this idea
of a full-fledged product yeah my
full-fledged product has to have this
feature in this feature in this feature
in this feature and you're just working
to build that car instead of starting
from you know a wheel and making
something useless and adding a better
feature it's still useless until you get
to that magical car moment instead try
to build something just a lot smaller
but it's still useful build your
skateboard and then your scooter and
then your motorcycle and then you'll
eventually get to your car my own
personal experience with this wedding
lovely when I first launched it I
actually use it at each myself how to
code so
the code in the backend was awful the
fronton I launched it six weeks from the
day I decided to pick up coding six
weeks later I launched my first product
and this is what actually turned into
wedding lovely and that first website
was just a landing page a place for
people to sign up for a vendor account
like a form that went into an admin and
then I could approve it and it would
just give him a profile page there is no
advanced search there's just one page
that listed every profile who's on that
service and this service was a way to
find wedding invitation designers and
let me tell you it's weird to build a
marketplace and launch it with only say
ten designers which is what what I did
is a useless marketplace if you were in
California looking for a designer my
service there would be probably no
options near you there's no reason to
use my website it was absolutely useless
but it was up and I was it was up I was
able to go to vendors and game to sign
up on something that was online and the
best part about launching so early for
me I totally ran into this by accident
as I was in New York and I ran into a
design blogger called twistmas
and she said what are you working on and
I was like oh yeah I just launched this
website teach myself how to code it's
called wedding in late love and she was
like cool I walked away and four hours
later my phone blew up because she
blogged about my website it was live
again it was useless for a imitation
designer and network service personally
ten designers on it so anyone looking
for a designer wouldn't help them but it
was up it's the same thing with the
landing page if something was up that
someone could share and then that's what
we'll actually launched my startup
launching as early as possible was
something that really helps my own
personal startup another thing that
prevents people from launching is the
fear of judgement so fear that someone
is going to see what you've built and
judge you for it
don't you negatively tell you that yeah
I hate what you've built
or it doesn't work for me or you did
something wrong you know these things
are largely irrational I think you knew
that but it also is something that
happens in your brain when you're
worried about launching
a thing with judgment the fear of
judgment something that reassures me
when I launch one my products is that
I'm actually small beans and that no
one's gonna see what I build until I
should tell people about it like it's no
way I'm gonna launch something and
someone random in the Internet as I am
right now even though I've launched a
bunch of products already people aren't
gonna come up to me like that's awful
it's just that fear in my mind telling
me that someone might do that and I have
to squash it and launch anyways so you
know for someone who is like Atelier
Friedman in the last session launching a
new product for him is definitely really
scary because he has such a large
following but for small beans people
when launching a product I tell myself I
can worry about judgement worried about
people judging me because probably no
one's gonna see it anyways until I
market it and the most important thing I
try to tell people before launching the
product is that you're going to think
about your product differently after you
launch it because customers going to use
it customers gonna tell you what they
actually need so when you're building
your product on your by yourself or with
a small team before launch you have an
idea of how your customers are going to
use it as soon as you give it to
customers I guarantee it people are
going to use your service in a way you
didn't expect they're gonna ask for
things that you didn't expect ask for
pot like features that aren't on your
you know upcoming to-do list you need to
get to the launch period as fast as
possible because then you're gonna find
out what I hope people actually need
from your website and then you can start
iterating and if you don't launch for
say four years like a friend of mine
then you're losing out on that
opportunity to work with real customers
and find out actually what people need
alright moving on to actual marketing
tactics thanks for holding on to my my
little spiel the beginning here the
easiest flash hardest best marketing
tactic is writing content I think
there's another session that was talking
about content and how it's such a huge
thing right now and believe me it is and
I tell you as a person who's written
books I actually hate writing but it's
such a good way to get a four if you're
running a startup if you're building a
product writing content
it's the best way to get eyes on what
you've built so again I hate writing yet
I've pretty much every success I've had
as a developer designer entrepreneur has
been through writing I've done this is
something I wrote eight years ago look
how young I looked this is when I before
I even taught myself how to code I
decided I wanted to find a co-founder to
help me build what I wanted to build
that went viral in hacker news I got
hundreds of people emailing me to be a
co-founder such a weird world and long
story short that didn't work out but
this is something that launched me
personally into the eyes of other people
before I started building wedding lovely
and I wrote this post thing which also
went on Hacker News was number one
hacker news for a day which is insane
and that's one of the things one other
things that really launched my startup
into the startup that is today eight
years later I've done blog posts for the
wedding lovely blog this is something
that actually brings in about three
thousand dollars a month in affiliate
revenue this one blog post this is a
post I'd done I did sorry for the huge
header cropping went weird
I do posts for the helloweb bucks blog I
did posts medium to talk about my
conference talks these postings are you
know a I'm teaching other people but
these this writing I do helps promote
the products that I run it helps bring
people into knowing about me and the
things that I am building it tells
people about the stuff that I'm doing
without spamming them it's kind of like
the Trojan horse of marketing because we
write things like this people don't look
of it as like a banner ad on a website
Amelie tune out you're giving someone
something you're teaching them a little
bit about you know for this talk and
talking about technical writing but in
it and talking about the products I'm
working on and so people know about what
I'm building without you know having to
advertise them and it's key when you
write these ponies blog posts and these
these pieces of content just FYI make
sure to tie these postings into your
mailing lists
this is where things that you've been
setting up for your for your marketing
or starting to work together so if your
write a blog post you write something
about something you've learned or
something about your product they can
then send it to your email list and send
out a little message be like hey by the
way I wrote this post this is a this is
a guy Justin Jackson he actually wrote a
book all reference later called
marketing for developers kind of stole
it for my presentation here he's a
really good job of this is that whenever
he writes a post he sent us his email
list with a little personal introduction
and then says hey by the way I wrote
this and that more people will see that
post that he wrote more people will kind
of get further into his ecosystem the
more they get these postings it's a
really natural way of sharing what he's
doing without seeming like one of smarmy
marketers so yeah this is why I'm saying
writing is great for promotion that
doesn't look like promotion it's you
don't want to go around to people say
hey I built this thing try it out
because people just turn off they just
say hey I built this thing and I wrote
about something that's going to help you
they're more someone is more likely to
read that thing that you've read and
learn about that product convertkit does
this really well I mean this is a big
thing right now and there's a lot of
companies who are doing this whole
content marketing as promotion and
advertising convertkit
wrote this book put this post that's how
to convince people to join some how to
convince someone to join your email list
and convertkit
is an email list software this posting
works this post works for anyone who's
on any software MailChimp or drip or
whatnot it's a good article that really
shows someone how to convince someone to
join your email list the kind of writing
and words that you should use but also
really great content and really great
marketing for this company because then
they also going to say a we also post
mailing lists we have a mailing list
software company and these blog posts
these articles you're writing are also
good for SEO especially if they're
evergreen
it's something that will like stay good
to read for years to come so that post I
wrote for wedding lovely back in the day
I said that gives us about $3,000 and
monthly affiliate revenue blues my mind
every time this happened it was complete
accident but here's the SEO graph as you
can see if you've read the tiny numbers
I wrote it in 2012 and originally in May
we got 300 page views and July 500 page
page news going down to 2015 sorry -
getting eight thousand page views and
you can see it just going up so the
writing you can do if you spend the time
doing writing talking about the things
you've learned things that help your
business help your products years down
the line they could you know still be
super relevant it could lead to the
biggest wins of your career there's
something there promotion that sticks
around that is an ephemeral so we're
dividing designers and developers
I told if you're like me hate write and
don't want to ride you must rather be
doing design and development you could
be terrible at writing I tell you I'm
horrible at writing in school it was
always my my worst subject I got I
nearly flunked out of my university
level in grammar classes and you know
the only thing I could say when it comes
to writing is the more you do it the
better you'll get I promise
rely on your peers to help you edit and
view view what you've read review what
you've what you're saying get feedback
and and the funny thing about having
your peers work on an article with you
if you say to someone hey I wrote this
can you help me review it and they're
like cool good job here as it is here it
is and then you release the post you can
go back to them be like hey that post
you help me edit now alive can you share
it on your own social networks and
they're more likely to share it kind of
a scummy a marketing tactic there but I
use it all the time so you can get help
from people but you can also use that as
a way to help promote your post
afterwards the other thing is as
designers developers you probably don't
want to spin
time writing because it's taking away
from the time you would be spending on
development the thing here is that
writing does not have to be long you
don't have to write a 2,000 word medium
blog post in order to share something
that is interesting to you that could be
picked up by other people and therefore
help promote what you're building to the
right people doesn't have to be long the
other thing that helps me write faster
in university one of the best pieces of
advice I got throughout my university
career was to when I'm writing
especially technical documents is to
just write without revising try to get
to the first draft without going back
and correcting something because when
you're writing if you're like me I'll
write one sentence my brain goes yeah I
hate that sign saying you revise it I
think uh maybe that's better and you
revise it again you know three hours
later you're done with the first
paragraph so turn that off turn that
voice off and just write and your brains
gonna be screaming at you ah this is
awful odd what are you doing what thinks
that's filling or fix that tense get
that first draft out get a introduction
and a conclusion step away and then come
back to it later and I guarantee it I
mean way better than you thought it was
when you're writing it and then the
errors that you you had are easy to fix
when you go back and revise it instead
of revising as you're writing it makes
the process of writing so much faster
and then the other complaint is what if
you don't have anything original Jose
why would you write about how you
learned how to code because there's a
three billion you know blog posts and
articles about that already
why would you write and just add to that
number when there was already somebody
ever blog post on that topic thing is is
that the key to originalitycheck you can
write how you think of coding or pic or
how you use popular open-source project
even though there's a bunch of other
websites on that part use me articles on
that subject because eh it'll be
original just because he wrote it be
people read more than one article on a
subject more is better you know and some
article ideas it's kind of applies for
anyone who's launching a small project
or a book or some kind of personal
project so how you wrote or coded so and
so I come to an event like this
conference doing a recap of the
conference write about your personal
story a funny story from your background
you can write how to use a project or a
an object teach someone how to use
something you are you know how to use
you can take say Python requests you can
write ok how to use requests with this
other project tie two things together
you can write about things that are
really awesome that enter that interest
to you something cool that you recommend
there's a billion and a half different
things to write about is such a great
way to start telling your story get
people interested in what you're
building and it's just again the number
one way of promoting what you're working
on without looking like you're promoting
something all right so we have a mailing
list we have a landing page we are
starting to write content of some sort
and now you have to take all those
things and start finding and sharing to
the right communities this is why you
write content because you want to know
it's the same thing as look you know
trying to promote your project now
you're just trying to promote your
content but it's way easier to promote
content than it is a project so some
communities are relevant to developers
this is hacker news hacker news is a
great place if you're writing
development minded articles thing as
hacker news can be immensely frustrating
so here's the flipside you can get it if
you can get something onto hacker news
something you've written that's for
other developers and it gets high in
hacker news it could be a hundred
thousand page views it's insane but
hacker news can be very frustrating
because they have a crazy vote detecting
ring they get really PV if you post an
article on Hacker News and the other
people you say hey about my article
if they detect that you are asking for
votes they'll disappear my husband wrote
this post called why aren't we using SSH
for everything and it's been hacker knew
who's like eight times randomly will go
on there and be like oh my god your post
your article got posted again oh yeah
traffic and that will just disappear
because their algorithms will just take
it away and he didn't do anything it's a
very frustrating process
so I wanted to put this up here is that
it's a great place if you're writing for
other developers you know if you write
something for other developers share it
with hacker news just don't rely on it
because it can be an exercise in
frustration I particularly like reddit I
share a lot of things I've written on to
Reddit and there's reddit has a lot of
you know the subreddit like the
programming subreddit or startups or one
and a billion different subreddit
the thing is is that reddit is very
allergic to self-promotion and they
don't like a lot of people want to share
what they've built and Retta does not
like it when you share things that
you've built other people have built so
they will likely take away your post if
they think that yourself you're
promoting if you're self promoting again
super frustrating to me as a maker and I
just want to share things that I've
built but I also understand those a
billion people trying to share things
they built and that's this BAM so this
post I want to announce the fact that
I've written this book and there's a
learning programming subreddit and I
want to be like hey I wrote a book to
help people learn how to program I think
this would be really relevant for your
community I you're doing the same thing
I wanted to share something on a
community that's is self-promotion what
I did here is I message the moderators
first and I said hey by the way here's
the exact text I'm going to be sharing
can I have permission to share this
without you immediately flagging and
taking it down SSL promotion and the
moderators were like oh alright well if
people flag the post we're going to take
it down immediately because people do
not like self-promotion again oh my god
so I put the post up I got 350 to up
votes at the time I took the screenshot
which is actually really high for the
subreddit did really well people seem to
really enthused
the book that I wrote had a lot of great
questions there are still have some
people who send me messages being like
you're a bot you're a spammer
frustrating happens everybody FYI if you
want to share on reddit try messaging
the moderators if you're going to share
something that looks like self-promotion
like I did the party over there all
right product kinds product kinds is
another I need to update this screenshot
and he may look different but if you've
built a product product is here to
help you promote your product really
awesome community there's it's starting
to turn a little Packer newsy where it's
best times to submit your product the
best tactics to do so something we can
do a whole conference session on yeah I
took the screen out essentially with
product hunts is that you know look at
some articles people talk about the best
way of sharing on product kinda has some
really good and easy tips one of them is
to find someone who's an active maker to
submit your product for you and then
they'll have more of a following and
then you'll get more views on your
product by having someone else submit
for you than yourself so there's a whole
slew of ideas and tactics and tips for
product hunt that are out there just
that's why I take a look at it but
product hunt is a great community for
sharing the products and books and
everything that you've written for all
these communities when you're taking
that writing you've written about your
project and you submit to the community
and gets up there if there is a comment
form try to drive as many comments into
that comment that you're calling field
the more if you're you know someone says
your headline it says ten comments that
is vastly more interesting to click on
than something that says zero comments
so with hacker news or write or whatnot
if someone responds to your posting
being like that's a great post
immediately respond back yeah thank you
and then you've doubled the comments you
know so respond to discussion try to
bring other people in to start
discussion try to up that comment count
and your post as a whole will do better
quickly moving into social media because
you have your postings you've shared it
on to communities but you also want to
share it on to various social media
networks and there's a billion out there
so how do you know what to do I use
Twitter a lot for my my projects one
tack that I use for my books as I have a
completely separate Twitter account for
my books because under my personal
account I didn't want to just constantly
be talking about my books and maybe turn
people off when there might be falling
personal stuff or if someone's following
for book stuff turn them off I talk
about personal stuff so I have a divide
between my book stuff and my personal
account occasionally I will retweet one
from the other and if someone follows
both they'd still only get one thing in
their timeline but someone can follow
one or the other or both and it won't
get overwhelming and it helps me keep a
good divide of promoting the books that
I've written but also keeping my
personal account more personal
so that's Twitter yeah you can look into
facebook facebook pages exist but
Facebook can be really annoying because
Facebook wants you to pay so if you're a
poet you know have four hundred likes on
your page and you post something
Facebook will be like cool you've been
seen by five people give me 20 bucks so
I'll send two more people
oh so frustrating Facebook so I have a
Facebook page I set up my things to post
to Twitter and there's automatically
share to Facebook knowing that people
who've liked my page on Facebook might
not see it but it's automatic I don't
have to worry about it I can spend more
time doing development and design and
it's on Facebook
just in case someone sees it if you are
doing a project that has images
absolutely use Instagram and Pinterest
and like especially Instagram and
Instagram also is really annoying so
it's very hard to set up posts like
Twitter and Facebook you can set up
automatic postings you can use things
like buffer to send postings to those
services and set them up all at once and
then it will drip them out so so you can
spend a Sunday setting a bunch of posts
and they'll be dripped out through the
week you can do that for Twitter and
Facebook and every other reasonable
Network
but Instagram makes it really really
hard you go have to use it through your
phone but that is where the traffic is
and if you have a product or doing a
service that uses beautiful images and
you use these services and start
building with following this could be
where the majority of our traffic comes
from people use Instagram and Pinterest
for image based search and it's just key
for anyone who wants to market something
that uses pretty images there's a
billion others so basically whatever
you're building take a look at what
social media networks are out there see
if you can set up say automatic whenever
you write a blog post maybe I'll just
send to the right networks just like an
automatic hey by the way a new blog post
up maybe whenever you upload a new image
you'll automatically sign over the
Pinterest set up this these set up the
social media service that makes sense
for you but don't ignore it because it
could be a place where you can get a lot
of page views without a lot of work
wrapping up quick side note about
Kickstarter if you're running a product
this is something I use a lot for my
books I do Kickstarter's for my books
it's kind of a way for me to generate
interest in what I'm building and also
bring in some money in the beginning to
help me fund the development of my
project it doesn't have to be a physical
product in I'm involved in the Python
and Django world and there's been quite
a few different Django digital products
and services that I've been funded
through Kickstarter for example this is
a tutorial serious - excuse me a
tutorial series that raised $13,000 this
was schema migrations I actually went
into the official code base which rows 7
was raised 17,000 pounds so if you're
building an open-source project you can
use something my Kickstarter to bring in
some extra money generate some marketing
interest doesn't just have to be a
physical product you can do cold
emailing let's just can be frustrating I
did this a lot for my directories why
does email different businesses being
like by the way I have this product he
might like
some guidelines for doing cold emails
and I don't call because I'm an
introvert I don't I hate phones I'll do
emails keep your messages short if
you're doing emails make it personal
it's not like a human don't sound like a
robot sending on emails give them an
obvious benefit tell them how it helps
their business do this manually rather
than using a service as it it's really
easy to pick out when the services send
email on behalf of someone like you just
copy paste it into your Gmail box and
send it out maybe changing a few words
but try not to use when those automated
email services and you can follow it use
something like boomerang for Gmail to
let you know if the person doesn't
respond in a week so you can be like hey
by the way it's been a week don't want
to bug you but maybe take a look at this
just be a human you know what I'm
talking about you get emails like this
all the time when someone's like hey you
haven't responded to me in a week and
it's really obvious as a robot but if
your act like a human this could be a
good way of following up and getting
people who are generally too and too
busy to look at what you've sent them
blogging in general if you work with
small businesses this is what wedding
lovely does our blog is largely built by
the businesses we run we work with
businesses businesses have products they
want to share their products so they
give us the content and images we post
them on our blog they're happy their
stuff got posted cuz yeah our stuff is
live on a different server like someone
is promoting our stuff they share our
blog posts with their communities and
then we get the traffic and likes and
follows it's kind of this mutual
relationship mutual benefit so if you're
working with other businesses and they
have stuff that you can share on your
side and turn it into something where
you're you know taking content you out
the right sharing their content getting
the traffic and views and likes from
them win win win highly recommend it and
then marking tactics might not be worth
it I didn't go into paid advertising
because paid advertising is a place
where you can lose money really quickly
with while you're trying to figure out
what you're doing that said I will
occasionally do paid advertising on
small
networks like again reddit has read it
allows you to choose your sub reddits
you want to advertise on so for example
this is the open source subreddit you
can say you know just do an ad to just
people on that open source reddit allows
you to do a lot that are targeting less
likely for you to lose money and then
FYI collaborations with other projects
or businesses you're building something
and a person like a competitor or
someone in a related field says oh
that's awesome we can promote each other
I'll promote you you on my side you
promote me on your side let me tell you
from experience of eight years of doing
this it almost always is disappointing I
have stories we can't get into them even
uber I was supposed to wedding lovely
partner with uber uber screwed us that's
another story
ask me later just look at you know the
bet cost benefit of spending a time
promoting another business and make sure
it's worth it but fYI it usually isn't
but it all depends how many could
promote your businesses by doing
conference talks some deaf high books I
have books final reminders look at your
headlines on your website your messaging
and make sure that they're exciting and
relevant to your reader yeah I don't go
into content on your on your actual
website but the left side introduction
to building web apps using Python and
Django that is wordy and annoying and
not fun but learn how to build a web app
actually tells the person what it's the
product is doing for the person so look
at your wording on your website make
sure it's exciting and relevant because
it could be the thing that's preventing
people from signing up for what you're
building and then use the marketing
tools you set up again something I
sometimes forget to do like with
MailChimp and my mailing list
there is no sense spending a time to set
up analytics and making sure
everything's all tagged properly and
making sure you have an email list if
you don't actually use them so set
reminders for yourself to keep these
things active especially when you get
distracted with design development all
right last little bit go through those
quickly resources for more
stacking the bricks these used to be
unicorn free is a marketing blog it's
now stacking the bricks really awesome
marketing blog there is another book
called design for developers not done by
me done by another person but it's
really awesome really great community is
indie hackers lots of topic lots of
articles and podcasts from people
building products and launching and
telling their stories great place to
learn you go on a hacker news search for
how I you'll get a lot of really great
articles about how people did things
there's forums like bootstrapped
and read it so in conclusion marketing
is super hard it can be really
exhausting mentally exhausting but it
could be the key to getting what you've
built your open source project your
homepage your startup into the right
hands
so I hope some of these tips helped I'll
send out the slides and recommendations
on my twitter and then through various
lacs
and thank you so much for having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
