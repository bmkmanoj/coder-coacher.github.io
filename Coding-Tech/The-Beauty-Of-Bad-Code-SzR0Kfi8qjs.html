manager of the services team at NPM and
we do lots of really cool stuff we'll
get into a little bit of it today but
first I want to ask you all fist to high
five right how would you rate yourself
as a JavaScript developer we're like a
fist is you've just heard of JavaScript
yesterday it was kind of cool but you
know nothing to you and Brendan Eich
could have words and you can totally do
like a Fitbit sort of thing like yeah
okay cool and how many of you have ever
written bad code okay excellent
today we're going to talk about that
we're gonna talk about bad code and what
what what it is how to get rid of it
when it's good and when it can be kind
of bad so first I want to kind of give
you an overview of NPM if you've never
heard of it
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript
a lot of people think NPM stands for
node package manager but it turns out
that when the creator Isaac Schroeder
decided to create a package manager he
just picked three letters and n P and M
they don't actually stand for anything
you could say that it has no prescribed
meaning and even then you could say like
it being a package manager for
JavaScript is a little bit of a misnomer
because there's not just JavaScript in
our registry there's some CSS there's
some C C++
someone threw some rest in there the
other day I think there's some go so
really it's just a package manager but
our number one priority is to reduce
friction right NPM is a tool for you and
when you're using your tools you're
using it to do something more important
so we want to get out of your way as
much as possible we want to be as fast
and stable and reliable as possible so
with that I'm happy to announce the NPM
five was just released earlier this
morning
NP m5 was over a year in the making our
CLI team has been working really really
hard to make it fast reliable stable and
it's only gonna get faster from here on
out and if you really like this greased
lightning wombat I actually have a few
stickers I have a limited number of
stickers so you have to come say hi to
me and like actually talk to me and then
I will give you one so just keep that in
mind okay so that said we at NPM have
written a lot of code right in fact
we've rewritten our code several times
and what I mean by that is on our teams
like the website we've rewritten it run
our third rewrite right now the registry
API we're on our third rewrite right now
our operations we are constantly
rewriting things because terraform and
ansible are changing all the time and so
what that really means is we know bad
code we have seen it we have played with
it we have gotten rid of it all sorts of
things and so the big question is of
course what is bad code now when I was
preparing for this talk I took advantage
of our a 10:00 p.m. every Thursday we
have an engineering All Hands and and at
those meetings we kind of have like
discussion topics or presentations or
whatever and I came in one day and I was
like hey yo what is there any like good
things about bad code and basically they
helped me write this talk and by helped
me write this talk I mean I let them
talk and then I just took everything
they said and put into slides and so
what I'm going to show you today are
code samples of real code from NPM the
good news is most of it is not in
production anymore
all right so there are three major
categories of bad code right
there's functionality maintainability
and readability and the reason why I
call these the three categories of bad
code is because these are the three
tenets of good code right so if you're
missing one of these things then in
chances are your code is maybe not the
greatest it could be so let's break each
one down and kind of go
a little bit so functionality what is
the point of functional code it's
basically to make sure that your code
does what it says it's supposed to do
right like that's the whole point of
having code you want it to do something
so in order for it to be functional it's
gotta do stuff all right so when I think
about bad code kind of the first silly
verse silly thing that I think of is
like the supervillain code right like
this is the morally ethically bad code
and good news there's none of this in
the npm code base because we are good
open-source citizens and we do not do
bad things but there is one massive huge
code block and you can make nor most of
it except for the highlighted bits but
basically let's say I'm a hacker and I
make a package that does something evil
TM
then I get all their bank account
numbers and get super duper rich and
become a VC and create LinkedIn for cats
like this is morally bad right like this
is just evil code fortunately not
exactly real evil code in our code base
but we are trying to deflect it but
there are people who write bad code
viruses and password sniffers and all
sorts of things like that so that's like
bad code in one sense and English is
this worst language ever so the word bad
can mean lots of different things but
anyway let's go back to functionally bad
code so at the core functionally bad
code doesn't do the thing that it's
supposed to do right so here's a code
example this is in this was in an
integration test in our web site and the
the point of this code was to basically
check to make sure that redirects are
working when you go to NPM j/s comm
slash package name it doesn't actually
go there it goes to slash package slash
package name so that's just how things
work but a lot of people will do in PJs
comm slash package cool let's make sure
that there's a redirect that works and
you can actually see ok well package
redirect is that's fantastic good good
solid name and and and then we've got
you know it's actually a selenium test
so it's going to the URL of slash
express and then it's waiting till the
page loads and then checking to make
sure that it reaches the package page
called
press cool except why is the name of the
test user with feature flag goes to the
new org creation page I don't know this
is not really doing what it says it's
supposed to do so this is functionally
not great code let's talk about with
security risks right so with security
risks you're opening up yourself and
your users to potentially malicious code
right like now you're opening it up to
the bad actors who do the bad
supervillain code and so example this is
statics we have a static page renderer
in parts of our website and okay cool no
big deal but what does it essentially do
it basically goes in and it says all
right well let's format this URL and
it's got two variables in it one of them
is system set that's fine we can trust
our own system but one of them is user
set if there's one thing you need to
remember about security is never trust
the user ever ever ever right so in a
perfect world someone would go to that
safe slash policies and that would just
take us to the new dub-dub / master
slash policy is that MD and that's fine
that's where we want them to go but
let's say we have a bad actor and they
want to go to dot dot slash dot dot
slash corporate secret slash all the
passwords MD and I'm not saying that
that file exists in your codebase but if
it did this would be bad so then there's
always the case of only testing the
happy path right when you're thinking oh
well you know this is the way that a
user should do things well again never
trust the user and so if you neglect to
handle error states then you're actually
neglecting very large swathes of your
code so example we have some old website
code here that is for browsing packages
by keyword and okay so what does it do
well it checks the logged in user and
then puts together you know a list of
all the different packages that they can
see and then it chunks it up paginates
it and renders the view great cool
fantastic what's missing here nobody
nobody
Buhler okay so we're not catching any
errors right and so yeah hypothetically
it should be fine but if something
happens in like you know the list
function and it doesn't return something
right we're gonna send a 500 to the user
so that's kind of it's just right for
bugs and we don't want to do that so
this is functionally not optimal code
okay so that's functionality let's talk
about maintainability now the importance
of maintainability is that we want to
make sure that if our code needs to
evolve it can evolve right so something
that's not maintainable means that in
order to change the code you're gonna
have to either completely gut it or
you're gonna have to sit there for hours
and hours trying to figure out what the
heck is going on a classic example
spaghetti code right what does this look
like it this is lack of clear flow
control it's just kind of gnarly and so
what we have here is our validate in
store code which basically checks to
make sure that a user is allowed to
unpublish a package once upon a time
somebody unpublished a package and it
did bad things mm-hmm won't say who but
but we've fixed that now but look at
this code right like I'm basically you
can see me highlighting the different
vendor on this promise chain and it's
just like what is going on it's just
keeps going on and on and on and on and
this is pretty spaghetti it's not
particularly maintainable because now
you have to keep all this context and
it's just kind of gross and then you
have another instance of bad maintain
like unmaintainable code which is code
with side effects and so what happens
here is your end up doing more than
what's advertised and you end up having
like you have a function that's doing
too much without telling anybody that
it's doing too much so for example here
we have some code that checks to make
sure that you are authorized to publish
a private package and so you're checking
the cache okay that's a great name for a
function but then somehow you could
maybe create a package as part of
creating this or checking the cache like
that's a little bit funky if somebody if
something were to go wrong
the creation of this package and we get
that log later on we're not going to
immediately go to the check cash
function right we're gonna go someplace
else we're gonna not know where to go
this is side effects in your code and
that's really difficult to get to to
maintain ideally you would have
something like check cache and create
package if necessary but that's a really
long weird name so keep that in mind too
all right now for everybody's favorite
section readability what's important
about readability you want to make sure
that someone else whether that's you or
maybe that's like a teammate or maybe
that's even just you in six months or
six weeks or six minutes later because
you went to the restroom and then had to
come back and you're like what did I do
here it's really important that your
code is readable so that other people or
you can look back on this code and
continue to work on it
the most classic example of unreadable
code to me is clever code right so when
something is too clever it it makes it
really really difficult for anybody to
get in on it so here's a fun example I
mean I know what it's like to be a
clever dev right you're like oh my god
I'm so brilliant I have made this
hundred line function into ten lines
look at me I'm so smart okay yeah great
except what on earth is going on here
like really like this is a ternary
inside a ternary inside a ternary inside
a ternary and if you don't know what a
ternary is it's probably better off
right like like this is just what is
going on here if it takes you more than
30 seconds to go like if you need if you
need a pen and paper I know we work on
computers but sometimes people like need
like the old-school like pen plus paper
to figure out what's going on maybe it's
too clever mm-hmm or maybe you've got
something that's just a little too long
we've seen these right we've seen the
functions that go on forever and ever
and ever and this is this is a piece of
code that's
it basically is trying to load
everything we need in order to get to an
org landing page it's a hundred and
fifty lines long this is not okay the
ROC the problem with this is that when
you're writing code I want you to think
about writing code and reading code like
eating a piece of pizza right if you
have to like consume the entire slice in
one sitting or I guess you don't really
do slices here in Norway like if you do
the whole pie like everybody here uses
forks and knives and we're barbarians
amuse our hands in the US but you know
it's it's important to not have to like
eat the entire piece of pizza at one
time should be able to like eat in
little chunks and so if you have this
really massively long thing you can't
you can't maintain the scope of it all
in your head it's just too much it's not
readable and then finally this is the
really fun one this is the one that
everyone on Twitter and medium and
everything like to go in on style
standards right and I'm talking about
code style and so let's take a look at a
piece of code we have a loud bot on our
NPM SLAC this is the code behind the
loud bot so what's wrong with this code
well let's see first of all we're using
tabs like what is that and not only are
they tabs but they're four space tabs
and then you know that weird newline
curly place like what is this C++ and
then semicolons at the H and whoa hold
up and hanging semicolons yeah no no
there is nothing wrong with this code in
fact that code is functional
maintainable and readable all at once
it's really important to remember that
style is personal it's so common to see
people screaming on Twitter like Oh
semicolons no semicolons tabs faces fam
Emacs um whatever like it doesn't really
matter style is personal it'd be the
equivalent of me coming in and being
like y'all black is so last year you
need to just you know change all your
clothes cuz that's just gross like
that's just rude that's rude don't do
that
all right so here's my recommendation
instead of having to deal with all this
style stuff use a linter and get over it
for those of you who are wondering what
a linter is it's basically a script that
will automatically change the style of
your code you can have it do two options
you can have it warn you and say hey we
agreed there'd be no semicolons in this
code base you've got a semicolon maybe
you should get rid of it or you can have
it automatically do it and just like
when you press save it just goes by
semicolon this is how I prefer I
actually prefer the automated way
because personally I don't want anybody
to tell me what to do I just want the
robot to just do it for me all right
okay cool so we've talked about lots of
different ways of you know different
types of bad code so now let's talk
about how to minimize this bad code so
in order to minimize at first we need to
be able to identify it we've talked
about different categories but now let's
what are the the signs that we see that
are like okay this is smelly gross code
so lots of different options first of
all if there are many branching paths
right you've got lots of if-then-else
trees if you've got a bunch of Turner
E's if you've got a bunch of dot bends
whatever maybe that's like your gut you
have too many for inches too many paths
that's smelly if you have
context-dependent understanding like if
somebody needs a PhD just to understand
how to do whatever it is in your code
like that's not particularly helpful yes
there is some inherent knowledge but
think about it from a new developer
perspective like somebody who's just
joining your team if they need to spend
six months just try to understand your
codebase before they can contribute to
it that's a bad code smell and then also
weird slash long variable names right
like so in this example that I gave
before a check cache and create package
if necessary like yes that's nice in an
understandable name but it's really long
maybe you're doing too much classic
works on my machine right like if it
works on your machine
great I'm proud
you you can have a cookie but if it
doesn't work on anybody else's that's a
code smell and it's really classic
people love to like make their own stuff
right like the not invented here like oh
yeah you know it'd be really great
I could totally create a new lager
instead of just using console dot log it
would be a package that just I don't
know whatever whatever people wouldn't
like to do and invent on their own but
an NPM we really love the idea of many
small modules right like that's our
ethos but think of it this way you could
spend your time writing all of these
different modules for yourself brand new
whatever or you can go onto NPM search
which actually works now and you can yes
and you can try to find another module
that already does the thing that you
want and the beauty of this is if it
really has really good tests and you've
got a lot of people downloading it then
those are edge cases that you don't have
to worry about finding later and it
means that you know you could just focus
on getting your actual work done and if
they don't have everything that you want
you can just put in a pull request
because yeah open-source okay and
finally the stinkiest cheese of all the
smells if you know it's gonna break it's
probably gonna break and it's probably
not very good code okay so you now you
know that you've identified all of now
that we have identified all of the
smells let's find a way talk about how
to clean them and so one of the biggest
things that we like to do at NPM is pair
programming and some some companies they
do like the full eight-hour pair
programming because in height you know
that's really asking a lot at NPM we try
to do just like an hour-long sort of
pair programming session and what's
really great about this is you have
another set of eyes especially when
you've been working on the same piece of
code for days or weeks it you you miss
stuff and having a fresh pair of eyes
take a look at it they can ask questions
like that's a really long weird variable
name are you sure you're not doing too
much in that and that you know function
or something and so this is really
really helpful I also like to encourage
people to commit early
and often and to make sure that your
tests pass after every single commit the
benefit of this is that you can go
through and you can say all right here's
my commit I've done this thing and and
you can see oh wow I just added like
seventy five different lines to this one
function maybe I should put that down
and so being able to keep track of your
commits is really useful that said write
tests
I know writing tests is a huge pain in
the butt I get it but it's really really
helpful to automate the automate away
somebody else checking your code to make
sure that it's at least functional right
like tests aren't going to automatically
check if it's readable or maintainable
but they will check to make sure that
it's functional and anything that you
can get computers to do instead of a
human I think is always a good thing
and honestly if you're writing a test
and it's too hard to write the test
maybe your code is a little too complex
so that's a good way to kind of check to
make sure that it is actually
maintainable like I said before use a
linter at NPM we like to use standard I
I think it's really important but folks
really spend the time that they would
spend arguing about style to just come
to a decision and just keep going and
working on things it just doesn't make
any sense to constantly be going through
and being like oh well you know I hate
your semicolons well I hate your
semicolon I don't know okay code reviews
finally last but not least code reviews
at NPM we try really hard to ensure that
nobody merges their own code by
themselves and the reason for this is to
ensure accountability across the team
right so if you're the only one who
knows how the code works and you push it
to production and then it breaks and
then you go on vacation like everyone
else is kind of stuck so having good
code reviews is really central essential
to making sure that your code is doing
what it needs to do now when I do a code
review I take forever and there's a
reason for this I have a three step
process and I want to share with you so
when I'm looking at a pull request I do
a full holistic overview right like I'll
take a look at the the description in
the pull request and make sure that what
they say that
is gonna do actually matches what the
code does so that's the functional bit
and then I go commit by commit and I
make sure that each commit is
maintainable
in each and every single section that
way I can be like okay yes this makes
sense I can see where this is going and
then I go line by line in each commit
and that's to make sure that it stays
readable I make sure that there are no
spelling errors and I make sure that
everything's kind of going exactly the
way it should so yes it takes me forever
to finish a code review but at the end I
feel confident when it goes out to
production and that it's not gonna
totally break everything okay so all of
that said when is bad code good right
now this is the crux of this talk right
because it's really fun to make fun of
bad code but you know it could be good
too okay CG Silverio is our CTO and she
actually spoke here at web rebels a
couple years ago and she said this
wonderful thing in our chat a few months
ago about this and she said the beauty
and horror of code is you get to see how
other people think and I think this is
so beautiful right but through someone
else's code we can get in some insight
into their brains like that's just such
a huge humanitarian sort of thing like
oh my god I see into your brain into
your soul through your cold like so cool
but honestly when we're writing bad code
a lot of us don't always know that it's
bad code at the time right like whether
you're just starting out or even just
playing around with a new concept you
don't know what's bad until later when
you go back and you go wait a minute
there's a bug here oh shoot I have no
idea where this came from we refactor
right that's a great opportunity because
it's a learning opportunity and so I
think when we write bad code it's
learning opportunity for us to improve
ourselves and when we write bad code
it's really it's practice right it's
it's an it's an opportunity for your
code to give you the feedback so that
you can be better so if you're going
back and refactoring you've now learned
a thing about how to ensure that you
don't write that kind of bad code again
those of us who are a little bit more
advanced in our careers how many of you
have ever just written code because it's
good enough you're like alright you know
what I just got to get this done so
whatever I just need to get it get it
good enough or maybe it's like maybe
it's exploratory code maybe you're
playing with a new framework for the
first time and you're like you know what
I don't need variables everything can be
you know a global it's totally fine
whatever I just want to play around with
this new thing and that's great it's
totally fine
I think it's important remember perfect
is the enemy of the good
right okay and then for those of you who
work on product or maybe even work on
client work but particularly you product
folks you're with me on this sometimes
you know you have to ship it's that it's
that last minute moment and you're like
oh my god I have to ship this and I'm I
feel really dirty like shipping this
code this is gross but after we ship
this I'm gonna have time to clean this
up so I'm gonna I'm gonna purposely make
it really ugly so that when I come back
to it in a little while I'll go oh good
god this is the gross disgusting I've
ever seen and it's like a signal to
refactor and and then you feel really
good because you're cleaning it all up I
don't know about you but I've got devs
on my team or just like yes this is the
greatest thing ever so you write it to
throw it away on purpose and and so
that's fine sometimes you just got a
ship and then finally I think it's
important to remind people that bad code
is more than just code it's really
common for folks to like create these
really great interfaces and they write
these tests but underneath it all it's
really ugly and if you've ever looked at
the CLI codebase from before NPM five
and even still in NPM five there are
gonna be some some trolls hidden under
the bridges but it can it can be kind of
scary in there but know that most people
don't really notice they don't really
care because as long as it works on the
CLI like as long as I go and come
install and it does the thing I need it
to it's fine
but it's important to actually run the
code before you judge things so I want
to show you my very first JavaScript
that I've ever written ever and this was
apply eight years ago and and so I
actually submitted this for my first web
dev job ever I was like oh you know I
want to I want to be a JavaScript
developer how hard can this be I'm gonna
do something cool and so this was my
very first code for my very first
JavaScript code I wrote C++ and Python
before that and I got rejected
I was totally rejected nobody wanted to
hire me and so let's let's take a look
at why right so yeah okay there's some
Python e-type syntax and I'd totally did
the new line C++ II thing and to be fair
there's some really too clever variable
names like what is VIP I don't I don't
even remember and you definitely need to
have some sort of advanced understanding
to understand what is even going on here
but but what happens when you actually
run this code what you'll see here is a
fully articulated three-dimensional hand
I was a robot assist before I came into
web dev and so I know some of you are
looking at and go wow wow wow right
because it's like that is not human that
is not how a hand works but why are you
saying oh it's because it's close enough
to reality that you're starting to self
identify with it and so like I'm not
bitter or anything that they rejected me
for this code I mean honestly I work at
NPM now so I think I turned out okay but
come on like if they had actually run
the code they pi would have seen some
promise and all this to say bad code is
part of our origin stories right every
single one of us has a story about the
bad code that they've written like it's
just part of who we are we've all done
it and in fact when we sat down and
talked about bad code at NPM we're all
like sitting there with smiles and
laughing and we're just
because it's like oh man there was this
one time I wrote this really bad code
and it did this really awful thing haha
you're right and like every single one
of us does this all the time and
honestly every time you change languages
you kind of fall into this whole thing
again anyway right like of course it
varies with experience those of us who
have done more languages we tend to
figure out the code smells ahead of time
and it's just syntax but I do want to
remind everybody that just like when
you're learning a new foreign language
when you're writing when you're learning
a new coding language you write with
accents right so like you have this
whole I had a pythoness pythonista C++
ish type accent when I was writing my
first JavaScript we all do it and so
that's why I think code style in
particular is a silly code smell anyway
so we talked about what is bad code how
to fix it
what's good about bad code but now let's
talk about what's wrong with bad code
and ultimately it's that we mock bad
code we make fun of it and that's it's
okay if it's our own code but when we
make fun of other people's code then
things start to get a little bit weird
right it's become this weird
institutionalized behavior like some
sort of rite of passage of you know oh
well that person made fun of my code on
Twitter so I'm gonna find some other
Rando and be like hahaha
that's a terrible looking code you
should feel bad for yourself but what
happens what happens is that new people
come in and they're afraid they're
genuinely scared to publish anything
publicly because they're afraid that
they're gonna get mocked - and what kind
of environment is that that we're
creating for each other like that's no
fun you shouldn't have to be weeded out
for being too sensitive like it's just
code y'all and we create this like super
unhealthy attachment to our code you end
up having people who are either
extremely like stubborn about their code
like oh well I wrote that code and you
will not touch it it is mine and and and
this is a very important and it cannot
be removed from production ever because
I wrote it right or you have this other
side of things
people are like oh my god like they just
have this self feeling I don't know how
to call it like it like they
self-identify with their code and so
they're like oh my god you made fun of
my code you're making fun of me oh my
code is bad and therefore I am bad too
right and it it becomes the source of
shame like yeah I wrote some bad code
and I feel really bad about it now and
it's it's yo code is ultimately zeros
and ones it's a it's a thing for the
computers it's not about us at all that
said code is an act of communication
right it's it's how we talk to each
other so that we can we humans control
the machines don't believe anything
anybody else ever tells you the machines
will never be taking over I promise you
this I've seen too many robots fall off
the stage so code is how we communicate
with each other to make sure that the
robot underlings do exactly what we want
them to and like any act of
communication writing good code is hard
it's really hard it takes years and
years of practice I've been coding for
over 10 years and I am still learning
new things like accompany conferences
because I want to learn how to code even
better right and hopefully every single
one of you has been learning something
new at this conference I know I have so
ultimately please accept the bad code so
that you can become great developers
that's how this needs to work
so to close I want to share with you a
blog post that I wrote at the end of
2010 no sorry 2014 and it's pretty short
so I'm just gonna read it verbatim your
code is not a reflection of you it isn't
a reflection of your beliefs your
upbringing or your ability to be a good
person your code is however a reflection
of your thinking process at the time
that you wrote it
given our innate ability to change our
minds consider other viewpoints and play
with new ideas why do we hold our code
so dear your code can
change your code will change and your
code must change if it's ever going to
get better
so stop marrying your code the sooner
you accept this the happier you will be
and the better programmer you will
become I promise
