kind of a big claim that motion design
is to the 21st century what graphic
design was to the 20th century
ubiquitous versatile powerful it's like
I'm selling that truck I called the
lingua franca for visual culture alright
with that Proclamation ringing in your
ears let's get onto the predictions and
these are designed to be a little
contentious a little loosey-goosey
that's just so we can kind of you know
think a little more about them and
remember the context I'm talking about
motion design not the universe in
general but it's worth asking why even
make predictions like what's the point
in doing that I think that making
predictions is kind of a pretty sharp
lens on how to look at what you're doing
now on your current practice what's
going on in the landscape sometimes
you're stuck in a rut and you don't even
realize it until you start thinking
about the future and you start wondering
if you're pointed in the in the right
way but most important at least for me
making predictions is just good
old-fashioned fun all right so the first
prediction number one CG will eat the
world what does that mean this is kind
of a master prediction that's gonna
unlock some of the stuff I'm gonna talk
about later so CG here
computer-generated okay so for lay
people that's 3d I'm not talking about
stereoscopic 3d where you need glasses
talking about you know 3d rendered
images usually usually flat not always
okay so there are three main factors
that are driving CG is growing appetite
at least as I see it the first one is
hardware related to suck unless software
related and the third one is what I call
market forces now we're gonna dive in
these real fast cuz I think they're
interesting but also because it helps us
understand where everything is headed
hardware so there's been like a giant
revolution happening in the hardware
space well for computing in general it's
obviously affecting CG so the old the
old powerhouse of the computer you were
probably talking about in school to
central processing into the CPU it's
starting to share more and more of its
responsibilities and tasks with the GPU
the graphics processing unit or
graphical processing unit and that's
because the GPU can perform many many
more simultaneous tasks than the CPU
by itself so you've got this new
gpu-accelerated architecture you've
probably heard that phrase before so in
the software well especially in CG
software we've got third-party render
engines like octane redshift and a few
others they're taking advantage of this
this new architecture and they're making
interactive rendering or live rendering
or whatever their marketing part
marketing department is calling it let
me get out the new norm for cg software
so like in this scene here on the Left
that's octane render it's rendering the
scene on the right with physically
accurate lighting some depth of field
effects and notice that you know as soon
as the user manipulates the scene and
updates almost instantaneously now if
you haven't worked in CG before you're
probably like who cares but trust me
this is a big deal
it makes CG a lot more approachable a
lot a lot more gratifying faster and
just more fun for a wider range of
visual thinkers than ever before
when I stay on the software tip for just
a minute because there's been so much
progress in this space the software has
gotten a lot more powerful but it's also
gotten easier to use that sequence on
the left that's the genesis sequence
from Star Trek to Wrath of Khan 1982
it's one of the earliest 100% CG
sequences in a feature film it was
created by a team of computer scientists
and artists who wrote thousands of lines
of code over the course of like two
years or something really impressive
obviously for the time this thing on the
right
that's one dude who was doing a tutorial
on his own I obviously that's not a real
a fair comparison but the point is that
software has gotten incredibly powerful
there's also communities to help you
learn that stuff and the barrier to
entry is just dropping dropping dropping
for getting into CG so the third factor
that's contributing to this rise is
across industries there's this rising
demand for cutting-edge experiences that
rely on some sort of CG for their
presentation layer she got augmented
virtual and mixed realities obviously
you've got
installation projects like some of the
stuff you saw outside not to mention too
like native apps and games and stuff for
existing platforms for all of them
CG especially real-time CG can be a
shared tool that builds a bridge between
humans and code we're going to talk a
little bit more about this later
but I think this is a good time to make
a point that computers don't create
computer animation any more than a
pencil creates pencil animation what
creates computer animation is the artist
so it says John Lasseter co-founder of
Pixar I'm just trying to say that looks
CG is not an aesthetic CG is not a look
it's an ever expanding toolkit are the
implications for CG is rise are are huge
and they're going to affect us affect
aesthetics but it's not an aesthetic
unto itself so in the realm of motion
design more and more animators and
designers are finding courage to dive
into the deep deep waters of CG and this
is giving rise to new aesthetics that
blend photo real rendering for instance
with 2d animation or graphic design and
reality is increasingly becoming clay
and people are learning how to sculpt
with it
CG is capable of anything
realism sure but also stylization
dimensionality of course but also
flatness more and more designers and
animators who previously just weren't
interested in CG are starting to warm up
to it and they're bringing their own
look to it and by the way this is all
this is all CG here so if you guys are
familiar with CG none of these textures
were from texture maps this is all
procedurally generated in modo
as Alex ting Felder who did this with
some design work from Joshua Harvey look
okay so the second prediction is kind of
a counterpoint to that big monster
prediction we just got through analog
will make sense again so before I say
anything else I'm going to show you two
projects one is an excerpt from a larger
project and then the second one is a
kind of a standalone add America if you
care about your food the environment
your children
or the future of all mankind go here you
don't have to buy everything those big
agrochemical companies are simply mother
the first day Nature Made rocks lava
noise second same but on the 300 billion
and first life and with life
there's fruit the next day brought ice
and you go convenient and today you did
a smoothie dole keep growing I love that
guy's place Oh
a smoothie alright so some of you see
this coming already I'm sure but that
first one 100% CG okay it's obviously
trying to look like stop-motion right
they got the reduced frame rate the
cameras are pretty well locked down or
on simple paths and they did an amazing
job trying to make it look like
stop-motion right the first time I saw
it I thought at least at the very least
that it was blended some kind of CG
stop-motion thing all stop-motion
incredible from buck they never cease to
amaze so the second one of course it's
the opposite it's mostly analog
techniques in camera tricks some
stop-motion photography you'll see a
computer sequence here in this making up
video just a second that's to simulate
how leaves might grow on the planet
which they used as a guide to actually
do the stop-motion animation so what I
think about these two projects
back-to-back I think about how they were
made this is kind of how I feel you know
it's gotten to the point where it's like
virtually impossible to distinguish
between analog and CG or digital
techniques it's certainly impossible for
my mom and she's more representative of
viewers at large than you know any of us
here in the room so the weird thing is
that it like it used to be that you
would choose analog techniques like you
know stop-motion claim
or something like that because you
wanted their warmth and their
imperfections to shine through in the
end product right but thanks to advances
in both technology and just like general
craftsmanship it's gotten very very hard
to discern how something was made with
its CG was a hand made some blend so
I've seen now advertisers sometimes they
try to like use the making of piece of
the process stuff they'll put that on
social media try to make it part of the
campaign but that just underscores the
point that I'm trying to make which is
that analog as a term and as an
aesthetic has lost its meaning
you know analog techniques have been
striving for digital perfection digital
techniques been striving for analog
imperfection and they're both winning
they're both doing a great job which is
fine if the work is amazing it's
breathtaking beautiful and I think is
kind of a side benefit we're setting the
stage for analog some kind of real raw
imperfect analog to make a big comeback
because that's the way the old pendulum
works right back in the a little 19th
century the camera was born right and it
brought with it this this realism that
even the most talented painters would
strive their whole lives to achieve
right so it really threw a curveball at
painting who've been trying to achieve
that realism for so long but you know
photography was looking at painting and
thinking well we like paintings use of
Lights and compositions that inform
photography then the painters kind of
said you know what let's embrace the
limitations of painting and make images
that photography could never make
painters gave up the struggle for
painting to be anything other than
painting
so maybe analog animation techniques are
poised for a similar revolution or
Renaissance there are a lot of people
out there working in this weird space
and they're just waiting for taste to
change and market forces to catch up all
right another prediction
this one's near and dear to my heart as
I said my first timeline was flash flash
3.0 so I'm close to the web who
remembers this show of hands
yeah Oh a lot of went right up okay is
the old people this is a
this is 13 years old I wanted this is
the 2004 I believe portfolio site for
two advanced studios it was created by
Eric Jordan I wanted to find a 2001
version because that was like such a big
deal it's hard to overstate how this and
other projects like it influenced a
generation of designers working on the
web and that was one of them this was a
time when like the line between web
design and motion design which we didn't
call it that back then it was just
getting blurrier and blurrier and it was
super exciting and a lot of it was made
possible by flash but of course you know
the iPhone came along bringing with it
the death of flash maybe he just sped up
the inevitable thing I don't know a lot
of people like celebrated they're like
dancing on the grave of Flash but I was
sad you know I knew that a very precious
baby had just been thrown out with the
bathwater
you know that this along with this whole
death of wasn't really just about flash
was about the death of the rich web that
term I used earlier so video and
animation which was previously
completely integrated into the
experience now it's in boxes on YouTube
and Vimeo and Facebook everybody grabbed
everything and put it back in its place
on the web Pandora's box was just
hammered shut so yeah the web has become
a lot more usable but become a lot less
exciting to look I get it so a lot of
people made bad stuff with flash and it
was riddled with you know security holes
and performance problems whatever but it
was also groundbreaking it introduced
animation and motion design to millions
of people both as creators and consumers
it was a rule-breaking genre-bending
glorious tool and platform and I don't
want to forget it ok so now let's say
you want to do some web animation a
current in the current day
yeah you better dust off your github
account so web animation is dominated by
dozens if not hundreds of libraries and
frameworks for javascript and CSS and
God knows what else this is just a quick
smattering of some of the popular
frameworks out there there's no
guarantee that these are going to do
what you want them to do on the platform
or device that you wanted to do also
there's new ones every week and then the
old ones just kind of wither away
died after people stopped working on
them there are some tools growing number
of tools out there that are like
standalone tools kind of like flash
where you can work in a visual workflow
these are for creating production ready
animation ideally not prototype
animation if you use any of these then
you know that they're not really code
free in most cases you got to end up
popping the hood getting in there
messing around tweak things to get it to
work how you want by the way this is the
product page for tumults heiped which i
think is in version 3.6 right now I
check out these companies my laser
pointer
check out these key features timelines
actions scenes those were like standard
fare in the early 2000s and flash same
terms even so look and nothing against
um oh they they're doing a great job
building an awesome tool visual tool for
working this way they have to keep up
with all these shifting specs and you
know platforms and stuff it's just that
we've been here before and it was all a
whole hell of a lot easier this is an
encouraging thing though there's some
interesting projects out there this is a
demo for body movin which is a library
for exporting vector animation from
After Effects to JavaScript SVG like
little JSON file it's really cool it's
it's for creating a web animation
basically what we're seeing here is an
inverse kinematics arm rig from After
Effects being rendered in real time
animated in real time so those aren't
baked keyframes those that's the actual
After Effects effects expressions
driving the animation it's very cool
body movement was cited as kind of
inspiration or reference for Facebook's
keyframes projects keyframes is open
source project kind of like air BnB
zloty ello TTT IE l OTT ie
too many T's both of them lotty and key
frames are they allow you to work in
After Effects and then bring your
animation over for native iOS and
Android development Markus Eckert has
been doing this for I think longer with
squall and some other project he's been
working on all of this stuff those not
for the web Rises for native iOS and
Android development but it's cool that
people understand that the tools that
people want are the tools that allow
them to use the most powerful tool in
their tool belt which for emotion is
iers a lot of times is after
it could be a CG tool so there's work
being done here it's encouraging it's
exciting it's you know not nearly as
easy as it used to be obviously but the
web is warming up to motion again and I
am super excited about it
some people never gave up right they
just adapted their technology Jam three
here in Toronto they've been making this
stuff like forever
this is a new project or a newish
project from from them and it shows how
motion design can help us reimagine that
rich web that I've talked about before
now some people poopoo this kind of
design you know it doesn't fit in some I
don't know a small box of what the web
is supposed to be but that's BS yeah I
don't want the web to be an ordered
encyclopedia I want it to be fun
exciting and an encyclopedia so here's
an example totally different again with
motion design playing with kind of just
editorial design to create a really fun
experience that communicates some real
clear brand values I think we regenerate
a lot of this stuff out that we're gonna
see more and more especially as the
tools make this a little easier all
right prediction number four you knew I
was gonna have to go here motion design
will be the visual markup language for
augmented reality ok augment reality
virtual reality mixed reality before we
talk about this stuff before you talk
about motion designs role in this stuff
let's go down a rabbit hole because
there's a lot of confusion about these
terms and how they're used so I'm gonna
use this as my kind of framework
professor Paul Milgram proposed the
reality virtuality continuum back in
1994 like during the first wave of VR
and stuff so it's got some problems but
it's a good bird's-eye view of things so
we're gonna step through it real quick
cuz it's fun and it helps helps us talk
about this stuff so on the left-hand
side is the real world the real
environment right unfiltered objects
people stuff junk
look at this picture is so depressing
then anybody to notice that I chose that
there's a bottle of hand sanitizer right
there is that not funny to anybody else
okay so for the real environment you
don't need much in terms of hardware in
my case I need some glasses
you know just normal glasses if we go
all the way to the other end of
spectrum to the virtual environment this
is 100% computer-generated fully
immersive stuff there's no real-world
peeking through here you're totally in a
virtual world so the demo you're looking
at here is from first contact you can
see the user in the corner super tiny
but he's got an oculus rift headset I've
got the oculus touch controllers that's
controlling the hands in the environment
okay so that's all the way to the right
you guys know some of the big players in
the space they're all over the news
but there's so much going on in this
spaces you know hardware manufacturers
startups content creators academics VR
is here to stay this time around okay I
was around in the 90s I know what
failure looks like and this is knit
we've we've been like a bicycle helmet
yeah like it oh sorry
it's crazy whatever okay so let's talk
about these middle two terms this is
where things get a little weird
because we've got I'm gonna reality
which we've all heard of but we have
augmented virtuality so together Paul
Milgram called these mixed reality which
is another one you've probably heard but
it's that term on the right it's a
little problematic it's not really used
a lot it's hard to find compelling
examples especially in this context so
we're gonna I'm gonna change things a
little I'm just gonna do a little loop
do and help you guys you're okay with
that
this might rub somebody the wrong way
but look not even the tech giant's who
were pushing these terms agree on what
they mean and how they should be used so
let's just live with it for a second
okay augmented reality it's the classic
augmented reality here this window on
the world augmented reality is we have
the real environment and yeah of
information or graphics layered on top
of it I worked on this project on the
left side up about four years ago we
made it in three days the bottleneck
wasn't the tech it was the animation so
it's not hard to do this stuff it's been
around for a while then we can move into
the kind of like cool emerging Hardware
space I hope you guys did the demo for
hololens there's other cool stuff that I
think would fit in this same category
out there so in in the kind of headset
space there's a lot of innovation
happening you know by the way Microsoft
calls this mixed reality so
whatever it's fine mix reality I'm gonna
bail you it's not gonna kind of get
mixed up together so you're seeing the
same idea you've got graphics composited
onto the real world but what makes this
super compelling is that they're kind of
fixed in space right and they can stay
on a wall or a floor or a desktop or
whatever it's not perfect obviously the
the field of view is really narrow and
some other problems but it's pretty damn
exciting well I I there's there's other
people in this space there's I haven't
used this headset yet but Mehta has one
and daiquiris are kind of like going
after the commercial application space
enterprise space have to mention magic
leap these guys have raised over a
billion dollars in funding with Google
as a lead investor and they have yet to
reveal their hardware to the public this
demo is really impressive it's a it's
shot right through the technology no
compositing no special effects but
without having seen the hardware it just
feels like too good to be true I don't
know we'll see all right so why am I
going on about why why am I going on to
all these nuances well I think it's
really important especially for motion
design do you understand these nuances
because this is gonna make or break kind
of how you move forward so I think the
clearest path forward from motion design
is actually through augmented reality
not through virtual reality augmented
reality is poised for faster adoption
than VR and the technological barriers
to entry for motion designers is much
lower so I'm gonna make this argument a
little deeper here
okay so first we're gonna go back to the
right-hand side of the spectrum back in
virtual reality VR land there's two
kinds of VR generally speaking right now
you got cinematic and interactive or
what I call true VR so cinematic is you
guys are probably done this
it's GD put the headset on you're
looking around in the video as you move
you know you're looking at if you can't
touch anything but these gonna be really
cool very powerful experiences but as
cool as they are this isn't like the
real promise of VR right it's basically
filmmaking on a sphere it's probably
gonna piss people off but look I'm not
trying to downplay like the creative and
technical challenges and making this 360
content it's it's hard and it's fun and
very powerful stuff but
the ultimate goal of VR also not a super
exciting space for motion design the
ultimate goal of VR is like fully
interactive words worlds words worlds
rendered in real time right worlds where
you can pick up objects you can move
through space you can interact with
other characters or other people so via
our real VR requires considerably more
computing power and considerably more
technical expertise to pull it off this
is go a quote from Gabe Newell he's the
co-founder of valve and they're the co
developers of the HTC vive high-end VR
headset and if you read this while I'm
talking which is probably hard
he's very realistic about where VR is
and how far it has to go they want more
than anybody for VR to reach those
science-fiction levels that we all dream
of don't get me wrong okay look I love
VR I'm super pumped about VR but for
motion design diving in the VR and this
interactive VR means basically building
worlds from scratch it's a lot more akin
to game development than it is to
contemporary motion design and if you
wanna do that that's totally cool that's
totally fine but you gotta know that
you're taking on a whole new paradigm
and with that they're gonna come high
costs of Technology and expertise and
just time time to make mistakes and
learn and it's not a great deal of
business out there probably for you
either
so some motion design and animation
studios are making a go at it
tendrils here they made Sankara they've
done actually a lot in this space I
salute the pioneering effort there
because you have to have these people
pushing the leading edge I'm just
talking about motion designers in
general I think AR is is a little like
lower hanging fruit the last week at the
Facebook Developers Conference
smartphone based AR but really just AR
in general was a big piece of their
story it was like the the centerpiece
from Mark Zuckerberg ski note he the the
message he was trying to communicate was
super clear he actually said to the
audience if you take one thing away from
this talk this is what he want you to
take away his his point is augment
reality it's now it's already mainstream
it's already available the platform of
the future is in your pockets and your
purses so for him for Facebook
augmented reality on our phones at least
is not only a technology platform it's
it's a marketplace and it's also a
public gathering space this is a really
cool animated art piece that's mapped to
the side of Facebook building and
Facebook's campus I'd like to see this
is apparently something you can check
out now so somebody's seen it I'd love
to know about it this is a great example
though of augmented reality if like
basically motion design as a markup
layer for for reality and this was
created by super-bright it's a fashion
show right so you go to the show and
every time the model comes out you look
through your phone and you can see the
designer where you can buy it how much
it costs it's really smart it's like not
that complicated what they did the LED
panels on either side of a catwalk
change with every models of my
understanding of it and so those act as
the triggers for the AR experience in
the phone and I think they work as
tracking markers too this is you know
this is not super difficult it's
difficult from a creative standpoint and
they did an awesome job with it but
technically you can do this now today
obviously it's happening but for years
we've been using motion design as a
markup layer for reality in sports and
news and the current state of the art is
pretty damn sophisticated you guys have
seen these arrays of cameras you know at
the stadiums this is why a lot of what
we're learning here what we've been
doing in this space is gonna apply to
augmented reality on emerging platforms
so with that in mind imagine this
scenario you're in a live game at your
luxury skybox because you're loaded and
you're watching the game through glass
but the glass is also a screen so you
getting real-time updates and the
players and the games as the game
progresses it's like having your own
private sports channel so augmented
reality has reached an inflection point
and it's like the fog is lifting and the
path forward through augmented reality
for the next you know five or ten years
is becoming clearer and clearer so you
couple that with fast widespread
adoption across a range of hardware
platforms and I think we could see a
gold rush of sorts from motion design
into this space ultimately they're all
gonna converge and what we call a great
reality and virtuality probably not
gonna make a whole lot of sense but in
the near term it's interesting to look
at the space for motion design
okay so I just threw a whole bunch of
stuff at you you've been getting a bunch
of stuff thrown at you for the last day
and also tomorrow so I want to give you
some advice that I've learned a lot the
hard way on my own and also working for
a lot of different companies about this
on this stuff when you're here you
should I hope you're feeling like this
because this is how I usually feel right
maybe the kids in it but then a couple
days later three days that you're gonna
go home and yeah you get a little
overwhelmed with the frame ride back
start to hit me a little depressed
oh poor Ben so I'm gonna give you some
advice this first four individuals
member businesses about what to do the
first one is the hardest one and it's
the most important one you got to be
honest and play to your strengths so
often we learn about a new thing and we
just go running after it as fast as we
can because learning new things is fun
every HelloWorld application that you
write in some new framework or new
animation you're making the new tool
feels great it's a dopamine hit but then
you know you realize you just chasing
new stuff all the time you're going
around in circles feels like you're
going up actually going down and it's
exhausting
so look being interested in something
isn't good enough it has to fit and your
existing network of skills and interest
which is why when I need to make big
change in my life I create something
called an intra skills map this is a
greatly simplified version usually
thought bigger and all that but it takes
me a couple hours to do this but so for
me so the size of the circle that's how
interested I am in it the color is my
skill level or confidence level in it so
green is high red is low and then the
proximity of the circles to each other
is how closely related
I feel those topics are to each other
this is a great way to get an
impressionistic sense of your
professional or creative landscape it
helps you see maybe your spread too thin
or maybe you're over invested in one
area and as you want to learn something
new you can plug it in so and if it
doesn't plug in very well if you're like
I want to learn I want to learn
artificial intelligence mm-hmm-hmm
it's you know if you're being honest
with yourself artificial intelligence is
off the screen over there by the guy
with the camera that's not something I
should probably be worried about right
now
so obviously when you're learning
anything new you guys know this because
you hear but you make a project with
that thing but you gotta make the
smallest project possible the problem is
that when you're learning you don't know
how much you don't know so as you start
the project it starts to get bigger and
bigger and you realize shit this isn't
small at all this is actually pretty big
which is why number three is really
important no smaller because when you
hit that wall and you will hit that wall
where you realize oh this is actually
bigger than I thought that's an
opportunity you should stop back up and
shrink your projects shrink it either by
breaking it into smaller parts but just
start over with a smaller go my there's
nothing wrong with starting over it
takes time and experience to understand
what small means so give yourself the
permission to do it now this is obvious
and I'm preaching to the choir but
always be learning more specifically
these days always be enrolled in
something there's so many classes I'm
taking a coding bootcamp class for three
months this summer I'm terrified I have
a wife and a kid I don't know what I'm
doing but it's important for me to
always be taking something you can
online this every amount of you know
hours and and you know energy that you
have you can find something there's
really no excuse but the big key is that
when you enroll in these classes go in
there and like enrolling to become a
student not a master right like enroll
knowing that you're not gonna come out
of there already like take over the
world enroll knowing that it's more
important to understand than it is to
command at first okay that that should
help you chill out a little bit I think
a lot of times people don't take on
classes cuz they feel like they have to
emerge like a ninja or something that's
ridiculous just get over that
okay so business stuff from the business
perspective awardee you do the number
one thing here I think to understand
because I've worked at a lot places it
didn't seem to have a very good grasp on
this is
bonus is inversely proportional to size
and what I mean by nimbleness is the
ability and the desire to change to
change as an organization
I mean without nimbleness every business
would die eventually right you have to
respond to the changing marketplace and
it's always changing so the bigger the
team the harder it is to stay nimble so
what's the obvious what do you do you
keep your team small so even big
organizations can create small teams
that act as change agents within their
organization and the key is you gotta
give them freedom you gotta let them
fail if possible detach them from the
normal chain of command of the
organization so they can be as
autonomous as possible now yeah you have
to give them budgets and deadlines are
constrained some of those are necessary
ingredients for innovation but you want
to make these teams feel sovereign you
want to make them have a sense of
identity it's really important so this
says understand when investing in change
means I've worked at so many places
alike we are investing in the future we
know whatever that means so let's break
down what it means because it's actually
it's harder to swallow that it might
sound so the first thing is what most
people get excited about is investing in
technology new toys everybody loves us
this is great if you really want to tap
the full potential of the technology
that you're investing in you're going to
need to invest in people right either
by training the people you have or by
hiring some new people so they can bring
their expertise to play and that means
that you also have to invest in failures
and this is a part that I don't hear
talked about enough you have to invest
knowing that you're going to lose money
basically at least in the short term the
upshot is that you will hopefully add
some new capabilities to your studio
some new offerings and then a side
benefit of that is that retention should
go up since creative people like us we
like to work at places that understand
change and how to invest in it all right
the last or the third one here play to
your strengths and focus this is kind of
a variation on the interest skills thing
for the individuals that actually works
well for organizations - you got to do a
little tweak though you get three or
three to five people or so at your
organization who've been there long
enough that they and
stand the organization put him in a room
give him a couple hours have them build
one of these maps for the organization
and listen to them as they build it you
should be able to figure out kind of
where your opportunities are and where
you can go it's just that when you're
done with that pick one direction to go
don't pick two or three things you want
to pursue as a company pick one because
if you pick one and it doesn't work out
you can say about how this is the wrong
direction it's not because you were
trying to go two places at once so look
we all of us are positioned really well
for the future in this room we're
curious we're smart I think and we're
creative so it's gonna be awesome
okay let's try to stay pumped with that
I'm out thank you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
