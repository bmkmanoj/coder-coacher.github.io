terms what exactly is an API well it
stands for application programming
interface but to be perfectly honest
that probably doesn't give you any more
information than you had before more
importantly it is code that lets two
software programs communicate with each
other that's the really key piece about
what an API is and that's what makes it
both powerful and useful so we like
api's because they give us flexibility
once you've got an API in place you've
got access to all those basic functions
reading your data updating your data etc
without the entire structure of what you
expect the workflow to be and so that
gives you flexibility to be able to do
different kinds of things it also gives
you more access obviously we think of
API is largely in terms of users being
able to access directly but you also can
use an API internally and make it not
even expose it to the outside world but
use it with two different pieces of code
on one server or on two different
servers that just talk to each other so
that you have better access to your own
systems and you can also use this for
future proofing if you once you've got
an API in place that gives you the
ability when suddenly a customer has a
need right now that we've got to do
something a little different you've got
an API in place that gives you that
flexibility again makes it easier to
implement new things without as much
complexity so to give you an example of
when an API might come in handy I have a
friend this is a real story massage
therapist who needed his schedule
information to be shareable without the
client information attached so basically
what times he had appointments without
the client names his scheduling software
while I did a lot of things it didn't do
this but it did have an API so we were
able to put together a small script that
can pull that schedule information via
that API strip out the client
information and then post that
appointment information up to a
shareable calendar the API in other
words made it possible for him to create
an otherwise non-existent feature from
the perspective of a user not a
developer
you also can use api's for non web
applications I'll just mention this
briefly we often think of Django as
being a web framework and that is its
primary purpose but that doesn't mean
that its power and flexibility is
limited to the web as an example I gave
a talk at a game conference about how
this could be used to create a game
back-end so that the front-end the user
experience the game play could all be
done without having to worry about the
shared state of the game for multiplayer
types of applications and you can see
that code up on my github here you also
can use api's for internal separation of
code within your own applications modern
applications are heavily reliant on
JavaScript to be highly interactive and
responsive and so that requires
JavaScript you can use an API to
separate your Django code from your
JavaScript code which results in having
cleaner code because you don't have that
all tangled together in spaghetti code
and it also makes it easier to use a lot
of JavaScript frameworks that are going
to often be built around building a
single page app which isn't quite the
way Django templates work so if you have
your code built with an API then you can
have that JavaScript framework built as
a single page app and it can retrieve
the data and context that it needs with
simple API requests and again this can
be on the same server so you're not
really dealing with any sort of latency
here all right so how do we do this
there are a lot of ways to build an API
there are a lot of packages available to
do it this talk is going to focus on
Django rest framework Django rest
framework sits nicely on top of existing
django code and has a very thorough
feature set
cactus group uses Django rest framework
all the time we like it enough we
actually even sponsor it let me show you
why so here's the anatomy of a Django
rest framework API at the bottom here
you've got your existing Django models
which you know Django takes care of your
database all that sort of thing
on top of that the next layer you've got
is your serializer this is a piece of
Django rest framework that is just going
to take your model
information and parse it into a format
in going in both directions that the
view set can work with view set is the
next layer here and that is what handles
okay am i creating a new instance am i
updating an instance do you just want a
list of the instances the view set
handles figuring out what information
needs to either come out of the database
or go into the database and control that
and then the last thing on top of that
is the router and that's what handles
the actual access via the URLs so where
do we put these things this is my
convention I like to have a file called
the salt within my application within my
app within my Django app I like to have
a file called serializers pi that has my
serializers in it i like to put my view
sets directly into views dot pi if you
want separation if you're still using
Django templates and you want separation
you could also put this into a file
called API dot pi it would work just
fine that way too and then the router is
going to go right into your URLs PI this
can be inside the app or it can be your
global URLs PI either way all right so
let's start at the bottom and talk about
the serializer so this is the serializer
this is it so we're gonna import
serializers from rest framework we're
gonna import our model from our models
file we're gonna create a serialize
earth it's just sub classing the Django
rest framework model serializer
give it a meta class tell it what the
model is and tell it what fields we want
included any field that's not listed
here the API is just going to ignore so
if you have private internal fields you
can leave them out of the serializer and
they won't be exposed now let's move up
a step in our ladder to the view set so
we're gonna import that view set we're
gonna import our model again and we're
going to import that serializer that we
just created then we're gonna again
subclass the model view set from Django
rest framework tell it what our query
set is in this case I'm just using all
of the objects
that I have for my model you could do
different view sets for different types
of you know different subsets of your
data if you wanted to have different
functionality but in this example we're
just going to use all of it and then you
tell it what serializer class that's
just going to be your serializer that
you created and finally let's put the
router on top and this is gonna nest
just right within your existing Django
URLs code I have a convention that I
like to import the views as a namespaced
things because if you start putting all
this especially if you put this in a
global URLs file but either way it makes
it much easier to read when you look
down here we're gonna define our router
router equals routers default router
that's just gonna initialize it using
the Django rest framework router
structure and then we're gonna do we're
gonna register our model with this a
router stouter dot register we're gonna
give it a namespace I'm just giving it
the name of the model in this case but
it can be anything and then you're gonna
tell it where the view set is jenkees
framework will take care of parsing the
different URLs and the different methods
that need to happen here and then we
just have to include our router not URLs
if you had other models other view sets
that you were importing you would just
need an extra register line for each of
those the rest of this would stay the
same way and at the very bottom here
I've got one other thing that's handy to
have on there is the API off which gives
you access to the Django rest framework
built in browsable api so you can click
around and see what the functionality of
your api is for learning the structure
alright so when we're accessing our api
api structure is typically done using
the crud acronym create read update and
delete and we're gonna use specific HTTP
methods so that Django rest framework
knows what we're trying to accomplish so
and are trying to create an instance
we're gonna do a post when we're trying
to read either get a list or get a
detail view we're gonna use a git
for update we're gonna use either a put
or a patch the big difference between
these is put is going to expect all of
the fields just as if you were doing a
post
whereas patch will just take whatever
fields you gave me I'm gonna assume
those are the ones that change and
everything else I'm just gonna leave the
way it was
and then finally delete uses the HTTP
delete method there are more HTTP
methods than this but these are all you
need to know about for this particular
functionality so just to give you a few
examples
I'm just reprinting our register line
from the urls depay here so you can
reference it the only thing that we
really need reference here is the my
model namespace that we gave it so this
is going to translate into if I do a get
HTTP request to my app comm slash my
model it's gonna give me a list of the
instances that's gonna be based on that
serializer if i do a post to that same
URL just app comm slash my model then
it's gonna create a new instance it's
gonna expect me to be passing the data
to create a new instance if I do a get
to my model slash an ID number then it's
gonna get me the details for the
instance that has that ID if I do a
delete to that same detail URL then it's
going to delete that instance these are
not this is not an exhaustive list of
the ways you can do it it's just a
sample to give you an idea of how this
works more detail can be found Django
rest framework documentation which I put
a link to here so what if you don't want
your users doing all this maybe you
don't want your users directly having
access to delete instances well there's
different options you can either put a
layer of authentication on top that
layer of authentication will use the
same authentication as your Django user
model so if you want to restrict access
you can restrict access and exactly the
same way you've already got it
restricted on your templates and so on
so whatever a user doesn't have access
to normally they won't have access to
through Django rest framework you also
can do just read-only view sets django
has built-in read-only view sets so if
you want to let people access and
termination but not update anything or
delete anything that's a one-line change
from what I've just showed you and you
can also restrict specific actions so
maybe the only thing you don't want
users doing is deleting you can just
restrict that specific action at the
view set level and all of this
information again Django rest framework
has fantastic documentation about how to
customize all these different things but
I'm just trying to give you an idea of
what the power of this is speaking of
documentation your API will need
documentation because nobody's gonna be
able to make use of it if they don't
have any documentation of it this is key
to usability even if you're only using
it internally your developers will thank
you if you have documentation but
there's a very specific structure that
we need here this isn't going to be
highly variable because this API is
going to be constructed the same way
over and over again you'll need to give
the URL and HTTP method what operation
is performed when you hit that URL with
that method what parameters it expects
to receive and what data format will be
returned
djenka rest framework will do this for
you too so you can just create a Doc's
URL in your URL spy and do include Doc's
URLs imported straight from Django rest
framework and it will create your API
documentation at that URL and you are
off and running I hope that you also are
sitting here thinking about how will I
test this because we all should be
testing our code and that also is easy
with this so automated tests give you
the ability to just set it and forget it
they get run when you run your regular
test suite and if something breaks for
some reason then that'll catch it test
failures can also highlight changes that
should be reflected in documentation if
you have done any custom documentation
so here's some sample tests in this case
I'm using the API test case that comes
with Django rest framework it is built
on the Django test case and is very very
similar you can also use the Django test
case directly if you don't want to try
to learn some
there's very little that's different
from between this and if you use the
Django test case directly so I have a
setup function here where I define my
URL I'm doing a reverse on my model -
list and that's given giving me that
base URL this is the namespace that
Django rest framework gives to it
just as if you had put a name equals in
a regular URL and then I'm just going to
create some instances for the purposes
of my testing so I'm just gonna run
through and create a couple of instances
and then I've got a test list of you
here so now I'm gonna go do itself that
client doc yet just like I would in
regular Django test case point at the
URL tell the format is JSON because this
is all jason and then I'm gonna do I'm
gonna start equal that the response
status code is a 200 because this is a
yet so I'm expecting I'm not creating
anything it should just give me a 200
back and then I'm gonna assert that the
length of response data is 3 and
response data is one of those little
things that you get with the rest
framework test case that you don't get
directly with the Django test case
that's just gonna pull out the data
section specifically from the response
so I can just make sure that there are
three objects in that response data you
can also check and make sure that the
data is looking like you would expect it
to look but I wanted to keep things
simple for purposes of this a couple
more samples testing creation is very
similar in this case I'm checking to
make sure I get a 201 because it will
have created an object again you can
also check to make sure that the
attributes are what you expect at this
point and then testing the detail view
I'm showing this primarily because I
want to show you how I would affect that
URL so I'm just grabbing any one of the
objects I created just grabbing the
first one that comes out of the database
at random and then creating my detail
detail URL by slapping that ID on to the
end of it
and then they can do the exact same
thing just do a self that client get at
what's now my detail URL and again make
sure that I get a 200 response all right
so that is it we have just built an
entire API on top of presumably some
Django application you already had so
your homework is to think about what gen
your projects do you have live what
Django projects do you have in
development that you could add an API
layer to do they have public information
that is a fantastic place for an API
because you'd be amazed what people can
pull out of public information they have
collections of user data those users
might want access to that data in
different ways think back to that
massage therapist example he wanted
access to the data in a way that the
original developers didn't anticipate if
you can't think of a use for your data
in an API format don't worry your users
will and this is going to give you a
competitive advantage because again
think back to that massage therapist
example if he was using a scheduling
software that didn't have an API but he
needed this functionality here's a
motivation for him to switch to one that
does have an API so you can have this
functionality that not many people need
but he needs it enough that he's willing
to pay for a custom software solution so
those little tiny edge cases that you
don't want to build out because only two
people are ever gonna use it somebody
might use it via an API they'll go to
the effort of building it and then you
have that kind of lock-in going on
because you've got that API that makes
that possible so at this point I will
take questions I've got some resources
here again as promised the slide link is
in the middle if you want to look that
up for reference later Django rest
framework documentation that example
