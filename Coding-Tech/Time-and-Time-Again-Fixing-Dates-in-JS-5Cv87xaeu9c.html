what are we talking about what are the
ideas that we that we sort of shape what
time is is it one big thing is a
collection of little tiny things and
there have been a lot of you know
philosophical debates and this is by no
means a settled question whatsoever and
it's a perennial sort of discussion and
philosophy circles about what is time
and in the background is a as a painting
by Salvador Dali named the persistence
of memory and one of the won't be
characteristics that people often
describe about this painting is the sort
of mutable aspect of time the subjective
nature of it and when we think about
time I don't know if we I don't know if
everyone thinks about it as being
subjective and that that seems it seems
like it could be a thorny topic so what
have philosophers in the past said so
you may recognize these two gentlemen
who are both dead one on the left is
Isaac Newton and the one on the right is
Emanuel camp Khan excuse me
and Newton said his sort of theory about
this was the time is really independent
of any individual person my perception
of time is the same as your perception
of time it's not the idea of three
seconds is an objective reality that we
can't disagree reasonable people cannot
disagree about what three seconds means
in a manual concept well no it's not
really true time is an impure it's not
an empirical idea time is like color so
you know it reflects the physical
reality but the it's a perceptual
reality like my idea of Green is
different than your idea of green it may
be different than somebody else's idea
of green and although that's based on a
physical representation of the
wavelengths of light doesn't mean that
our perceptions are the same then you
have JavaScript sort of entering the
picture about five hundred years later
with a very different idea of what time
is and a very specific representation of
what time means missus today's date and
roughly this time in JavaScript and you
know that's that's a really different
perception of what time is from these
two philosophers and you know and they
might be horrified to discover that
that's what we've reduced time to and
these represent really different
philosophies of seeing time so who's
right which of these approaches is the
correct one are they all correct or two
out of the three right are none of them
right and there's a different
perspective we haven't considered
so are we mapping the right thing or is
this another case of bad assumptions and
I think for this talk just for the sake
of proceeding onward so we don't all get
stuck in philosophical analysis
paralysis will say the time is what
separates events from one another so
just like space is what separates me
from Jamison or someone else in the
audience time is what separates this
sentence from the one that follows from
the one that follows after that and so
on in the same way if you were inviting
a friend to dinner you would you would
sort of give them four four coordinates
right you would say meet me at this
location that's three dimensions and
then meet me at this time which is a
fourth dimension right so you need all
four coordinates in order to have a
meeting right so so so think about that
the next time you're scheduling meetings
in your calendaring system you're
actually doing 4d math so so if we
develop it if we try to develop a domain
model of time to sort of explore this
idea to explore the representations it
might be possible and which ones are are
appropriate we first have to sort of go
back to basics go back to first
principles and probably and the word
that we use to describe a systematic
representation of time is called a
calendar and if we'd if we'd like to
have a systematic representation we need
to understand what goes into that
calendar and unfortunately the early
proto humans did not have Google so they
could not ask a question of how do I
invent a calendar and so what did they
do how did they arrive at a notion of
time and the passing of time well when
you look at early civilizations and
there
representations of time and calendars
specifically you see things you see
certain theme at ik elements occur over
and over again and one of the big thick
elements is that of cycles of of
something that starts and and resumes
again over and over and over again
without end and there's something I
think there's something to that the
cycle idea is interesting because it
means that if we can count the number of
times that something happens for example
a cycle then we can sort of measure the
passage of time by indicating the number
of cycles that have occurred of that
thing so from for an early human what
are some of the ways that they could
represent those things they might say
remember the last time they ate
something I mean count the number of
times they eaten right that might be one
thing or they could observe the number
of times they saw a particular bird and
then if they see that bird again that
will be another another chalk on the
cave wall we're making measures say
something a little bit longer like the
passing of seasons if they she believes
fall from a bunch of trees at the same
time maybe that's their conception of
autumn and so on and so longer periods
and so on but but the but the idea we're
trying to get to here is it's useful to
consider these cycles the the idea of an
event occurring over and over again
I mean incrementing sort of a counter
that represents a number of times in
that event has happened so when we do
that that's called a period so when you
have a period you have a an event and
then that event recurring at some point
in the future and the length of that
time is called a period so this is the
initial skeleton of our domain model we
don't have a lot of his toolbox right
now we just have periods so let's start
with that and see where we go so if I'm
a next iteration of our toolbox we want
to start taking advantage of the world
around us so we live on a planet and
that planet rotates and because it
rotates that means that the side of the
planet that faces the Sun is different
at different times and because it
rotates in a relatively consistent way
that means that we can track the number
of cycles the number of cycles equal to
a
a the Sun going down and then coming up
again that's one period we call that a
day so that's the solar cycle the Sun
going behind the horizon and then back
up again and then reappearing from the
other side a day later now it doesn't
work if you're at certain latitudes like
Norway would be one of them yeah for
parts of Norway anyway so no this is
this is already subjective it's already
dependent on where you are in the world
but this is this is probably the best
early humans could do the next sort of
thing we can take advantage of is the
fact that as we're on this planet we may
notice that there's sort of this round
object in the sky that changes shape
over time and that round object is the
moon and because the moon is locked in
tidal concert with the earth meaning
that the same side of the moon
physically faces the earth all the time
it's just that the the side that's lit
is different which is why you get
different phases of the moon but these
the physical side that faces the earth
is the same so if you take a picture of
the moon no matter from Earth no matter
what where you are on earth or where you
take that picture from you'll be getting
more or less the same side of the Moon
facing you and one cycle it takes the
moon about a month of our of our current
calendar to go around the to go around
the earth so we call that illumination
so a tool box is getting a little bit
more sophisticated now we have the idea
of a day and a lunation but you know if
we can survive for longer periods of
time we will be able to see that over
longer and longer periods of time we
don't just have days we notice that the
Sun goes to a different point in the sky
each day to the highest the Sun gets in
the sky from the same location on earth
it's different at different points in
the years but after a certain amount of
time which we'll call a year the Sun
goes back to the same point in the sky
that it was a year ago
that's one year so if I if today is June
2nd and I look at the highest point in
the sky from this location where the Sun
is and I come back a year from now the
Sun should still be roughly at that
point in the sky but I come back a week
from now the Sun will be at a different
point in the sky at its highest point so
our toolbox is getting more
sophisticated we have some ideas of
periods that we can use to
drawn to make our calendar and so our
idea of what of what the kind of things
we can measure with time is getting more
sophisticated now at this point we we
can count days we can count new nations
we can count years and so on but it's
it's subjective in the sense that this
is objective it's hard to disagree about
the number of times that something has
occurred once we've agreed on what that
definition of a day is so if we agree on
what a day is we can simply count
well we've seen seven days eight days
nine days and so on but what we might
disagree about is well what is that
point in the middle of the day that we
don't yet have a Division four so we
don't know how to divide the day off
anymore finally than than a day so if we
if that's true if we want to like
indicate that point to each other you
know you might say something like well
that's day one eighty two point two five
day one eighty two and a quarter well
it's not very helpful because that's
that's pretty you know it's pretty
subjective in terms of what that means
and how we talk about that to each other
might be different so modern modern time
folks like us might describe that as
being six o'clock in the morning but
someone who is an ancient Sumerian might
have called that the fifth night hour
they divided the day up into ten periods
of night and ten periods of day but the
difference was or the the length of each
such period was different because the
nights were different lengths in the
days so they divided they had different
divisions for different times a day so
this is you know until we can agree on
each specific subdivision we're not
gonna be able to agree on what time it
actually is so our toolbox needs to get
a little bit more sophisticated and
specifically we have to think about what
it means to have a calendar so a
calendar when you get down to it
in the modern reckoning anyway it's a
mapping it's a function that takes a day
number and returns a date so for example
in the Gregorian calendar which is the
one we're all used to the day is a
number of accounts up from a specific
date which is January first 4713 BBC
and then every day since then has been
an increment of one since day one so
today happens to be day two million four
hundred fifty six thousand nine hundred
and seventy three and we write that
detour
most of us write that deed as June 2nd
2017 in the Common Era but this is
arbitrary right you can have any
function that maps any day integer to
any date string so if you were in the
Game of Thrones universe you might have
a totally different representation of
that instead of being June 2nd it might
be you know the the fifth moon the past
the and a specific solar cycle or
something
so fictional universe is or other
representations of time on earth might
agree about the day but disagree about
the date so the data is the string that
represents the way of describing the day
to other people so we can make our we
can add this to our toolbox now this
idea of a function it takes a day and
returns a date but you can see that
already we're getting really like we're
getting kind of fuzzy at this point
these Sufis on the left is more object
if everybody can kind of agree on what a
day is or what illumination is or what a
year is not everybody agrees that the
Gregorian calendar is the best way to
represent the best way to represent
things why are there 12 months why
aren't there 17 months or three or two
or nine right why are there thirty days
and some months and twenty-eight and
others and but sometimes twenty-nine and
so on so so there's a lot more
subjectivity around the selection of the
calendar I mean even worse there's
there's a lot of subjectivity around
like what time it actually is so I'm
gonna invite everyone to just breach
conference etiquette for a second and
pull out your cell phone or look at your
watch and on the count of three I'm
going to ask you to just yell at maximum
volume what time you currently think it
is so one two three
all right okay cool so I heard some
people say the hour and the minute I
heard I think I heard a couple people
say the am part I don't think I heard
anybody say seconds but it was hard to
see 500 people but you can see that like
just the question of what time is it we
disagree about what how much detail I
need to provide you to answer that
question so you know you can say well
it's 6:00 you know 6:30 at some moment
in time but you could also get really
really specific about how if I asked you
what time it is do I need to know what
millisecond it is probably not if we're
talking but maybe if we're talking about
calibrating a like atomic clock or a
telescope or something like that and and
this gives rise to another idea of
moments which is if you imagine these
the spectrum of time all possible times
it could exist and we focus on say 6:30
a.m. this morning and and I say it's
6:30 what does that mean well that
doesn't mean a point like people say
it's 6:30 I think people think of like
it's a point like this moment is 6:30
but actually 6:30 the statement it's
6:30 is true for a range of values not a
point in time all of the times in
between 6:30 and 6:30 one it's correct
to say that it's 6:30 and depending on
who you are it might even be correct to
say that it's 6:30 when it's 6:30 3 or 6
27 especially if you're frequently late
to things like I am so and it's not it's
not helpful necessarily to get more
specific if we if we use seconds here
all we're doing is narrowing the
interval that we're talking about we're
not reducing it to a point we're just
shrinking the width of the interval so
we have a problem which is that moments
or our sort of canonical description of
time is ambiguous it doesn't it's not
just that it's an interval it's also
that that interval is ambiguous because
the statement it's 6:30
does not contain enough information all
by itself to resolve to a specific
moment in time so for example it's 6:30
could refer to 6:30 a.m. today or 6:30
p.m. to
not if you're on the 24-hour clock but
for those of us who aren't on a 24-hour
clock it might be true and it doesn't it
doesn't then help just to say it's 6:30
because we have to identify all the
pieces that are ambiguous about that
statement and resolve that ambiguity and
so the moments denoted by the statement
6:30 are there's more than one of them
per day and again it doesn't help to be
if we look at multiple days we see that
pattern recurring over and over and it
doesn't help if we get more specific if
we go from 6:30 and then provide the
seconds all we're doing is shrinking the
interval not D and B we're not providing
a disambiguation on the statement now
the reason that I don't like blow up
when people tell me it's 6:30 like what
are you talking about I have no idea
what time it is you need to be like
super specific or else I won't be able
to function as a human being the reason
that works is because I'm not a computer
and I can take facts about the context
we're talking about and incorporate them
into our shared understanding of time
the computers can't do that they need
specificity not just granularity about
the time so it's not sufficient to say
it's 4 o'clock you say it's work o'clock
p.m. on a Thursday May 14 2015 in the
Gregorian calendar and so on right so if
we take that statement let me say okay
well this certainly seems specific
enough surely this will be enough for
JavaScript you would be sadly mistaken
because if you if you give the computer
this information if you ask JavaScript
hey give me a date that represents that
time I just told you about you get this
extra bit that we never specified what
is this what's this part that's hanging
off the end here it says GMT negative oh
for 100 parentheses EDT like I didn't
say anything about that that's not part
of my time system and and more confusing
leek and other things go there like they
didn't specify that who gets to decide
what that thing is and if that's part of
our shared temporal representation then
do we have a problem because we're not
speaking the same language so it seems
like there's a really big missing part
of this time domain model and what is
that how do we get unique
representations of time so there's no
ambiguity about what we're talking about
when we say that it's 6:30 so to get
unique times we have to resolve a few
problems with our domain model
first humans generally want times to
correspond to the solar day
meaning that in a.m. we want times to be
like when the Sun is up so if I say that
it's 10:00 a.m. I want the Sun to be out
I don't want I don't want it to be dark
so I want to pick I want to pick a
representation of time such that morning
times are in the morning and evening
times are in the evening well that
that's really difficult because we live
on a round planet despite what a certain
segment of YouTube might tell you the
and and that that planet means because
it's round it's spherical not everybody
is going to experience morning at the
same moment in time so it's impossible
to have it it's already impossible to
have a time system in which we both
agree that it's 6:30 a.m.
but it's morning for one person on one
side of the earth and morning for
another person on the other side of the
earth that's impossible you can't have
can't have it both ways so the gentleman
that resolved this was a guy named
Charles Dowd who is a seminary teacher
and he proposed the idea of time zones
to a bunch of US railway operators and
we liked the idea so much that this was
legally adopted and the United States in
1883 said he was frustrated because he
would you know take the train from one
state to another and go hundreds of
miles and he'd have to like constantly
be readjusting his clock to synchronize
with the station's local idea of what
time it was so you could you could drive
20 miles and have a totally different
idea of what time it was because
everything was set from the local clock
and not from any shared understanding of
time so he said well that's stupid
everybody should just have a shared
understanding of what time is it should
be a common offset so that everybody who
wants it to be morning at a given time
they can just we can all just agree on
some universal time and then offset by
that time so that we wind up in a.m. or
p.m. so for example I live in
Charlottesville Virginia and I have a
friend who lives in Maryland New South
Wales in Australia and when I say hey
when I say hey call me when it's 9:00
a.m. for you he's gonna call me when
it's the morning for him and if he says
call me when it's 9:00 a.m. for you
I'll be calling him in my morning but
those are two different times we just
have local understandings of what 9 a.m.
means at our specific time and that's
achievable because we all have a
reference time which is called UTC and
then we offset by a given number of
hours from UTC to arrive at a consistent
local time all right that seems like it
resolves one of the problems but here's
another problem what if we're not using
the same calendar what if I'm in
Charlottesville Virginia and the US
using the gorian calendar but my friend
in Beijing is using the Han civil
calendar which is a totally different
system the totally different idea of
months and dates and so on or what if
you're using a religious calendar your
there are many many different religions
with many many different calendars that
celebrate specific feast days and so on
so very very complicated to resolve that
so the only way to resolve that is we
also all just have to agree for the sake
of trade or commerce or shared
understanding to use the same calendar
but we're gonna have to remember when we
switched calendars to that same shared
calendar otherwise we'll otherwise we'll
all get our previous dates wrong from
before the switch so in 1582 everybody
in Europe pretty much switched to the
Gregorian calendar from the Julian
calendar but if you ask now hey what
happened on August our October 5th 1582
in the Gregorian calendar or in the in
the Gregorian calendar there is no
October 1582 that will cause a error
when you try to resolve that in a
specific time and a specific time
library here's another problem our idea
of what offset it should be changes over
the course of the year maybe you've
heard of something called daylight
savings time which is terrible so we
have different ideas of what it means to
have a specific offset over time so in
charlottesville we have UCC -5 in the
winter UTC minus 4 in the summer my
friend in Maryland New South Wales has
UTC plus 10 and UTC plus 11 but winter
and summer actually mean different
things in Australia event in than in the
US and we may disagree about when we're
going to set our offsets differently so
in Maryland New South Wales they jump
forward and back in October and April
but in charlotte's where we do it in
November and March and in the past even
worse we changed our minds about when
that's
to happen right so in charlottesville it
was true that it was the first Sunday in
November and the second Sunday in March
except through 1917 1942 to 1944
specific windows in 1947 and 1848 etc
etc Maryland New South Wales same thing
with a completely different set of times
and you know even more confusingly some
of the times that you might want to talk
about don't actually exist in my local
time zone so if I say 2:30 a.m. US
Pacific time Sunday March 9th 2014 seems
like a perfectly normal reasonable time
if you ask a you ask a library please
get me the Pacific time zone and then
say please convert that date to a time
it doesn't exist there is no UTC time
that maps to that time and that's
because that occurs in a daylight
savings jump so you go from 2 a.m. to 3
a.m. on that on that morning there is no
intermediate time of 2:30 a.m. so that's
not a valid time then conversely you
have the opposite problem when you go
backwards in time for daylight savings
right if you go from as soon as the
clock ticks over to 2 a.m. the first
time on a fallback daylight savings time
day then you are experiencing all the
times from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. once you go
back an hour and you experience all of
them again in local time so that means
that when you ask computer hey what time
is it for about local time it can't give
you an answer because there's more than
one possible answers you have to tell it
how to resolve that ambiguity somehow
there's more than one reference sign
that maps to that time so clearly
there's something missing in our domain
model we have to introduce a few more
pieces the first is we have to introduce
the idea of a reference time the Charles
doubt idea we're all going to agree on a
common clock second is we have to have
some idea of local time and then an
offset between reference time and local
time that will maintain so that it's
always morning for us and then we have
to remember how those offsets came to be
and what they were so just like a
calendar is a mapping of days to date
strings a time zone is a mapping of a
reference point in time somewhere in
that spectrum to a offset that should
occur from the reference time so at this
moment in time I can tell you what the
offset should be from UTC for any
particular place on earth and that's
because we all have time zones and again
because the time zones change over time
I like to remember where what they were
at different points in time that sounds
complicated let's make it data base
fortunately someone has already done
this for us a wonderful organization
called the internet assigned numbers
Authority maintain something called the
TZ database a time zone database of
every single time zone that anyone has
ever come up with and you need one time
zone for every list of historical
offsets you might have had that so every
country whatever decided what time it
was at a specific moment in time that's
got to be recorded somewhere where else
you won't have a correct representation
of time for that specific country or
city or whatever and and the TZ data
looks like this it's got all these rules
and timezone things and you can see
things like if you look at a specific
rule that tells you what what window of
time this rule is active for and when it
happens and what the offset should be
and here's when America switched to
Charles Doubt's system that LMT means
local mean time that's the setting your
clock by the the railway station I mean
they said well after November 18 1883
we're not using local mean time anymore
that was stupid and then the rest is
regular time zones now because time
zones are permanent that means that
every every single time that someone
changed their mind about what time it
should be that was another distinct time
zone so as you can probably imagine
there are a lot of time zones there
aren't like 24
so just in one state in the u.s. there
are 23 time zones representing different
cities ideas of what time it was at
historical offsets so Indiana has a lot
of trouble making up its mind so how do
we felt this well fortunately there are
libraries so JavaScript has moments yes
Java has joda-time
donna has a port called no 2 time ruby
has something called active support it's
not very grid in terms of representing
times Python has pi TZ and arrow which
are a little bit better but the point is
we need something to kind of represent
this timezone aspect so we need
something there and that's usually it's
easy data and it's a library that's
interacting with TZ data to get you the
right rules and
process everything correctly so if we
want to work the times in our
programming language it's really
important to think about intention and
how we represent that so if I say to you
hey wake me up at 6 a.m. tomorrow or if
I say to you this call this meeting that
we're having is on the 29th of every
month or I want to go to the gym three
times a week so think about the first
one if I say wake me up at 6 a.m. I'm
from Charlottesville Virginia I just
flew to Norway do you think I want to be
woken up at 6 a.m. Charlottesville time
for 6 a.m. passe l'eau time right so if
I want to make Webb rebels I want 6 a.m.
local time
Oslo time but if but if I set my clock
when I was over in the US my calendaring
system said yeah sure I'll convert that
to universal time for you and store that
well I wasn't what I wanted I wanted the
local time I happen to be in when the
alarm goes off well if I say this calls
I'ma 29th of every month you think that
means that the meeting is cancelled in
February is where it's not a leap year
or if I say that I want it to be I want
to go to the gym and three times a week
should that be three precisely equally
spaced moments in time so if I divide
the week into a five seven days in the
week do I take two point six days apart
is when I'm gonna go to the gym so I'm
going to the gym at 4:30 a.m. and one
day and 6:00 6:15 p.m. on the next day
the problem is the date math doesn't
express intention so we're missing the
last piece of our domain model and to
resolve that we need something called a
duration and the duration is a precise
objective representation of time sorry
it's a precise precise objective
representation of time season so if I
say if I say one month and I mean 30
days and I mean 30 days with 24 hours in
them and each hour has 60 minutes and
each minute has 60 seconds and I can
tell you that one month is precisely two
million five hundred ninety-two thousand
seconds now if I say a period though and
I mean one month that could mean lots of
different things if I say one month that
could mean one month one calendar month
like January is the same as February
that could mean 30 days that's like the
average or the median of the length of a
month it could be in 28 days if I'm
talking about February could mean four
weeks if I mean the number of full
calendar weeks in a given month could be
in five weeks if I mean the number of
full calendar weeks in which at least
one starts on Sunday could mean six
weeks if I mean a calendar month in
which any day starts on any part of the
week right so it was a subjectivity
associated with periods
that's not associated with durations and
that's really important for working with
libraries the moment you ask for example
if I say hey let's talk about January
30th 2014 all right so I've got that
date I mean I say I want to go two
months in the future from January 30th
2014
well I get March 28th 2014 why'd that
happen even more weirdly if I start from
January 30th again I mean I say add two
months or not at one month twice but add
two months once I get a different answer
I get March 30th not March 28th so these
operations were not associated how did
that happen what happened because when
you added the first month you went from
January 30th February 28th then you add
another month and you went from February
28th to March 30 or March 20 versus
going from January 30th to March 30th in
one step subjective subjective period
versus objective duration so we have to
match our usage of time libraries to our
intentions here's another example if I
say October 1st October 2nd and October
are sorry November 1st November 2nd
November 3rd I'm already tripping up
over JavaScript's use of months being
indexed by 0 instead of by 1 so that 10
represents November and not October
right because you start from 0 so 0 is
January 1 is February etc anyway so if I
have November 1st November 2nd November
3rd 2014
remember 2nd 2014 happened to be a DST
transition and if I say what's the
difference in second or in milliseconds
in this case between those two dates I
get well it's 90 million milliseconds or
90,000 seconds between November 3rd and
November 2nd but it's 86,400 seconds
between November 2nd of November 1st so
it seems like we have a disagreement
about what one
days and that's because we used periods
instead iteration if we instead say well
no I want to I want to know about days I
want to know about I I want to use that
as these specific representations so I
said okay well then November 3rd is one
day after November 2nd and November 2nd
is one day after November 1st so if we
want to talk about days which is a
period and not a duration then we can
get the answer we might expect a
consistent notation of days the last
thing I want to say is we need to be
really careful about the assumptions or
libraries making here's it's the same
situation November 1st November 2nd
remember 3rd well on the first day we
have November 1st at 1 o'clock in the
morning
2nd day we have just before that at
12:59 a.m. and then the third day we
have 1259 a.m. again
so if we say periods yeah we get one day
there one day a part that makes sense
but if we but if we so if you say what's
the difference between November 3rd and
November 2nd we get one day but if you
say what's the difference between
November 3rd and November 1st we also
get one day well I thought what we
wanted we wanted to an answer like 2
days that November 3rd is two days after
November 1st and that's because we used
periods instead of duration and in in
moments they asked the assumption is
said if you don't have a full window of
that period we have a little bit less
than one day between November 2nd of
November 1st
it won't round that up to being a 2nd
day so our library made an assumption
that maybe wasn't what we wanted to be
true might be useful in other situations
but it wasn't in this one so that
represents our whole domain model we
have a full representation of time and
at this point we can sort of go forth
into the world I you know Isaac Newton
and Immanuel Kant would be proud of us
so so would our JavaScript forebears
because we sort of reconcile this idea
of it while time is subjective it's also
object --iv and yeah you can represent
times in JavaScript with new date
parentheses a bunch of parameters
they aren't they're just different
slices of the same idea of time of a
human representation of what that idea
is and so time is complicated it's
multifaceted because we're complicated
and multifaceted we have really
different ideas about how calendars
should be written and
how time should be tracked and because
we have to keep track of that complexity
somewhere well it round up in software
right but if you find yourself
interacting with these systems or
designing them or using a time library
you should probably not reinvent the
wheel we should probably take advantage
of the domain models it already exists
don't add two dates together by yourself
use a library to do that use something
that has canonicalized the idea of that
domain model into a library so that we
have a shared understanding of time
versus fragmenting it further and and so
if you're going if you're going to
interact with if you're going to
interact with time hat be consistent for
the sake of your fellow humans because
nobody wants more sad kittens thanks
very much and have a wonderful
