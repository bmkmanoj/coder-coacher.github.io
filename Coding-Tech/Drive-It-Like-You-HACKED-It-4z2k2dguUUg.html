and this is drive it like you hacked it
this is a basically a fun talk I've been
continuously working on improving as I'm
doing research in a couple of different
areas a couple really fun areas for me
have been vehicles vehicles radio
hardware and we're gonna focus a little
bit on some of that stuff which is
really fun to me we'll cover some web
stuff as well and try to bring it all
together in a fun way
so we all love Nicolas Cage right yeah
okay I love Nicolas Cage so I saw gone
in 60 seconds it's like one of my
favorite movies so I've spent my entire
life trying to be like him so as gone in
60 seconds happens you know basically
Nic Cage is going around stealing cars I
open to spoil that for anyone but to do
that the first thing you need to do is
you need to get into a garage which has
like some really cool cars so in the
last year I've been looking at how can I
break into garages like how do garages
work and garages are pretty cool we all
have sort of we've all seen the clicker
right little garage clicker all right I
have one here so I started learning
about how these things worked and my
goal was to break into my own garage I
like a I'm in a condo unit so there's a
bunch of different cars down there and I
wanted to see how this thing works
so I started learning a little bit out
radio frequency and how radios and
communicating with devices like garage
door openers it works so the first thing
we're gonna basically go in-depth here
and I'm gonna show you how how this
stuff works will actually do some live
demonstrations the first thing you do
when learning about something with radio
is there's something really cool any
device in the US that transmits that
actually transmits radio frequency has
to have an FCC ID so if you actually
pull out your phone all of our phones
actually will have an FCC ID on the back
here so like on my iPhone I I see an FCC
ID so same thing with this garage door
opener which opens my garage so what we
can do is we can actually take one of
these things and open up our garage and
if we look at the FCC ID the cool thing
about the FCC is what they do is they
regulate
transmission in the US so if you want to
transmit on Rea your frequency the FCC
has to allow that device or manufacturer
to do it and what we can do is all of
the information about that ID is
actually public information so you can
actually go to the FCC's website which
is really really hard to use and search
for one of these IDs fortunately someone
named Dominic spill has created a
website called FCC IO which I use all
the time and basically on FCC IO you can
just type in the identifier back on
either this garage door opener or your
garage door itself or your phone so if
you actually pull out your phone and you
can look up the FCC ID and you can learn
all about what your phone transmits on
it's actually very cool and inside of
there we'll see a few things so the
first thing we see is often you'll see
pictures of the actual device both the
outside on the left here and the inside
so you'll actually see inside of that
circuit this is really cool if you're
trying to look up information on say a
device that you don't necessarily have
access to or a device that might be out
of your price range or a device that's
not released yet right something that's
coming out you can actually go here and
you can learn a ton of information you
could probably produce you know vulner
you can probably discover
vulnerabilities or issues with the
device before it even comes out it's
pretty incredible so here's an example
of actually my garage door or door
opener I looked it up and the first
thing we see here is we see kind of like
where it came from it came from China
obviously and you also see the range
here the frequency range so this is the
frequency that it communicates on and on
this one it says the lower frequency is
390 megahertz and the upper is 390
megahertz so that means this
communicates on one one frequency 390
megahertz which is pretty cool so what
else we see on the FCC we see stuff like
they have a cover letter always a nice
little formal letter they write external
photos like we saw internal photos a
couple different things one of the more
interesting areas is the the test report
so what the FCC does is they hire
someone to come out and actually test
your device because the thing with the
with frequencies is were essentially
sharing the spectrum like you don't want
a device to just constantly transmit out
prevent other devices from working for
example if I just held this garage door
thing if this were just transmitting all
the time it may prevent other garage
door openers from working and you
wouldn't want to interfere with say
someone across the street so they do all
these tests to ensure that it transmits
on the frequencies that's allowed to not
more powerful than it should so on and
so forth so if we pulled this up we can
see like the internal report we can
actually often see a spectrograph of
actual recording of that of the radio
signal transmitted by the device and
there are some different devices I use
to actually listen to this kind of stuff
one of the devices is really cool it's
hack RF it's capable of receiving an
Trin's transmitting from one megahertz
all the way up to sixth gear it's really
wide range totally open source open
hardware a couple hundred dollars it can
also transmit which is really
interesting people have done some really
crazy stuff with this thing
for example spoofing GPS I mean people
have literally spooked GPS using this
device or similar devices and have made
ships go off course ships literally
going off course because what are they
depending on they're depending on GPS
how's the GPS works
it's from radio signals getting sent
from satellites down to the earth and
we're using that to like figure out
where we are and someone comes along and
transmits a signal and you think you're
somewhere else or you think you're just
going somewhere else I mean the the
amount of dependency that we have on
these radio signals is massive and it's
growing every single day so this is
another reason that this is like such an
interesting thing and and I'm so
interested in this right now
and now hacker fu may say okay well I
don't know anything about radio and I
know very little about radio personally
but you can do some pretty simple things
for example if you're dealing with
something that uses a fixed transmission
something that where it's like a
password so if you open your garage door
opener a lot of our garage door openers
basically have a bunch of dip switches
which is essentially a password and that
opens your garage now if you don't know
someone's like if I were trying to
exploit someone's garage and trying to
break in what I might do is I might
record that signal and replay it and
hacker F can do that now not all devices
are capable of recording and replaying
often you need to know a lot more
information
about the signal which we'll learn in a
bit but with literally two commands you
can record and then replay kind of like
recording of you know taking a
microphone and a speaker and reproducing
some signal now this will work in some
scenarios not in all scenarios for
example cars will use something called
rolling codes we'll go over that later
where the passwords changing kind of
like google authenticator or 2fa right
you might get a two fa is essentially a
rolling code where every time you get a
new identifier or new password to log
into something another device I use is
RTL SDR this thing's awesome I have it
right here it's basically another
antenna it's a soft SDR means
software-defined radio RTL it's from
real Tech and software-defined radio is
all hack RF is also a software-defined
radio it allows you to use software and
inexpensive hardware to analyze the
radio spectrum and also often transmit
RTL SDR is great because it's like $20
on Amazon so you can go right now for 20
bucks get into it you know start
learning and you can do so much you can
see planes going overhead there was
actually someone in LA who did who has
been recording planes so it's public
transmission whenever a plane is flying
it's sending radio signal of where it is
of its GPS coordinates and information
about it see unique name and he's
started mapping it out as a hobby and he
found that there's these planes that are
just circling over LA there's going in
circles right they liftoff they fly
around and then they circle why are
their planes circling over LA and he
started look what's that correct FBI
planes he's the guy who discovered that
these are FBI planes going around
probably using something like stingray
to listen to our phone calls and text
messages so always say hi FBI when you
pick up the phone so rtl-sdr is another
really cool example he did that with
rtl-sdr it's a $20 device you can use
free software open-source software on
your computer no matter you know in any
major operating system good new radio
this is like a this is a fun although
complicated piece of software that it's
probably not complicated it's just
really hard for me to learn so I'm still
trying to figure out how to use this
thing but it allows you to take radio
signals are actually any signal
technically you can just pipe audio into
it and you can manipulate it you can run
different filters on it and extract
information or transmit information so
this is another really useful tool gqr X
this is an awesome tool we'll actually
use this in a minute I'll show you how
it works
basically this allows us to see a
waterfall view of their spectrum of the
radio spectrum so we can say alright I
want to see from 300 to 301 megahertz
I want to see everything that happens on
there this would allow you to make let's
say you have a device and you don't have
the FCC ID or let's say you don't have
access to a device let's say you're
outside of something and you have a
black box or you know someone's driving
up to later garage and they're about to
hit a button but you don't know what
frequency their device is using you can
use this to essentially watch watch a
waterfall of radio frequencies and you
will see when there is something with a
high amplitude when there is essentially
a signal that's getting transmitted it's
really cool this is for Linux and OS X
only if you're on Windows you can also
get SDR sharp it's another similar tool
to do the same thing very cool and the
cool thing is I mean there people out
there like on reddit there's a there's a
subreddit called rtl-sdr and you can
actually go on there and people are just
looking at the spectrum because there's
all these radio frequencies out there
and we have no idea what a lot of them
are right a lot of these you know this
is this is something that's invisible
right is essentially invisible to us and
usually when there's something invisible
like people just assume it's secure
because we can't see it we don't know
how it works and more and more people
are now playing in this area and
researching and trying to find what are
all these invisible signals and a lot of
it lacks security I mean it's really
interesting some of the stuff that's
coming out of here RTL FM this is like a
command-line tool that allows you to
record signals with the RTL SDR so these
are some of the tools that I use the
presentation will be available online so
if you guys want to grab it and do any
research in here you'll you'll have
access to all of that so let's go back
to this FCC report there are three
things I usually look at when I'm
looking at an SEC report for for a
device internal photos because that
allows me to see inside if I can see
inside I might be able to make out the
chip that's being used if I look at the
chip I
and probably look up data sheets
available for that chip and I can learn
all about what the chip is doing the
frequency it communicates on the
modulation all sorts of information
about it I can look at the test report
as well and the test report will will
often provide some useful information
such as what frequencies it uses perhaps
what modulation and then also the user
manual there's always like incredible
pieces of information in user manuals
that I find a friend of me a friend of
mine I was at Coachella and he's like
yeah I came back to my car and all my
windows were were down and I was like
was anything stolen he's like no luckily
I'm like well so it's like someone broke
into my car and didn't take anything I
was like that seems weird so I looked up
the FCC ID I was like maybe someone
hacked his device is like radio thing or
his car key and I looked at it looked it
up and I looked at the user manual and
it's just a section of how the car key
operates and everything about the car
key and apparently if you hold one of
the buttons down for enough seconds all
of your windows just rolled out I
haven't told them I'm gonna use against
them so so here's an example of a test
report from a from my garage door opener
you can we can see something called the
the frequency is 390 megahertz we see
the modulation type is a sk or a school
we'll go over that in a second here and
a couple other things about the device
so let's talk about modulation a little
bit
who here has listened to the radio okay
cool
younger people may not know what that is
it's like Spotify so we now have things
there there's different types of
modulation it's basically how we encode
data in a signal there's ask which is
amplitude shift keying
there's FSK frequency shift keying and
PSK phase shift keying these are common
modulation schemes that are used now
these are specifically for digital data
when you're trying to communicate
digital information over over the radio
spectrum now ask is actually a type of
amplitude modulation amplitude
modulation is am it's literally AM radio
when you listen your AM radio your radio
is taking the radio spectrum at whatever
frequency you're listening to say 200
kilohertz and it the amplitude which is
essentially
if you listen to let's say a sound file
right the amplitude is the volume it's
essentially how strong that volume is
the amplitude defines where what kind of
sound you're hearing or what frequency
the sound is that frequency shift keying
is frequency modulation or FM so FM
radio when you listen to 102.7 you're
actually listening to 102.7 megahertz
and we can use that we can see that an
rtl-sdr
and the frequency is actually not 102.7
it's actually a range so it's actually
more like 102.5 to 102.9 and the
frequency changes depending on where you
know what that sound what that frequency
should be so in something like rtl-sdr
we can also if we don't know what device
is transmitting we can look at it here
and on the Left we see that there's kind
of like two signals coming whenever I
hit a button so that's probably
something called two FS k or frequency
shift keying where the frequency is
changing and because it's digital it's
just ones or zeros so left or right
means one or zero and then on the right
we have ask which is amplitude shift
keying where it's just either there's a
signal or there's not a signal which
represents a one or a zero so why don't
we actually why don't we actually see
what this looks like I am going to open
G qrx
and I'm gonna use this rtl-sdr just so
we can take a quick look let's see if
this works here all right so awesome so
we can see here I'm at 300 megahertz
which is what this garage door opener is
at and whenever I press we can see data
so that's pretty cool like if if I
didn't know what frequency was that we
could like go searching through you know
we could go to let's say here we have we
have actual stations right so I'm at 100
megahertz now so we can actually see FM
radio stations and I could actually
demodulate this data I don't see if it
even works D mod
so we'd have to tune oh yeah so we can
actually tune to different stations here
that's my jam right there alright cool
cool so we actually know that this is at
300 megahertz now this is really cool we
can demodulate in this data right in
here so now that we know it's at again
we'll look at it once more here 300 Meg
yep three hundreds and because it looks
like it's just one signal going turning
on and off that tells me it's probably
amplitude shift keying or AM an
amplitude modulation so we can then use
RTL FM so let me quit that let's see
here find my windows alright so I mean
that's gonna be hard to see but here
I'll just record it first so I'll say
RTL 300 test dot wave I'll press this
once or twice great control C and what
this actually does is this produces an
audio file a wav file that we can then
inspect so I'm gonna pull this up in
audacity a free audio tool let me find
the file here and I will throw this in
here alright cool so this is audacity so
here we can see I click I hit it twice I
did it once here and then once here so
let's take a look at what this signal
actually looks like zoom in it looks
like it's a repeating signal it looks
like the same information
now who has open one of these garage
doors and had to like set the dip
switches you had to do that alright so
so we've seen those usually it's like 10
or 12 dip switches so let's zoom in can
you guess what these relate to so if I
open mine right here this thing is
impossible to open all right now got it
I'll uh I'll tell you what I have here I
have on and off dip switches mine is on
on off on let's just zoom in so we can
see if there's any correlation at all on
on off on off on off off off off so
basically we're seeing amplitude we're
actually seeing a sick
in this case it looks like a long signal
followed by nothing long is a one and a
short signal followed by nothing is a
zero so literally just by using this $20
device I've recorded and I now know the
code to my garage door you could go
around like recording code like just
like in gone in 60 seconds right they go
up to the garage they use their little
device which probably didn't exist and
they are able to record the code like
that's so interesting alright so let's
go back to I like I like where he's
going with that alright let's see if I
can figure out how to open I can't I'm
not marrying here show all windows
enhance alright back to the slideshow
okay cool so we just saw GQ rx and we
saw this right so we actually analyzed
that signal we saw it's just a repeating
signal it repeats a bunch of times
because amplitude shift keying like if
you've ever listened to am the audio
sucks audio quality sucks it's it's very
easy to it's the most inexpensive way to
transmit information but it's also the
most prone to interference people
sniffing you can really see if anything
though so someone had a good suggestion
what if we brute force that how long
would it take well if we take a look at
these different garage doors there's a
couple different things some are 8-bit
some are 10 bits 12 bits right there
just on and off so I recorded this one
and it looked like it was 2 milliseconds
per bit with a 2 millisecond delay for
each bit and it sent five signals per
transmission minimum so if we calculate
that for all the possible garage doors
that I've looked at that use fixed codes
it looks like it would take about twenty
nine twenty nine and a half minutes to
brute force
so basically 30 minutes to brute force
someone the garage which is pretty
insane so I was looking at this and I
was like well can I do this a little
faster because I have stuff to do I
can't just sit outside of people's homes
thirty minutes and do this and uh I was
looking and I saw okay well if it's
repeating the signal what if we stop
repeating the signal like it's repeating
just so that it can be more successful
but for the most most part we're not
going to have interference so if you
actually take out the repetition we can
actually reduce it to six minutes to
brute force any fixed code garage that's
pretty cool but looking at this further
I saw that there is basically this
massive period of wait of delay between
every time it sends a signal so it's
curious what if I took out that delay
where it's sending one signal followed
by like one password followed by another
password instead of a delay in between
them what if I just sent password
password password password and that
worked it opened my garage so that
reduced it down to three minutes to open
any fixed code garage and then I was
thinking how does it know where one
password begins in one password ends
what if it's using something called a
bit shift register now a bit shift
register is basically a register where
you you pull in data one bit at a time
and as it's essentially it performs a
test let's say it's a 4-bit register it
looks at the four bits and it performs a
test is this the correct for a bit if
not it then takes one bit off pops one
off and then shifts one in well if
that's the case you wouldn't actually
need to test all possible codes you
could actually just pop for example if I
used let's say let's say I'm looking at
this is a two bit code let's say we're
just looking at a two bit code right
here 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 those are the four
options that's a total of 8 bits however
if we create something called the de
bruit de Bruyne sequence de Bruyne is
mathematician who discovered this
algorithm to efficiently produce all
possible codes over that overlap so if
we overlap these we can say 0 0 1 1 0
now if we put them in bit chip register
we get 0 0 is the first 2 bits and if we
move over just one bit then we get 0 1
move over one bit we get 1 1 and then
the last one 0 so we've actually gotten
all 8 bits out of a 5 bit sequence now
if we do that with every 8 to 12 bit
code we actually reduce this down to 8
seconds to brute-force any fixed code
garage between 8 and 12 bits long 8
seconds yeah tv-b-gone
although all of the infrared codes that
are basically public information for all
the televisions tv-b-gone you could do
that but tv-b-gone specifically turns
off TVs so if you're a brute forcing
what you'd actually end up doing is like
changing the volume changing the import
source doing all this other stuff
tv-b-gone specifically has programmed
all of the IR codes for most of
different televisions but you could
definitely do something similar because
you will hit the off code at some point
right so at this point we have eight
seconds now this is just how to transmit
rtl-sdr does not actually transmit this
is just an assumption of how we can mess
with with this garage so
now I need a device to actually transmit
one device I'm a fan of is this
yardstick one also by Michael Osman this
has a nice radio tip for both receiving
and transmitting it's not
software-defined radio software-defined
radio allows you to take a very a signal
you know nothing about and then perform
all the modulation and demodulation and
accessing and reading it in software
this is all hardware there there's pros
and cons the the con the major con of
something like this is that if you don't
know what the signal is if you don't
know if it's frequency modulated or
amplitude modulated or the frequency
this is not gonna be too helpful because
you have to tell this to tell this
hardware I know it's FS k I know it's on
this frequency I know it's this data
rate and show me the data or transmit
the data but if you know what you're
looking for or you know what you want to
transmit you can use this device and you
there's a Python interface that you can
use by something called RF cat and
there's a another device that that I
like to use from this from one of the
most amazing technological companies of
our time
Mattel so Mattel creates all sorts of
awesome toys for children and one of
their devices one of their toys is
called the Mattel I am me this is a
texting device for tweens to basically
communicate with each other without
being on the internet we're creepy
creepy people hang out so with the IME
you can actually text someone and it
wirelessly transmits to a little dongle
on on a USB stick and then it goes over
the Internet to your friend who also has
one of those USB dongles and then
wirelessly transmits to the this little
device to the IME the service is no
longer active they don't sell these
anymore so you can get them off eBay for
like 1020 dollars and a couple of people
have found that inside of this device is
a really cool chipset from Texas
Instruments and it's a sub gigahertz
transceiver that means it can receive
and transmit on virtually any frequency
under one gigahertz which is actually
amazing if you're trying to build a
device like this yourself it might cost
hundreds of dollars thanks to Mattel and
massive production you can get it for
like ten bucks on eBay so Travis good
speed and some other people found out
that you can connect to
the back of this thing and reprogram it
and do whatever you want with that
transceiver so this is the device I
chose to use for transmitting across all
the different garage frequencies
performing this attack and this is a I
call this the Open Sesame attack let's
see if it Oh No
Oh No how do we get this to there should
be a video here
oh I'm sorry so that's an example of the
Open Sesame
just running on my friend's garage it
takes a total a max amount of eight
seconds which on average is four seconds
so awesome one one step down so I've
released almost everything to do this
obviously I don't want people breaking
into people's garages so I did not I
bricked the code so that it would not
work however I released most of it so
that people could understand how this
type of attack works and also how to how
to prevent it unfortunately since I did
that the prices have raised of the IME
so if you do want one reach out to me
I'd be happy to send you one if you're
gonna do some research in this area
because I bought them before they they
became kind of ridiculously priced so
some lessons here don't use a
ridiculously small key space just
because it's invisible right just
because it's over radio and people
aren't looking doesn't mean people
aren't going to look right at some point
people will look they will understand
the technology your proprietary you know
method is not going to help you so you
have the there's plenty of information
on this require a preamble or sync word
which is basically something that says
the passwords about to start that would
prevent the debryn attack where you can
actually have all of these passwords
sort of rolling over each other and then
rolling codes that's another thing we'll
talk about rolling codes will prevent
this type of attack so now we're inside
of the garage and there's some cool
stuff when you hear one thing that's
happening is all of our cars are
becoming connected so great so a lot of
new cars now have all sorts of different
radios inside besides the am/fm sirius
XM Radio's they have some other things
they often have gsm they'll have GPS
receivers and they'll communicate with
the Internet
who has OnStar OnStar yeah so okay a lot
of you have on certain aren't raising
your hand that's okay so actually any GM
vehicle GMC Buick Cadillac will actually
has OnStar built in now you know whether
you activate or nots irrelevant you
actually had these features and those
features are connected to the computer
of the car the ECU and the various other
our cars are no longer cars they're no
longer mechanical vehicles right
they're now essentially we a computer
with wheels so the computer controls so
much I mean we have so many awesome
features coming out in our vehicles like
assisted Park and all of these things if
there's something called assisted park
that means the vehicle the vehicles
computer has control of the wheel where
before it used to be simply mechanical
now it's a computer that's actually able
to turn your wheel so OnStar has a very
cool feature they have an iOS and
Android app so a friend of mine had
actually with the same car he had he had
OnStar and I was playing with this stuff
and he said you can play with my vehicle
if you want so I was playing with the
app I downloaded OnStar there's some
cool stuff lets you see where your car
is let's you do a couple things there's
a key fob access you can lock you can
unlock remote start hit the horns and
lights I tried that a few times while he
was driving but they they fortunately
they don't allow you to activate the
horn in lights while you're driving
which is smart so I thought okay I'll
I'll check out this communication I
assume it's encrypted with SSL so I'll
install my own CA you know my own
certificate authority on my phone and
I'll sniff the traffic you know lo and
behold it was encrypted i installed the
CA and or i usually have my own
certificate authority installed on my on
my mobile device and i started sniffing
and because I was using my own CA I
could actually perform as a cell man in
the middle attack again this is only I'm
on my own device I can't do this on
someone else's because they don't have
my certificate authority installed my
certificate authority tells my phone
that OH
Sammis you know house of cards CA is a
legitimate authority you can use his key
instead of the legitimate GM or OnStar
SSL key so once I decrypted the traffic
I saw you know nice HTTP requests in
plain text it's awesome base64 pulled
out the basics before and of course the
password and username are right there
like okay so make sure to not use you
know the OnStar app on a network that
you don't trust but as long as as long
as you don't have someone CA they
shouldn't be able to decrypt that
traffic and then I realized I had just
reset my iPhone I forgot like something
happened I reset it so I actually didn't
have my certificate authority installed
which means the app allowed an invalid
certificate authority to decrypt traffic
even though it had no recognition it had
no idea who Sammis house of cards was so
the GM app was not looking at an SSL CA
it was blindly it will take accept any
SSL key that means as long as you have
someone on your Wi-Fi network which is
very easy to do and they open that app
you can decrypt all of their traffic for
that app I thought wow like this is this
is absolutely insane this was like how
can i exploit this and I created a
device with a Raspberry Pi computer a
phone a GSM board Malory which is an
open-source SSL man-in-the-middle attack
software some DNS spoofing so that the
user wouldn't actually detect anything
so I only took over API GM comm so
anyone using OnStar but all their other
traffic would still continue to go
through the correct servers and correct
SSL Certificates and a couple other
things like a alpha wireless card and
then I thought okay how do i attack my
friend how do I get him to jump out to
my network now unfortunately you can do
things like you can use your own or you
can use common Wi-Fi network names like
ATT Wi-Fi or Starbucks things that you
know that they might be on but there's
actually something pretty cool here
another thing that our phones do is they
send out probe requests so if your phone
doesn't see your network it will
actually send out probe requests saying
hey I'm looking for a network in this
case named - dong is there a network
name - dong out here and you can say yes
it actually tells you the network name
it's looking for
and with that information you can
generate a network on the fly which it
will then join assuming that it's the
correct network it's actually our phones
our devices our computers or laptops
none of them actually look at the MAC
address they're only looking at the
network name now this is only for open
networks if your phone has only
connected to encrypted networks
fortunately this attack will not work
but I'm assuming almost everyone has at
least connected to one open unencrypted
network before ATT Wi-Fi on almost all
iPhones absolutely neck ear Linksys I
mean you can and the cool thing is you
can just launch all of them all right so
if you come near my house you may
actually just see like 10 different
network names for all the common ones so
with under $100 we have a little device
that I threw under my friend's car and
was able to you know at some point let's
see own star yes this this is an app
called own star now so here I am and and
once I acquired his credentials I was
then able to unlock his car remote start
it and basically do anything to his car
at that point and then I tested BMW
which also did not check SSL
Certificates and then I checked in
Mercedes Benz which did not check SSL
Certificates and then I tested Chrysler
Jeep which not test SSL Certificates
this is a massive issue in virtually
every I'd say this was like five out of
ten of the car apps that have the
ability to unlock a vehicle right I only
cared about the apps that actually did
something you know important five of ten
did not perform SSLC a validation so the
lessons here if you're gonna do this
either validate certificates from a CA
which actually I wouldn't necessarily
suggest anymore the nice thing about CA
is you can like turn off your keys if
they ever get stolen however there are a
lot of certificate authorities out there
for example with like I don't know you
wouldn't want the Hong Kong you know
post to be releasing CAS or releasing
keys for you but they have that full
capability they can say they own
gmail.com if they want and we've seen
we've seen CAS get hacked before or
accidental keys for Gmail com get
released
so better yet you certificate pinning
this way your the app that you release
has a key in it you have that key those
are the only people who know about this
key no one else can you know avoid that
also hash the passwords like don't just
basics before everything right hash your
passwords use the salt make it difficult
even if someone does obtain this
information who knows how someone will
break into your device sometime in the
future there will be new attacks that
will extract information in different
ways and always assume you're on a
hostile network just always assume that
so now we've broken into some cars we'll
go through this uh now there's another
interesting thing that I've seen a lot
of these vehicles use and a lot of the
key fobs they all use something called
rolling codes so rolling code is like we
talked about before with the CA the code
actually changes every time kind of like
2fa you get a different SMS message or
your Google Authenticator sends you a
different number every time and that's
great that's actually a really good way
to prevent an attack like they keep like
the garage-door attack right Open Sesame
where we have a fixed code also rolling
codes are much much longer they're not
like silly 12 bit codes that you can
break in a couple of seconds so that's a
that's a nice thing I'll quickly run
through some hardware attacks that if
you're ever looking at hardware that you
don't know some of the devices I was
looking at I was actually finding that
they would actually mark the chip off
they would actually scratch off the name
so they couldn't look up the datasheet
and see what it was using so in that
case what I use is I use a couple of
things they use the logic analyzer logic
analyzer just looks at looks at
information with the digital information
going on a wire so you can connect pins
to each of these pins
I use these SMD micro these micro probes
so I can connect like really small
really small pins off of chips I also
use a multimeter you can measure voltage
with a multimeter off different
different pins on a chip and when I'm
looking at the chip that I don't know
anything about I'll start mapping it out
I can use the multimeter to find the
ground and define power so I can mark
all the ground and power pins also I can
use the logic analyzer and I can look
for certain things that look like a
clock signal the clock signal will just
look like a square wave or pulse width
modulation once I do that if I know what
frequency
it's communicating on which I should be
able to learn with something like an
rtl-sdr or hack RF I can then download
all the data sheets I can find for
something that does that let's say it's
communicating on 2.4 gigahertz I will
download all the data sheets of
transceivers on 2.4 gigahertz and then
I'll take all their pin out pages and
I'll look at them and I'll compare do
any look similar to what I have do any
have the same number of pins do any have
the grounds in the same places the
voltage in the same place is the clock
in the same place and if so I've now
discovered what chip that that device is
being used despite them trying to you
know scratch it off using the logic
analyzer and data sheet I can see how
that chip is communicating with the
device what commands it's sending then
I'll learn all sorts of other
information like if there's encryption I
might learn a key I might learn you know
what's what it's using I can extract all
the serial communication how it
communicates with that device and I can
then build an interception device which
is pretty fun so at this point let's
take a look at my car my car uses
something called rolling codes now if
you look at this there's a ton more data
in this code so this would actually take
years and years and years to brute force
and it's only good once so as soon as
you use this code it will never work
again so when I hit the kick clicker on
my car to unlock that code is used and
my car knows that this code is no longer
valid which is great so let's understand
how rolling codes work there's basically
a random number generator in your car
and in your key and they're synched
there's actually like a rolling window
so when you press the unlock button your
car expects that unique identifier that
unique code but now that the car has
heard it it says I will never accept
that again so if someone was sitting out
Nicolas Cage was outside of your home
and he like sniffs this identifier and
he tries to use it later on to replay
it's not gonna work because the car says
oh I've seen that code before I will not
accept it I will only accept the next
code and there's a rolling window so in
case you know in case the keys in your
in your pocket and you hit it a bunch of
times out of range of the car
then you go back to the car the car will
say oh you're actually out of range but
it's ok you know you're all you're in
the future right you're not using a past
code you're just a little bit in the
future you probably hit the
next Emily a few times that's okay now
that's only a small window so it's it's
hard to use that to attack so trying to
find ways of replaying rolling codes of
attacking that the only you know the
major way I could think of was the only
way is to capture a signal while you're
out of range of the car so if you like
break into someone's house take their
car hit the button record it and then go
back later and then replay it now all of
most cars these days also use this for
starting the vehicle as well so these
attacks are actually not only for
unlocking vehicles but also starting now
this is a really lame attack I think if
you're in the house and you have access
to their key you should just take it so
how can we how can we get around this
what if we Jam what if we jammed the
code now again these keys are
inexpensive so they're I mean they'll
charge you like 300 dollars to buy one
but they're actually really cheap so
it's that it's actually very easy to
interfere with this communication so
when someone hits their button if you're
actually transmitting as well in fact if
you even have the same similar key and
you hold down the unlock or lock button
of your key while someone tries to
unlock their car they won't be able to
unlock their car you can actually do
this for kind of a wide range it's kind
of funny to watch oh but you can
basically easily interfere with this
communication so worst case scenario
they might have to like pull out their
key now who has hit their button of
their key and it didn't work once that
happens right and you just hit it again
and it typically works right there was
some interference you didn't hold it
long enough so what if I Jam just
slightly off just slightly off the
frequency and I also listen I also use a
similar device to listen I can actually
be very specific and listen to just that
signal and listen to their code and
ignore my jamming because I know where
I'm jamming I can ignore that piece of
the the signal the problem is once I've
recorded that signal that the car is not
heard I can use that signal I can use it
to unlock however they're gonna keep
hitting it until it works and when it
works when the car does hear their
unlock code all previous codes get
disabled so the code that I've acquired
is now no longer useful
however as we're human we all follow a
simple pattern if I Jam
I listen and I get one code and I keep
jamming so you go to your car you you
hit unlock it doesn't work you hit on
lock again it doesn't work two times in
a row but I've listened to both codes
and I've extracted those two passwords I
now take those two and I only replay the
first one so now the car doesn't lock on
the second time but I'm using the first
code so later on when you go home and
you lock your car
I still have an unused future code that
I can unlock your vehicle because
there's actually no timing right it's
all about just the order of the sequence
of these codes so you can essentially
trick the user by playing the first one
on their second time and of course you
can automate this so this is an attack I
call roll jam I've demonstrated with
about thirty dollars in hardware and
there's so many other attacks in this
area I mean such as I think it's such an
exciting area because you have cars
coming at this year in 2016
they'll actually communicate with other
vehicles on the road it's called v2v so
there's so much other radio
communication that's gonna be happening
no cars are able to use ultrasound to
see if there's something in front of
them but what if you send your own
ultrasound right but I mean you can
generate ultrasound it's just sound at a
higher frequency what if you send that
to a vehicle you can make it believe
that someone is in front of you you can
you can send communication a car saying
that oh it's it's really rainy so slow
down you just make everyone slow down
around you I mean you can do all sorts
of stuff
um it's crazy and it's scary and it's
exciting there's so many other
interesting attacks I was also looking
at my at my car and I found that if
they're locking the vehicles they're
hitting a lock lock lock and I record
that data or inners interfere with that
data well I can't use a lock to like
that's no good I can't what what fun is
locking their car however I found in the
signal as I was looking at the data
sheet I found that the rolling code is
one part and then the command is a
second part so I could change the
command from lock to unlock and use the
same code as long as I jammed and
interfere their lock command then I can
use that lock command to unlock so even
though I hit they hit lock later on I
come over I he sent I send an unlock
just by changing that bit because it's
just a command and not tied to the code
in any way
here's the the device itself I tested on
a lot of cars it unlocked a lot of cars
and it was beautiful lessons I mean in
you know encrypt hash those buttons
together so if if you're sending a lock
command for example and of course this
this works anywhere this will work on
HTTP like you should use these same
these same methods encrypt that encrypt
or hash that communication together
right hash the key hash the key with the
command use H max time based algorithms
there's actually something called I mean
we've had secure ID for twenty years now
right those RSA RSA tokens which are
essentially two FA fat those for 20
years and every 2015 car I've attacked
has had this issue we can implement this
stuff this stuff exists we know about
these we know about these problems and
we know how to solve them also you can
do challenge response right with
transceivers rather than just cheap
receivers so they're ways of fixing this
and you know that's that's about it
that's that's what I have for you thanks
so much for coming I hope you guys
enjoyed it and happy to take any
