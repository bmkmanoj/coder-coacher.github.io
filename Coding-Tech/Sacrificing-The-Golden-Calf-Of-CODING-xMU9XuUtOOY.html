a bit of digital heresy because there's
no numbers not much things and you can
do in the morning that wakes you up
better than that and I want to talk to
you about a sacrifice in the Golden Calf
of coding and what do I mean by that
first of all I think with the made code
or developing or programming kind of
almost a religion we have our own rules
and everybody has to follow them and we
we see ourselves as somebody different
from the world of the people that use
the things that we do and pay money for
it they're stupid we get everything for
free right and I want to make sure that
we understand that technology has kind
of overtaken us as humans and we are not
immune to that that revolution or that
change as well so the other day I did
something that nobody ever does I went
to Twitter and made a grandiose
statement without backing it up at all
nobody does that everybody has only
research-based things on Twitter and
says things that aren't that are
understandable and I said that in five
years most of what we call coding these
days will be done by machines and
they'll be much better at it and people
were all like yeah well whatever Chris
you live in the future or whatever
you're deluded and you're old just stop
cause we have to code it like being a
command line is the best thing ever when
I started at my company right now we put
delete the wsl subsystem into Windows 10
so we had these announcements with like
Holograms and like everything really
cool stuff and when people got most
excited about like you can now write
1970s code on a new laptop and I'm like
really we invented 40 60 years of
engineering and software so we're back
to writing unix commands that's kind of
kind of somewhere in between we lost it
and we got lost into the fun of coding
things so machine learning and AI is the
thing that is happening right now all
around us and it's the hot new thing if
you have a company or you want to get
funding you just go to any cafe in the
Silicon Valley and you mumble machine
learning and people give you investment
money because nobody knows what it is
and nobody really understands it the way
it should be understood and there's
leaps and bounds happening just
today actually yesterday this morning I
tweeted that one that Alibaba and
Microsoft's AI programs beat humans at
the first time on a Stanford University
reading comprehension test so this is a
test to see how well people can read and
artificial intelligence programs are
better and this is not only reading the
words but also making deductions what
the words mean understanding metaphors
understanding intricacies between words
so we are in a world where AI and
machine learning is the thing that
people strive for that's the new hype
that we're following right now and it
can go really far I mean I love that a
new scientist where is it like letting
robots kill without human supervision
could save lives I'm really wondering
when you stopped finishing that headline
and hit Enter and they're like what did
I just do but we even think that ethical
decisions are sometimes better done by
computers because humans are failing at
that and there were quite a few Star
Trek episodes in the original series
about computers killing people without
having to feel remorse or these kind of
things it's kind of weird that we're
already thinking about these things and
everybody is worried about automation I
work a lot outside of our ma our little
world right now and I talk to people in
like insurance companies I talk to
people in banks and they're all really
worried that automation and computers
will replace them and they will they
have in a lot of cases already I live in
Berlin now and we have next to us one of
those Amazon delivery centers with all
the cars just lined up and when you
think about all these small kamekona
companies that used to deliver things or
you had to pick up things that there's
they have been replaced by Amazon Prime
already so a lot of automation is
happening around us and people are
worried about their jobs what will
people do and I'm kind of like a
optimist about this I'm like if we start
optimizing the things that we do that
keep us from innovating that keep that
eat up our time and are boring to do we
have a chance as humans to do some more
creative things and more important
things I always love when we blog we got
a safety earth know we don't the earth
is fine as soon as the humans are dead
like we're the only ones who actually
mess up
our world the way we actually use it
with the best parasite I've ever seen
other parasites help the host we don't
we just take take take take take and the
answer to it when you go to the press is
always like everybody must learn how to
code like oh my god you're a custodian
now but if you want to have a job in two
years time you have to go to a code camp
and you have to become a coder and you
have to become a developer and I find
this kind of like a blanket simple
solution much like saying like you got
to learn English to get a job
not necessarily in Germany not
necessarily Romania it's like one of
those simple things that like
everybody's like these guys code they
have a job I don't code I need to learn
how to code and we are not actually
exempt of that either I love that the
other day when the github but got a job
offer and it's happening I mean there's
like chop off a BOTS going through
github and finding keywords and sending
your job offers and I mean maybe in the
future just spots hire each other and
fire each other and these kind of things
it's got to be interesting to see but
let's rewind for a bit about the whole
coding thing there's a crib there's a
few great talks about this and when you
do your research about in the 60s and
70s when coding was a thing that people
were so much more happy about the future
of coding they were seeing computers
doing the jobs for us rather than us
having to know the nitty-gritty of the
command line for everything that we do
now for me coding the first time I saw
the talk the term coding was a part of
the demo scene it was not in the
commercial enterprise it was not in the
job environment it was people that in
their free time did random stuff with
only outdated old computers this is what
I looked like back then and this is what
we did we had a Commodore 64 in front of
us and was sitting there for people like
why does it why does it still flicker
maybe change that number around maybe do
that do something since of sensible with
ease and coding in the demo scene to me
meant one thing it was programming in a
creative fashion pushing the boundaries
of limited environments we had 64k of
ram we had a 1 megahertz machine and
that's all we had there was no chance to
upgrade it there was no way to wait for
the next iteration of the hardware it
was just fixed in time and place so we
had to be very creative in our code
to make things work to make things look
pretty to make things look impressive
but we didn't care if it was
maintainable we didn't care if it made
sense we just wanted to show off how
cool we are as developers rings a bell
you know Stack Overflow hacking news
fields the kind of thing like oh this
thing is not ready for production but
you all should use it like no so to me
back then coding meant performance
cleverness and the meant if nurse was
the most important thing whereas
maintainability and readability
readability was actually a thing you
made sure that it wasn't because then
other people didn't know how you did it
and you were the cooler one it's like
some people have that as job security as
well like I've written this nobody can
maintain it I'm here for the next 40
years until the next security hole comes
around and you have to fix it
so when I started having to make money
cause my parents threw me out and said
like you're old enough to make money
whatever you still here I thought about
okay let's do this computer thing and
not do it as a hobby but actually make
some money with it so to me the time of
coder was over and I became a programmer
a developer or an engineer depending on
what the company called me one one
business card I have says HTML monkey
and that was okay as well because the
money was good so I didn't care but when
I did the transition from coder to
programmer I thought I play nice because
I like to work with people who have
their stuff together or have their
things together so my focus became
maintainability and readability of my
code whereas like cleverness and
performance was not that much of an
issue because when I started on the web
there was no performance there was
nothing a browser could do that would
need performance it was bust like oh you
render forms and you press buttons and
you send them off excellent that was
always fast we didn't have any nations
we didn't have any like video these kind
of things
and the inventiveness was all out of the
window because most people wanted to
have the same website that everybody
else had done the amount of websites
that I built back then because
competitors had the website was just
hilarious I worked on McDonald's England
for four years McDonald's doesn't need a
website back then they didn't sell
anything over it they made it hard for
people to communicate with them because
everybody abused him when they
communicated with
them they only had a website cost Burger
King had one so they always send us to
poster ads and then like turn this into
a website you like well where's the text
where's the content but that's it be
creative okay fair enough
and it wasn't easy for us because the
environments were terrible I mean we had
Internet Explorer four five six we had
Netscape and these things were all not
standardized we didn't have anything to
have didn't have any documentation to go
at we had to have to do trial and error
to make things work and to do random
things like table layouts we had to use
indentation with bandwidth block code
and these horrible things we did to HTML
because there was no CSS there was just
nothing to extra to do and the problem
with that one that everybody who came
from that world or even later the ie6
world we carry all this weight of like
oh we had to go through that pain so you
should too so the last 15 years of
giving presentations and hearing
presentations of development has all
these things that I call the worries of
the battle-weary people of the web the
people that went through the browser
wars and that had to suffer these
horrible environments and those those
clients that didn't know what they
wanted and still demanded a lot of
things then there was always see like oh
my cousin's son has dream Bieber he
could do it cheaper than you and you're
like well let him and then I see you in
a year's time to fix it for twice the
money but people just didn't trust our
job right so we came up with these
things that we keep repeating and I
found myself repeating them as well and
I kind of got bored of them so one of
them is like browser X is the new ie6
you see that every few month were it's
like right now it's Chrome before that
it was Safari and people build form on
browser only and we know for sure that
the one thing that that means is that
these are also people who are terrible
and probably kicked puppies because that
there is there's no reason nowadays to
do of something for one browser except
business reasons and except people don't
even have a choice to do it quickly so
it's always quite funny how we get up in
a jiffy about like oh my god everybody's
doing like this only works on Chrome
Google hates the Internet you know what
if 90% of your users you
Chrome only your business plan that week
is to get this out of the door and then
you fix it later I'm not saying it's
right I'm just saying it happens the
other thing that people keep saying is
like what if library or framework goes
away and that's all that people learned
and was always to jQuery saying what if
people only know jQuery we have a whole
generation of developers that only know
jQuery and still they have a job still
they build things of course it means
that kittens will die and unlocked code
will clog up the internet this is what
libraries and frameworks do yes service
so-and-so is amazing but what will you
do it when it's gone you know like what
if github goes away I mean the only
solution is frantically copied your code
to floppy disks for safekeeping this is
what we do package so install softs this
problem for you but you don't own it and
you don't know what it does NPM like oh
my god NPM install out of a solder can
like 5,000 package of my hard drive and
I have no idea what they're doing
they're probably like Trump tweets and
over in the background on your behalf
generic code tries to solve too many
things you don't need solving and in my
days all we needed was two lines of CSS
and we changed it every four days I was
liking when people go for frameworks and
they're like well it solves all my
problems and you can do this by hand
okay next week you have to do it by hand
this way in two weeks you have to do it
by hand this way so make sure you get
this kind of stuff in your world of
development which you don't because one
of the biggest lies after I read the
Terms and Conditions is do it now we're
gonna fix it later no we won't
it's a lie don't trust people who say
that they never will give you time to
fix it later feature of the web is cool
but what about people on older browsers
that's always in Germany that's my
biggest thing like whenever you do
something in your life yeah sure this is
in the newest browser
everybody gets for free on their phone
but it doesn't work in IE 9 ok my
clients have upgraded in years if now
the developers can support them so
should you this is the kind of message
there that I'm giving to people some
things on the web should not be there
anymore
some things should not be used at just a
security problem and it's not you don't
want to be in control or you
want to have the job to fix other
people's security issues and by
supporting them you support people doing
that everybody is invited to build for
the web you don't need to use a certain
editor or training that's the beauty of
the web that was the great thing about
the web notepad and FTP was good enough
for me and made me the person I am today
and I find it fascinating that we're so
excited about how shit our environment
was you know we're all like hey I cool
we have to do things by hand we only had
zeros and ones and sometimes we had to
use the letter O because the zero didn't
work so well done but we should move
ahead we should not actually use the bad
terrible tools from the past just
because we can so we're great in
inventing and advocating best practices
like I love that if one of the main
principles of good code is don't repeat
yourself why do we keep talking about it
and we do is like I was still ago do you
sort of the 1970s best programming
practices that we should follow today as
well but when you look around this is a
live code that I saw the other day and
it's tr class a thing ID and I have one
five something like that so it's a table
layout anybody have a guess what that is
yeah hacker news
this is hacker news and I love class a
thing because it's just basically a slap
in the face of anybody who ever liked
CSS it's not even an unnecessary class
that is computer generated it just says
a thing you know how do you style this
how do you start a thing it's bizarre
that these things are out there but the
fun thing is these things work computers
and browsers have to become lenient
because we expect people to make
mistakes one of the main principles of
the web is that the end user should not
suffer from program and mistakes so we
made computers that we made browsers
very very lenient with what computer
what people do and lazy developer sees
uses a carte blanche to write anything
there well table layouts worked in 1997
why should I change my skill set so why
is that why do we have all these best
practices and these most beautiful
things and these explanations and
tutorials and video things and still
there's so much crap on the web that
basically you just look at
somebody who is about best practice why
why would you if ever no it's you can't
have two IDs in one HTML document that's
what an IDE is you don't have two
passports this doesn't work that way
well the reasons that people are people
and people have problems and people have
deliveries and people have jobs to do
and people get lazy and people get tired
and people make mistakes because they're
bored and we cannot just tell people
that the best practice is the thing to
follow because a lot of times what we
earned from best practices after the
first browser wars is not that much of a
necessity these days all browsers are
much better than they used to be all
browsers give you insights in what you
do so there's a good quick story about a
button when I started my first company
in in Augsburg on my first day I came in
and they're like okay your HTML
developer and here's to decline that we
have a big company that does like
handcrafted clothing kind of things like
wellies for children and three other
pound and these kind of things really
expensively and that was was 1997 and
they send us access databases and that's
what's the data that we got every week
and then we had HTML developers that
went through the Access database and
copied and pasted content into HTML
documents safe them put them on FTP and
put them on the server
this was our job as HTML developers and
I looked at that and I'm like why are we
doing this well that's how you do
websites right and I'm like this is
access you can script access you know
that looks like what do you mean yes
just vbscript and there is like action
that there's a visual basic if you don't
know visual basic it's a great
programming language if you hate syntax
and you like to write security holes
this is this was a great language for
that so I'm like I can make you a button
to generate these pages from that
database easily in the lagoon I'm like
give me an hour and I wrote an hour I
wrote the script and basically had a
button and then we could generated a
website and we had it finished and we
still build a client for two weeks for
development work because that's how the
contract worked and they didn't ask but
I found out really early that way that
automating things as developers is our
superpower because if we hand copy and
paste things into these HTML documents
we will make mistakes we will be bored
and we will not be doing it properly if
you can write a template and you can
generate the things that way these
mistakes will not happen you can even
write unit tests you can write tests in
between to make sure the computer while
they're doing it doesn't do it wrong
this is how PHP came around this is how
smarty came around this is how all the
templating languages came around where
it's like oh we should write HTML by
hand and like gluten-free and vegan and
these kind of things that make our
artisanal HTML now we got a render
things out so professional development
for me means that only a few of us ever
hear the Wow how did you do that like we
had in the demo scene but most of the
time what you hear is have you finished
this because we are not part of the
timekeeping we're not part of saying
like how long do we does it take to do
that there's assumptions being made for
us as developers to get this out of the
door and when we as a keen young cool
new developers get asked to do something
we always underestimate we always say
like I could do it in three hours and
then like 12 hours later of googling
things you're like okay Matt didn't do
it in three hours
always Pat 400% when people ask you
anything ly outrightly to their face
because you will have problems that that
come up so I learned very early on that
instead of code what made me a career
and what made me happy and because as a
developer was reused and I started
reusing my own things I wrote my own
snippets I wrote my own extensions to
development environments I tweaked my
editor and my browser to my needs
I wrote extensions to the browser itself
I made myself happy by making my own
environment rather than writing the code
that I was paid for and that way I can
then press three buttons and generate
the code that people asked me to do
because we always think that people want
the most amazing and cool things in
essence they just want what's on this
month plan and the next month and the
next month and the next month cause we
have to change that we cannot work that
way
but we are guilty as programmers to
never have cared
- never thought about why is a product
manager not giving me enough time why is
that for that feature so hard when I
could do it in two lines of code because
16 people worked on it against each
other because they were badly done I now
moved into a row where I'm I was a lead
developer an architect and now I'm a
product manager and a program manager
and I learned out of a sudden all these
horrible things that I had my program
manager go through because as a
developer I didn't understand the things
that they had to do like sit in random
meetings and listen to three-letter
acronyms you don't understand and find a
developer that needs to do that and
support the developer in networks to do
their now work for Microsoft and I work
at huge things and I learned that a lot
of the things that I thought were best
practice not that interested in not
Microsoft itself but our clients and
these are huge companies these are
companies with thousands of software
products inside their own thing my
department is called Paks and I just
joined because of the logo because I
thought it was something with stars and
stuff but in essence it means partner
application experience so I'm helping
people write applications on the web on
them and on other environments to make
their stuff work and what I learned
there is that everything counts in large
amounts it's not really about optimizing
to the nth degree is about like how fast
can we roll is out yeah we know it's
crap but if we don't roll it out we
don't get the budget for this month we
have to do something this month let me
get budget for next month to do
something extra to do something with it
and that's why I learned that writing
code needs to be modular to be built
upon we cannot just build bespoke
perfect solutions that we then have to
throw away again this is depressing for
us as somebody that put a lot of effort
into making that perfect we need to
build more modular than we actually
should we always think about building
the perfect gorgeous beautiful solutions
you know we're building these
Chippendale furniture where every screw
is the right thing and like every
coloring of the of the corners is what
we need to do and the same thing with us
like I remember when we proudly had like
these valid XHTML badges on our websites
nobody
knowing user care at all we were like I
did it right I'm happy now I get more
you got nothing you basically get more
predictability that your thing worked
and you made sure that you could be
proud of creating something clean but
the cleanliness is not what people
expect it they just expect that a
website to do something with now
nowadays computing is ubiquitous we have
these mobile phones in our pockets we
even have like random microphones in our
rooms that record to it that listen to
us and do things for us always cracks me
up like 10 years ago I would have come
to you and say like can I put a
microphone in your house that records
everything no what if it tells you the
weather oh cool yeah sure let's do that
you know like we have these machines all
over us controlling our lives doing our
things I'm now moving to Germany so I'm
trying to get all my paperwork done
there's still a sailing race in
Charlotte we love paperwork and
bureaucracy but we do everywhere else
you very much reliant on software we
reliant on computing computers to work
and I think when it comes to that then
the whole IKEA model makes much more
sense this is the IKEA Billy it's not
amazing you probably will not go to
somebody's house and say like I built
that because we all did you know like
you know IKEA it's like Lego but for
grown-ups and cheaper but what I like
about about IKEA is when I look at how
these things are planned how these
instructions are written for anybody in
any language or any intelligence levels
and how these the screws are at the
right place and the holes are at the
right place the statics of the thing
works out so building something badly
together in IKEA takes takes a job ok I
managed to do it I managed to build
something wrong the wrong way around but
that's because I was I was not putting
patience and I was reading ahead and I
was trying to think what it should be
done but how clever these IKEA things
are to be built together it's just a
beautiful idea how much they thought
about her making it work how can we make
it as simple as as possible to pack it
together and transport it and then build
it up and that's what we should be
thinking as well how does my code
modularly
work for other people can use it not
like how do I build the most beautiful
salut
I'm the one doing it with increased
complexity and demand any software
product would sooner or later use
pre-built components I used to do games
on Commodore 64 and these kind of things
an Amiga and I'm like this is cool this
is fun and then I learned that game
development is only SDKs from dick from
the console developers and you basically
put things together and you it's more a
clicky thing than anything else in the
indie game scene yes you write your
games from the start to end but when it
comes to commercial production it's just
using other people's components and code
and it makes it faster it allows them to
roll out many more things and make users
happy because that they always want to
have the same thing people are happy to
get the same thing over and over again
just with a new feature this is
depressing but that's the reality of the
world just look at Hollywood the last 20
years what's the same movies over and
over again so great components are easy
to use they're easy to keep updated they
have limited pollution of the final
product and they have appropriate
tooling and this is where we get away
from this like oh I used my text editor
and write my HTML and CSS because some
frameworks make sense to have an IDE to
use some frameworks only should run on a
cloud box run and reuse setting up your
local machine over and over again with
different projects when I was a leaf
developer I was looking after 12
different projects my computer was
completely shot because I had an Apache
running I had a tomcat running I had a
an IAS for the other tool I had this
environment that environment I spent
more time fixing my computer and making
my local environment work then building
things for the end user
and that's why I like that nowadays we
have images we have things like docker
where we can make environments and
deploy them in one click and that's IKEA
as well they're easy to update they're
easy to limited pollution of the final
product there's nothing left at the end
of it and that's of course a problem if
you blindly use frameworks and
environments you will have a huge
website that uses everything but doesn't
use it when it's actually being used and
again this is where something like web
pack and other tooling comes in that can
do takeout these things that we don't
want to have because you don't want to
do that by hand
so all these things these worries of the
old people their problems but they're
not problems that we should be solving
by hand these are problems that we have
tools for and I'm so excited nowadays to
see what tools we have when I teach new
people coming into our market I'm like I
wished I had the stuff that you have now
of course it's complex when we always
say like ok let's start with HTML CSS
and make a website and now like all you
do is grunt NPM no trace you setup this
I don't even know what brunch is and you
have gallup and bower au man web pack
you know all these things can be
overwhelming but you know what they're
not there to overwhelm you the job of
all these tools is one thing and one
thing only they need to ensure that
large teams can work safely together if
we build things by hand we assume that
everybody else is clever as we are and
we need it's up to us to explain to them
how something was done if we use a
framework that is properly documented
properly properly installable properly
has like it has like demos has like
helped channels then this job is done by
the framework for us I'm not saying we
should rely on frameworks on everything
but this is a huge opportunity to be
able to go away from a project and then
basically say like I don't have a
problem next person coming on that has
documentation has a community that
supports them rather than myself and I'm
a hundred percent sure that I won't find
anybody in this room who says like every
job I ever finished I left the thing and
I was happy with it because anybody can
maintain the thing that I left behind we
never get the chance to document things
on the way out we stay far too long at
companies without having fun because we
think it's up to us to make this thing
work no it's not if you're unhappy
working on something don't work on it
anymore find another way for people to
do it because all you're gonna do is
write terrible code and be unhappy doing
it so we create code that might not be
optimized that way but it's easier to
convert and maintain code written by
algorithms code written by scripts by
build scripts follows rules that way we
can actually write a conversion script
to turn it from one to the other hand
written code optimized quality code
is not optimizable with a weather tool
or not as easily if you ever see try to
scrape HTML from the web and use it or
might write your own scraper rather than
using beautiful soup or something like
that it's daunting it's so hard to find
HTML code that's clean because people
just randomly put things together
because the deadline was there and we
see this kind of abstraction happening
even the languages itself take for
example this task which is a very common
interview question a few years ago find
the largest member of an array so via
have let array 2010 510 when I started
as a JavaScript developer back in the
days when browsers were really horrible
I would have probably written it like
that like largest array is a function I
have a temporary value which is got to
be the highest value at the end then I
loop through the array in Reverse
because of for loop that iterates and
reads the length of the array was really
slow in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet
Explorer 5 so I do this clever trick of
using all - - and loop through it I do
an if statement to compare the temp with
the array value at the moment and then
at the end I return the temp because the
biggest one will always be the one
that's out there this is readable but
not really because I already do that all
- - trick that you might not know about
so I wrote and optimized at the same
time ok later on javascript got a bit
more features out of a sudden I had math
max and so I didn't have to do that
stupid if statement anymore so it still
acquired a lot of code for that simple
thing nowadays with es6
this is the code that I expect people to
write and it feels weird to me I don't
want to do it but it makes total sense
I've got my array my fat arrow function
and I have a math max function that gets
called on each of the iterated elements
and I have a spread or a spread on the
are on the array to go through it
there's a lot of magic happening there
that I is an old-school developer I'm
like Jesus what the hell is that but if
you learn JavaScript right now this is
documented and it works fine now you can
do a micro optimization and run it
through like a a benchmark and say like
well actually the reverse while loop is
much much faster than the spread
but by using the spread I can make the
performance problem the problem of the
JavaScript engine makers you don't have
to optimize your code they have to
optimize their engine and the people
made working on JavaScript engines love
that kind of stuff when we put new
features in we want people to use them
so we see where the problems are we can
optimize them if people don't use them
because they're not ready yet
we will never optimize them because we
don't know that they're performing not
well so something's consider about all
of this is that humans rely heavily on
technology these days we're the time we
get to deliver product has been much
much shorter than it was in the past
we're supposed to deliver a most viable
product in every product that I know
right now we're not even thinking about
like okay we're gonna have the first
iteration the alpha and then we're gonna
have to beat her and then we're gonna
have no nothing it gets past beta and
stand up work in in startup world but in
in real production we always ask the guy
or make it work and then we roll it out
and then we make it better and we have
to think about that compute people rely
on computers to get fixes to get better
functionality to have better
functionality and this gives us plenty
of opportunity to endanger our end users
it's not about code quality and writing
beautiful code it's making sure that
your code does not become a security
problem does not become a performance
problem that cannot be fixed and when
you saw like the latest problems with
the Intel and AMD ended on chipsets
vulnerabilities with CS yes I could make
a computer vulnerable nowadays this was
impossible CSS came out all we did was
like put underlines on links away and
when we rolled over then we showed a
mega and were like whoo look at that and
nowadays we do animations we do timing
we do all kind of things that directly
talks to the vid to the graphics
hardware in CSS and we can make mistakes
without knowing it and there's nothing
more easy for a developer for a new
developer to say like why do people do
it that complex I can do it in two lines
of code you're like yeah you don't know
the repercussions of it so abstractions
to me are not inherently a lazy way out
or dangerous like I always like to say
like oh my god use jQuery you can use
vanilla
you don't need to use jQuery for that
because you're lazy but in essence
they're a consensus to enable lots of
people to build bigger and better
products it's easier nowadays to say for
example okay we're using vue.js for that
we're using we're using react for that
and of course you make it more limited
to a smaller group of developers that
way but you have a documentation you
know why something was written the way
it was because the framework demanded
you - and in essence to play well with
others we need to establish rules and we
can document our best practices as until
the green in the face if people don't
get the documentation or the error
handling while they're building things
they're not gonna follow them so we're
not code warriors fighting the man or
the good fight that's what when I came
out of the demoscene it's what we're
always were like we write code and we
make like disco machines this computer
company says their computers can never
do that look what I made it do
we're not cold warriors about this
nobody cares about this fight any longer
we have to deliver things for people to
use and that's why I think we're
becoming engineers building solutions in
teams for people to use so focusing much
more on the teamwork and how does my
code affect the people around me how
does what demands does my code have to
the people maintaining it is much more
interesting to me there's a great quote
that that states that it may not be
warriors who get the glory but it's the
engineers who build societies and
building societies is something that we
should be considering of course it isn't
- Steve Jobs was actually B'Elanna
Torres from Star Trek but it's always
people listen to it much more when it
was Steve Jobs but I love that quote I'm
like building societies how cool is that
we're right now in a massive fight where
people look at IT people as horrible
people we're the ones with a lot of
money that go into the houses that other
people can't afford and we're not
playing well with each other and we're
all like arrogant and I think the
society thing is something we should be
concentrating much more on I also lost
in another lights for Philip poem and
there's this beautiful quote that made
me rethink my best practices and the
preaching
than I do about them it's the duty of
the old to be anxious on behalf of the
young and the duty of the young is to
scorn the anxiety of the old so I invite
every new developer coming in right now
to call out people like me who say like
oh you're overcomplicating by using this
webpack thing show me why you're using
it and what the benefit of it is and I'm
happy to oblige because I realize we've
been overtaken by the demand of delivery
that we have to do we cannot just build
like bespoke software for everything we
have to think of the ikea way of
building components that other people
can put together and build things for
end-users
so it's much more important what you
create rather than how you do it I'm
much more excited about what your
product does not rather than like what
framework did you use because that will
change and the fun thing by relying on a
framework with the coding best practice
and a coding style and a tooling you can
convert it to other frameworks after
that with handwritten code you can
probably not do the same thing that's
why we talk about pwace you can ride an
iOS app you could run an Android app you
can write a web app or you can write a
web app and let technology do the other
ones for you then you don't need to
repeat the code on all of these
platforms coding is much more fun when
you aren't carrying years of well that
won't work this way with you and in many
cases it very much works as technology
moved on whenever I look at at a product
I'm like ah now I can't do that because
that would happen I can't do that what
can't that would happen and it stifles
me it makes me not creative and
interested anymore I love when new
developers just try things out and say
like here that Mon liner with the array
I would have probably a year ago I would
have said like yeah but you've got to
make sure that the browser supports this
fat arrow and these kind of things cool
he doesn't have he or she doesn't have
to think about that problem anymore they
can build the next cool thing they can
think about the next big problem and we
have great tools these day they teach
you to code while you write the code I
love for example Visual Studio code I'm
working on that project so I have to
love it but I love that it's written in
typescript I can write the editor that I
use for a certain line
which in the language that I'm writing
it with I can mess around with that
thing in any way that I want and it's
open source and I don't even Microsoft
doesn't even have a right to say no I
can I can put dancing dinosaurs in the
background of mine and it would be mine
it's fine it's an open-source project of
course I can resubmit it and Brenda can
say no we don't need dancing dinosaurs
but you can make this your editor you
can make this your environment same with
Adam same with many other editors out
there but what I like most about it is
that it comes with linting built in
that's bit like when you're writing in
word and out of a sudden you got the
squiggly red lines under it which made
you you made mistakes there and this is
happening in code now as well and I
think that's much more exciting than
debugging that you can put in a Java
Script for example you can put up there
an ADD TS check and then it puts the T
the typescript rules in JavaScript all
of a sudden forget the squiggly lines
telling you you forgot to actually make
that a constant
you forgot to initiate that one with the
LEDs and out of a sudden once you fix
that the other ones go away as well so
while I'm typing things it tells me the
mistakes that I do which is for me much
more exciting than learning all the
rules why something is wrong you can
still put click on the arrow next to it
to get the explanation why it's wrong
but it's much better than writing wrong
code and then being disappointed because
it doesn't work we have collaborative
editing and education tools as code pen
jsbin glitch comm and also in the
editors itself we can now much like in
Google Docs you can write code together
and you can see who's writing where I
teach people coding that way nowadays I
asked them to like okay put it on put it
on jsbin and i come in with you and i
code with you and i show you where the
problems are rather than like being on
skype and having to explain go to line
15 see that character there and there
it's much easier to do it
collaboratively and together and if you
need inspiration code pen is absolutely
incredible it's beautiful what people do
there so good tools allow you to find
bottlenecks and obvious flaws browser
developer tools have all audience built
in they got performance tools built in
they've got just checkers in there so
while again while you're executing it on
your end product you will find the
issues that you have but I think it's
ridiculous to think that nowadays with
our complex
city of devices and environments that we
have to develop at to support we can
actually make the life code our
development code we passed that we
actually should be dead pieced all this
tooling makes our code better so we
should write it
use the tooling and create the most
optimized version for the end product by
algorithmic and script scripted
environments rather than doing it by
hand for all of them if you haven't
looked at solar well yet you can do that
later up upstairs in our downstairs and
our thing as well that's a limiting tool
that shows you all the performance
security and and and validation problems
that your website has before you build
it you can put that into a continuous
integration you can put that in your
build script to go through these and say
like okay here's a unit test on like
best practices rather than knowing all
the best practices up front so thinking
with reusable components is not only a
thing for coders we've we've been doing
that in the development space but also
in the design space if you think about
it it flows over into the design space a
lot we've got style guides we got
pattern libraries people using sketch
and turn it into code with just a few
steps in between because our designs are
already coded to a degree they're not at
the mall like mocked up rather than
written and back in the days it was just
like you got a power you got a appear
Steve with like 5,000 layers with no
names and nowadays you can do a lot of
generation of like click throughs from
our tools as well so the thing is Tobin
we have predictable reusable and well
working parts to mix and match we can go
even further why would I need to
download bootstrap and start putting a
bootstrap website together when
everybody wants to have the same website
anyways they want to have a hero image
and they want to have a carousel under
it and they want to have a footer that
says mate with love somewhere so
computers are good at repeating things
finding patterns and improving them
humans suck at that when I look at
something like bootstrap I'm like I'm
already bored I don't want to do this I
know it's easier but I don't feel any
passion of like putting a thing together
to somebody else as written and then
releasing it I'm like I'd rather think
about what can I do
optimize and again with that button
thing that I did an actress in VB back
then think that thinking is an eye in my
head now when something is repeated over
and over again a human should not do
this because we're bad at that when we
get bored we make mistakes so computers
are good at looking what people are
doing I love Auto draw by Google where I
can do things like that and then it
press a button and it turns it into
glasses you know for somebody like me
who has no talent of painting at all
this is great and I love especially the
backstory of that it's it's been
sorcerer who Google has ai but they fed
it with a game that they did called
quick-draw in the past they asked people
to say like okay here's a game draw an
elephant and then the computer took all
the elephants that people drew and then
found the elephant icon and maintained
matches them together so by letting
people do things over and over again and
a computer listening in on it we can now
make it easier for people to do and you
can do incredible things like that
that's that's Airbnb I don't know if
you've seen this what they're doing is
you paint something on a piece of paper
like a prototype of the page and it
analyzes it and it creates the page and
creates the code from it they can do
that because they have a very strict
design system they also do that because
because they want to build new websites
rather quickly there's a white paper on
the background of that if you want to
know about the machine learning in
detail about at the neural network
that's under that and how to turn a
graphical image into HTML code that
looks like code written by a person
except without the mistakes that the
person would have done that is amazing
and I love that we're in their space
already so they use training data
open-source machine learning algorithms
and a design system in the browser to be
able to do this because they
concentrated on those things cost a new
you're not gonna have a developer for
more than a year that person will go so
make sure that you actually automate
around them take their skill set and
make it a skill set of the group rather
than like having rock stars in your room
the question is now why is the where's
the fun and all that and I think humans
are better than machines so working well
with people is thousand times more
important than working well
with code don't get so lost in the app
problems that you don't spend any time
solving people problems
so when it comes to everybody must learn
to code I find that completely the wrong
solution to me everybody should learn to
solve problems and when we automate
things away that are boring to us when
we when we do things by automating the
necessary we gain time to find the fun
again in our development we find time to
be creating gorgeous new components new
pair new packages an npn that have no
security problems new a new new web
components that are accessible we have
time to run unencumbered pet projects if
your own project go wild plaything with
things write a code pen that doesn't
make sense but you want to try something
out play with those things outside of
deliveries we have we can help the tools
that we use you can put a pull request
into all the editors that you use all
the tooling that you use and you can
help those even with documentation even
with fixing typos you don't even need to
be a coder to help somebody like web
pack you can play with upcoming
technology I'm now looking at hololens
stuff and look at that machine learning
stuff much more than i look at
javascript although that's my expertise
because i'm one more i want you to do
different things you want to drop out of
the rat race and clear your heads
because we are in a world right now
where we're not working healthily we're
working far too fast and thinking we're
doing far too many things right while
we're doing them wrong where computers
could do two things for us and we could
spend time having a coffee and talking
to our colleagues instead and planning
the next step before we're actually
doing it and we have time to help each
other out when we're stuck with some new
technology to teach new people about
things and we have time to help others
get excited about what we do and this is
not about sending them to a coding
course but you're telling them like our
product enables people to do this code
is at the base of it but here are the
five components that we use that you
could use as well so if you're feeling
overwhelmed by the whole coding thing I
think there's a change happening right
now
where a lot of the stuff that we call
coding these days can be done better and
faster by computers and I find as
developers we have
our job if that's that's already not the
case if it's still up to the human to do
repetitive pouring commands then we
haven't used a computer as a tool but we
made it a religious object and I don't
think that should be the case and with
that I thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
