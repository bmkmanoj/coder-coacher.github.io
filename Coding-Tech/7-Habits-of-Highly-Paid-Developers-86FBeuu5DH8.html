highly paid developers so I guess I
should introduce myself I'm Gaines
Carson yeah in France it's pronounced
care Gaussian but it's been Americanized
I'm from Nashville Tennessee that's the
home of country music also known as the
music city let's get right into the
numbers has anybody here ever been told
not to talk about your salary yeah I
think all of us have been taught you
don't tell people what you make it's
impolite
it sounds boastful it can cause problems
they might be jealous
it might make you jealous of them when
they tell you what they make the problem
here it is we're told we're not supposed
to talk about it
we're not supposed to know but employers
know they know what they pay you and
what they pay everyone else and they
know when they hire people what to offer
and recruiters certainly know they see
more resumes and salaries go across
their desk than anyone we're the only
ones who are supposed to be in the dark
so one thing I would like to start off
with is it's suggesting that maybe we
combat this so we start sharing this
information among each other there are
good sites to do this there's one called
Glassdoor there's several other PayScale
I think this one I'm not sure if there
are some specific to this region you can
see this is a report from believe 2016
that outlines the demand for different
technologies so you can see Java right
there at the top followed by C C++ these
slides will be available later on my
website and I believe we'll make them
available through the conference as well
so don't feel like you have to take a
screenshot of every one and then these
are the next ones down just to give you
an idea of what follows but there are
some of these such as Erlang for
instance not been very high demand but
the people who wanted are willing to pay
for it so keep in mind that it's not
purely demand it's also supply as far as
how companies find candidates which will
be going into how to expose yourself how
to get in front of the right people it's
very often referrals social networks and
we'll talk about some networking
techniques
so let's see if we can identify some
special skills that make you valuable to
the industry besides just these
technologies the first trick is to
establish your value when I say
establish your value I'm not talking
about a list of all the technologies
that you know or how long you've been
doing them what I'm talking about is
what have you done for people that
generate a value for them does anybody
have any suggestions for how you might
measure that anybody have any ideas
none excellent then you all are here for
a good reason obviously if we generate
more profit for a company that's
valuable if you build a website and that
generates 100,000 in sales that's
100,000 they didn't have before you can
measure that but what if you just
increase the efficiency of the company
what if you take a job that took a week
for somebody to do and you make it take
a day what if they have to do that job
every month you've just saved six days a
month times 50 weeks a year or however
made however often they work you can see
how that will add up if you can figure
what those jobs pay and how much
efficiency you've created you can start
to quantify how much value you've
delivered so to an employer if I tell
them I built a website for HR to manage
employee information well that's nice
you've done something you've probably
run your paycheck but if I tell them I
made the HR process more efficient by
eliminating a week's worth of work every
month and that person made it's less
eight twenty thousand or whatever
currency then you can start to calculate
the actual value you created with that
website and it's much more impressive to
a potential employer to say well if I
pay them X amount of dollars or current
whatever currency that they could save
me at least half that just by something
they did in a month often overlooked is
the decreasing of risk
if for those of you who raised your hand
that you don't work as developers maybe
some of you make backup systems you
backup data off-site well that may never
be used hopefully it will never be used
but you still created value how much
would it cost that company if that
backup system wasn't in place and a
disaster happened you can measure that
you can estimate it and remember these
don't have to be perfect numbers as long
as you can explain how you got there
that's what's really important and this
is a starting point for a conversation
it's to help someone understand what the
value to the business of what you did
any other ideas of how you might create
value or measure it yeah absolutely it's
hard to measure if you don't say
generate revenue directly from your
product but if you increase the
experience of the user if you improve
the brand it's very difficult to measure
but it's definitely worth it yes
that is a perfect example you should
really come up and join me on this
presentation but for anybody who
couldn't hear he was saying it's one
thing to say that you've increased the
speed of something it's another thing to
talk about how many users that affected
and what the effect was on them it's all
sort of important to remember that the
value that you create for users is often
not measured in technical aspects such
as speed or for instance I understand
that they were trying to improve the
train speed between London and Paris and
it was very difficult to increase that
speed it's very costly but they
installed wireless internet on the
trains and all the sudden satisfaction
went up incredibly because I don't care
if it takes an extra 10 minutes to get
there I can be on Facebook right
excellent point anybody else obviously
we will also want to consider what
technologies were able to use especially
for a consulting job or something where
you need to hit the ground running you
don't have time to learn new things but
how did you use them it's one thing to
say I built something with this or I use
this technology at a job it's another to
say how you creatively used it to solve
problems and we'll talk about how to
capture some of this in things like
resumes often overlooked are there less
technical skills the soft skills
communication skills being able to I
understand that one reason Romania is
such a popular destination for companies
to come for talent is because culturally
and communication-wise there's so much
more compatible with so much the rest of
the world over other countries that
outsource that's something that you have
to offer especially if you have gained
second third languages the ability to
collaborate is often I find as important
as your technical ability when
interviewing for a job or trying to
advance your career I don't want to hire
someone who's going to disrupt my team
the ability to collaborate with others
and to address issues is extremely
important
difficult to capture in something like a
resume but there are other times when
you can make this apparent I also
generally don't want to hire people who
are going to be exactly who they are now
as long as I have them I want to invest
in someone I want someone who's going to
grow most employers do they want you to
improve and they want you to stay while
you improve so that your ability to
change to their needs is something
important to highlight anybody have any
examples that they've used recently to
do this this is often something that
comes up in interviews I put it forth in
this slide but it's possibly the most
important in this changing economy is
the ability to solve problems the
ability to come up with solutions on
your own there are millions of people
perhaps billions of people who can do a
specific job that you give them very few
of them though have all the skills
required all the abilities to take a
problem create a solution and implement
it that is an extremely valuable skill
it's often overlooked especially if you
just portray yourself as a collection of
technologies that you know does anybody
familiar with the phrase critical
observation are you familiar with it
would you like to help us with what it
is Oh excellent we even have a mic now
nobody's gonna want to answer because
they don't want the mic oh I'll repeat
what you say it's fine
yeah that's definitely
that's definitely I'm shouting the mic
that's definitely a big part of it is be
not just the time put this over here
I know
test test okay great I know we're
recording so I want to make sure it's on
the mic so the ability not only finding
solutions to problems but to do it
proactively to be critical about the
sleep is extremely as well maybe this
thing is shorting there we go okay so
I'm at work and and clapping aspect
often times you can't choose the people
that you work with so the ability to
take problems and roll with them and
find solutions to social issues is
important I know this this was a bit
disjointed anybody have any questions
about any of that all right so let's
talk goals thing you've probably heard
the acronym art for SMART goals you need
goals that are very specific to what
you're trying to accomplish
you need to work hard at them you won't
know that you've accomplished them
unless you're able to measure them but
you also need to set realistic goals and
you need to set a certain amount of time
a certain duration to accomplish them in
and why am i talking all about these
goals well pretty much everybody who is
who we would consider successful sets
goals even if they don't do it formally
but for most of us we need a formal
process to do this I like to once I make
an action plan once I say here's my goal
I fill out all these details of what am
I trying to accomplish how will I know
that I've accomplished it how long and
for anybody who does project management
you'll realize this follows very closely
with how you manage a project right
you're managing your life I personally
like to use a daily planner anybody use
one of these very few one benefit
I've been in consulting a lot so this
allows me to capture what I'm doing on a
daily basis and then when I go in for a
review I am able to prepare and say what
did I accomplish over the last six
months or year I can go through my weeks
and see what I was doing and remind
myself but for personal growth this
planner in particular and I'm sure there
are many like it allows me to actually
write my goals down in my daily planner
so every day when I look at this book I
see what are the three things I'm trying
to accomplish what's the one thing I'm
focused on today in fact this one
underneath each day has a daily
priorities checkboxes so I can say what
are the specific things I'm doing today
to meet my goals and we'll talk about
some ways you can go about this as far
as advancing your professional career
anybody have other approaches they use
towards setting goals or planning out
how they're going to accomplish these
things dreams with a deadline that's
excellent
very good although I would be concerned
that dreams might be less attainable
right we want to make sure this is
something that we can be successful in
so we want to do it again and again
true that it's okay if goals can't be a
tank obtained they are goals for a
reason if we knew that we would do them
they wouldn't be called goals so let's
talk about your brand if you're a
developer and you don't have a brand
you're probably being given one and this
might be the one you're being given it's
important to remember that your brand is
simply a representation of who you are
you don't need to be a superhero you
don't need to inflate who you are just
focus on your actual accomplishments
because when you think about it from
someone else's perspective they don't
know it unless you share it so one way
to do this is open source development
does anybody do open source development
you're raising your hand to a communist
poster well the socialist idea of
sharing this goodness code is also
excellent for getting your expertise out
there it's almost like proof to the
world of what you're able to accomplish
I unfortunately have not gotten very
involved in open source development I
focused more on blogging and speaking
you buy here blog oh that's awesome
there's like two people who raised their
hand I mean we have a whole room of
people who can write a blog tonight if
you don't have a blog you have a
LinkedIn profile I expect yes pretty
much everybody has a LinkedIn profile
did you know you can blog on LinkedIn
you can write a post right there you
don't have to create a new website and
that's where most people are looking for
your professional experience so having
it right there is fine and you can
always copy that content somewhere else
if you decide you want your own separate
blog what's important remember is you
don't have to have something very
special to say there are a lot of people
who are kind of the same issues as you
do every problem you have is a problem
somebody else has had or will have so
consider them an opportunity every error
message you encounter how many times
have you Google
or binged an error message defined in a
solution I think every developer has
done this a hundred times a day you
could be that article that has that
error message and has how you solved it
but what if you didn't solve it you can
start a discussion about what you're
trying to do you don't have to have the
answer to write a blog article to put
content out there you could simply have
a situation I know us sometimes when I
look for answers I'll find something
where someone doesn't have a solution
but they have more information to the
problem and then also many blogs will
have the ability to comment LinkedIn
does this you can add comments articles
so you can start a conversation about
how you might approach this problem and
don't be afraid to make daring opinions
in fact if you couch them as a question
people can't really blame you right you
could say I think you know what if what
if Linux has always been better than
Windows and there always will be right
it's not my opinion I'm just wondering
right but you'll be surprised how often
these controversial topics will generate
attention and generate conversation
engage you and create conversations that
are of great value one of my favorite
approaches for putting content on the
Internet is to take something I've
accomplished and it doesn't have to be
perfect it could be the first time I did
this but to put it out there and say I
did this I created this what do you
think I'm looking for feedback I'm not
saying it's the best work ever but there
are probably other people who it's going
to be their first time doing it and your
first step will be a good template for
them to follow of course the other
benefit is you may get people who give
you insight to say well this is
something you could have done better or
I would have approached it this
different way this doesn't make you look
bad that you didn't make these
accomplishments it actually reflects
really well on you that you sought this
insight in this feedback this is
something that employers and co-workers
are looking for is this collaborative
nature
any other of things that people blog
about oh I guess we only had two
bloggers in the room so I'm probably not
I hope when I do this as a workshop I
actually stop and have everybody get on
a device and even if you don't write a
blog article at least write down some
ideas for articles that you might write
things that you're working on something
you maybe you did yesterday at work that
you were struggling with and write down
the idea and maybe start writing an
outline because that's the first step
you don't have to write the entire
article you just have to get it going
and you'd be surprised how quickly you
end up with something you can share any
speakers in the room I know we have at
least one or two up front excellent you
don't have to be a unique flower or a
special person to speak either there's
something that you have that there are
other people who would be interested in
it of course most people their fear of
public speaking is greater than their
fear of death so at a funeral they'd
rather be in the coffin than standing up
and talking to everyone but really in
the end you're just telling a story
you're just sharing an experience that's
the best presentations I've ever seen
have been narratives
they've just been a story this
conference doesn't have open spaces I
don't think is anybody familiar with
open spaces is that something that's
common here we like to do it a lot in
the US it's the idea is you get up on
stage at the beginning of an event like
this you know a leader and they ask for
ideas and people throw out topics that
they want to discuss and you wrote note
these topics on the board and who
mentioned them and then everyone votes
on which topics they think would be most
interesting to talk about and the ones
that got the most votes you put into a
schedule and then you schedule those
four different times in certain places
and everyone gathers there to have that
discussion now the reason I bring this
up is because the person who suggested
the topic leads that discussion they're
sort of the speaker but they're not
presenting it's a collaborative
discussion everyone's expected to
participate at some level but it's a
great way of getting your feet wet if
you decide you might be interested in
speaking but you don't
want to be onstage lightning talks are
another great opportunity they can be 5
10 15 I believe that those are done here
correct anybody not at this event okay
well if you have the opportunity one of
the great things often times with
lightning talks it doesn't have to be
technical in fact it's hard to present a
technical topic in five to fifteen
minutes so some of the best lightning
talks I've seen have been on gardening
it's something you're passionate about
and if you share something you're
passionate about that's contagious it's
exciting to hear about I'm not
interested in gardening but I was
riveted by this person's passion for
this topic and the way they went about
it and again it's just a story and you
can tell a story for five minutes on
something you're passionate about if
your company sent you here and paid your
tab one great way to make sure they do
that more is to start some lunch and
learns lunch and learns is there another
phrase that's used here basically brown
bag lunch take some of the sessions that
you attend here take a few notes or just
remember it and go back and say I'm not
an expert I just attended a session but
I want to share with the rest of my team
or some other people in my office what I
learned and then have a 30-minute
session where everybody brings their
lunch or maybe the company will even buy
lunch which is even better it's an
excuse to get a free lunch but share
what you learned the company not only
got the value of you attending this
conference but now they brought that
back to other people who may not have
been able to attend so it gets you that
speaking experience with people you're
comfortable with and justifies them
sending you to things like this also
there are local groups that meet and
they are always looking for people to
present in fact even if they have a full
calendar for the year they already have
ski speakers scheduled if you're
interested in sharing something with
that group you should definitely reach
out to them because they often have
people cancel something comes up this is
a volunteer thing so if you are on
standby if you can step in if somebody
fails that's very valuable and again
this is a local group it's probably
people you know it
very comfortable not as big of a room as
this and for conferences oftentimes
people think you have to be someone
special to speak at a conference that
the conference comes to you and says
would you please join us would you
please come share what you know almost
all the conference speakers I know they
submit you know the conference puts out
a call and those speakers say I'm
interested in sharing something at your
conference and they'll submit the talk
and oftentimes even the best speakers
get rejected because the conference is
looking for a certain topics and need to
fill out a schedule and it's very
difficult to plan a conference so if you
decide to submit and you don't get
selected understand that that's normal
it happens all the time but I would
encourage you if you get to the point
where you feel confident enough to do
this that you try it because as soon as
you get on stage people give you a
certain amount of respect and they
listen to what you have to say and it's
a great platform to share your thoughts
of course all this comes back to you
building your brand getting in front of
people and speaking is a great way to
share what you know what you're
interested in and remember those soft
skills we talked about well I hope you
at least know that I'm a competent
communicator right I can get up in front
of a room of users or for board members
directors and share some information and
so this is some value that you're able
to expose in this way anybody familiar
with the the now I can't remember that
Liam Neeson movie anybody remember this
movie's name taken yes you don't have to
be forceful in networking it doesn't
have to you know when we think of
networking sometimes we think of
recruiters trying to get your resume get
your phone number so they can call you I
like to look at look at it as a way to
connect on something that people love in
fact one of my favorite ways to network
is to ask people what are you passionate
about I used to ask people what do you
do for a living that's a very common in
the u.s. is what do you do what what's
your job a lot of people aren't
passionate about their jobs data may not
like what they do or where they were
they may be doing something that they're
not really interested in so asking them
what they're passionate about or what
they're struggling with engages them
almost every in oftentimes they'll say
well I have kids I'm passionate about my
kids that's something that they would
love to share with you people love
talking about their kids asking them
what they're struggling with could be
the same answer maybe their kids
hopefully though they'll share with you
something that they're working for bond
professionally that they're struggling
with and it's a great chance to connect
them with someone else you know who
could help I'm an expert in very few
things but I know a lot of people who
are very good at things so if you if I
talk to you and you have an issue I
might be able to connect you with
someone who can help but it's only so
valuable to make those connections if
you walk away and never talk to them
again in fact I'd say you might as well
not have had that conversation is that
anybody ever got in a business card and
put it in their pocket and then it went
through the wash or you know you threw
it away because you didn't remember who
it was there are tricks to this have you
ever seen somebody write down on a card
yeah and them a card and they pull out
their pin and write something on it I do
that all the time because I have a
terrible memory and I go to a lot of
conferences so it's hard to remember
everybody that I meet but if I'm talking
about you about something you're
passionate about and you hand me your
business card which we'll talk about in
a moment business cards I can jot down
met at IT Camp Romania discussed
gardening and then when I get home and I
want to follow up which is very
important to follow up I can make note
of that and said enjoy talking about
this topic with you at this conference
and a secret don't let anybody else know
I use my email to keep track of those
things so I can look back at them so if
I meet you in the future and like I
remember talking to them but I don't
remember what I can just search my email
because I followed up with you and I
mentioned what it was and I encourage
you to do that immediately if you get
business cards if you make connections
with people today tonight follow up with
them the longer you wait the less likely
you will be to do it
there's a instinctual tribal aspect to
eating together there's something about
giving someone life-sustaining food
whenever I owe somebody a favor whenever
somebody's done something nice for me or
I just want to connect with someone I
love to feed people also love to eat if
anybody would like to feed me drinking
too is good
I hear the beer here is pretty great I
don't think though I can stress enough
the importance of taking the time to sit
down and eat with someone being sitting
next to them and sharing a meal tells
them not only that I trust this person I
allow them to be near me while I'm
eating which is a very vulnerable thing
instinctually
but it says we belong together or part
of the same tribe so there's a lot of
subconscious aspects to this on that
topic I think it might have been
Benjamin Franklin although he stole some
things that said the best way to make
friends is to ask them to do you favors
because there's a cognitive dissonance
where they say if I'm doing you a favor
I must like you because I wouldn't be
doing you a favor if I didn't like you
something else to keep in mind and as I
mentioned earlier about pain points dig
into the projects they're working on and
this is probably professional but it
could be personal you'd be surprised how
often someone will tell you I've just
been building a website at work and
that's all they want to tell you but if
you asked for more details they might it
might get more interesting you might
find out the things that are struggling
with and as I mentioned earlier it's not
always about being able to help them
directly oftentimes I find it's more
about being able to connect them with
resources or at least tell them there's
nobody in my field that I know of who
can help you with that that's still
valuable information does anybody else
have any aspects that they connect
people something they need they've used
at this conference no okay
it's just some of the questions that I
often asked one of the questions I
wanted to make sure to help focus on was
who else did I talk to if you're
connecting with someone who's who's has
a strong connections in the community
ask them who else you should get to know
you'd be surprised how often once they
understand what your interests are and
what your goals are they know someone
who has similar goals or could help you
along the way this is a great
opportunity to ask about mentoring and I
will say if you ask someone to mentor
you it's best ask them for very specific
things to say I would like for you to
share with me your thoughts on this
topic or I'd like for you to help me
with this project because asking someone
to be your mentor in general is a very
big commitment but asking them to help
you with something in particular it's
much more reasonable yes
as anybody ever answered the question of
what do you like the least about your
work oh sure people love complaining
about their work yeah yeah it might be
about people it might be about their
co-workers it could be a segue into the
fact that they're not really happy at
their job and maybe you know somewhere
that they might want to connect with
yeah yeah I kind of skipped over some of
these questions because I wasn't sure
how much time we were gonna have good
question
so we'll shift from in person to doing
this online I'm sure there are some
other social networks besides the ones I
listed that are good to connect with
people on there might even be some here
that I'm not familiar with has anybody
ever used TripIt I don't know if it's as
common here but in the u.s. it's a great
way to connect with people around
conferences because it lets you know if
you live here in Cluj and you connect
with people at this conference and they
might be returning in the future if you
connect with them on TripIt it will let
you know when they're going to be in
your area and you can ask them out to
dinner or lunch share food with them a
lot of times people will say I don't
want to connect with my professional
network on Facebook because I share
personal things and I don't want them to
see that or I don't want to share
professional things because my family
doesn't want to see that a lot of these
networks have ways to group people and
to target content to certain groups so
off for instance I have an IT group and
I put everyone I connect with in my
professional world in the IT group and
when I have something geeky to share I
target that group because my mother and
grandmother won't understand it and when
I I don't have kids yet but when I
eventually do when I share baby photos I
will exclude the IT group because they
don't need to see my kids well at least
most of them so as I mentioned earlier
people aren't going to know it what
anything about you unless you make sure
they do either by put make putting it
out there on the Internet in some form
that they can consume or telling them so
it's important that we get past
humble and we start being our own
salespeople twitter has declined I think
and usage a bit but it's still a great
way of letting people know what you're
up to every time you go to a session at
a conference it's an opportunity to
tweet in fact you might want to do that
now say well depends on if your employer
would appreciate you being in this
particular session but share going to
this session on functional programming
at IT camp and watching the speaker the
speaker and I in the conference will
both appreciate you mentioning them
they'll probably retweet it and get it
in front of more people and it lets
people know that you're an active
learner your you might find that people
didn't realize you were interested in
functional programming but now they know
that because you're attending a session
so get it visible put it out there and
it's great way to make those networking
connections as well also again you don't
have to be an export expert to
contribute you can simply be encouraging
and supportive of others very often
that's the best way to make
relationships and often overlooked is
capturing a lot of the things we've
talked about the soft skills the thought
leadership in forms like resumes so
let's talk about that for a moment you
might not be able to read this that says
I want my resume to be the one you
remember it's also available a music
video interpretive dance and haiku but
you don't want to make it too creative
or to memorable somewhere between that
this is an actual resume and that is
anybody here have a resume that's just a
collection of skills and experience I
mean mine was well yeah LinkedIn is
definitely a collection of skills but I
know this this was actually my resume
several years ago I considered myself to
be a collection of different
technologies and these are the things
that I could do for you and I was a
consultant so that made some sense
because they wanted me to come in and do
a very specific thing
and this is not a bad approach you can
make a lot of money doing this being a
resource for very specific topics but I
think to be one of the really highly
paid developers it's good to shift away
from this to something more along lines
of this yes we want to communicate our
skills and if we communicate those
skills in the previous form we want to
do it in a way that ties it with our
experience so we list I've been doing
c-sharp for eight years and then in my
work experience every job where I did
that I want to mention this is where I
use the c-sharp but I think the true
value the really senior value is in the
problems you can solve and the ways you
can do it so while many people don't
recommend having an objective or a
summary at the top of your resume I
think when you get to the point where
you have value that's difficult to
capture in these technologies and
languages it's good to have just a
sentence or two at the top to highlight
some of the things that you would bring
to an opportunity or that you could
bring to a problem you'll notice online
and this is not my actual resume it's
something I typed up but I wanted to
focus on my leadership my mentoring my
problem-solving and my interest in
growth and continual improvement because
I want an employer I want a position I
want a project that values those traits
I also didn't want to have the person
looking at my resume have to go through
paragraphs of job information to find
what they wanted I want highlights right
at the top the the general takeaway here
is make sure your most valuable
information the things that are most
vital for someone to see and consume
right there at the top of the resume now
every time I present this someone asks
are you want to keep it to one page
because growing up I was always taught
to keep your resume to one page when was
the last time you printed a paper resume
I mean we email them all the time right
and when you open a digital document you
start from the top and you eventually
say I don't need to read the rest right
again
important things at the top I don't
personally think that the resume needs
to be a certain length I personally I'm
okay if your resume is 20 pages I'm not
gonna read 18 of them but if I need that
reference if I'm looking for something
very specific I might do a quick find in
that document it might be there but this
brings up another point oh that's
different topic this brings up another
point about sharing the things you've
done outside of your professional
experience although it's speaking and
blogging
you've done well blogging is difficult
to capture on a resume except for a link
to your blog but all the community
involvement if you decide to step up
into leadership in your community take
on a user group president role capture
that when you resume as well it conveys
some of those soft skills some of that
character that's important there was
something else I forgot but I'll come
back to it if I remember any questions
or comments we could do a whole session
on resumes I just wanted to touch on it
briefly anybody here have a business
card I would think most people do
anybody or have their own business card
like just for you one of the speaker's
does he knows you might not think about
it but if you meet someone here and you
give them your company's card what
happens next week if you leave that
company you've just wasted that
connection that person I mean they might
be able to find you on LinkedIn but the
point of giving them that card was to
give them a token that had a way to
connect with you and that's been lost so
I'm a big fan of having a basic card not
a card filled with clipart and all the
information about you you can decide
what's important for me there are a few
key things I think you need name email
address in case they want to follow up
with you online a phone number so that
they can follow up with you directly if
they need to reach you urgently or have
a converse
that would be difficult by email and
your website
anybody here own their domain it's like
what I don't know what the currency with
you here but in the u.s. it's like ten
dollars a year it's it's the cost of
lunch to own a domain for a year
everybody should have one because if you
have a professional identity if you're
building a brand this is a place to
collect it all online and then you can
put that domain that you own on your
business card and it can evolve you
don't have to print new cards every time
you get a new social network or change
jobs or change titles in fact I don't
actually put any of that on my card this
is the front of the cards that I
designed it's a little difficult to see
but there's an @ sign between my first
and last name and a.net
at the end because my name is my email
address it's easy to remember well if
you know my last name
and it flows on the back I try to leave
it almost completely blank because the
reason I mentioned earlier I want to
take notes it's not just when someone
hands me a card they're probably not
going to do that so when I hand a card
to someone I write on it met at IT Camp
discuss such and such and then when they
get home and they have that stack of
business cards that people handed them
they're not going to know who most of
them are but they'll know who mine is
also it looks a little different and
notice at the bottom just simple phone
number website so you need sorry
use SSL
so we have a security expert here saying
that's not a secure website that's
correct then again you don't have to log
in either anybody have any other
thoughts on business cards any different
approaches or something you've done yes
I've heard that mentioned several times
has anybody ever taken a business card
with a QR code and scanned it you can
capture I guess your whole contact
information in that code so that's a
great example I've also seen people with
their pictures on their cards if you
want to be recognizable if you want
people to remember your face that's a
great thing to add I'm not saying this
is the only way to go about it it's just
my perspective any other thoughts or
questions in an NFC sure if you want to
get fancy and speaking of getting fancy
don't cheap out on the cards don't print
them at home on your jet printer I would
say don't even go to Kinko's and have
them cut them and print and cut them
order professional cards you think if
this connection is important how many
how many cents how many how much
currency am I willing to spend on this
connection with someone and even
expensive cards are very inexpensive
when it comes to specific ones and if
you don't put too much information on it
you shouldn't have to reprint them very
often any other thoughts or questions on
cards what's that muqaam I have seen
people get some free muqaam yeah and by
the way little tip I like cards with the
rounded up corners because the square
corners get dog-eared and look kind of
dirty and if you stick them in your
pocket and then you hand it to somebody
and it it's all wrinkled up it's not
real great so I try to get ones that
have a nice coating and rounded corners
so let's talk about you get you you
submit a resume they check out your blog
they say this person really knows their
stuff and they want to talk to you and
keep in mind this doesn't have to be a
new employer this can be the place you
work already they know you in a certain
way in a certain job but you might want
to advance
within the same company most of these
same things apply so if you already work
at a company and you're looking to
advance you probably know that company
fairly well but even then you want to be
sure has anybody ever done a search on
the internet for a company before going
in into an interview like if specially
if you use Google there's a news tab and
you can see what that company has been
up to lately
it's really impressive when somebody
walks in and in the discussion they say
yeah I noticed you just released this
new product how's that going well you
actually knew something about this job
it wasn't just an appointment that you
had on your calendar being able to not
only show or one way to show this
knowledge is by asking good questions
not only about what the company is up to
but about your part in the in that
company it shows that you're looking to
invest looking to be part of solutions
looking to help move the company forward
in general and not just be a cog in the
machine and most importantly know who
they're looking for and I'm not just
talking about a job description with
what technology is and what experience
find out who they have on the team and
what they do already has there been
somebody in this position before and
they left and why did they leave maybe
they didn't have certain skills that
they feel are vital the more information
you can gather and oftentimes LinkedIn
is a great place to do this because you
might be connected with somebody who
works there or who's connected with
someone else who works there and you can
ask them this is not a bad thing to be
asking around about a company it shows
that you're proactive that you're
looking for answers I usually take a
moment to see if anybody's had great
successes with interviews but well jump
past this because I think we're running
short on time
specifically in negotiating so you've
you've made a good impression and they
want to talk to you about maybe taking a
new position or taking a new role or
joining the company just like you
research for the interview the company
in general make sure you know what that
position is all about make sure you know
what it pays this is a great opportunity
to talk salary with some air
colleagues know what you want going in
don't let don't base what you want on
what you think they'll offer this is a
buyer or a seller's market right for
talent you should know what you're worth
we talked about that in the beginning
keep in mind you want your image to
match what they're looking for
I'm not saying to pretend you're
different but I'm not going to address
with jeans for a company that expects
ties right it goes beyond that to how
you interact with people whether you're
very formal and how you present your
business card to them whether you're fun
and playful because this is a
environment with a foosball table in the
development room right or pool table
whatever and I feel most of the people I
know they want to be humble humility is
good but you need to be proud of your
accomplishments you need to be able to
say these are some things I've done that
were great and remember we know that
they were great because we measured them
we figured out the value of our
accomplishments we can say it wasn't
just because I thought it was a great
website here's the actual bet value that
it conveyed that it brought to the
employer don't be afraid to say to ask
them what they can pay in fact the first
thing I say when a recruiter brings me
an opportunity is what's the range on
this opportunity I'm not looking for you
to give me a specific number I know
that's dangerous to tell somebody a
specific number is it 60 to 80 80 to 100
like just give me a general idea and
then we can work from there because at
least that lets me know if it's worth
pursuing
but it also lets me know where they're
at if I'm say looking for a job that
pays a hundred of something and their
range is eighty to a hundred I know even
if I get that job I'm already coming in
at the top end am I really going to want
to be there in a year or two when
they're already paying the most that
they really want to pay for that
position
and don't be afraid to provide them a
range as well a lot of times recruiters
and companies will try to ask you what
you make and I'm okay generally we're
telling them because I'm comfortable
with
what I make but if you maybe you're
looking for a pay raise and you feel
like telling them what you currently
make would be bad give them a range I
said well for the past several years I
between in between this number and this
number it doesn't give them a specific
number to shoot for and if they want to
be a good employer they're gonna go for
that upper range and whether it's an
interview or an opportunity that they're
saying we don't want you as a candidate
consider that that's not a permanent no
oftentimes their first choice doesn't
work out because their first choice had
offers from other people and they might
have taken a different job if I'm in an
interview and somebody asked me a
question I don't know that's not a
failure that's an opportunity to follow
up I'll send them an email later and say
you know that question you asked that I
didn't have an answer to I went and
found the answer and I was interested to
find out it was this and most
importantly I was willing to tell you I
don't know I actually have been hired
for a very specific job because they
said I was the only candidate who was
willing to say I didn't know an answer
to the question because they wanted
someone who would fail quickly who would
say I can't figure this out I'm not
gonna spend days churning on this I'm
gonna go to someone else for help I
think one of the biggest hurdles for
people is they are comfortable they
don't want change in their life they're
happy enough right they know there might
be something better but they don't want
to risk it I would encourage you
especially in the industry where in what
the demand we have to be brave and not
be afraid to change oh and I pulled out
one more piece of information from that
report on benefits keep in mind when
you're talking salaries and numbers
there's more to a job than just your pay
one of the most popular benefits at the
moment is flex time flexible working
environment that could be extremely
valuable especially if you have children
how many times would you need to go home
and take care of something yes
what's that oh good question
I don't know I think their relative
percentages but I just pulled this
information off the internet so I'm not
too familiar with it I I will have a
link in the slides to the original
report so you can look at them in more
detail yes
[Laughter]
so sometimes getting what you asked for
is actually a sad event because you
think well if they were that quick to
agree to what I asked for how much more
should I've asked for
that's a good point and also a great
point about Glassdoor especially for
larger companies because the more
employees they have the more reports
they'll have and you can help by going
to Glassdoor and sharing what you make
at your current employer and it'll help
others
so I mentioned taking risks and failing
early most people seem to think that
some people are just successful and
other people aren't and maybe if you
work hard enough you'll succeed and not
fail but the truth is anybody who's
successful has failed over and over and
over you'll hear this from athletes that
they've missed 99% of the shots they
they took or not this point right but
basically I just want to impress on you
figure out how to fail early often and
don't deny your failure don't chase your
losses
don't try to double down on a bad bet
try new things get past your own
emotions recognize when you fail and
learn from it and consider that an
opportunity that's all I have for the
presentation thank you for coming any
questions excellent I think our times up
