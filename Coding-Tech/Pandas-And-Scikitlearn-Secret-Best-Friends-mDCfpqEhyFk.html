why if you have some data scikit-learn
makes it really easy to get a first
model train quickly and so if the
problem is a bit more complicated then
maybe you'll need to do some feature
engineering on that so I love I
especially love scikit-learn spy plane
with a little bit more work I mean the
big thing that most of the code is taken
by a big dictionary that says how to
explore the hyperparameters with a bit
more work you can have like multiple
transformer steps you can train your
model in the proper way that would
actually be a good way to get an
out-of-sample estimate of your models
performance in production and it still
fits on a screen it's amazing but let's
say your data doesn't look like a big
array of number but more like this so
you have dates you have categorical
values correlations between columns and
rows so for that pandas is amazing if
you use pandas and so the question is
can we can we get these two to play
together so can I take my model and just
replace the line at the top with yeah
low complicated retail data set and will
that work well not sure like so pandas
dataframe it's like numpy array aren't
quite the same beast they're pretty
different actually so one way to make
this work is to go back so like I'll
delete the pipeline delete the k-fold
validation and this almost works now if
I add if I convert things to categorical
values then we have a model but we've
lost yeah so and yeah it's not
surprising that this works I mean
dependence stuff is above the line the
scikit-learn stuff is below the line and
you're keeping them really separated and
then you can add whatever you want at
the top and at the bottom for their
respective libraries and that does work
and that's what we used to do but you've
lost a bunch of the nice features
scikit-learn so you've lost five lines
you've lost the ability to do splits
easily so the question is can we do
better and the answer is yes use not to
be the case though
so if you're like me and you've been
trying to get these two to work together
for a little while then you may have
gone through like tried it out in the
past and figure it out oh this this
really wonky this doesn't work and this
talk is basically telling you it's time
to look again and so we'll look at the
two components first splits and the
model selection so the documentation of
scikit-learn is really good but for
these things you kind of have to know
where to look to find the fact that it's
support it's not very well advertised
sadly at least not currently and so this
is the documentation for the Train test
plate function as an example and you
have to kind of read all the way at the
bottom of the the slide to see aloud
inputs are like numpy race a trailer or
pandas dataframe and actually that would
probably also not even show up in
autocomplete so if you're using an IDE
or a jupiter notebook if you do to
complete usually it shows like sequence
of indexable with same length so yeah a
dataframe
is indexable but not in the same way as
an umpire will it work so I looked into
the source code to see exactly what was
happening this is so this is actually
the definition of indexable and you can
see in the middle that if you have this
is called at the beginning of all the
model selection functions to convert
things that are nothing get indexable
and if you see in the middle it supports
data frame it looks for Eyelock and if
it sees that it just passes it through
and this is the other half so if you
have I like you will use it to get the
entities to subset your training set or
data set properly so this works
pipelines
this is the documentation for the fit
method of the pipeline class and you you
read it and you see like the thing that
worried me when I read this you see like
parameters x and y must be iterable that
the doc says and like is this gonna work
again because if you iterate and then
umpire a and append this data frame it
won't give the same kind of results when
will return rows the other columns so I
looked into the source again and
well now this is basically the transform
helper method for the pipeline class but
all the others are similar basically
what's happening under the hood is just
a for loop on all the pipeline steps and
the output of a step is fed into the
input of the next step so anything that
works like that will actually work and
so there's no magic also for work for
writing pendous pipeline steps you just
act you just expect to get a de frame
and input and you learn things in your
fit method and then you apply them
repeatedly in your transfer method so if
we put that all together so as a
combined example yeah we're back pretty
much where we started and actually this
now well almost works there's the thing
in the middle when you still need to
take care of but we can use time series
split which is new splitter in 0.18
because our data set as a date so you
don't want to pass dates and from the
future into the past and it so it
expects your array to be sorted in order
of increasing time so you do that at the
top and the only missing thing is
something to convert your data frame
into a bunch of numbers again but in a
train test perspective so you want to do
it once when you train and then we do
exactly the same thing when you test so
there are a couple of options
picking desk ml actually for this and so
if you pop these two classes here I'll
do the conversion for you in the proper
way and this actually work in is you get
all the benefits now so our experience
at JDI Labs using this we've been using
this for a couple years it's worked out
really nicely we started using it in the
beginning mostly for the pipelines
because that's a really nice way to
structure things and try many kinds of
different transformation steps we
couldn't use pleather in the past
because we have more complicated data
with time relationships and that wasn't
well supported before 0.18 but actually
now with the new splitter interface we
could at start using it
and we wrote our own code to do the
transformation from pandas dataframe the
dummy encoding but don't do that there's
no reason to do that anymore there
couple libraries that are starting to
pop up for that and so in summary use at
least scikit-learn 0-16 one preferably
0:18
for splits anything pandas like will
work for pipelines in theory as long as
each step accepts the output of the next
you're fine
in practice you'll probably want to put
all your pandas transform at the
beginning convert into all numerical
numpy array and then any all numerical
steps after that pc etc and then the
actual model and writing pandas based
transform is pretty much the same as
writing and numpy one except for the
input
so one go over the next few slides but
they're here for reference so if you
want to dig further there's some of the
relevant change log entries for this
some of the relevant commits some
related projects like desc ml is really
nice and is supporting if you want need
to parallel ice things you have a look
at it but also it supports explicitly
pandas dataframes so you can use it if
you were ready to handle the
dependencies other useful project still
missing is a library of transforms for
pandas dataframe so you'll tend to write
a couple of small helper classes maybe
they'll come one day although the
there's a in 0:17 there's a function
transformer function the preprocessor
that will help you just need to pass
validate files and if you're from the
future then maybe the situation will be
better there's an open issue to improve
the dock this is my personal website
where the talk will be posted later and
JD Labs is hiring also thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
