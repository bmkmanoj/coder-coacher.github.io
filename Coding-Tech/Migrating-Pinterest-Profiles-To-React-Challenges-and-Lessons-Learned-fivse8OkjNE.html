to be here
Paris is a beautiful city I'm from San
Francisco and my name is Ahmad le Effie
I am a software engineer on web core
experienced team at Pinterest I started
using a react about three four years ago
when I was at Facebook and one of the
projects that I've been working on last
year is react migration and today I'm
going to tell you a story of our journey
to react we'll take a look into
challenges we faced and techniques we
used while migrating interest profiles
to react if you have any questions
please make a note and I'll be happy to
answer them in the end so today's
presentation is broken into four major
parts and the first one is about why we
choose and react and why we had to
migrate from the existing framework at
all and the second part is about how we
prepared our infrastructure before we
were able to build something in react
the third part is one of the most
exciting parts for me is about a/b
testing and UI experiments basically
I'll tell you how we were measuring the
impact and how we were making sure that
the newly created react components and
the whole architecture works better than
the old one and the last part will be
about where we are at now basically I'll
tell you how our developer experience
changed after adoption of the react so
why react and why we had to move from
the existing framework at all and the
old framework was introduced in 2013
with a major redesign at Pinterest and
this framework was based on
object-oriented JavaScript paradigm and
uses component base the Iraqi it's very
similar to many other frameworks that
were introduced three four or five years
ago and you may still find something
similar in your projects but nowadays
Denzel is outdated and basically all the
modern frameworks are fantastic compare
what we had before and one of the
biggest questions why we actually choose
and react and not decided to migrate to
angular meteor or knockout ember or any
other frameworks and as I mentioned
before all the
modern frameworks are fantastic compare
what we had before and building single
page web applications nowadays is much
easier we had a list of requirements for
the new framework and you can see them
on the slide the very first one was
having large developer community and
reacted as a huge developer community
and we're excited to be part of this
developer community
the second requirement was designed
patterns and we try to find framework
which has design patterns that are very
compatible with the existing stack which
makes the migration much easier the
third requirement is isomorphic
rendering and it's very important for us
to have a solution for isomorphism and I
will tell you I will tell you later why
this is so important for us the first
one is performance and we did bunch of
tests and benchmark benchmarking and we
realized that react performing is very
well and you probably all know about
virtual Dom that helps us to prevent a
lot of performance bottlenecks and
issues in the last requirement was
developer experience and our developer
experience has changed a lot after
adoption of react so this is our old
stack nothing too crazy you can see
Python jungle web server ginger render
on the on the server side nunchuks on
the client side the web app is powered
by backbone and probably you all of you
are familiar with this stack and using
something similar but having all of
these and being on board with web pack
module bundler just unit tests many
other frameworks and tools has changed
our life a lot and developer experiences
is completely different now so just to
give you an example of scale that we
operated we have 175 millions of monthly
active users which is more than
population of the biggest country in the
world Russia we serve 150,000 requests
per second and this is just to give you
the example of scale that we operated
so now let's talk about migration paths
to react and since we're constantly
shipping features and we're running
hundreds of experiments simultaneously
we can stop development process in order
to rebuild the whole web app from
scratch and react and while it's
relatively easy to rebuild a whole build
the whole web app in react from scratch
migrating a service which is constantly
changing and has millions of users is a
much more complicated challenge it's
like changing engines of an airplane
while you're a mid-flight how many of
you have tried to ride a web app from
scratch before I think a lot of hands I
tried to do this before and it was a
nightmare ended up in a situation where
I had two web apps that I had to support
simultaneously the old one which is
still in production and product
engineers are constantly changing in
shipping features in the new one which
is still under development process and
you kind of have to port all these newly
created features to the new one and it's
like constant race condition not a
pleasant situation to be so how can we
avoid this and the only way to avoid
this is to rewrite our web app piece by
piece while the rest is still run by the
old framework thus will not have to
implement features in two places and
will not have to stop the development
process so we're coming to this idea of
so-called hybrid app it's an app where
two frameworks coexist together for a
certain period of time in this period of
time is a time of migration from the old
framework to the new one
and how can we make this hybrid app and
the very first thought maybe it's not
that complicated but let's take a look
in the into the list of all possible
challenges so first of all react is a
JavaScript framework and how many of you
have JavaScript server-side rendering on
the server side only few hands and it's
not a very common thing yet and but
having JavaScript rendering in languages
like
Python PHP or Java or anything else is
not common at all and the very first
step we had to do is to prepare our
infrastructure before we could actually
build something in react so and for for
that purpose we had to enable JavaScript
rendering on the server-side some of you
may ask a good question why do you
actually need a server-side an
isomorphic or universal rendering in our
web app and there is two reasons the
very first one is that our engineers
will not have to build their templates
twice basically we build one template
and works on the server side and the
client side you save a lot of
engineering time and the second reason
is SEO
even though nowadays search engines that
can execute JavaScript and they can
render pages that are single page web
apps it's still better for SEO purposes
to send the initial markup as an HTML
the second challenge is to render newly
created react components inside of the
old frameworks and inside of your old
framework and template language and even
though react is very flexible in terms
of rendering there is still might be
challenges for example what if your
templates are starting in separate files
or what if your template language is a
custom built language which which is not
exist like in JavaScript and such
example is ginger templates on the
server side in Python and nunchucks on
the client side the third challenge is
reusing the existing data sources and
API layer library so basically more
likely we have something that is built
on top of Ajax requests which does all
the communication with the API and you
probably really want to reuse this
library at least for the first period of
time unless you really want to migrate
everything at once which actually a
little bit too complicated so how can we
make sure that we can reuse and and feed
the data from the server side an API and
the last challenge is measuring the
impact how can we make sure that the
newly created architecture and react
components actually work better than the
old ones and what if we introduced some
performance
or what if we introduced box how can we
make sure that we can address all these
issues and how can we make sure that we
can measure the impact so here we'll
outline our four main challenges and now
let's dive deeper into each of those and
let me give you a very high-level
overview of our web app architecture and
you can see there is nothing too crazy
birthing junga web server back an API we
have user agent and whenever user agent
sends a request to our Python Django web
server eat it renders the whole HTML and
sends it back to to the user agent so
after that browser bounce a bunch of
additional requests in order to obtain
all the assets like JavaScript CSS
images and etc so once the web app is
initialized all the subsequent requests
are sent only in order to obtain
additional data from the API so
basically we render only the very first
page on the back end and all subsequent
renders are happening on the client side
in the web app which is powered by
backbone and the old framework so now
let's talk about a little bit about
ginger and nunchucks these two
templating languages are very similar
almost identical and they led us to have
so-called isomorphic rendering ginger is
a Python version and nunchuks is
JavaScript version the only caveat of
this approach was that we had to have
two sets of libraries and utils and
whenever someone adds a library or
utility we had to test it twice
implemented in two places not the best
approach
also on this side you can see a code
snippet which is a non Jax or ginger
templating language is anyone familiar
with nan jacks or ginger at all
a few people quite a bit yeah that's
good so you can see it's nothing crazy
really common templating language and
you can see here we're setting
three variables and if greeting a name
is empty it will fall back to hello and
guests so you can see a new line and two
curly braces basically it will execute
the template and it will render if there
is breeding and guests empty it will
render hello guests welcome to Pinterest
now you can see we have a module call
and module is actually a function call
so basically what it does it will find a
home feed module it will fill it with
the options that are passed in and it
will render the whole feed module for
you
and does this architecture look familiar
for you at all react people what do you
think so it seems like the whole the
whole process of the rendering fits very
well to the reactor architecture what we
do here with reading properties we we do
call a child module home feed with
passing all the properties into it and
seems like they feed were well into each
other but how can we render react in
Python and for that purpose is a very
first step we introduced a node.js
sidecar a standalone service which is
which what it does it just renders
nunchuks and our templates on the server
side thus it will unblock server-side
rendering and our engineers will not
have to migrate everything at once
that's why it's so important and as a
bonus we'll be able to use the same
utilities and libraries and there will
be no more duplicating sets of utilities
and libraries so here we have a plan for
our migration and is the very first step
we're moving from ginger in Python
nunchucks on the client to nunchucks on
the server and on the client and from
that we can move on
now let's take a look our how our
service at rendering used to work before
introducing node.js sidecar
as you can see we have the old
architecture Python django web server
ginger rendering engine on the server
side and once user agent sends a request
our Python jungle web server will start
the rendering process and there's a very
first step it will send a request to the
back-end API in order to retrieve the
initial data - for the template when the
data comes back ginger renderer will see
really render our components tree as far
as it can go until additional data is
needed worst to mention that this
process is CPU blocking
there is nothing else can be done in
this process so we see really render our
module tree and when we need additional
data we'll send another request then we
continue rendering of the tree we go as
far as we can go until the until
additional data is needed again and this
process repeats over and over until it's
fully rendered and we send back the
resulting HTML now let's take a look
what what happened after introducing
node.js sidecar as you can see in this
layout we introduced injects proxy layer
we have no GS workers and the whole
process starts with the same thing we
send the request to our Python jungle
web server then we obtain the initial
data from the API for our template and
here where it becomes different we send
a request to our node.js servers which
go through balancing layer and we're
starting rendering our tree we render a
tree as far as we can go and two
additional data is needed then we
request additional data and now we send
multiple requests we send one request
for each sub tree in order to continue
rendering process so as you can see now
the rendering is not CPU blocking any
more we can paralyze this process and
the responses can't come back come back
independently as well so then we
continue our rendering process we
something wrong with the colliculus
sorry here you go then we continue our
rendering process we request additional
data from the API and we render our tree
as far as we can go until it's fully
rendered and then we send back the
resulting HTML to the user agent as you
can see this process is very similar to
what we had before but now we're using
node.js standalone service and this the
rendering process is not blocking CPU
blocking anymore also this approach can
be used in any other language we use it
in Python but if you use PHP Java or any
other programming language and obviously
having JavaScript and all these
languages is not a very common thing you
can use similar approach in order to get
JavaScript rendering on the service side
so now at this point we solved our first
challenge and we have nine Jack's
on the server and on the client and we
can start building and migrating our
components once we are able to render
JavaScript on the server side we can
solve our second challenge and figure
out how can we render react components
inside of the old framework and
templating language and let me give you
a little bit of a context about Denzel
Denzel is a object-oriented JavaScript
library it uses approaches that were
very common like three five years ago
and there's still a lot of them exist
and on this slide you can see Denzel
module Co and a react component Co as I
mentioned before if you remember module
is a function call it will find and
render them sell module dens helping in
this case the same with component but it
fall back to react rendering so in order
to empower our engineers to
migrate our service incrementally we
introduced a react specific bindings
with the keyword component that
represents the bridge between Denzel and
react so on this slide you can see a
simplified version of things I'll react
bridge and let's take a quick look how
it works once nunchucks render means a
component keyword it will render it in
gel react bridge instead the bridge in
its turn will read all the options and
forgive flow figure out the name of the
react component and its properties it
will pass all these options to the
properties to the react component and it
will render react component inside of
its own container element so to
basically override its own so this is
very simple technique but very handy and
you can use it in many other template
templating languages and some of you
some of you may ask question how
actually react to reuse services
rendered mark-up on the client-side and
this is one of the very cool features of
react basically whenever react is render
on the server side it will add a
checksum to its marked its own markup
and once the web app on the client is
initialized it will render its own it
will render itself inside of its own
virtual Dom it's not the regular down
but virtual Dom which is very fast it
will render and generate another
checksum if these checksums are
identical then we can reuse martin the
markup and we can reattach itself to the
existing markup that's we will not have
to replace the existing markup which
will lead to a lot of free flickering
and other performance issues you
probably would notice it so this is one
of the cool features of the react so now
we can talk about third challenge and
dealing with the old API layer and the
library which does all the data
communication with the API for you
and for that purpose we use harder
components or simply hoc and hoc is a
very powerful technique the definition
is it's a function that takes a
component and returns another component
it's a powerful technique that lets you
to reuse components logic while
remaining them composable I know that
might sound a little bit tricky but
let's take a look at the example so on
this side on the left hand side you can
see a harder component with the resource
and on the right side you can see an
example of usage of this harder
component and we use hoc in many places
but the main one is dealing with the old
resources so here what happens on
component did mount lifecycle and it's
basically one component is added to the
Dom it will create a resource and send a
request to the API once the data comes
back a callback function will update its
own state with the newly received data
this will trigger rendering of the hoc
component which will actually trigger
rendering of the subject component with
this approach you can keep your
components and data in sync all the time
so it's pretty powerful but pretty
simple and very handy technique you can
use it like anywhere whatever you want
to deal with with any data sources and
layers so at this point we can render
JavaScript on the server we can build
react components and we can supply data
for them now let's take a look into the
last enforce challenge and the fourth
challenge is how can we measure the
impact and how can we make sure that
newly created react components are
actually performing better than the old
ones
and with 175 millions of users we roll
out things very carefully we want to
make sure that newly created UI is
actually performs better than the old
one for that purpose we're using a be
testing framework
and we have framework code gatekeeper
how many of you are familiar reviews a B
testing frameworks before I can see some
hands that's good if you have something
similar in your project that will be
super handy migrations like that so a B
testing frameworks are usually used to
measure the impact of your UI and for
testing new features and things like
that on this slide you can see a
simplified version of experiment setup
basically we check if user passes react
experiment check then we render a newly
created react component pin and
otherwise we'll fall back to the Oh
Denzel component now
let's that let's take a look more deeply
into how we set up experiments on this
slide you can see that at some point and
on some Denzel note we for call logic
based on the experiments check and the
whole right subtree is fully rendered in
Denzel and the left one is fully
rendering in react it's important to
notice that we don't have Denzel calls
from react so once you migrated to react
there is no way to go back this is a
conscious decision we made that helps us
to make migration much more cleaner and
well that you can imagine what would
happen if you will allow people to call
themselves inside of react and then vice
versa so it would be total mess
you don't want to do this so because of
that we have to migrate everything from
the very leaves into the very top we
call this bottom-up approach and as I
mentioned before it makes the migration
much more cleaner and well thought also
it worse to mention that more likely you
want to run your experiments at maximum
per page level you don't want to run
experiments your old web up against the
new one otherwise you have too many
factors affecting your metrics and you
will never figure out where the metric
drops are coming from and also for the
same reason you really want to run
your experiments exclusively you don't
want two different different experiments
to affect your metrics in the user in
the different ways so this is a very
important part and later on we can log
into our experiment dashboard and check
our experiments again such metrics as a
user wait time engagement metrics
performance metrics error rate and so on
and so forth on this slide you can see a
screenshot of our experiment dashboard
there is a small subset of metrics and
here you can see search engagement
metrics and on the right side there is a
lot of squares which represent the
metric how it works if it goes up or
down or neutral so basically the blue
the blue squares means that we have some
improvement and which is good
the red ones that means that we have a
drop the gray ones means that's neutral
or not statistically significant and
running experiments during any migration
is very critical as I mentioned before
even if you have a really good test
coverage if you even if you have outer
tests unit tests or manual testing you
unlikely you'll cover all the edge cases
and corner cases for example what if
your bag exists in countries with poor
internet connection or in a different
languages so catching all of these with
tests is really hard but with experiment
dashboard you'll always see a drop and
if you see dropping user engagement
maybe there is a bug or maybe there is a
performance issues and you'll get the
signal that will help you to investigate
Pinterest profiles was the very first
user heavy page that was successfully
converted to react and during react
migration of interest profiles we've
seen consistent performance and engaged
improvements for example such metrics as
Dom interactive responds and/or board
page views were improved by 20% and
these 20% were gained only from gears
and infrastructure change without any
design changes I think this is pretty
cool and while we're converting
Pinterest profiles to react our product
engineers were able to continue
development process and making changes
in many other pieces of our website and
finally all of these leads to a
completely new developer experience so
now we don't have duplicating libraries
in nan jacks and ginger anymore we
actually don't have non Jack's anymore
and it makes and boarding much easier
because people don't have to learn then
Jack's at all we have single language on
the client and on the server side which
helps even more and the last but not the
least we have with now we are part of
the large developer community and we
don't need to create all these wiki
pages or engineers can go online and
find everything in the well-crafted
documentation so it's been a long
journey but we're excited to be a part
of react community thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
