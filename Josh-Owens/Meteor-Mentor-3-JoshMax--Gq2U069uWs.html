it's the third right i miss the first so
the third meteor mentor session for our
group you get a full group today so yeah
I don't know last week we just kind of
talked I guess is that what you guys
want to do now ah yeah works for me okay
well good start it yeah anyone got any
questions very always seem so a lot of
questions I way to put me on the spot
there tom uh yeah actually something
I've been playing around with this um
have you ever done any sort of like a be
split testing with your website um not
necessarily within meteor itself but
I've so I like um have you used hot
shower I know I've not heard of that hot
jar is kind of interesting it doesn't do
a be split testing but it does record
the visitor on your site and you can see
like it leaves a mouse trailers to go
through the page you can see where they
click and you get a little video
recording afterwards so that's kind of
interesting I do i do have that
installed um yeah I guess that's about
it for me as far as a testing goes is
anyone else done a/b testing this is the
way are you show different different
users different content right and then
you see you you know now only dabbled a
little bit and eat with Google you can
define some things later on would google
it a little bit mmhmm yeah now I was
just playing around with you know react
components and I use like Mixpanel for
different analytics and stuff so I was
just trying to wire in you know give
users a random a or b variable and then
they
get served that component when they use
the use the website and then mixpanel
will just record their different what
they see yeah you know I mean I
definitely heard of people using like
optimizely or google has its own set up
you can use as well to kind of mod the
page on site but yeah I think you're
gonna use it with react you set up
sounds good to me yeah well keep playing
with that let you guys know turns it up
yeah I think the key there is just
making sure that you're like tracking
the metrics correctly so just kind of
right test it like that's always the
hardest part I think a baby testing is
making sure you're getting your
measurements right I was listening to
the entrepreneurs podcast the other day
and they were talking about running an
a/b test and like they were comparing
their striped numbers to their baby test
numbers and like stripe was vastly
different saying that they brought in
vastly different income than what they
were seeing conversion wise in the a/b
tests so that was kind of interesting oh
yeah no I've definitely found them very
very important to my testing stuff
because they make assumptions and they
show me that things are very different
from those assumptions okay yeah yeah
yeah I would agree like they were is
really interesting episode cuz they were
talking about like pricing difference
they were selling training course at 99
or 149 and they were trying to see what
the income difference was all right
who's got the next question ok so I get
a more you know general opinion kind of
question and I mean everybody's
following development of mantra of
course mm-hmm space space kitty redwood
I don't know what else you got more than
these
personally I haven't used any of them
but I would read about them they pop up
everywhere basically oh and um I was
wondering have you had a look into these
different frameworks butch opinion on
that like starting fresh with the
framework or starting fresh be you own
stack basically yeah i've i've been
watching mantra um kind of closely and I
wouldn't say like there's a few pieces
that are different right like he he
suggests using react composer which he
wrote um I don't know we talked about a
little bit in the podcast like to me I
think it's interesting uh that he's
doing it and I also think that there's
value at least in in mantra because he's
building applications and extracting out
that knowledge of building that
application into something like mantra
and that's super interesting to me what
is the team of meteor like they're
building a framework and they're not
really using that framework like now
that they're running galaxy they're
starting to support applications that
are being built but they're not they're
still not really building applications
themselves you know they're just
building a framework and so I think
sometimes that that can feel like maybe
not not the greatest path you know I
guess so I i think if nothing else it'll
make the meteor ecosystem better because
you know we're starting to have debates
over why do it this way or can we do it
that way there's a thread on github
right now where they're talking about
what is you know since mix-ins are going
away and react what does using react
look like in a 1.3 world or after 1.3
and you know they're going to do a mix
in and probably come up with some kind
of like container composer api and
there's discussion around like should
they just use react composer and
they actually ran some experiments and
just yesterday or this morning decided
like yeah they're not going to do that
they're going to probably write their
own thing that'll be closer to what they
already had so but i think that like
things like mantra encourage that
discussion to happen hmm it says i'm
gonna use that ha you gonna use that
mantra yeah you're right yeah um well i
mean i'm i'm pretty pretty daggone close
right now in the app i'm building I mean
it's meteor but I'm like pulling in
quite a few like I've got react
composure and flow router and what's the
other one he's got the react mounter so
I'm using quite a bit of that um but I
you know the other part of it is really
just like some packages and then like
some guidelines to follow so it's not
it's not like a full stack this is it's
weird hmm you know I have been I've been
reading the the forums on this mantra
and and I'm just I'm just my my thinking
is I just want to beat for few months
it's couple of months before everything
settles down then kind of dig deep
because a lot of these things it does
take some time so so that those are my
thoughts I mean I've been following
those forum forum threads and it's
pretty it's pretty interesting that he's
doing all this stuff yeah I would you
know I would i would probably disagree
with that a little bit i would say like
if you want to learn the to me the best
way to learn is to just start doing and
you know i mean this the thing is if you
wait to get started on something because
things feel uncertain like I don't think
they're gonna feel any more certain six
months from now like we're going to be
talking about something else right like
we're gonna at some point we're going to
start playing with reactive graph ql and
that's gonna feel uncertain and things
won't be settled out but I you know the
best way to learn is just by doing in my
opinion right right
okay and I you know I maybe this is
gonna bite me in the butt but like I've
got a class that I'm giving in two weeks
on I guess almost a week now on 1.3 with
modules and react and all that kind of
stuff and like I've probably got to make
a choice to teach the class react
composer because whatever is going to
come in 1.3 or 1.4 isn't going to be out
yet from meteor so you know I have to go
back and redo that class later or at
least that section of the class later so
okay all right I know Nils doesn't have
audio but no here we go I was gonna say
he should add a question so he just
asked I've been I built an app where
users can create products images + data
when I developed locally i have access
to Mongo via msn mango great super easy
but what once the app is published and a
user just creates a random product with
an inappropriate image how do you take
care of this one strap is deployed ah
yeah this is this is an annoying problem
right like like we started getting spam
on crater and you know I think that's
maybe part of the question like how do
you deal with that and with crater we
have an admin interface and I think
maybe that's the easy answer um you
could throw together like yogi been
admin and just point it like an app
using yogi been admin and just pointed
at the same database and probably get an
easy admin interface going if that makes
sense I did a similar thing I've got a
blog post on it um that's probably the
fastest way to maybe resolve that issue
and get inside into your database the
other is if you're using something like
compose you you do get access to like a
graphical command line where you can
query data stuff
that's also dislike problem on go hmm
yeah Mongo chef yeah I use Robo Mongo
myself and you can connect it to a
publicly open Mongo database with your
same connection string that your apps
using and that would allow you to kind
of dive into that data but I you know I
think in the case of like inappropriate
images that's going to be maybe an
annoying way to look at that so I would
I would maybe look at more of the admin
interface kind of direction true the
other thing you know if you find that
you're dealing with inappropriate images
too it's less of a maybe about an
obvious thing like you you don't always
have to code your way around it one that
one thing that I did to stop spam on
crater which it seems maybe they're
finding a way around it now but um it's
you know we track karma and so when you
leave a comment you get upvoted you get
you get positive karma for that up vote
and you have to get enough karma to be
able to post so one thought is like make
them go through some kind of tutorial
give them points and then you know only
let them post things once I get those
points like I find spammers don't want
to jump through too many hoops to to do
something like that I don't know you're
dealing with spammers are just idiots
all right what was quite annoying on
crater nice i've seen that I mean you
have that automatic twitter bot right
and all of this all of a sudden I had
all these twitter messages for watch
this movie or watch that movie or
something like that I was really me yes
it was super annoying try being the one
catching it all like every day I was
getting up and deleting everything and
trying to clear it out but I honestly I
think Google and Twitter both penalized
me for that happening so like my google
and twitter traffic drop dramatically
damn
yeah spammers stammers so I got another
one when following the forums you always
come you know you read about forks like
community forks of meteor and stuff are
you generally in favor of such a
community for which you contribute I
mean I bread pieces here and there that
you know pull requests aren't finding
their way in quickly enough into the
core and stuff like that in the
community for would surely make this
much easier what's your thought on that
I'm sorry can you repeat part of that
yeah of course got interrupted here
sorry um while reading the forums you I
always come across posts where people
suggest having meteor forks like
community forks and since I you know you
can't help but notice that pull requests
aren't finding their way in to meet your
core as quickly as they potentially
could so I was just wondering what was
your one what your thoughts on a
community forum be yeah actually uh well
I mean likely i would probably
contribute i don't know i mean like it's
it's weird right because the number one
the package ecosystem allows you to kind
of accomplished quite a bit i think that
for me contributions are usually because
i find a particular bug or something
like so super useful that i want to jump
through the hoops of getting a pull
request in um but i don't know you know
it's tough like I i well I say that
things like they move too slow at the
same time I feel like they're very mdg
is very deliberate and the things that
they do put out and I do think that it's
of a higher quality and there's a lot
more thought put into the why of
building this stuff and so even though
they're not building apps i do think
that they do build super clean api's my
opinion
um and for me I I would rather I mean
you could do a fork right and i think
that's totally acceptable and media
itself even has a way to accomplish this
and so you can create your own release
track and put it out there and you can
tell meteor to use that net release
track essentially and it's it doesn't
have to be blessed by anyone so if you
look at like velocity and how it was
working for probably seven or eight
months it they actually had a fork of
meteor that they were maintaining that
had like instrumentation and so
basically you'd fire up meteor your
meteor app and then it would fire up a
second meteor app but that second media
app would actually use the velocity fork
and you know they had velocity stuff in
there that was specific to like being
able to run the test and wipe out and I
think that was totally fine but the
reason velocity went away is because it
became hard to maintain right like that
came out with 1.1 and then they were
maintaining it and then 1.2 came out
broke a bunch of stuff they had to like
go rework all their patches and it would
like they had a pull request out that
was never getting accepted and so they
just decided to abandon that whole
process because they weren't they
weren't really getting that accepted in
and you know it feels may be
disheartening to have to keep that
long-running pull request accurate and
workable especially when big pieces the
system might change hmm so for for me I
think the the better tactic and the
tactic I've been trying to take is let's
figure out how we get pull request
accepted in more easily and so I had a
poor request accepted last week that
outlined like who's in charge of
different areas of the application and
so now it becomes clear if you're
working on something for blaze or you're
working on something for the data team
like you can get the right people
involved in the conversation if you're
going to have a pull request and I think
that's
the hardest part like I didn't know like
I I have a ProQuest that still out there
from May it just adds something for
blaze it has tests it has documentation
as like everything needs to be good to
go and like a longest time I didn't even
know who to talk to about getting it
merged like you had plenty of Plus Ones
on it but like who's in charge of
accepting blaze pull requests that was
never super armies but that's getting
better and they've it looks like they've
a tentative lee agreed to creating a
meteor community github repo and going
forward we're going to have some
discussion around like how does the
community contribute to meteor in an
effective way and there's going to be a
lot of discussion around that happening
in that github repo okay that's exciting
to me good question how many full-time
core developers are there in MTG let me
know mmm no because I don't know I
update their website super often if I
had to guess I'd say it's somewhere
around 10 to 12 um yeah on meteor itself
I also think they have additional
developers that are on galaxy so yeah
you know you have guys like Zoltan who's
working full-time on galaxy so about
this forking meteor basically if you if
it can't have seven full-time developers
working on that fork it's not really
feasible to have a fork because at some
point MDGs material and the for me but
dutiful basically so I don't think it's
a maintainable strategy to have a fork I
you know I would tend to probably agree
along those lines
like you can see if you go look in the
forms you can see Abigail talking about
it and they're building their own kind
of fork of meteor that's more I guess
compliant with how the like HIPAA
compliance stuff works here in the US
and so they want a litter goal is to
make it easier to build applications for
the medical industry in the US and you
know it sounds you know if you find some
of her more recent posts it sounds like
it's actually kind of hard to maintain
all that and so I think that yeah I i
I'd really want to have a good reason to
do it if I were going to do it or you
really have to feel like you're gonna
split off from meteor if you're gonna do
it for real I guess yeah so I have this
question I'm reading your email list and
basically you published about
microservices I think that was like last
week or two weeks ago yeah so I was
wondering what is what is your did you
use any testing framework because like
was it any any testing framework for
micro services because you're looking at
the apt level are you breaking up loll
so how does well it's a different I
think yeah so I think that you're gonna
have two different kind of levels of
testing here and when you look at a
micro service and what you're doing
you're you're essentially creating an
API and so you're really talking about
creating API tests and going that route
so you know you can you can use
something like chimp and mocha and
you're basically like for the micro
services that I've built right so that
that article I was talking about was
really just I don't it's borderline like
is if microservices like a lot of people
said it wasn't because you're sharing a
database and that's right like an
anti-pattern so I mean if you go that
route you really
test apps separately in my opinion
especially in that case like the admin
app I didn't even bother to test it um
the main app is tested but the admin app
is just there for me to like put in
content and stuff and so it's just me
using it I didn't see a reason to test
it but when I think about the other
microservices app that I built I
actually split it out so that dealing
with other API services became much
easier right and so like I've got one p1
microservice that deals with scanning
the network back Apple TVs and I've got
another application that well that was
so that one scans for a positions it
also handles doing like requests so like
it'll tell the apple TV 2 stream
something right and so that microservice
just deals with the apple TV piece and
the way that i would go about testing
that is to test that the publications
are working the way that I expected I
would test that the methods or working
the way that I expected and just leave
it at that and then if you want to go
deeper what you could do is in the main
application you could write a test that
says like I click this button and this
whole thing should happen but I think
that gets much harder to test because
you're gonna have to have all those apps
running in order to test them so at that
point you're either looking at mocking
out that piece of the application to do
the n10 testing or you're going to have
a more complex testing set up that says
you know I've got all these apps running
I think that it's got one main app with
four side apps billed as microservices
so testing that would be maybe a little
more difficult than you want but i think
you know if you're if you have clean
demarcation points but in your code
right like i know that i'm going to
press this button and it's going to make
a meteor method call to this API service
over there as long as I know this API
service over there is tested correctly
and works and you know I've tested that
hitting the button is going to make the
call then I think maybe you're okay you
don't have to go super deep with it if
that makes sense I think I've muted you
there you might wanna unmute oh yeah
thanks um so the other question I how
was when i was reading your article when
it's kind of so we talked about micro
services and i'm still trying to get get
my head around and so when you are
trying to think about a nap and deciding
whether you have to use micro services
or not like how many microservices is
going to be enough for example or how
many microservices you think you think I
don't because beyond certain point is
going to be pretty hard to maintain I
think I'm assuming you don't reckon I
mean it's not super hard to maintain
right it's like it's I look at it as
like a code modularity thing you know I
can I can specify that I don't need to
care about scanning the network for
apple tvs in my main app and I that code
lives in one small folder itself and its
it's maybe got like a hundred lines of
code in it and it's just accomplishing
that one thing for me it's keeping track
of the Apple TV's on the network it's
keeping that in a Mongo database that's
separate from my main application I can
make a call and get that data and it'll
show up in my main application on the
client if I need it and i can make
meteor method calls to kind of control
that side of the application if i want
and so if i look at it the application
is split in two you know I've got the
appletv scanner I've got another one
that will scan a folder for movies I've
got another one that scans a folder for
TV shows and it keeps those bits of
information and metadata in those
databases right and they're not in my
main database and then I've got another
one that will set up you just give it a
file and it'll set up a stream like a
HTTP stream so you can watch the movie
or the TV show and so these are
I've ripped blue rays onto a hard drive
and then they're available to all my
Apple TVs and then lastly I've got the
main application which kind of ties it
all together and you know you it handles
login it handles you know pulling in the
DDP like subscription stuff so I can see
all the data and it handles like just
orchestrating all the calls between the
different services but the thing that I
gained from that is the fact that like I
can independently work on one micro
service so let's say like the HTTP
streaming portion of the app is working
great I can leave that up and running
and I can actually leave it up and
running on on another box I've got like
the box under my desk that's running
Linux that's running that streamer and
it has all the files on the hard drive
whereas like the Apple TV stuff didn't
work on linux so it runs on a different
machine and it handles talking to the
apple tv's and you know if if i need to
work on the movie cataloging portion of
that the micro service like i can go
work on that and i don't have to worry
about disrupting anyone that's streaming
a movie in my house because the apple TV
and the HTTP streaming portion live in a
different service and are deployed
elsewhere and you know i can update
those independently so you kind of get
this control of like parts of your site
still function just fine even though you
may have a breakage if that makes sense
okay yeah that's really cool I have
another question if I may jump in yeah
general topic is logging stuff yes so is
their services like Lockley or whatever
wins Winston has a lot of transports I
think lovely is one of them or paper
trail or
any of those um do you use them honestly
I haven't used them but I have we've had
this conversation a couple times in the
space dojo slack chat room and log Lee
and and Winston seemed to be the two
that come up the most i've also heard
logstash mentioned but i don't knit
that's not really I don't think that's a
hosted service I think you can get
hosting for a log stash but that that's
also another option so yeah I don't know
no I haven't really had a need to use
those but I could I could certainly see
like how do you how do you do it then
you just put everything in the console
or trace errors how um that's a good
question yeah I think for now like you
know this really is an interesting
question because we do the one
production app and I'm still kind of
involved with uh we do have trouble
because the logs like the logging
situation isn't great there and so I
think that's the point we're at right
now like we're starting to add more
logging in but the the logging like it's
it's a complex app so there's Drupal and
then there's a node app that sits in
between Drupal meteor and then there's
the meteor app and we could probably do
a better job of like getting the logging
going on on the meteorite better but
they've so that like I'm the meteor side
of the team and the Drupal side of the
team has been working on like getting
better logs and and then they're trying
to get alerting to go on with with the
with the logging now and so like it'll
send alerts to slack to say like hey
this this problem just happened I would
say for now like we've mostly relied on
Khedira and Khedira air tracking to
maybe help us track down issues but
that's still not super helpful because
the files are minified and so when you
get the when you get the back trace back
it's like not easy to figure out what
happened necessarily because like the
location in the code is different
for production than it is for
development yeah true i found this was
really hard using Khedira so far also
some arrows show up and like two or
three times like different some say just
okay something happened and a bit more
detail and you don't know if it's the
same one or if it's a different one and
yeah it's really not not easy to to get
a hang of their client sites arrest I
think for the for the server side you
know what's funny straightforward oh I
would suggest using Winston it's super
easy and now 1.3 is it for me I just
imported the NPM package and then there
doc you pink documentation is very clear
and you just plug in where you need
logging and it just goes to a little
file and then that helps my or i'm
debugging flow what not accept a lot
smoother so yeah yeah i gotta say like
I'm really digging 1.3 with the MPN
module support that they have now pretty
awesome well one thing that actually
brings up is some of these services like
SendGrid or Mixpanel where i have to use
an API key is there some way to make
that global or do I have to recall and
my API key to those services every
different script that I use so my
suggestion for that would actually to be
used me to your settings right because
that right the idea for me to your
settings is that you want to be able to
set it from the command line ER or you
run time and so meteor settings like
doing that setting it via the command
line or at runtime allows you to have a
different key for every environment
you're in rights and so if you think
like locally I'm probably gonna have a
development key or I'm I don't want one
right like I don't want to send email I
don't wanna like accidentally email a
bunch of people which I've done with
crater before um or you know when you're
in staging you want to use a different
api key right until if you think about
stripe like you can get the stripe
testing key and therefore you can put in
test credit cards in staging whereas in
production you want live and so you just
do like meteor settings dot sendgrid key
or something like that and then you can
anywhere you're you're making a call you
just call that in and that way like you
that separate it out in your code and
you can easily change it later if you
need to that make sense ya know i i'm
already using settings i guess what's
happening is for example when i use
mixed panel for analytics i had to
basically do like constant Mixpanel
equals new mix panel um doc config API
key mmm and ate it wouldn't I was used
to the Global's and and meteor 1.2 and
so it feels like i have to call that
with the API key on every single script
ideas and I just felt sort of messy
compared to just set at once and meteor
start up on 1.2 and um then it works all
across the board country still do that
up if it wasn't working for me so that's
why I was recalling it in every script
rather than did I lose everyone no I'm
still here I I think we lost everybody
we lost everybody now that you still
here yes yeah I think everybody want you
except josh we kind of lost Josh yeah
mm-hmm ok so just just too
just to say that I think that also in
1.3 you can just use you can use the
global media namespace right which so
technically work because if I think
about it I mean it's supposed to be
backwards compatible right right well
that's what I ended up doing I just
ended up using okay grow analytics and
at the meteor package and then that
works fine and lazy but you know I just
like future thinking getting used to
using the 1.3 modules and trying to do
do everything the same way and I really
like being able to strictly call things
because then I know where it comes from
and later on when i go back to debug
something because my apps a little bit
larger now it's like hey that's where
that comes from
you know concerning logging one of the
habits that I currently was made aware
of is I have a lot of console dot log or
when i log arrows but info or whatever
aha at some point it kind of gets a bit
messy that you just can't remember where
in the code that particular arrow info
was thrown right right and so I started
putting in like hash and then a six
digits value so a unique identifier for
every lock that I that I posted and so
you can very quickly search for that
particular identify a new code right so
that was quite helpful so you do it like
every for every console log for that you
you you you put the hash code for every
console log statement the airlock that
info or warning or whatever whatever I
use ready ready ready yeah not not
during dip not necessarily strictly
during development when I develop stuff
all the time I put a lot of console dot
log there to understand what's going on
but then if i remove maybe half of them
the other one stays in and then I just
flow errors in production for example
and if you just look at your server logs
you kind of you kind of just see okay
product ABC wasn't found there and
you're like damn that is really the bose
statement like you can't really make out
what part of your app just through this
particular ok for example and then if
you if you have if you have a unique
identify you can go back and check right
that's pretty cool actually and that's
pretty cool because it's very yeah i
understand because i still have the same
issue myself it's so hard to I mean it
takes its time consuming we got to spend
more time going through the code ok yeah
so I
suggest also doing that with Winston and
then instead of just putting it up to
console you can have it right to a file
and so I get you know five or six errors
that run in a string and so I output the
error to the log file but it also puts
the file name then it was called from so
that means that super easy go oh it was
from this line on that file as opposed
to console which will sometimes give you
this massive object of errors and you
have to figure out where exactly is that
scripting yeah exactly the problem is
always to go back to the code and see
which method or which file where the
error occurred basically right and yeah
and then I guess logging also the file
name is helpful but I don't know do you
did you try that in production uh yeah
um clogging the file names the same
thing it's thinking it's basically it's
just a matter where you just go like
Winston that log um you output the error
message and then you just mainly put in
the file name for the org I mean you can
call the variable of what file name that
is oh yeah right advanced annually right
um yeah I know I mean you can just do a
you can do the file name or you can get
another said there's a variable you can
call that is that file name and then it
just plugs it in so you don't have to
manually type in you know product jas it
will plug that in for you hmm okay i
think that is leaving so see you next
time unit yeah my yoga is waiting for me
he's calling me but it was nice talking
to you guys all right did you not happy
yoga thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
