welcome meteor fans i'm your host josh
owens along with my special guest
regular co-host hey there Dean welcome
be so um yeah where I was busy and
totally slipped his mind so Dean filled
in I think I think you're like the
official back up now hey not a bad place
to be yeah yeah alright so this week we
are going to talk about mdg blogging
again yeah that's interesting stateful
URLs it's an interesting concept meteor
and backbone that was a heck of an
article uh no meteor what would you use
and meteor sequel oh yeah alright so
there was there was a lot this this week
i actually had trouble choosing like
just five yeah i had a list of ten and
had to whittle down so yeah mdg blogging
you know what I'm gonna be lame and say
i just realized i didn't read the entire
article um so number one i love that
sashko blogs right and yeah the amazing
part here is the fact that you know they
just hired a new vp of marketing and you
know we're starting to see some changes
happen in the company and this is one of
them right i love that this blog post
was written in put on their own blog
rather than put up on medium or
something like that so that was pretty
exciting to see and i think you know the
gist of this post they caught it
optimistic UI updating but i think this
is really just a an explanation of
latency compensation and kind of how it
works and how you can use it and that
kind of thing so um I think it's worth a
read and its pretty long here it's got
he's got four points uh
yeah yeah it's a justification to of
what's become the norm but it kind of
takes a step back and says why is your
rendering on the client so important
mmhmm yeah that's a good point and I
think the other thing is to you know
this is it's maybe the norm in meteor
lamb but it's not the norm everywhere
else necessarily and so I'm right the
idea is that you know when you read this
article just think like you know when
you submit data on your client basically
you're able to fake out all that data
going to the server running and then
coming back and so it looks super fast
to you because it's going to run on your
client go to the server run there and
then the data like any data changes will
come back down and you know you you
won't even see once that change comes
back down and so you're getting it way
faster than everybody else and I think
that's nice and there's been times where
you know I've used it and it's been very
very helpful and probably the easiest
way to do this is just to you know put
your meteor methods in the lake in the
collection and your collections usually
go to both the the client the server so
that's an easy way to do it but yeah so
we're really just talking about latency
compensation and studying that kind of
stuff so but it's definitely worth a
read and I hope they put out like an
article we write right because there's
there's still a lot of need there's
still a lot of convincing of people to
do right so having more more concept
this is a rather technical one of it I
actually saw a ten slide thing that I
wish I had gotten into maybe we can get
it into the show notes I saw a very
non-technical ten frame slideshow of
meteor that I thought was really good oh
nice and and so but this is like kind of
like the opposite direction of like a
really deep dive and somebody who
understands angular and react will be
able to get a lot out of this article
and understand the selling points yeah
definitely
so more more blogging from mdg we'd love
it thank you for sure from you know
honestly like I sashko and slava do an
amazing job about being more vocal about
their work I'd love to see more from
like avital or David Greenspan or David
glass or you know they're doing a lot of
cool stuff over there yeah they don't
really talk about it a lot so they've
got this like github tool for managing
issues that they built in meteor and it
like sinks issued data back and forth
and it shows them like an issue that
hasn't been touched in a while like
it'll start flagging it and moving up
the queue and telling news mondial and
it's pretty awesome man I'd love to see
a post on that or something you know
like I don't know they're doing cool yep
yep keep it up guys alright likes next
story yeah this stateful URLs man so if
I if I rewind a few years ago even
before the rise of backbone I was
introduced to the knockout j/s view
model framework and it was actually what
turned me on to reactivity I wouldn't
have discovered meteor if not for my
knockout and the idea what that was with
with with all view model things is that
there is an object who state uniquely
determines the view of the page so if
you're doing a to-do list there's the
mode where you're editing it to do and
the mold where you're not editing it to
do and if you just have an ad hoc you no
soup of events you might not be able to
for example in a selenium or cucumber
test go to a particular state of the
page immediately you'll have to click
around you know your instructions will
be like click here and do all that stuff
well all that's really doing is changing
the state of some object that controls
the view so what if you put the state of
the object that controls the view right
in the URL and that's what I got out of
this post and it's it's something that I
thought was a good idea you know even
even years ago
the I entered I could maybe help me
think of some drawbacks of this because
I think it's pretty sweet uh yeah i mean
i would definitely agree with that and I
think maybe coming from rails land this
is similar to doing like nested URLs or
something right and I don't know I think
it can it could definitely be helpful
you know I guess to me this doesn't seem
like a super new concept it's really
just bringing you know an older concept
to to meteor which I mean it's it's got
the whole push state support through
iron rod or through flow router but
right not necessarily something that's
native and meteors so right it's it's
it's a Back to the Future concept like
hey this is what you can do with URLs
you can create an address for anything
you know the the third editing the third
record on your page why not have a
direct URL to that state of your
application yeah yeah absolutely and I
you know it's it's important because the
URL is like the backbone of the web
right like if if no I have a URL there's
no way for me to tell you hey go here
and do this thing this specific thing
you know and and so that's why like URLs
are important and that's why we have
things like iron out or inflow router
because even within a single page app
URLs are still in yeah all right uh
let's see meteor and backbone so this
one like hit me out of left field uh you
know everyone's over here like you know
talking about oh hey you know reactor
and it's hired Yuri and he's working on
angular and you know we're gonna see
something with react soon and then boom
you know mixmax comes out of nowhere and
they've got this great blog post about
integrating with backbone and the work
that they just finished up and rather
than
to figure out a way to get backbone to
slot into you know kind of like blaze
they decided instead to write a little
DDP client and have a backbone meteor
collection object that they can now use
and they're getting fully reactive data
updating going on a backbone using DDP
and that like this is a great read um
definitely worth taking a few minutes to
look over and even if you're not like a
backbone person I think the important
thing to take away here is that DDP is
awesome and seeing it expand you know to
me like I want to see it expand more and
more and have more like server-side DDP
kind of points where you can expose data
but but saying new clients consuming it
to like it just makes you realize the
modularity of building a meteor app is
actually pretty amazing because you know
as long as you're supporting DDP on
either end you're good to go you can
hook something in the media yeah and and
this is just continuing the trend of
showing that you know you don't have to
take all of meteor as a it's not a big
ball of mud right and that protocol is
the the integration point that you can
have different things on each side and I
wonder Josh like do you think that with
so much of the stuff being contingent on
DDP if DDP implementations occurred and
a whole bunch of other server side
frameworks would meteor still have the
the you know compelling advantage I
think it has a better one right so now
you know if you decide you know I don't
know I guess there's different like if
you think about meteor in in these
chunks you can break apart right so
you've got like the database is one of
those chunks and changing that out is
very interesting to people but in
reality the meteor server is just
grabbing the data and pushing it out
over DDP and so I see DDP is another one
of those like points where you can kind
of disconnect something and replace it
and the interesting thing is it
you know the DDP is kind of sitting in
front of the client and the server so it
makes it a very interesting
disconnection point where you can change
those pieces out and I do think you know
having talked to Erin oda about the
stuff that he's doing you know and I
tried to prompt him to talk about this
more on the AMA that he did this week um
but you know honestly he's doing some
interesting stuff to write like they've
written a go DDP library or server and
they're they're trying to figure out a
way to use like Kafka and go to like
serve up data to the to the meteor
clients and yeah that's very compelling
right so right he was having some
trouble scaling with the right load that
he has right so Mongo's great for a ton
of Ruiz but when you get a ton of rights
like yep it can handle it but the way
meteors set up to read from Mongo it
doesn't handle it very well but um yeah
so I you know I just I think it's very
interesting that he was able to kind of
modular Lee break off and move this
piece over here and I don't know I guess
that's uh we're starting to approach the
idea of microservices through DDP yeah I
think I think that's a that's starting
to get going and understanding the
hosting ramifications like like galaxy
is aiming to do and like modulus has
been doing learning how to scale a DDP
protocol will help everybody yeah
definitely all right so definitely go
read that lessons and client-side DDP
it's another like back to the future
like you hadn't heard of backbone in a
little while I or url's like you know
next thing will be talking about meteor
and XSL state for a blog post for me
about that yeah have fun with that
that's terrible I was trying to like I
was building a new app and it it has to
use an undocumented API for YouTube and
the only thing that it gives back is XML
and so like I'm trying to figure out how
to like parson edit and Reese pit out
smell and XML to jas yes that's what I'm
using but rap async around that and ya
know it's a funny looking JSON object
but it's still JSON yeah it's just I
don't know feels dirty like digging
through I tweeted like hell is other
people's data structures oh yeah well I
could get fewer characters by saying
like hell is XML that's true that's very
true all right next story yeah so the
next story is actually just about what
would you use Oh kind of with if you can
use meteor and jeez a lot of people have
answers about that my answer is uh I
don't know I don't really have a good
answer at the moment it would be my
go-to I mean no Jas but I'd you know be
implementing fibers in it and I'd be
implementing all the things that I'd
miss so yeah yeah I you know I tend to
maybe like for me I probably would have
just kept going with rails and I
probably would have pushed harder on
learning angular you know I got I got
far enough in to implementing like one
kind of angular controller to do some
stuff on a page for like sorting and
stuff and I just didn't like it and
honestly about three weeks later I ran
across meteor and it was like man this
makes a hello a lot more sense for me
like I could have built this entire you
know application that I've been working
on for months I feel like I could have
built it in two or three weeks yeah and
the estimation is probably off by fifty
percent but still you know months versus
a month month and a half is still pretty
good yeah so in facebook react has a few
interesting connections for one it's
it's not so different philosophically
from meteor with the reactivity and
there's a also some of the other devs
that I know that are in the closure
closure script world there
they're big on this library called ohm
which runs on top of react so like as an
additional front end tool to learn and
it would be for me it'd be react and
then I'd also dig into their server side
rendering and react native they kind of
seem to be doing a lot of the things
that the meteor community is doing so I
think you could learn by comparing
what's going on and react with what's
going on in meteor well you know and so
the interesting thing maybe you're right
like I would if I weren't if if I had
known angular react probably would have
been super interesting to me and it's
generating a lot of noise but I think
the key difference is and i don't i
don't know if it's true but the team at
facebook has an actual app that they can
you know kind of get learnings from and
try things out with and you know mdg is
great but at the same time they actually
take a week every quarter no it's not a
record every every half year they take a
week off from doing regular work and
they do app week and they build things
using meteor but maybe the the thing I'm
trying to get at here is the fact that
they're only playing with the framework
itself every six months and they're not
continually dogfooding on right exactly
vehicle app yeah that's totally what I'm
getting at so I mean I you know react I
think maybe they conquered some critical
pieces that I feel like meteors may be
ignored like server-side rendering and
you know we got Cordova so I think
that's a good thing and I think react
native is probably far too big in scope
so Kourt using Cordova makes a lot more
sense to me especially when you look at
the core tenant of like supporting
off-the-shelf components that are open
source type of thing mmm but yeah I
definitely think react would be on my
list I just I can't get over you know
jsx like Java hampden HTML living
together I don't know maybe I'm a
curmudgeon but keep
I'll throw my king I'll shake my keen at
them with you Josh hahaha yeah i mean
like we just learned over the years that
it's best practice is to separate this
crap so let's just stop stop right now
functions are just so nice raw raw
JavaScript or es6 functions like let's
let's not add croft too much cruft to
that simple premise yeah definitely so
I'd love to see like react with
handlebars or something no no that would
be interested i know you i know the j sx
part is optional but i think all the
main tutorials I've seen say let's just
take that as a starting point so yeah
yep well what's interesting in meteor
SQL for you uh yeah so this one like I
don't know this is another one like I
had no idea I mean obviously compose is
probably paying attention to meteor but
I had no idea that were paying this much
attention to be here and so this just
kind of like popped up on my radar I saw
a tweet about it actually and was so
kind of excited that they were paying
attention to and doing research on it
that i put it up on crater and but they
really you know they they dug into the
roadmap and a sequel support is
definitely the most voted feature and
you know i'm hoping like i'm not hearing
anything from MTG but i'm hoping
someone's working on this but they kind
of outlined some of the options that are
out there now with a las equal meteor
postgres sequel and all those kinds of
things and i don't know i just i found
it to be a good read and it's an
interesting roundup I don't know how
accurate it is because i haven't used
any of these projects that they were
talking about but you know I think if
nothing else it's worth people trying
some of these things out and you know
don't don't wait for an official package
right because I think it's going to be
slower than most people think to get an
official package out and I don't know I
honestly I would love me like you said
like
higher been you know mmhmm yeah yeah
when there's a lot of churn mdg kind of
waits to see something kind of settle in
and so it does take a little while and
you'll look into the community for you
know really good really good packages
that can do something now and because
you can build on node functionality and
like things like live streaming
notifications from postgres the NPM
postgres library has been dealing with
that it's pretty battle-hardened so I
don't think it would be a long road to
get that kind of thing into meteor but
you'll probably be using a third-party
library for a while before you know
you're waiting for mdg to adopt it and
that's one of the principles of the
meteor ecosystem right is that you can
find what you need in the community I
don't know if you know some of the tools
like you know as having a component
library having having atmosphere it's
good to have yeah and you know what is
probably the most interesting and I just
now started reading all this but I been
green num tell actually went in and
responded on crater because i don't i
don't think compose has comments on
their blog is that true or false that's
sure they don't have comments okay so he
left a comment on crater and actually
it's quite large and he kind of gives a
comparison of all a sequel and space
elephants efforts and their postgres
work to what he's been doing and he
points out that they're actually missing
quite a bit and in what they're doing
and that they don't have a ton of test
coverage and all kinds of stuff and so
he he mentions his packages as well um
yeah I don't know like I i if I if I had
to or I was interested I would probably
be looking at the end stuff yeah you
know it's only gonna get better if
people pitch in if people try it learn
see you see what it does what it does
do and you know honestly it takes you
what a couple hours on a weekend and
maybe add a feature if if you know what
you're doing or if you don't know what
you're doing just keep playing and maybe
get half an implementation you post up
in an issue and someone's able to take
it the rest away who knows but you know
like like space talk I spent a couple
hours on Sunday working on space talk
and submitted a pull request to get
direct channels working and it turns out
like I was probably 75 percent of the
way there and someone else picked it up
and you know they've been refactoring it
over the last couple days and it's been
getting more and more polished so you
know that's this is how things get
better cool what are the hosting options
for playing with meteor and postgres
roku maybe all yeah all of them I guess
I mean really so if you look at mop I
think it's going to give you a Mongo
database which you can turn off and then
you can install your own plus crest by
hand on on that same box or on a
different box so that's one option or
yeah like probably the easiest option
would be to go to Heroku and get that
set up and you know I'm kind of curious
now that composes talking about it I
know that they have yeah they've got a
postgres option as well so you can you
could set up there and hand off the
connection string just like you do if
you use compose for Mongo ok so yeah I
think there's a couple options
definitely and I mean nothing says you
know you could set up your Postgres
database on Heroku and then host you
have somewhere else if you want it it's
all just ec2 in the end yeah that's true
i was curious what you know what were
the kind of easiest onboard kind of
options yeah I guess you know I mean I
probably look pretty hard at compose if
that's yeah something now we're gonna do
yeah and is the idea with a sequel on
the client that'd be isomorphic that you
would use sequel strings to query your
client side data as well and create I
mean I think that would be cleaner yeah
means I it'd be weird to use a Mongo
syntax on the front end and a sequel
syntax for publishing on the back end
true true but at maybe I'll do a weekend
warrior project of converting the Mongo
query syntax into into a sequel
string-like objects yeah I'm trying to
look at honestly screw it let's just
throw caution the one to build an app
man with the meteor PG feet here PG yeah
yeah yeah I'm trying to see what he's
got on the client here he's got
subscription calls that you can make
yeah this probably isn't interesting for
people but no just just one of those
like as I investigate SQL I'll need a
good hosting option and I'll figure out
what kind of it's a natural feeling way
for me to query it yeah isomorphic is
probably the most natural for the for
the average person though yeah I would
agree because it's what they're used to
write like it's what we've been set up
to expect so yeah so and here's a pro
tip for you or on the subject of
databases if you set up a database that
compose don't use things like add
symbols or Colin's or slashes in your
passwords or your usernames I am those
things that are special URL characters
yes yes those are the ones ya didn't hit
by that before yes I helped a guy
yesterday and he's like I can't figure
out why you know I'm mom modulus I've
got composed it up but they're not
talking to each other and you know after
about like three minutes of looking at
everything we're like he had an ad
symbol in his is uh and his password wah
wah yeah that was a bummer Allah I guess
it was a bummer for him he felt like you
waste a lot of time but you know as good
we fixed it pretty fast yeah so the
perils of string concatenation yes yeah
alright well thanks for coming on the
show Dean good topics Josh you had fun
you know I haven't done this in a while
let's let's maybe talk about the patrons
I didn't do it last week yeah I
definitely we've been getting some new
people on here so i'll just mention some
names but if you're interested you want
to jump in the slack chat room where you
can find Dean and rye and myself and a
bunch of other really awesome meteorites
you can go to patreon r EO n-com /
meteor club and there's a ten-dollar
play in there that'll get you into the
slack chat room but we had Matthew F has
joined Ruben I let's see Marcus L Fred a
benji tongue tons of people are joining
excellent so awesome i think we're up to
like 80 people in that chat room now
it's getting even getting crazy yeah a
lot of man I just I a lot of interesting
stuff I wish I in there a little bit
more this week yeah it's it's almost I
mean it's it's a little noisy but it's
it's really fun to watch all the people
learning the experience people jump in
and be like oh here's the thing like
even today like Stefan whole house was
in there asking like how do I do this
and like we're all giving him
suggestions yeah pretty awesome from
like meteor specifics to general
javascript stuff a lot to learn in that
room yep two bins poop jokes and gif
ease and kin and we'd give these that
was it yes alright well thanks for
tuning in guys and we'll be back next
week maybe booth right maybe with Dean
