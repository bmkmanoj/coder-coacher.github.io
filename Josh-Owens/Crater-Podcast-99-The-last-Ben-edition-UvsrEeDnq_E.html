tax day not texted a very confusing
welcome crater fans i'm your host Jeff
Jones along with my co-hosts been
Strahan hello everybody come a little
hot on the mic there man and straight
here widow whisper wish story whisperer
yes oh yeah so like this is episode 99 I
got 99 problems and then is quitting
that's 10 but this is this is like your
last official show this is the last
official show we have something special
planned for next week would you do ya
two on the rise show yeah right I see me
show you to make it um I haven't talked
to hobby yet but it sounds like we might
have four I I'm almost wondering if we
should just do like a round table rather
than talking about needs I don't know
might be fun yeah we have four of us
yeah we're all very opinionated yeah i
really liked rise insights because
yesterday or last weekend the show
because everything was was focused
around the problematic solving right now
it's a startup mm-hmm and that was a
really interesting perspective that i
liked hearing yeah mom stuff and I think
moving forward uh I mean the crater show
is so great one because of You Josh and
to its kind it's great because of these
revolving co-hosts mmm different
perspectives uh and it like I think it
adds to the to like the longevity of the
Creator podcast I think I'm really
excited what's going to be coming with
Abby yeah so again you sound so sad
little sad love you man talking aband
imeem you're still gonna do the space
dojo show so yeah
again yeah seriously I think right right
yeah I'm their man put you on the spot
I'm there you know what I love what
we're doing with the space dojo show too
because it's a lot of fun I got an email
the other day and someone's like I love
the new direction you're taking no ass
yeah like horde me this stuff me yeah
yeah I'll have to send it to you it was
it was other stuff like no I pay you
money for you training but oh I'll send
you the snippet about them loving the
podcast it's gonna be like Clinton's
emails where like they have to black out
half of it yeah yeah redacted sorry Ben
ah for those of you who don't know what
the space dojo show is like go ahead and
search then itunes and you get hooked up
with it yeah what a rock are you living
in there I know like it's great because
we tap we go in depth we go out and like
take advantage of our connections and in
the world in the development world and
like get the driving forces behind some
of these the most popular packages on
our the show with us and we start
hammering them with questions so yeah
yeah like I loved we talked to the
feathers team we talked to the helm I'm
someone that that's working with a known
full-time so there's been like a lot of
cool stuff Phoenix honestly like I
really want to get so I was looking at
this f8 studio thing that they've been
putting out from facebook um and Lee
Byron sat down with Christopher chetty
oh I think chedi yow I want that last
name yeah yeah the react native view JX
or whatever he goes by um one of the
co-creator graph ql like I want to have
a show on that you know like this
telephone so it's very relevant for the
future I have to keep this clean I found
out my son like randomly watches these
by the way from YouTube whoa geez yeah
okay attending a lot I'm sorry Josh for
teaching your child new language yeah
all right let's let's do this so this
week we're talking about importing
styles from nude module
what one not saying hello to react cdk
cdk zdk not an sdk cdk it's OCD uh and
then we're gonna talk about what's next
for feathers uh got some some friends
over there and I mention us in that post
so it's fun um and the media roadmap
save a little time for that guy not not
because it's long but but because I
think its controversial we're gonna have
fun with that one right yes yes we will
great my wrist keeps buzzing like crazy
because the feathers ama is going on
right now so if you're living under a
rock again you didn't notice there's a
ama on crater right now at the top and
the feathers jazz team is doing and ask
me anything so by the time you hear this
you missed it but you can go read all
the answers I like that too yeah are
awesome yeah all right so uh meteor I
guess you could almost say this is like
us talking about 1.3 point2 pretty much
uh which i think is still in release
candidate is that true yeah it hasn't
been released yet yeah so it's still an
RC which is interesting right um so I
think maybe so the article willing to is
from floyd price he's been doing a
pretty awesome job putting some content
out lately really appreciate that and uh
he's just showing off how imports will
work now and if you're not familiar with
it since we moved to 1.3 we get full
access to NPM now we can just say npm
install aftershave and put in any
anything we want into our media app and
then we can just start importing things
the problem is you know we have a whiles
Styles the punch rapper packages on an
atmosphere for like bootstrap and stuff
and there's no reason for that right
like bootstrap is already publishing
itself to mpm
so we should just be able to import that
but with 1.3 there was a decision made
that it might increase build time and
therefore they weren't really targeting
the ability for you to mention and
import less or SAS or CSS files directly
from an NPM package and so that would
require them to scan that package and
make those available to the build tool
and that's where they were worried about
the increased performance costs or
decrease performs yeah and just doing it
right so like the pre-processing of
styles has always been kind of like a
sore subject with the meteor build tool
and in slowly yeah exactly um and I
think this is pretty elegant from the
perspective of the developer to
integrate node modules similar to how
you're going to be like tapping into
styles and files inside of the packages
if you want to import them so I think
like this is wonderful yeah I hope that
it like puts it to bed I'm gonna
obviously when 1.3 comes out all my apps
are going to be upgraded to that and I
just hope that there's no bugs in this
it's so annoying in the past one year
when you come across a preprocessing bug
and you're like this is this is so
elementary and now this is holding me up
yeah it's gonna like take a half a day
for me to bug this like I I was furious
on those days yeah yeah I I had one of
those days right I think did you yeah on
the show it was like I tried out 1.3 and
new like using a beta version and um the
designers like well let's let's import
foundation and we can use that and like
you know one of the great things about
using bootstrap or foundation is that
you can use the kind of like the less to
override some of the core styles right
like exactly when you go to space dojo
we have purple buttons like purple
buttons are a thing for us on that style
so like we want to be able to set that
as the default and then anytime we just
say this is going to be a default button
it should be purple yeah
and like you could not do that you had
to copy / CSS files or copy over the
less files and it's like that's pretty
bad for like ah yes yeah it's just like
nails on a chalkboard so um I'm hoping
yet this gets a whole off without a
hitch it looks elegant I'm really
excited to start using it if if you guys
are having any problems with it like hit
us up in the chat on YouTube let us know
what's going on and yeah definitely hold
the torch for you you know the
interesting thing is that they're
they're trying this new release cycle
normally they only did release
candidates for like you know 1.3 we get
release candidates and then like they
would eventually just come out with one
point three point one and they would be
much much smaller and then everything
else would wait until like one point for
was coming out and get piled in there um
but now they're trying like we've got
we've already gotten one point three
point one now they're working on one
point three point two kind of
interesting to watch but I also feel
like uh maybe not as much attention is
being paid to the release candidates
because I upgraded to one point three
point one and it totally broke my
application Oh what happened I think I
couldn't deploy it and I couldn't figure
out why and it turns out like there's
some weird binary like mpm binary issues
that were causing problems and you could
blow away node modules and then like
redeploy correctly and that would fix
some of it and there was another bug I
don't know it was now I had it like
earlier this week but there was
something for 131 as well for me you
know something was failing in the build
that wasn't with 13 yeah yeah so it's
like I you know I appreciate what
they're doing but at the same time like
I don't know it it feels less stable to
me like 1.3 in general feels like it has
more rough edges than any other previous
media release Brenda there was a lot of
changes yes yeah so it's understandable
they were very ambitious
13 yeah I hold off on this for our last
topic because our getting it okay we're
so pitch I'm really excited to get the
rest done with you all right all back oh
yes all right let's talk about this cdk
man what is a CD dude dude another error
note about gosh this guy's just kicking
it out so Aaron Oda loves react uh we
were talking about storybook a couple
weeks back mm-hmm which is awesome and
then what's uh mdgs ekids chrome
something chromatic chromatic that's
what it was yes yeah so it's like oh my
gosh Erin Oda is like right there like
like with mdg as it always like air
knows usually one step ahead of everyone
so anyway this is really neat he
released reacts cvk and pretty much what
is its a yeoman generator for react
components and it also like bundles in
some of his hopeful stuff like getting
going with testing and getting storybook
going and I'm looking forward to using
this I I plan on using this next week on
a project that I'm using I'm converting
from blaze to react so I'm gonna totally
go this route and yeah and love it yeah
you know the interesting thing to me
like I was teaching a class this week on
media 13 again and react and I actually
think I may incorporate storybook into
the start of the class because we have a
pre-compiled like static HTML that the
designer created and it's been kind of
massage tin too generic we have like
three react components that we just
import and it's static but I think it
might be easier to show people like
here's what we have out of the box like
and then as we're prototyping things it
might be fun to build the components
directly with storybooks and then like
bring
the men to the half piece by piece hmm
so interesting yeah the chromatic
package looked really interesting too
and I have to like give a public thank
you did you watch uh their talk I did
not they when they were talking about
react components they threw a component
up and they used a tweet as a component
as a visual reference of a component
uh-huh and it was one of my tweets oh
nice well thank you very much guys that
was pretty awesome so now i have to you
try it next week a along with story book
and see what I like so i'll report back
yeah yeah you know the interesting thing
to me is like I I prefer I I think
storybooks gonna have a longer life I do
too yeah so that is the very first like
1x4 chromatic um but it looks pretty
sharp so I I think I want to try them
both just so like I have a working to
understand like an understanding
viewpoint on what they're both trying to
achieve and how they're achieving it
because I want an opinion I want to form
a technical opinion on the two yeah but
this cdk component developer kit is a
pretty awesome I mean it's a small thing
a yeoman I don't own a c0 min a lot I
haven't used it for like a year and a
half so now it's gonna be getting back
into my workflow probably so cool yeah
it's really interesting feels like Aaron
Otis doubling down on storybook and like
delivering awesome tools to the react
community what is this one of the bullet
points he has deploying your storybook
to github pages yeah yeah you're able to
I think um it looks like there's some
integration flojo for like deploying
components to NPM and getting them up on
github pages which has been a question
of mine as well like could I just build
react i have to deploy it to github
pages
well well so storybook like your you're
mocking it out so it's not like you can
connect it to a data source yeah but you
know I bet we could build a REST API or
something and consume that easily or you
know whatever if it's just a static site
but you want some reactivity going on
you could use your act right this is so
funny because this conversation comes up
every once in a while with like senior
meteor developers uh and so I've added
come up before more like is there a
simpler way to get what I want like like
it's just a static page you know how can
I and it's all based around github pages
how can I like utilize that and then
start getting everything that I'm used
to in a web app yeah yeah well I mean
that's that's the weird part right like
you look at meteor itself and you
realize like the connect app underneath
is really just delivering some HTML jss
and CSS right perchance ESS and like you
could like that stuff can be parked
anywhere that HTML can live anywhere on
the web it's just static same thing like
the JSE's compile the CSS is compiled
that can live anywhere like it's
recommended that that be pushed off to
CDN anyway so really just need like a
WebSocket server almost you could really
like pull apart a meteor app into these
two pieces and really say like almost if
you had a hosting setup like firebase or
something like you know and this is
where I think it gets really interesting
when Apollo fully comes out and like the
heck's that that we're going to be able
to build on top of that yeah maybe maybe
yeah like independent of meteor like
just a pot like hackett just with Apollo
mmm yeah and some database snow but you
cannot a private what I hosted with
galaxy I'm sure
I am two hundred percent sure that you
be able do that yes alright so speaking
of other things than meteor um one of
the things that got released this week
was a road map essentially for what's
coming from feathers and they said that
in the in the post one of the things
that they feel like they're having
trouble with is the fact that everything
is kind of like able dependently change
and upgrade and so they're trying to
create these almost like a release track
and they're calling this one awk which
is a type of bird and they're just kind
of describing a lot of the overarching
goals that they have for this release
and so the post is is pretty much about
all their goals that they're they're
aiming for and they talked about you
know the first big one is authentication
they're trying to you know like there's
no oooff one support right now and again
I don't even know how much that matters
like outside a Twitter everyone else's a
lot too yeah you know they want to have
multi-factor authentication which I
think would be amazing I know there's a
package of meteor landed do that kind of
thing with twilio I think but um
password management password lists
authentication so you don't need a
password probably similar to like slacks
magic links or whatever hmm um and so
that's like that's one big piece they
want a kind of overhaul and polish up
some of their surface adapters that they
have so they have a DAB the service
adapters for like sending push
notifications to Apple and Google
sending SMS messages to twilio so um
that stuff looks pretty interesting as
well and they have realm support didn't
we talk about that isn't that a realm DB
yeah that's funny and just clicked on it
and it's just a it's just a readme there
so yeah it looks like they don't even
have that thing yet um but yeah so it
looks that that stuff looks interesting
to me and then you know they really want
to nail down their react native and
android and iOS stuff even further like
how it works with rest or web sockets or
like the JWT authentication like making
all that stuff kind of easier all these
applications so it's really really
interesting I think I love that they're
talking about this stuff too um you know
they want to get a bunch of
documentation up and they want to get
like really deep dive with their command
line interface tool that they have now
that just came out this has become
pretty ambitious it is it is hurry I
remember our conversation with them and
they were um when the issue of like
scalability like developer scalability I
maintaining all these libraries came up
they came back with argument that's
saying like well we're leveraging
express our footprints pretty light you
know uh and so I'm wondering like when
they're gonna hit the apex where you
know they're building building building
and then all sounds like oh like
maintenance takes it you know you know
here's the thing from me and i'm looking
at i'm looking at other teams and how
they're doing it right you look at ember
or you look at react and how they're
moving at a good clip and i think that
there is only so much concern for
backwards compatibility so rather than
like we're gonna support all these
features that we used to have there at
some point they decide that didn't work
we're going to deprecate it we're going
to start throwing some warnings so on
you know the next release you're going
to start getting the warnings the
release after that is called
no and it's good I I think that's smart
I think that allows you to stay nimble
and be quick you know what i find
interesting though is that you know we
had a conversation with them afterwards
about some of the graph ql stuff and
that's not mention in here so i wonder
what that's about hmm yeah yeah i really
like them i have a lot of faith in that
team editing project they seem to be
hitting everything pretty quickly once
it comes up yeah as like a concern so
it's something to watch out for and this
roadmap sounds great well and I you know
I think I think they're well connected
to their community to you know like they
added that yeah you know you know I've
been paying attention to that thing for
the last couple weeks and they're really
like they're there to help there to like
get people up and running yeah it's
interesting and I love this post you
know it was great I really appreciate
all the effort that they're putting in
yeah and you got to remember like oh my
god this is like a real open source
project like it's not backed or
sponsored by a large organization there
they don't have any like business plan
to like break out and be its own company
yeah that actually all refuge I did go
mom after they put this post out someone
was like well you know you guys like are
you gonna do something around hosting
and they're like no like we just want to
like we'll just get some documents
together and you know maybe maybe down
the road it might make sense for us to
build a hosting service but right now
like we just want to focus on making
feathers the best they're like they're
like the Bernie Sanders real-time world
right now yeah right everybody else is
funded right yeah rethink DB just
released horizon I oh yeah yeah totally
time for a revolution time for a real
time revolution do you feel the feather
I don't know that that's creepy man
feel a flap I don't know that's even
worse your son's listening to this all
right so talking about so about the
other road map right other road maps
yeah um yeah this is your gene you start
the meteor roadmap so this is the
Hillary Clinton of the group allow a lot
of history here right there's some
backing going down here I love meteor I
like ah Hiller cousins not that bad
either anyway I had to do that okay so
Zoltan put together a roadmap for meteor
a saloon read redacted then other pieces
we can't read ha is there I don't know
I'm just kidding me i'm like clicking up
here I want to see how many what we
likened it to Hillary I wondered if it
was like oh funny okay sorry i can't
read some of these it's all blacked out
okay um thing we're most excited about
is black bar well and it's interesting
that you said that so um is there like a
lot of exciting things in this is in
this markdown file and there really
isn't I would say the MongoDB update is
expected like okay we knew that this was
gonna it's been expected for a while
right like they did a round of updates
not too long ago note for right you know
what's interesting yeah they changed the
format did you see the early version of
this no I'm gonna go okay so the first
we had they actually had headings for
when these would be targeted and they
expect one point three point X the mongo
driver will be updated and one point for
that are expecting to update node yes Oh
interesting
mm-hmm okay yeah oh I see it okay I see
you here uh full transition the MPN was
gonna be 1.4 yeah oh okay yeah yeah yeah
and this is where I started to take
issue because I don't feel like
upgrading node under the covers feels
like a 1.3 point X kind of release hmm
yeah i mean i get like maybe updating
your mongo driver like that maybe make
sense but node feels pretty core yeah
yeah well are they gonna get rid of
fibers you think right and if you get
rid of a quick make me think like that's
a breaking change you don't have to so
apparently there's already been enough
investigation work done that you don't
have to get rid of fibers to upgrade it
still works fine um you know on on node
4 and node 5 from what I hear okay
interesting well that makes me think
that there's like more to this than so
like the 1.4 release I'm curious what
that's going to be what's gonna become
in there well you know so so my ding
here is like I feel like we're not
following sim bar at all and I feel like
we're almost afraid to deprecate things
right we look at the the imports folder
that we got in 1.3 yeah then like making
the full commitment to note an MPN and
all that kind of stuff like we're really
just trying to incrementally upgrade and
yeah we still have no idea like I I'm
teaching a class and people are like
well I don't have to import why should i
use imports and it's like probably
because at some point auto loading files
in the main app might go away but yeah
your room is right back and it's like
well why don't they just take it away
you know if you're doing all this work
to upgrade to 13 yeah it feels weird
we're gonna shove my whole app into the
imports folder i'll be honest i think
they I think it's also tied to like some
marketing because they want to have to
no have a big push big marketing push
for it and really something huge 1.3 was
big too like the senior developers and
the hobbyist but was it like big enough
for like no I were disagreeing I would
disagree with you wholly right one of
the things they get dinged on the most
is there like division there decide to
move away the packaging system away from
em p.m. and node and now like we're
healing that division and coming back
right and to me that would have that
would have been a super compelling story
not with a two point oh ok I totally
agree with that now you framed it that
way I'm gonna bore you you are you are
good um I think low that they like want
some personal marketing so I think
Apollo is going to be 2 point 0 probably
yeah not gonna see any 2 point 0 or even
talk about it until Apollo's hammer down
and then they're gonna be another
working on ode right like make that be
three point oh yeah yes that's not gonna
happen I mean we have a yeah yeah
version 15 now right which which means
you can't ding mdg for not following
sember well so they I mean to be fitted
they came out and said like I to me some
bar like a 1 point 0 says it's you know
you're you're stable for production and
they felt that way like they I totally
agree they were following the gym why
Rick model right like was out for 10
years and he was all like 0 dot whatever
and then he would got as far as I know
he was the first one to do this like he
bumped it from like zero nine to like
version 10 and he's like I just I wasn't
really following the way some horse
should have been and that's how it's
typically done in like apps or like the
developer knows all the weaknesses and
the road map of what they want to
accomplish and they're so hesitant to
put that one point oh uh version on
their stuff I'll totally yeah and it's
like when someone brings up
the conversation like oh this is right
for one point oh also it's like all
hands on deck meeting you know like
seriously it's just like well you know
it's interesting to write because i
think if you look at like Tim and what
he's doing with the terrible name STD
accounts you I um I think it's supposed
to be short for standard but yes if it's
not too um yes I read it you know we
just started that thing off at one point
oh right like it works it's there the UI
is functional like he probably spent
some amount of time but by the time you
put it out in the world like that's
something that you're willing to share
in sport so and I kind of share that
opinion if what the moment that you make
it public it should be one point oh
right oh there you can all its glory
yeah and then you just like start
iterating yeah yeah cool okay so let's
read through the list because I think
like you and I are going to dive into it
so full transition to NPM right that was
coming I testing updates so a lot of
people are saying hey we want better
support for continuous integration so
we're getting that community
contribution project governance we broke
that story and transmission so we knew
that was coming and then data Apollo
pretty much and the view layer uh which
feels like okay oh I love this because
there was this whole conversation where
it's like what's happening with blaze
there was a recent revival just like in
the last two days the recent revival
blaze on the meteor forums and like
everyone's like oh we want to maintain
it we want to maintain it and they're
like breakout tracker to its own NPM
package and boom were off to the races
you know and so like I'll sent
everyone's like gathering around blaze
it's a topic that we're talking about in
the okay gross lack and now like and
this is how I feel same as Zoltan blaze
well we're going to make it essential
fixes to blaze but most likely will be
adding new features ourselves which is
like totally right like
so I'm glad that blazes like getting
some community behind it um but that
that's pretty much it like it's going
one hundred percent community uh just
just the same as meteors going one
hundred percent npm you know yeah yeah
it's interesting right I feel like this
is just this has been a lot of like
backpedaling and missteps at least on
the view layer I I hope that we can
build a good team around it around but
at this point like I've already just
decided that it's it's dead to me you
know that's my opinion a lot of work to
get to where react is and I just don't I
don't see a small subset of the meteor
community driving that to where it needs
to be no no I mean it's gonna be a small
niche fan base cool yeah that's what
it's going to be I am NOT going to with
everything else that's happening that as
a developer i need to get caught up on
to speed with and everything i I want to
be more mainstream I have to have stuff
that has a lot of documentation around
it issues issues are talked about
there's stack overflow solutions but not
if I get into like these these little
niche libraries where there's less
content out there in the world do I want
to dive into that you know and the view
layer is a huge part of your help so
this is you know if you look this
reminds me a lot of like testing and
Ruby world in rails like the longest
time r-spec was king just because there
was a lot of people that were they were
talking about it they were using it you
know I don't I'm like stackoverflow
existed back then but um there were blog
posts about it there was a book and that
stuff was it was all kind of a
difference maker and yeah kind of you
know because there was such large
community support you could figure
things out
and uh yeah I don't know like when it
comes to the view layer I can absolutely
see a performance difference in between
crater as it exists now for most people
and the Nova branch that I've been
testing out against the same production
database on a smaller server it's like
lightning fast you know interesting yeah
yeah yeah I'm not talking about like you
know I've got a hundred users on one
server and to one another we loaded up
the other day and had like 30 people on
there and it still felt on a smaller box
much much faster and like doing a votes
and plenty of comments like ridiculous
diff I thought the issue like wouldn't
have been what the view layer though
with that like I thought it was like a
method back in database kind of issue
it's it's all still there he's still
utilizing it but when you click an
upvote button on the front end like that
should be asynchronous like the methods
running the back end have nothing to do
with that and the fact that like your
browser is chugging on something that's
all like view layer stuff and trusting
though yeah yeah anyway I feel same as
you like okay blaze this whole thing is
like no news to me pretty much what oh
no here's your news right what was
missing from this because we essentially
got a similar post from Jeff back in
December right yes and uh let me see I
kind of want to find it now just to look
at it but um and why did he commit this
like as a fire l like there's no
conversation around this you know it'd
been better if it won't they won't
accept it won't accept pull requests on
this they said I thought was interesting
um yeah but I suppose you could open an
issue and have discussion there you know
or they should have like so submitted
like a link to a forum post and like
Heather cuz the discussion carry on over
there but where we go here we go uh so
meteor
here's a post from jeff i'll give you
the link so you can pull it up as well
by then paste yes so this person
februari februari right februari 19 so
we're about two months out from this
post and it talked about meteor 1.3 um
and talked about like once 1.3 is out
we're gonna start publishing meteor core
through mpm so hopefully we'll see that
with 1.4 again I think that's a pretty
fundamental change as well I don't know
that that feels like a 1.4 to me um but
who knows a new build tool right that's
what we were promised we were promised
faster rebuilds and code splitting and
all kinds of stuff along these lines and
that is sorely lacking from the roadmap
and I would just say like being in the
feathers there's a meteor chatroom of
feathers um you know a lot of what
people are complaining about our bad
build times and reload times know as our
support in core really bad first initial
load time for bigger apps that have a
lot of complexity so we're talking about
code splitting just a ton of stuff like
this guy had this like 15 bullet point
list of reasons why he's frustrated with
meteor and it's like I look at this list
and aside from like there's the MongoDB
component maybe being addressed by
Apollo don't see a whole lot else being
addressed in that list hmm that's tough
man it is a lot meteor ah still love it
i think 1.3 made me fall in love with it
even more eden yeah you know here's
here's my prediction like all I see when
I look at this roadmap or I look at what
meteors doing between now and say the
end of the year is like to me it just
seems like there's gonna be a lot of
pain you know like really yeah we're
gonna be moving to NPM which means that
package just like at the
not atmosphere but the meteor package
system goes away right most people
confuse atmosphere as a beggin strips
gonna stick yeah um but you know there's
pain involved there right like our
account system tied into that mm-hmm and
I also know that they're doing a large
refactor on the account system hopefully
that's done well but given the may be
slight degradation in quality coming out
with the the 1.3 release like again
there was a lot there I feel like we had
more problems than we've had with other
releases like I just I worry about
what's gonna come and we're not you know
again they're trying to figure out how
to do all this without deprecation like
let's get some duplications in there and
start to understand where these pain
points are going to be I think right now
until two point oh they're they're
running with like optimizing the stuff
that they already have and so like this
roadmap kind of does that so like we're
like eighty percent there in a lot of
areas you know like mpm integration like
okay we're there but now there's still a
sharp edge where we got atmosphere and
like what's the story with that okay
we're going to round that out you know
and uh lays we're going to round that
out you know and then we're gonna get
going with MongoDB node for like like
this they're cleaning up all those
messes um and with NPM like everything's
opened up for you now so come to point
oh we're going to have they're going to
have like a solid platform people are
going to be happy if people stay at one
point oh they're going to have a really
solid product I think I think that's
what they're looking at it at a business
standpoint and 2 point 0 is going to
probably be like pretty intense rewrite
you know with Apollo integration uh
meteors gonna be so it's it's gonna be
like half the person it was before right
but it will colleges which is also
interesting right because we're building
real-time pub sub set up snap and we're
being told that Apollo is gonna be the
way the future but I what's that mean
does that mean DDPs like going away then
for sure because then I don't want to
write too many publications well it's
interesting so we got a meteor night
coming up soon and i think sasha was
going to be given mmm i think he wants
to squeeze in like a lightning talk of
like a van example a working example a
little bit hollow so and they have they
have their apollo guide up now which is
looking pretty pretty hot they have to
repose that are getting a lot of
attention they got their apollo client
that people can look into to see where
they're at with it and then they have
their graph ql tools which is really
nice but that is the question is the
wild card that is the wild card it's
almost like yeah I I like this this is
I'm going to go back to like my business
acumen this is going to be rounding out
one point oh so that when they go to two
point oh they're leaving people on a
good foundation for one point oh you
know there's gonna be a lot of people
aren't gonna upgrade or at least it's
going to be really slow going some of
the massive apps to get to two point oh
right yeah yeah right I guess to me like
we've I don't know like maybe the
problem I'm having here is that we're
fundamentally changing how we build
meteor apps like it was a big enough
change that I'm getting you know
fundamentally changing for two years you
know but it's not though it's not right
I mean like my third different router
now I have 3i I'm on it I'm writing my
subscriptions in a a different way which
I changed six months ago which I changed
six months before that as well ah yeah
it's not not the same though to me like
we're talking about like entire paradigm
shifts like if you go look at the guides
it looks nothing like what I built a 1
point 0 app right and I get that that
that's changed for sure um but like
imports and how they function and like
how people should build apps now it's
like
completely different and for that change
to be so drastic between 1.2 and 1.3 is
a little though shocking to me I guess
yeah it should I think I did right now
I'm having here is it seven to two point
oh and should have been to point up they
should have partnered with the node
community more made it like a major
release it coming out party like hey in
this sat on her own anymore we're with
you guys and looking at this list I
think it's a good list when you realize
that the media team smaller you know
like that's the other thing you have to
account for like sashko and is it Jared
it's pretty much it um there-there off
in Apollo land and you know you've got
zol and ben newman and tom coleman Tom's
doing a lot of documentation work tom is
primarily documentation right he's not
on the meteor tema I don't think he's on
just a documentation side of things mmm
yes so I mean that's that stuff's all
interesting to you like you have to
account for that if you go look at the
commit logs actually it looks like it's
mostly been mmm writing code lately um I
hope that they get someone else in there
helping out with code yeah well this is
this is like a short-term roadmap it's
definitely not the exhaustive roadmap
that we had in the past in trouble well
I don't I don't think you'll ever see an
exhaustive or a comprehensive roadmap
because like I think they catch nothing
but flack now for yeah i mean the things
that were on a long-term road map and
change right like i was reading an
article the other day how about the
Bengals and like Marvin Lewis wanted a
succession plan for when he retires keep
Hugh Jackson around make him be the head
coach right and Paul Brown the owner of
the Bengals wasn't willing to
duh put that in writing mmm uh he didn't
know what the heck would happen in in
the next two years so I don't know
interesting it's interesting right yeah
so like we we give them flack for for
not having an exhaustive road map and
then they get they get flack if they do
put an exact exhaustive roadmap totally
totally no looks like it's interesting
because it's just it's very different
right like what what they're building
now is still trying to check some of the
boxes that they had on their list but it
looks very different than what everyone
thought it would look like two years ago
the import exports is an amazing feature
I I was right for me without knowing
they got the readability just went
through the roof oh yeah that is a huge
thing right there and the imports folder
that's ugly that is stupid heck it is
but you know two point O is coming
they're gonna certainly get rid of it by
then they chose efforts compatibility
rather than doing a two point O was 1.3
okay that's what it is our apps are
better still that we get that weird
folder okay like I could I could move
from I can move forward with that and
and that's a decision they made great do
they have time to like fix that or say
or even look back and like contemplate
on the decision no because they're
working on amazing stuff right now yeah
when you know it's missing from this
list what's missing from this list is
the 2 point 0 meteor stuff like that
still under wraps so I could see why
this short this list is is short and not
so much not so impressive because
they're they're finishing the one point
oh but you know the thing is Apollo and
media are separate things and I think
you're right they're gonna tie big
launch of Apollo to their two point O
release but I feel like they shouldn't
be tied together right like they're
independent projects I'm pretty positive
Apollo is going to be released before
meteor two point oh
I'm like honey actually has to be unless
you're going to have a lot of
communication happening between the
teams there's going to be Apollo there's
going to be that's going to go out for
release clamp this is my prediction I
don't know guess Apollo 1 point 0 or
whatever if they're going to do the same
thing that meteor did and and then
they're going to official galaxy support
and then meteor to point out is going to
come which is going to like nicely glue
everything together right they're not
talking about anything that's going to
be in 2 point 0 in this road map right
here that's what I'm excited about I'm
really hoping that they got some amazing
build tool I really hope that they clean
up some of the messier parts that they
have because of backwards compatibility
we don't know yeah and I won't be around
report on that oh I be I'm holding you
accountable man you know yeah I think
it'll be interesting to to get arbys
perspective in the future because like
they're like as a business there they're
building actual rules that are dependent
on this right like you and i we're like
guns for hire we come in we build
something for someone and then we move
on and the next time we build something
like we're just building with the latest
and greatest version that meteors giving
us but really quickly Bobby's the one
feeling the pain or not feeling the pain
when it comes to this because he's got
limited engineering resources and they
now also just after the fact yes yeah oh
man that could be like a kick in the
balls every time like a release comes
out fun stuff especially work pot they
got a lot of custom stuff built in mmhmm
yeah yep ma'am good show I'm exhausted
show time for lunch oh yeah I haven't
had anything me come on come on I cylay
titfuck bad-looking do my I know have
glasses now
really sad day yeah ah man reading
glasses not too bad man Oh Ted dad I
know has connotations on yeah everybody
gets old then and we get someone at the
restaurant reading the menu exactly hold
on i'm playing my trumpet yes yes oh I
left my glasses at home yeah honey do
you have yours you put on the pink ones
yeah like she's got twenty-twenty vision
she was able to do LASIK to correct her
problem oh cool she's perfect I don't I
don't I won't have anyones glasses to
even borrow apparently Lake prompt this
sigh like doesn't focus as fast as this
I so it causes blurriness problems so
reading glasses will apparently help
with that it has been a phenomenal time
together with you Josh I want to say
thank you yes yes everyone should tweet
to Ben and say thank you for spending so
much time on the show it has been pretty
awesome it has been great memories this
past year has been my most exciting year
of my whole life thanks much so and this
is a big part of it is is your
mentorship and all the effort that you
put in and brought me in on the loop so
thank you man yeah it's been I think
it's been just a lot of years since we
started doing this face dojo show I was
looking the other day so how long has it
been yeah thank you yeah yeah pretty
awesome it is pretty awesome all right
man well can't say till next time ya
know about Iranian you'll be on next
week class that's right yep yeah yeah
100 you don't think we all should get
like birthday cakes or something like
that birthday birthday peers yes we do
all right man well yes as always guys
thank you for listening to the show and
if you do like the show feel free to
join patreon patr yo n.com / meteor club
um and we have the awesome slack room
there just added like I've started at
people that take my training class too
so that things go on like gangbusters
it's nothing bonus yes awesome like the
amount of technical help you can get
when you need it is amazing um seriously
like this is some people say like oh why
did why it why does Jess charge for this
slack room I would not like to slack
room if it wasn't if it wasn't a premium
oh yeah like the feedback that you get
the the noise that's not in there that's
in others it's just like so valuable I
still this day I always tell people and
still this day I haven't come to a slack
room that has so much value yeah yeah
well and I think it stays active and
vibrant because people i don't know like
this is whole theory about when people
pay for stuff they care more about it so
I i I've been part of like slack rooms I
have 3,000 people and it's just like
sometimes dead in there 3,000 people yes
I have accounts I don't know it's
interesting um and then of course you
know modulus do they made a big upgrade
to how they're building meteor apps so
that's much improved mmm digitalocean as
always if you're doing stuff with node
apps like they have and their article
system is amazing making like I added a
swap the other day to this 512 megabyte
server and like they had a step-by-step
article I just copy paste got to face
Wow and that's like newer that's like a
newer technology right I just saw that
on Twitter like what a week ago talking
about swap SWA no that's old technology
man that hey man i'm showing my DevOps
right there that's like computer science
stuff right like when you run out of
memory it's the disk space on your hard
drive that its doors temporary memory
stuff oh I know that yeah we're talking
about two different things there's this
library that they were showing off uh I
want to say it's like swatch is or
something like that or of course of
course there is you who it's like
there's an app for that
there's a jazz lab haha alright well
thanks for listening guys and as always
tune in next week and we will have
another great show for you see you been
