crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using javascript you can find out more
information about upcoming crater remote
coughs at cough crater io enjoy the talk
welcome back to day three of crater
cough mobile edition I am Josh Owens and
I'm pretty excited about everything we
have lined up for today it's real quick
I wanted to mention our sponsors
the first one is Raygun and if you're
trying to get your application into
production there are things that you
need to be concerned about and some of
those are tracking errors and the
performance of delivery of code and
Raygun has a suite of tools that can
help you with that so you should check
them out ray gun die oh the other one is
native script which is backed by TELRIC
which is part of progress now they've
created an open-source framework for
building truly native mobile apps with
typescript and angulation to use your
web skills to get native UI performance
on in Android and iOS
so today our first talk is from Danish
Mohammed he is one of the founders of
Khedira
which is a company that originally
started building performance tracking
for meteor applications but lately
they've been working on something called
storybook which helps you create react
you eyes and today he's going to show us
about the react native stuff that
they've been working on as well so I
will turn it over to him
hello no I'm not okay I'm tarnish I am
for the performance of cadena tools
these days are we are working on a
project called react storybook and
recently started the story for react
native it's basically a tool which lets
you focus your UI development to a
particular component at a time I'll
explain it later but I am trying to do
today's how try to explain how our B
application prototypes faster and how
that story book can be used to do that
pretty good
the thing is when we are building a
prototypes we you should end up spending
time on things we don't want at the
beginning of F when I like you see the
couple of things we spent which takes
lots of time and which can be done at
later stages of the project so when
you're starting something or if you
suddenly come up with a brilliant idea
there are things you should do first and
there are things you should do later and
write the how you do this how to do this
can either speed up or even slow down
you have tuned up on time
what C let's get the first thing is
always try to start with the user
interface because maybe at the beginning
of an app you may be you user maybe
don't have a good idea of what it's
going to do so if you are when you build
the UI itself you can understand it
better and when you're writing you I
also only right parts which serve the
purpose of there like a
this basically is trying to tell you to
avoid male built writing log in forms
and maybe contact and above pages and
stuff like that be take a and just
forget about the process that's the demo
app I'll show you how we can whatever
time what I mean by try this one
the next thing is avoid these things
when doing prototypes forget back-end
service just you play with dummy data
don't use API servers when prototyping
user interfaces it doesn't even make
sense right because you are building
user interfaces you don't necessarily
need back in service for the next one is
user authentication
some people start their projects by
building a better login system and they
spend the first couple of weeks
optimizing it and will be pairing it
with other services the end of the day
they have a good login system and
nothing else so you see these things
take off a lot of time and don't
immediately serve your application and
use function something similar and next
one is try to use cloud services when
you start you there are awesome cloud
services like five days for data with
real-time data and many other stuff and
maybe o'the 0/4 integration if you use
these you can save hours maybe even
weeks for months of your developer time
and when you're starting a new project a
new dawn phone to spend time on building
database and stuff and it's there's also
another group switcher come is using
some managed cloud services because you
don't have we don't did have to worry
about scaling your services because they
do it for you
use you five days later in database and
suddenly you have kicks off and comes up
on reddit or something and thousands and
also so people come start start using it
you don't have to worry about scaling
your back end because it's already 5s
and who is doing it for you
the same it's all zero and I think over
five this is if it comes with a lots of
features you can use straight at all the
screen like user authentication if they
even have satisfy posting for web
application so you can really start
working on talking on these things click
ok and next when you are building
applications try to build navigation
part of its later but it also takes lots
of time usually because you have to you
are always try to do it in a good way
organize your views and your maybe route
or something better and these things
also change a lot when you are building
the app so title to do it later so
mobile apps I tell you how you can just
forget about navigation when you're
starting your application ok god yes
just go write some code ok that's easy
so because everyone's talking about
Pokemon go these days I will build an
app that can be useful for Pokemon your
players
we have iview storybook to help us with
development so let's list all its facets
so to which are people which has all the
information you need and when you're
starting install the Indian module and
while is working on it it's copy Vista
here and this
and this okay now let's stop started
just stop your crap reactivating packet
server we can clean every round spot and
then your soul look they make your
faults a little bit bigger
oh wait I can do this Yoshi's it okay
yeah hello yeah that's better for me
okay now started using you later see you
later
oh don't worry about the other because
we don't have anything to it that's
right okay let's write our first own
tonight
to write our first Roy let's start with
a simple hello world type component okay
let's create a new file right now let's
save some time I will just get it and
just check out for myself
okay now my next a simple yet and it's
battery a component
we're going to text one pops
now the story what oh you can just copy
that's because we didn't load it here
when you write a storybook
well you must know your Storify inside
the configure function we say the
function you passed configure why we are
doing this is because it helps with the
hot module reloading system with
otherwise it won't work
hey all that see and perceive of those
are and we have a hello world story it's
hidden behind this let's add some styles
to make it super cent rate okay I like
to keep my styles in a separate file
let's call it style ojs react make you
reuse the a chaos fit to define styles
this put on line items center and
mystify center which won't Styles
because I'll go so you see are any
changes we make a component or the story
tip or K will deflect let's use a
property
it's empty and let's meet some before
beautiful day and make it up and get the
code from here
it is and just beautiful
and so see to make changes in our
stories you can immediately see how it
already look like in your reacted to
that in this case in an iPhone 6's try
to change the subject
maybe you get the point right is from
rakia done is instead of creating a new
app we just created a small component of
it and I immediately say how it looks in
an iPhone I mean and we can work on it
without worrying about anything else in
our or let's start it's a I mean every a
good component it's time and duplicate
this fantasy in some time let's call it
of talking back we will import left
field component here
and let's import it and so you see it
shows up in our storybook rebab and you
select it should show up here and this
one also needs some Styles you want
probably let's make it flex the entire
screen and we can let's make it show the
users look current location and change
our follow it
I'll show it now if you if you're
working on an app it's a Matthew there's
a that's one the available default on
Dracula - but it only works for iOS and
for this demo we'll just go with it if
you need a platform application you can
there are three narrator good can use
one of those
the application we are building now is
something to emerge Shalu the Pokemon go
game hypothesis when you find a Pokemon
in real world you can just go and test
it and and our users can work together
is to find a poor team or somewhere you
can let your fans know that's the set
document available in this particular
location so what you got what you try to
build today is a simple app to do it for
us and now we have the math key and
let's add some locations I mean this
marked their pokémon should show up and
for that we might need to get the
markers location s react property please
define how it should get input types
let's call them alerts
should be very well gold should be a nap
here and set some innovations
you
yeah the map view only works the map
view which comes it's react native
currently only works with iOS there are
a couple of other prospects for
implementation like map react make you
left GL this this one's used quite a lot
in many I've seen making many places you
can try it out and oh yeah this sounds
awesome
oh why I didn't use one of these
cross-platform things because uh it
takes a while to set up because you have
to pay to do Maps API key and then so
that's why I did the varnish township of
yeah me too
okay just get back to their escape I
deliver
take our let's copy the code from the
report because it saves a lot of time
you
and
Oh
this antenna the same and the time we
add some markers with it
so I'm store this here and select this
one and you see there are three markers
symbol on the map those dude look really
do the hit unless state to use images
you just require them and use them and
when you do if you are add an app and we
make also finds static I like that
oh let's restart the react native packet
so applies it will show this error I'm
going to restart strongly and now it
should look
yes
with mothers and let's write in but ok
check to see are now we have the one of
the important features of our I mean we
are getting things done right I mean
instead of working on a login page user
registration and stuff like that we are
working on what really makes our app I
mean what it does what it is supposed to
do in yeah you see those along ok let's
wrap this up and get back to totally and
the next component when you're writing
components are type Campos components
each one usually are in how you're react
native this view should look like this
you have the map and on top of that you
we have some other its internals like
some point are we publish new progress
and stuff like that so instead of
writing everything into a single
component try to break them up and and
this in this example will we are we also
wrote the react map we component and
what we are going to do is write a new
one core pokey map poking at page and
let's add this map into it and some
other stuff as well I'll duplicate this
one
I just this one that's easy
ah 1603 fresh looks this report every
fall if you don't tell you that sorry
for that page and when sitting when
sometimes we have to get props from
post-oil nested components and when we
are doing it uh we can just use for pipe
foundation rules from music component
itself say yeah we are getting a lot of
property here and we are just going to
pass it to our map later
so yes good pop types from poking a few
plus itself so if we change there it
should also hold effects here no need to
add before topsoil because it's it
should be it should happen inside I am
points and here 7b and more lap to here
and the ethics time is fun
Oh
yeah I'll get the code from here it's
always this messed up in there I can and
give into this hole
yes mister
yeah depth and sorry about that less I
missed em see this our note stories for
 app page and should short here
to to changes on iTunes and it also
needs some styles see
and what we need next is a submit button
over here we can write the button in
this component all better we can just
create another component for that button
you
yeah
let's get the code from here because
it's much easier button and it starts C
and this and the Battle of here
now we have to walk in order to get a
better look
let's add some annotations you can copy
this file and just enjoy that movie yeah
in the whole time not you look okay so
you see a cure right if you start with
the login page or and stuff like that
you must be still working on those and
you won't have something to show at the
end of the day so what time time says in
this in this application
what if suppose do is show markers they
are pokemons
come up and allow users to submit a new
pokeballs so you submit new locations
and they show up so this is one of the
most important views in this mobile
application and we just finished it so
that's the point
yes
all right so thank you for the talk that
was uh it was pretty cool to see like
just building the react components using
storybook appreciate that
and now brief word from our sponsors
before you see the rest of the talk
Raygun spent more time building great
software and less time fighting it
Raygun helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Reagan calm
native script back by telluric by
progress is an open source framework for
building truly native mobile apps with
typescript and angular to use your web
skills to get native UI and performance
on iOS and Android
enjoy the rest of the talk uh yeah so
Ryan asked oil sorry will
yeah absolutely I I like to share that
water further before we just did uh oh
yeah okay the repo begin typical day to
be awesome so uh Ryan asked what exactly
is the point of storybook what does it
offer you I've not been able to figure
out from you talk about what exactly it
was giving you that you would not
already have just with the react native
client so today we beat that yeah so
Ryan asks like what exactly is the point
of storybook he's not sure what he gets
with storybook over say just using the
react native command-line tool hey uh
this is a quality features to see a
prototype says uh over here we don't
know the exact effect I'm into and write
the complete aperture because there's
lots of other things too right we just a
super UI and
just work on this case create the hello
world find those things on different
parts of the recognition maybe we don't
have worry about anything else because
we work on things single component we
work with a couple of scenarios
and we can just focus and open it
without falling out anything it's
s5000 19th fluid oh did I answer so I
think for me like the thing that I got
on that is that you're building the
components without having to worry about
hooking up to a database or a reactive
data source or you want worrying about
user accounts like you're just building
the individual components that you need
to create the mobile application you
don't even get up your mobile
application you just work on the
component itself yeah so it's it's it's
allowing you to focus on building a
react component or a react native a
component that's a fully functional that
you can then go back and plug in and
hook up in your application later is
that right yeah yeah decibel and then
there's there's also some integration
with testing as well with is that true
or no Oh hold on whoops yeah like
Genzyme or no uh-uh not yet I can say uh
but uh literally we had we had a couple
of issues on the actual look we talked
before and a couple of interested people
I mean yeah really
we should we are going to check them off
home and we certainly will come
contributions like you can question the
pool request we need
sitting at the same time okay and we'd
also worked on it we have died we are we
are working on that of no stop right now
we explore and specially we actually do
story book still means or work he can
learn more easier to use so this ah that
is when we have a title from it might be
a part of a book maybe to integrate
serve all right ah
so Sebastian asks can you share your
with us your Adam set up Oh like plugins
yeah
I think that's what he meant I don't
know if maybe you could pop those into
the I'll invite you into the slack chat
and maybe you could pop in a couple
plugins there for people that are
following along yeah I put it on yet
okay today's yet alright um and then
someone asked what is your terminal app
is it the standard OSX terminal with
some sort of skin or is this applies oh
I can't I go John and I'm using oh my
the hell with it oh the theme stuff
awesome
and I put I like Bigelow yep okay all
right well uh thank you
Danish really appreciate it um I think I
think was a great talk and we'll take a
short break and then we'll get started
with the next talk in a few minutes
thank you thanks again
thanks for watching this crater cough
talk from the Mobile Edition 2016 for
more information about upcoming
conferences such as the one in February
2017 go to camp crater IO to learn more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
