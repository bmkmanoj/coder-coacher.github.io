kind of chaotic let's see Wendy's taking
the kid they're taking the oldest to
camp first overnight camp kind of weird
and then I'm gonna take the younger two
to swim practice and then we're meeting
my brother there he's gonna drop off my
nephew we're gonna have my nephew all
day today then I have to run once Wendy
gets back from dropping off the oldest
I've gotta run to meet a friend for
breakfast
so I just finished breakfast with my
friend and we went to this place I'd
never even heard of before but I knew if
I let him choose like he knows all the
crazy places and so you know here we
went to this sugar and spice not an area
of town I usually go to but it was it
was actually pretty good so and I always
love having conversations with him he
he's just left his job and looking for
something new to do so very very honest
conversations and I really enjoyed it so
so today was interesting seemed like a
day of new beginnings were with the
first weekend to first full weekend too
no school for the kids and swim team for
the kids and that's bringing with it new
patterns and our schedule and how we
handle our day around our house and
that's that's been interesting to watch
it emerged we waved my nephew over today
and I was trying to pair program and
like they were just they were being loud
and raucous II and so I didn't get
nearly as much time and as I wanted to
but then you know I ended up just
packing up early and taking them to the
pool and I think you know to them that's
that's exciting and fun and I just it's
interesting to look at everything that
that changes when you start something
new when you start a vlog like I'm doing
here talking to myself walking looking
at my phone funny sure I'll get funny
looks here but I just
you know seeing the the raw energy and
interest and passion that my friend had
today at breakfast is just it's really
inspiring and so like I wish him the
best of luck in figuring out what he's
going to do next you know hearing him
talk about how he wants to take what
he's learned and apply it and new and
interesting in different ways yeah that
to me that that's inspiring so
if I think about this in terms of
programming which I often do a new
beginning I think it's as a new
beginning is for some people it's it's
something like JavaScript fatigue right
like oh no I gotta learn another new
thing or all these new technologies out
or like just go start a project you know
you look at Twitter and how it came
about like they were building oh do a
podcasting platform and it was just this
weird side project and new and
interesting things have come out of that
I don't really like I get frustrated
sometimes with how things are changing
and job the JavaScript world but I also
look at it as an opportunity to learn to
get better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
