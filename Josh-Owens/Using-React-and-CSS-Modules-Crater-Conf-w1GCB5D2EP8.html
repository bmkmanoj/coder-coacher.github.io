welcome back to our last talk of the day
for crater cough today on the what is
this the february 10th
we have ramsey lani ER with us did I say
that right ramsey no it's linear not
linear totally totally butchered it all
right
so Ramsey works at include and writes
all kinds of interesting things there
and you've been experimenting with
WordPress and graph QL and all kinds of
fun things mm oh yeah
WordPress yes so all right all right so
I'll let you take it away all right
sweet all right this is weird talking to
my computer I'm not getting to see
everybody but thanks for sticking around
and let me bring home the last leg of
the first day of creator comp today I'm
gonna be talking about using CSS modules
with react and why inline styles are bad
things I know they're very very popular
and the reaction unity but I hopefully I
can change the minds and hopefully not
hurt anybody's feelings
so okay my name's james engineer i'm on
twitter as very bad hello and raise
Lanier's my github username also there's
links to the slide deck so you can
follow along live in the info section of
crowdcast
and also there's a link to a boilerplate
repo that i'll be going through
if you want to go ahead and clone that
or at least just open it up cool so
first let's talk about why inline styles
are even a thing there's there's some
general issues with CSS the the biggest
issue I think that that inline styles
and other things solve is the fact I CSS
by a is inherently globally scoped
meaning styles are accessible anywhere
and the biggest problem is you could
change a style and have it affect a
different part of your application
without knowing it inline Styles
prevents this by having all yourselves
in your components you don't have to
worry about changing a changing style in
a component and having that affect a
different component this also leads to
some CSS also has huge problems with
specificity conflicts if you have ever
done any front-end development and you
CSS unify know what I'm talking about
this is a nice clip I took from Smashing
Magazine but it shows how specificity is
calculated by the browser and to avoid
some globally global scoping issues
people will like to do super crazy
nesting of styles and it becomes a real
big hassle
this is alleviated by inline Styles
again because everything is locally
scoped to your component and also dead
code this is like a little snippet I
took a website and made a while ago but
you can see margin bottom and Fox sized
our font size are negated by a more
specific style with inline Styles you
don't have to worry about really having
any dead code anything any code that
you're writing is gonna be used by your
component so these there's some other
there's some other issues with CSS but
like these are the main the main things
that you know front-end developers are
really trying
tackle and it should be dealt with
properly but we have problems and Taylor
Swift is my favorite so how do you do
hover things like hover states and
inline Styles how do you do pseudo
selectors or how do you do class
composition you can't do that with
inline Styles can you use you can't use
any pre compilers like sass or less post
CSS how did how how do you how do you
handle these well there's a really
popular package called radium which
attempts to alleviate some of these
problems using England selves so here's
a really good example this is taken
straight from radium's like website
better intro but we import radium and
you can you can see right here on the
button you've got this style the style
object which is an array of styles and
you've got style space then you're
passing in a prop of the kind of button
and it picks that style so you've got
this Styles object down here which maps
to styles here and notice here this is
what radium gives you things like hover
so with radium you can stop hover active
focused and and you can do media clips
so that's pretty that's pretty neat
however how do you do something like
first of type with radium you really
can't I mean this is this is basically
how I think you would probably end up
doing it you'd have to map through a
list of buttons and then figure out if
your index is zero and then give it you
know the the first style here so Styles
first or style space and then do it this
way this is really really ugly it's I
mean and this is just to get the first
up flats of type a little bit more
difficult you want to do every odd one
every even ends of type things like that
become pretty impossible
so i'ma go through how CSS modules
alleviates a lot of these problems using
this example so here I'm importing a NPM
package are called react CSS modules
we're using actually es7 decorators
don't worry
I'll show you how this is all set up so
also I should have mentioned that the
boilerplate that will be going through
is using webpack with babel so you can
use es6 and es7 or 2015/2016 one I'll
call it JavaScript functionality anyway
so we use this decorator and what this
gives us the ability to do is we can now
use style name and base and then this is
just our base button type you know color
white we have a nice hover state but
then you can do regular or the vanilla
or a missus s but you can do first of
type so it's it's a lot easier
I mean this is a contrived example but
there you go so I yeah so I'm gonna go
through a boilerplate setup and show you
how how to use react how do use react
module setup and so the basic setup is
going to be web pack node and Express
server so we're going to use two
configurations in the boilerplate we
have one for development and one for
production if you aren't familiar with
web pack don't worry this is kind of
crazy but it's very similar to a general
web pack setup however the only
difference really here and you can see
I'm using things like web pack dev
server so you can get hot module
reloading and stuff like that so what
packs really really powerful but I want
to point attention to this part so we're
using webpack loaders and basically
what's gonna happen is web pack is going
to look for any file that's got
extension scss and then it's going to
run through these load this loader we're
going to get source Maps which are very
very powerful and it's going to run
through basically create CSS it's
basically going to create classes for us
based on a file based on the path the
file name and then a local variable so
you can see and you can you can modify
this if you want if you you know don't
want underscores or whatever this will
make more sense when I actually go
through the output but this is really
the heart of the set up here and then on
production there's a slight difference
the way this works in in in development
is it's going to inject a bunch of style
tags right after the opening body tag so
you're not going to get a CSS file what
we do want to production is we want it
to generate a CSS file for us so we can
minify the CSS you know you can possibly
serve it through a CDN to cache it it's
not gonna block loading I mean there's
there's numerous benefits as to why we
would want a actual CSS file instead of
a bunch of inline style text especially
we have a very large application so the
only difference here is we're using this
extract text plug-in to basically going
to extract text into a file called app
dot min not CSS this is going to go into
our our distribution our distributed
solar app and I'll show you what this
all looks like but just know that on
production we're going to be creating a
minify CSS file this is the node server
there's really nothing magical here this
is pretty standard in a node server just
see if if we're on development we're
going through web pack dev server hot
loading is set to true yeah cool so I
want to take a break and let you guys
watch this gift because this dad is
amazing look at him he's just he's
sleeping and then all of a sudden
it just magically saves his daughter
from impending doom I don't know why I
included this in the talk I thought it
was really what happened is I feed if he
searched examples to find a good gift
and this is the first one I came up I
thought it was amazing so nice break
alright so this is a link to the boiler
plate it's also in the info section I'm
gonna I've actually chop this up and put
it into the slides so down down below
here we've got all the web pack config
and everything but this is the main
application folder
our main Jas file is its using reactor
router it's basically just saying load
at the loads app or like an import app
the app component and then pass in a
another component whichever route you're
on the only thing really to note here is
that we're importing styles from this
app dot CSS for that sdss it's a sass
file so what that looks like is this is
the this is the font styles that were
importing so I'm inputting some basic
global styles so I want to reset I want
my fonts I want some variables I'm using
the type plate plug-in for all my from
my typography and then from Z and X and
stuff but this is this basically to show
you that like you still do want to have
some global silence but these all these
styles are very very low specificity and
then you can overwrite them using our
Styles into components so when you go to
the the root it's going to render this
homepage component and then it's gonna
render a bunch of sections which are
their own components there's a pin a
page component one thing to note here is
I'm actually sending in a background
image and this will be important after I
show you what these sections actually
look like
so this is the section component it
looks a little crazy but don't worry
about this render post idle part what I
want you to see is we're importing CSS
modules and then we're importing styles
from a sass from a sass file which is
right which is right here and what this
is going to do it's going to give you an
object of all the class names that are
inside section it's not going to give
you any style so it's just going to give
you the class names and then we go
through our we look through our render
we we get a type one thing I should have
mentioned is if you look every section
is get the type it's a prop primary
secondary tertiary and this is what's
going to determine what styles what
everything looks like and I should
mention that this is basically what this
what this homepage looks like so I'll go
back to that but this is basically what
this is rendering so we've got our
sections and our types what it's going
to do is it's going to return ative
style name is equal to type plus a
background class so we're checking to
see if there's a background image
attached to it we want to add a
background class to this because we want
to we want to change some of the
background staffing the other thing I
really wanted to show is that you can
still use inline styles with this if you
wanted to one of the big reasons you
want to use inline styles is for
background images in your CSS file if
you're let's say you're pulling a
background image from your data source
you're not going to have you're not
going to know what that is in your sass
file or your CSS file so you're going to
want to do that inline style so you can
still do that here we're doing we're
setting the background image style to
the background image prop that gets
passed in and then we do style equals BG
so you can still like kind of abusive
those both together as you want alright
so this is the bread and butter of why I
really love CSS modules
everything is locally scoped and you can
compose different classes so I'm gonna
walk you through this little bit now
let's go back to our sections remember
you have tight primary secondary dark
and tertiary right here so here's our
primary class it composes base and then
it composes a primer it composes these
two classes from a separate file colors
that sass file which I'll just jump
right into the probably be easier if I
look in this up so we've got and notice
that it's importing all these classes
from these different sass files so you
can get very very very like this if
you're familiar with atomic CSS where
you have one class one class for every
style to my notifications off rookie
mistake you can have one class for one
stuff so for instance I got child one
container justify:center from flexbox so
I'll go into styles and look at flexbox
and all I've got our classes with one
style to it and then you can compose
classes inside of it so every one of
those sections is going to be base but
it's also going to be a different color
primary primary background secondary
background dark background
tertiary background and then if it's got
a background image we're going to we're
going to get some you know background
size cover background position center
and again here's a you can actually do
this is another good thing that you can
do with CSS that you can't do it in
style so you actually have pseudo
elements so you can have before and
after elements which is impossible to do
with inline sides and then we've got our
title which again is composing a bunch
of styles from our typography
the beauty of this is how it actually
generates your classes for you so I'm
going to go here I'm going to expect
inspect the source check this out so if
you look at this div look at all these
classes here these are automatically
generated for us remember when we go and
look at we looked at webpack and fig and
we said generate path name and local
here that's what's happening here at
component sections and then double
triple underscore section double
underscore secondary so the beauty of
this is you don't have to like manually
write these class names out instead all
you have to do is in sections you're
just like base primary secondary dark
and it gets converted for you so you
don't you have locally scoped CSS you
don't have to ever worry about
specificity issues and you have no you
have no dead code also and the last
thing I want to show you is how awesome
hot module and replacement is so let's
look at these titles they're font size
six vertical it's I'm gonna change it to
something ridiculously big like 20 and
save it oops and then we get hot module
replacement with our CSS as well so
didn't have to do any refreshing or
anything like that this really really
drastically speeds up development time
it's very very easy to try to debug some
CSS issues that you have although
hopefully you'll have a lot less the
last thing I want to show you is what it
looks like when you run so this
boilerplate is run using NPM scripts so
when you run NPM build it's basically
going to do a bunch of web pack stuff
and it's going to generate this
distribution folder so your end result
your index file and it's going to
remember
at the very beginning of the talk I said
it's gonna generate a minified CSS file
for you and put it into and link to it
in your head and so then voila here's
your very long minified CSS file so now
you can cache it do all stuff like that
however you don't have to worry about in
in development you still get hot module
replacement because everything's in mind
so that being said that's pretty much my
take on CSS modules I guess we can open
it up to questions now Josh trying to
find the right buttons there we go
alright so feel free to start adding
your questions guys we got a couple here
authors there's no questions no there's
two did this okay since meteor isn't
using webpack at one point three do you
plan to use webpack post meteor 1.3 and
if so what keeps you from switching to
the year way I do plan on using webpack
I actually haven't full disclosure I
actually haven't been using meteor a lot
recently and when I was using meteor 4
for a project that I started at actually
last Basecamp for rear old
I was actually using webpack with meteor
there's like a really awesome
boilerplate for it and so literally all
I was using a meteor for at that point
was just DDP yeah I probably won't use
1.3 I listen to two transmission
episodes three I think when I'm talking
about webpack little shout-out to Ben
and I was a little episode 5 now right
whichever one you talked about webpack
and I mean 1.3 sounds awesome like using
modules is really cool
understand a need to be backwards
compatible with old meteor apps but I'm
a little worried that NDG is gonna keep
falling behind because webpack 2.0 is
about to come out or it's already out I
don't know and so by the time they
finally do decide to use webpack I'm
just a little worried that they're gonna
be a little bit blind so I personally
don't have any plans but configuring web
pack is a huge pain it is yeah it is
gnarly
so yeah I think um you know I understand
like I mean I uh I started with meteor
and I'm like you know open up the node
world for me and and web pack and no I
mean without meteor I never would have
like gone down this path so I mean I
definitely understand why it's so
popular yeah I think you know to me they
remove kind of the config stuff that you
have to deal with and that can be kind
of a blessing and they're also kind of
curating the interesting parts of the
JavaScript community for you uh which
isn't exactly like that can't be a fast
thing right like it took a while for
jQuery to be the clear clear winner over
other options early on so you know that
stuff takes time
yeah cuz I did I dunno I was actually
talking in the Creator slack chat
earlier today with somebody and they
were using react CSS modules with 1.3
and it totally works so like you don't
need that wet pack for this talk it's
totally gonna work in 1.3 all you need
to have is as long as modules the one
thing you won't get I don't think is you
won't get the ability to actually have a
generator CSS file for you I don't think
of production stuff yeah it's going to
inject everything into your HTML I mean
it's it's not a huge deal but
it matters in my opinion it matters
right like having recently written about
CD and in why you should do it I think
it matters that is definitely your jam
and then you know I mean getting it the
webpack right nice thing about webpack
is you can do code splitting so you can
have know a bunch of different CSS files
depending on your entry point but anyway
yeah all right I see grunt grunting gulp
in here yeah if you have questions about
that kind of stuff feel free to pop them
in so we'll keep going on the ones that
we got voted on here we got a bunch of
questions now there we go if our app is
all blaze would you recommend I think
you're gonna be a little a little little
little biased here but would you
recommend to starting to write all new
views we add and react and slowly trying
to transition old views or is waiting
for 1.3 or later perhaps a better time
to start transitioning as a lot of
question that's a that's a big question
for a lot of people I feel like I
actually started doing that I think
right around the time media announced
the react package I guess it was like a
year ago now yeah the beauty of it was
that I was able to like slowly piece out
components I think I think that would
work
so I mean that's if you have an existing
application I mean that's the beauty of
reactants it's really just the front-end
stuff so I mean you can you can throw it
in or replace stuff slowly yeah so yeah
there's a matter I practiced I mean I I
was pretty vocal about my disdain for
blaze at Space Camp
when we were doing like the hack
projects I had these blaze and it's been
a while since I've used it and it was
very slow for me like development
experience wise because I'm so used to
react yeah so but yeah I mean I'm like a
huge reaction so yeah
okay I kind of figured you'd say that
and you know it's funny like we've got
the the comments going on over here and
someone mentioned Sasha's video stuff
which is good and then in the in this
lecture we're also kind of having a
conversation back and forth about
whether it blaze is dead and my personal
opinion is okay they effectively kind of
killed it by saying we're not gonna
we're not gonna use it going forward and
then they were writing the guides and
they're like holy crap we can't write
these guides oh no we're not gonna kill
blaze right yeah I don't know for me I
think that caused a lot of the momentum
to shift more towards react and I think
that we're gonna see a lot more
interesting stuff happening in react
going forward and I would probably push
that way myself
yep just from what I'm seeing there it
looks like like people are worried that
react is going to be something different
well there's going to be something newer
than react next year or two years from
now and yeah I mean that may be also
I maybe I'm weird but then I love I love
it I love the constant churn of stuff
but I'm weird yeah like I like playing
about the new stuff definitely I mean
you know I think it's like comparing
react native and Cordova right like
Cordova was a great tool to get us
somewhere and react native is like a
better version right yeah I mean the
other thing about reactors I honestly
don't think it's going away anytime soon
mainly because it's I mean the hot new
thing now or it's not new but it's
becoming a lot more popular it's
functional functional programming right
so then you get into functional
functional UI components I mean that's
that's the beauty of reactants you can
have pure pure function components that
you know are very very easy easy to use
and build I mean once you once you get
over the learning curve which does take
a little while like it becomes second
nature just probably like like you know
using blaze was when you had to write
helpers and you know trying to like
transition from like learning really
ought to use events and blaze over like
jQuery you know yeah am bleah
stop rambling alright wouldn't you be
sacrificing portability by building your
components in this way Ryan
Birgit that's it it depends on how you
do it so when when I was you saw me
composing all those classes right that
definitely is not going to work unless
those files that you're composing
classes from are they right so I mean
that's a great point
but I mean you can definitely structure
your app to where it's only using styles
from inside of its its own files or what
you do is you make a component or like a
you know you make like a package that
has all your basic styles right like
your your reset your your typography
Styles stuff like that and then you just
include that in every package and then
those files will always be there and
then you can pop in your your UI
components as you see fit it takes a
little bit more I guess the answer is it
takes a little bit more planning upfront
but maintaining is way easier and that
is always the pain point when developing
websites at least for me as a front-end
developer nice alright Jesse wants to
know the thuggees styling ever feel
completely okay I the only time I ever
use it is like I in my example when I
use background images so I use that a
lot in like my WordPress experiment like
pulling in background images from from a
database and then using that but that's
the only time every every other time
it's whack
I did give this I gave it a very similar
talk like last month attached to people
live and some people were like getting
pitchforks ready to run me out of the
room because they're like super
entrenched into inline Styles but if I
can like convince one person to not use
inline Styles and go go the way of CSS
modules I'll be a happy person that also
being said like because development is
so like things change so fast like I'm
sure there's other solutions out there
that I haven't even I don't even know
about that might be better than CSS
modules I've been using them for six
months and I haven't like even I've been
so happy with it I haven't like even
tried to find a replacement for yet what
are you using instead of meteor these
days the mean stack well I guess I mean
the project I'm using I'm working on is
WordPress without PHP so it's my C I
guess it's means Act but instead of
Mongo it's my sequel essentially oh it's
not angular either it's react so I mean
our earth burn stack I don't know yeah
nothing broke a key yeah but it's made
of e and that's and I don't know where
you I don't know where graph QL comes in
or relay and now you get like this long
thing but I am using I mean the project
that I'm actually like the application
application I'm actually using is it's
still Mongo with meteor it's just using
webpack as a build tool the bless you
stick that I just burped in it was
audible wasn't it unless love
alright are you just out of luck for
some of the more complex pseudo
selectors Oh
within lifestyles me yeah I have assumed
that's what the question was like if you
want to do like one of my favorite
pseudo selectors is like not first of
type or not last of type because then
you don't have to write like you know if
you have like a list of items and you
want them to have spacing between them
you can do like margin bottom one Ram
but you don't want it to be the last one
so you just do not last the type margin
bottom one RM and voila everything's
nice and style for you trying to do that
is inline Styles is like impossible you
have to write like a loop for all your
elements and like it just becomes
untenable if that's at that at that
point I think how long do you have to
write code for the hot load to make up
for the configuration cost up front of
web pack I mean the boilerplate that I
have that I showed you it's like
Frankenstein between lots of other like
boilerplate things that I've kind of put
together to work so I'd say I probably
spent like maybe five or six hours like
getting it together he's he's requesting
in seconds please oh and seconds yeah
yeah I don't know 180 thousand seconds
anyway I mean it definitely I mean if
you're just trying to like create an MVP
and it's like release it black then you
know by all means like use meteor but
with you know just blazing or inline
solves whatever but if you're like
building application with multiple
developers and you all have to maintain
different different aspects of the
front-end like it's way way easier and
the other thing is like
I have the biggest thing when I like
when I do WordPress development with PHP
like for clients like I have to like
really like name space out all my
elements and think about it and hope
that when I change a style it doesn't
like affect a style on another page
somewhere and then when it does like I
figure I find out like two days later or
whatever I messed this style up probably
cuz I don't have like really good UI
testing framework but that brings up an
interesting point have you ever used any
kind of UI testing framework like I know
I I don't even think there are many
around anymore but there used to be one
that Facebook had that would like render
the page and then like render the page
with the new code and like serve all the
differences there's some oh man I saw a
really great talk on it and there's this
one testing framework that like works
with browser stack and like you
basically give it a list of browsers
like operating systems and it will run
through all your tests and give you like
videos and screenshots with everything
it sounded really awesome it took like a
lot of configuration I think it works
with like selenium to give you like a
headless type of phantom jazz type of
thing so I can try to remember the name
of it I can't move any wood I'll think
about it
I remember I'll put it in slacks
environment yeah awesome
all right uh we'd take a few more or in
is inline CSS visible in the browser is
it possible to debug them in the browser
don't they show up like in chrome
they're like the top like element I got
my inline styles or with CSS modules
with inline Styles it's going to show up
yeah in line Styles yeah that's the
other thing like I mean they I feel
there I didn't even mention it's about
inline styles but like because you're
not using classes
that are repeatable so if you want to
like debug in the browser like you can't
just go and change like a valley like a
font size in the class or like a
background color in class and have it
change through every component you have
like because they're all in line there's
no classes so I that makes it you can do
it by element in crow because the Styles
are all in line if you're using CSS
modules with classes then obviously it
makes debugging a lot easier
the other thing I forgot to mention is
server-side rendering becomes pretty
difficult to do responsive if you're
using inline styles because everything
is rendered on the server and you don't
know necessarily I'm sure there's
probably a solution to this but if
everything's rendering on the server you
don't know what the viewpoint the
viewport is or like how big the screen
is that it's rendering to and so if
you're using inline styles to calculate
that that's not gonna work very well
whereas CSS media queries you don't so
worry about any of that stuff so another
reason why you micelles it's probably a
solution to that somewhere but little
aside there server side yeah so as
someone someone mentioned ghost
inspector is that may be what you were
thinking that's not it no no it'll come
to me in a second okay so Darren asked
is there a place where common web pack
configs are published place called
github yeah I don't know man just like
like usually I usually will just Google
honestly like the things that I found is
like I'll usually just Google like using
webpack with reacts and graph QL and
then some ones are in the prep
boilerplate for and it's alright so it's
always a link to to get up somewhere I
mean that's usually how I found them
yeah that'd be pretty neat sir I do yeah
medium is good that's what everybody is
now that'd be a good they make like a
repository of a good web pack
configurations for different types of
projects
yeah I've seen other stuff like that
right like so something more like
atmosphere where people can just say
like oh here's a web pack config yeah
mm-hmm interesting you just do yeah
all right so where can people find out
more information about this PHP list
WordPress is word Express tayo would it
was trending on the front page of github
blaze yesterday
nice I got some stars shameless plug
I can talk about that briefly although
it's not I am using a minute I am using
inline style I mean uh so no I'm using
CSS modules there yeah so basically it's
a it's a node application with express
and then it's using graph QL server and
relay to query a Mongo I mean a sequel
database and then fetch the data and
pipe it into react components it's been
really cool like I actually wrote a NPM
package I'll get a link for that second
that basically you all you have to do is
give it some connection details to a
sequel data word press database and it
will like automatically connect to it
and then give you access to of my sequel
I mean a graph QL schema so that's like
that's been that's my first ever NPM
package and hopefully I wrote I spend a
good amount of time writing
documentation on it so hopefully make
sense I just put that in the link there
so that's been it's been really awesome
I actually gave a presentation on
yesterday and
I'm like really excited to see I'm
waiting for someone from WordPress to
contact me because they've they've I
hope it happens
they've already like rebuilt of admin
interface and node Calypso and so I
think they know that the future if they
really want to be like not just a
blogging platform they want to be like
an application development CMS type of
thing then that's the rabbinate have to
go yeah
so the I'm really excited about reactive
graft ul because I think that would be
like really really cool to work with and
yeah I saw you you left some comments in
there yesterday didn't you yeah I've
been like poring through the that's a
meteor data repo all the comments about
their building graph QL reactive graph
QL and I started playing around with
some Redis caching trying to like figure
out how they might do it and I realized
that it's like way over my head
I'll let sashko and err know to figure
all that stuff out but I am like super
behind it it's gonna be it's gonna be
pretty awesome it James Wright James is
working with them just enough Justin
sorry Justin oops well I do think James
is maybe giving input to yeah it doesn't
work it MGP no no I know but I think
sashko look seems like really open to
working with people outside of MDG
possibly so that's that's really awesome
to hear yeah indeed alright last
question I think we kind of went over
this but Robert asks can you cash in
line styles
this was the CDN stuff we're talking
about right like I don't I don't know
how that would work I mean I guess if
you're doing I mean I I guess you could
it would cash yeah I mean you're caching
the view of the whole view component
itself right if
the rendered HTML so I mean it's in line
with HTML so if you're a catch in a page
it would it would curl so if you're
using something like an e-tag and
checking the if modified since header
and that kind of stuff that would all
get cached in there which actually would
potentially be bad right if you change
the inline style like tags should change
yeah I don't know that's not my area of
expertise but yeah I mean you can
definitely definitely caching I think
you'd have to be it have to be rendered
on the server obviously because it would
be like that style gets determined if
it's not server-side render it gets
determined on the fly like when the
component is being rendered yeah all
right
so that was it awesome first date done
yes I think we'll just end by saying
that it looks like blaze won our little
informal viewer poll here we took a poll
what fun an option to use with meteor
yeah 12 votes reacts 15 by just one
angular there we go
I did another Oh Oh No all right all
right cool it's close it's not not like
Sanders Clinton Iowa close but close
everybody he's just using me you're
comfortable with it I don't like arguing
with people because I feel like it's not
productive like just go build stuff if
you want to go there blaze like yeah
it's not really gonna be much different
let's just wait honestly jQuery Pete
wants you to build everything in jQuery
so he can go hack you easily yeah all
right well thank you everyone for tuning
in thank you Ramsey for the talk
appreciate it thanks
all right we will we will be back
tomorrow with four new talks will be
exciting
