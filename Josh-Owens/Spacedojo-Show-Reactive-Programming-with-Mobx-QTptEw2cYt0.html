host josh owens and today we have a
special guest with us Michael actually
how do you say your last name Michael
I'm terrible Leslie Michelle West razem
okay awesome Michelle is that what you
said yeah oh wow it's like that like the
French name yeah awesome so you actually
put out a project called mob X and
that's what I wanted to talk about today
can you tell me a little bit about my ex
and what it is sure so mobile base in
essence is a reactive programming
library but that sounds more academical
than it actually is what is allows you
to do is to decorate objects and say hey
this is data which forms the state of my
application and then and then then it
delivers you a system which can drive
all other things which are important
your application from the state select
the UI like sending messages around
making network requests those kind of
things
okay and so this is maybe analogous to
something like Redux or no actually it
takes quite a different take on state
management usually I just related to
like spreadsheets so we have some data
and you have a lot of formulas an
interesting question is when do these
formulas need to update and so it's
actually focused on a other part of
sight management's not not that much on
how do you change the state how do you
control that which is what really sells
it's more of a given estates how can you
make sure that the rest of your
application is consistent with it I see
yeah so I come from a meteor background
and so we have in meteor land um mini
Mongo and pub sub and then we have a
library called tracker which kind of
keeps track of the i guess the state
right that the cash may get my stuff at
any time one of those reactive data
sources change it kind of it forces a
recomputation andrey rendering so like
how much is mob x handling of that kind
of flow like let's say I mean how are
people typically building a mob except I
guess is what I'm asking like where
their data sources coming from and
resently yeah so what's mobic actually
inspired a lot by tracker what it does
is actually a quite similar check are
going to the term transparent reactive
programming and that this was mobile
does as well the difference is that a
tracker is very most couples to a
framework like a meteor and it's geared
to watch updating the UI and connecting
gets to your data sources well no bigs
took a more generic approach which is
basically more like I have some states
and I have something which derives from
it and then might be you I it might be
something entirely different and so I
did say lots of research about how
people are using a tracker meteor how
they use no cows and what issues they
run into and it seems that a lot of
issues were caused by the fact it's what
trackers does is not always predictable
or that's how it appears to people
and so there are some fundamental
differences which my big stakes like
making sure that everything that is
derived from the states is updated
synchronously and then from that point
on it doesn't matter anymore whether
it's you are your days or random other
system calls answer to get back to the
question how you people use it is that
they often define a store or a which
contains models and those things are
observable and from this mobile is
usually mostly mostly used in
combination with react so there are
compared components that use these
observables and their mobiles make sure
that those components are based in time
and from the other side of things most
server calls are made using the classic
rest libraries like super agent or
eggshells and in response to those
cervical people just update their models
mobic takes it from there so either how
you update your states and what you
drive from it is not of much concern
mathematics so it's like more of a small
piece instead of providing the full
stack
okay so what would drove you to write my
bags we are I think roughly a year ago
we started this greenfield project and
that was actually a new projects death
but we knew the domain it's needed to
handle very well because those actually
the migration of a dis fabrication to to
the web and the domain we need to handle
most very complex to give a rough ideas
has about 500 different classes
describing the domain I think the
Taipings alone are like 10,000 lines of
course just describing with attributes
there are are so the question I started
with is wells what is the codes I
actually want to write and what is the
gods I want the system to create for me
so to say so I started with a pen and
paper and I like to react at the time so
I starting writing react components and
I just had things like okay I want this
components to render dish attributes
maybe there are some limitations in
between maybe it looks and deep into a
objects but I still want to just write
this and I'm not interested in
subscribing to data or figuring one
instead when because well I feel domain
is dead big that becomes really tedious
so and basically I took it from there
and I figured that the thing came close
to swore systems like meteor and knock
out which also handle and tracking
mostly a transparently so that people
don't have to subscribe to the data
sources and have to change that whenever
their components that changes so that's
basically how it all started
nice and so you actually you guys use
mob X in production then yeah yeah can
you tell me more about like where you
work in and I guess at that you guys are
done yes I work at their computer called
mendax we have our headquarters in
Boston but our recent film area office
is actually in rotterdam netherlands and
so what we are building is an
application studio a kind of an IDE but
mainly focused on consultancy firms so
they use our software to build and
design applications often for insurance
companies or banks or governments so
like a really enterprises stuff but to
build those applications we offer a
standardized class hosting solution and
development studio in which you can
officially edits most things of your
applications like the form the data
model business rules and so we have a
like a deck adult video for death which
was basically a c-sharp cereal which is
still news but we also now making a web
version of that same thing
I see ok
so I'm just kind of like I'm looking
over the Daleks as we're talking here
from mob x um it looks like you're
you're actually using a decorators is
that is that required here no that's
entirely optional and I use decorators
because it makes very clear the mind
sets which you need to have fun using my
base so if decorates you can tell you
mark this is states these are actions
and these are things that are derived
from States mm-hm so I use it in
examples a lot because mix it's really
clean and post it down to the essence
but you can use it in a plane es5
environments as well every decorator has
a normal function alternative to to do
the same thing yeah
nice so um you changed the name from mom
I guess mob servable ya get the score xx
and you talk more about like that name
change and why you did it yeah so I'm
observable back at a time started like
which problem I just describes and I
hacked something together in the
weekends and then I we started using it
and start improving it and we were quite
satisfied and actually when fisting a
few conferences I was like hey how those
people are handling state management in
react applications we have something
that's it's way easier to use and I
think more scalable as well so I figure
at the time it should be open source and
a share to the community so that's what
I did but then I just observe all sounds
a little scary the name suggests that
it's like the observable verve objects
proposal which has been cancelled and
actually took some idea from there and
but it sets are people on one foot and
because it's actually a reactive
programming library so that's what I put
in the X at the ends and shorten the
name so that is it was also recognizable
for existing users
cool so I'm kind of curious like hearing
you talk and you said you were inspired
by like meteor and view and knock out
those kinds of things like why why build
a library rather than just use one of
these kind of existing frameworks order
set ups yes basically there are several
reasons for that first of all we knew
that this was a very long running
projects and we wanted to don't didn't
want to go in a full on a single
framework because usually if you are
able to fit everything within the rules
of framework is fine but as soon as you
want optimize specific for parts then
you are often stuck for example we
dislodge with dojo in the past and it's
really hard to migrate from system
opinionated framework so we already
figured if you wanted to use react
because it's that's just an objection on
the view layer for example then then the
issue with a knockout and meteor also
backbone as a day those reactive
algorithms are specifically written to
work with the rest of the framework but
it's hard to use them outside for
example you also use mobiles on the
server sites for things we have partners
using our SCH which are powered by my
base an entirely different architectures
and having an library that just does the
reactive thing without all the rest a
four-step flexibility
I see ya so I'm lately I've been
thinking that libraries tend to be
sometimes they take more time to
integrate but maybe at the end of the
day like it's it's they move quicker and
they solve the problems slightly better
than I think opinionated frameworks can
um and that's just I think maybe that's
my experience like coming from meteor
and feeling like we're locked into
components that aren't necessarily being
updated very often right like they went
yeah look from a team of like eight or
nine people to like one what kind of
curious like what's the community look
like around mob x are you getting like a
lot of submissions like how much time
are you spending on like updating and
maintaining it lately a lot actually
because the interest is still growing
there are some I think clearly your four
core committer shorter than me and so
yesterday I released a new version of my
bags and actually that's a another guy I
think rebirths roughly the half of the
core algorithm by his own so that was
really cool to see that's somebody else
entirely crooks the codebase Sal room
for improvements and wrote really smart
optimizations inside it I wish I didn't
think of and actually improved the
semantics a bit as well
so while I saw is quite funny that's the
user base gross with roughly the same
rates as people committing add to it
okay nice
yeah I usually I've got a little
calculation i run i just take the number
of commits and divide it out by the
number of contributors and it looks like
you're you're about a 24 average which
is which is pretty good you know i think
the the projects that don't really
encourage community start to get upwards
of fifty or a hundred and the ones that
are like really good at embracing a
large community get down to like 10 or
nine like react i think is that like
nine and a half commits per contributor
so um that seems pretty cool yet a slash
yeah so do you get I mean do you get a
lot of pull requests I mean how much
time do you think you're spending per
week on on mob x
I think lately three evenings and some
commutes time now when I at refer to to
my work
yeah something like that I think abot
it's a bit I actually don't spend that
much time on contributing to a thing
itself or on bug fixing that's quite ok
I think most of my time goes into
preparing talks and shrink question I
improve documentation mmm I noticed for
example that's uh whenever I have here
the same question for the second order
time I really have to put in the effort
to write a question and the answer down
somewhere in documentation to keep it
the scalable and actually what I see is
often I get a lot of similar questions
and then I take the effort to write it
down and then that question disappears
from being asked directly at the Gator
channel or something like that so that
really pays off
awesome actually I'm seeing here also
you've got like a
an egghead tutorial it looks like maybe
15-20 minutes of video yeah yes I think
it's almost exactly a half an hour and
this right and it covers all the basics
of convex after that she should be able
to build pretty serious muaks
applications
it's awesome
and we're also actually also recently
there were some tutorials released by a
goat academy know and loon calls room
codes Academy I think they're called
yeah and they also did a pretty nice job
of showing the essence in I think about
them in saw something yeah yeah it says
12 minutes seen in the dogs it's nice
actually I I'm pretty amazed usually how
quickly people are able to pick up
things I hear I hear people that are
using my big saying things like well I
explained to one of my co-workers and he
also been running with his first
components in 10 minutes and I think
that is because it's what you need to do
with mobiles is very close to the mental
application you have of your application
I think I think it's puts more effort
and the most frameworks in focusing on
what is the essential complexity of your
application and taking care of all the
rest
anything gets that just go off probably
every framework but it feels like it is
working what I hear from people
yeah yeah I mean it seems it seems
pretty nice and like honestly it feels
pretty familiar to me like just looking
at the code and like seeing the autorun
it's not really something that people
use a ton like tracker behind the scenes
does a lot of the autorun for you in a
meteor land and a lot of people like I
teach in a tower course that shows
people like all the parts of media and
one of the things like we just touch on
for a few minutes is is auto run and
it's like it's definitely I think a
foreign concept when people first see it
like what do you mean like it's gonna
rerun when anything changes like that's
that's weird um but I think it's super
helpful um and so yeah I usually explain
that that's like the decor of mobile
bases for functions the first one is
observable that makes data observable
and the second one is observer which you
use Fourier components and which kind of
reps the render function of a component
in otter and that's basically what
happens behind the scenes and half and
then you have so you have also outrun
and computed and basically they do the
same thing they derive something from
the states the difference is that
computers always derive value and alter
and make sure that some side effect
happens yeah so and people should mainly
stick to producing values its thing you
can't reason simply about it's like
formulas in that excel but at some point
you have to britts to imperative
programming to make a network request or
to flush something to do dumb and that's
one autorun comes in it's ideally you
have framework thats takes care of most
of the utterance you would ever need
yeah
yeah it's definitely like I'm looking at
this so for the most part like by using
my backs and react you're able to kind
of take advantage of the fact that
reacts is react is using the virtual Dom
and like it's only going to put out the
pieces that change right so when you're
looking at using some of our observable
data it should be like very tiny changes
are coming through which i think is
different in meteor land like we tend to
rerun
a lot of code that doesn't necessarily
have to be run because auto auto runs
like they're everywhere kind of hidden
behind the scenes so it's kind of nice
that seems like it's not that way with
my bags yeah my big stakes it's a left
of further and analyzing what should be
rerun it's basically because there's a
distinction between utterance and
computed values ah good values are like
well they're failure so even if a
computer failure needed to recompute
with its output didn't change then knows
address of the derivation tree can be
skipped and it orders the derivation
tree automatically for you so that's
things that are I needed early in the
chain our computers first so that's
they're not computed accidentally twice
hmm yeah that's pretty slick
so if people wanted to like get started
with with mob acts like where should
they go I think if you like learning
from videos just follow the egghead
course hmm I think with the first lesson
already you know enough to build
something very basic and experiment with
it and then what's the rest of lessons
to learn more about what is actually
happening it's Andre media are quite
some fiddles you can fork and then
change there are some boilerplate
projects both official ones and more
funds water place submitted by other
people and they're all listed in the
example section I think on the homepage
hey there just wanted to take a quick
second to tell you about something
that's coming up in November Space Camp
two point oh so last year we ran Space
Camp one point O and gatlinburg
tennessee in the mountains it was a lot
of fun and so this year we decided we
wanted to go bigger and it took some
searching but we found an even bigger
place it has 30 bedrooms and it's on the
coast of North Carolina and outer banks
super super excited for this you know
we're going to follow a similar format
to last year so the first day we're
going to have talks and it's going to be
kind of the the open camp style of lake
you know everyone just kind of saying
hey I've got to talk and we'll pick the
best ones in the mole we'll sit down and
listen to those they were great last
year I'm expecting some some touch not
top-notch once again this year we also
have like home-cooked meals the entire
time my wife is an excellent excellent
cook and she's going to make all those
meals and I think anyone that would last
year would attest to how tasty
everything was and how much food there
was
and it was just it was amazing and we
plan to replicate that this year and you
know talks during the day then in the
evenings beer board games a lot of
hanging out talking watching funny
videos all kinds of stuff so if board
games do you think this is definitely
the event to come to I may even try to
bring the ps4 or something we'll see how
that works out the car was pretty packed
last year so I don't know how much space
there will be but if you're interested
it's like November it's like the first
week in november right after the
election so that that weekend the second
day we'll have hacking hackathon contest
where we'll be building fun things using
javascript so if you're a fan of
JavaScript like this is the event you
want to be at so check it out camp
that's based ojo com it will be an
amazing time I promise you see you there
and then there's a mob xjs github daya
as well right ok that's the homepage you
were talking about yeah the song basic
so we talked a little bit about like
redox vs mob X and like looking over
these docks it's clear to me that like
mob X is a just a smaller piece of like
managing that state like you mentioned
whereas Redux is maybe a little bit
bigger right it's it's like a store and
it's founded on the idea of like
immutable data um whereas you know it's
not that's not the case with my ex right
like it'sit's mutable data right yeah
it's immutable data I mean you can use
your Spears of immutable data but you
benefits the best from using mutable
data and their few reasons for this the
first one is it's easier to optimize
people and generally claim a lot better
performance when using mobibucks out of
the box and then when using redux that's
basically because the changes are
applies are not smaller it's like you're
either mutates all of your state or you
mutate a small piece of it
a little fishing what was the question
again I just I guess just the kind of
the differences between Redux and mob
axes when I was driving at seems like
you know redox is a good thing yeah so
it's it's people often Paris like it's
like using automatic gear or many Oh
gearing well I think I'll I critics I I
looks because of the purity of the
abstraction and it's more fun to tinker
about then mobic actually it was this
kind of old fashions goes what you were
eyes then when it's
when it comes to learning and writing
cards I think mobic is easier because
it's more close to the mental model you
have of your data so if you have a user
which is related to a message then you
can just link the user to message and we
shall take care of the rest and then
contractually use immutable data you
have to work with a kind of foreign
references and because there's no yeah
so that feels more awkward I think in
practice to use I mean it's like you are
doing the work I wish the program can do
for you something like that yeah so I'm
curious like have you looked at anything
like Apollo or other kind of data
loading libraries I guess right like
Apollo uses graph ql and it creates a
redux store and like pushes the graph ql
data into the store and then you can
pass that along and use it within a
react application have you seen any
other kind of mob x related data data
loading libraries that makes it super
easy to just say like i'm gonna drop
this in here i'm going to pull my data
over and then I don't have to worry
about it anymore like I can just say
observer on my react component and like
everything works like it should
I think there's not something out of
books which objectives as I as a first
thing I never hands because mod X is not
very opinionated it's very easy to
integrate it recently there was an issue
on the Apollo clients people somebody
wanted to integrate more pics with
Apollo clients mmm and so I i looked at
the docks of the polar clients and wrote
a very simple rapper i think in 50 lines
of code just turns a how do you call
them what's query know below clients
into an observable because what makes
has like like Decker actually this
notion of generic observables where you
just need some lifecycle hooks to be a
hooked up like please notify dreadful
system that this observable change those
kind of things yeah and the other way
around their subscriptions are actually
end up finding it nice that's pretty
awesome actually um after you that'll
work I've just started to dabble a
little in to Apollo I try to learn
something new every week to keep right I
don't know if one new thing a week
really keeps you current and JavaScript
but I think she'd be okay I tried to do
the same until I started outsourcing my
base and then I end any time anymore for
desk yes exactly like open-source takes
time it's crazy um yeah I don't I don't
really do I don't open source a lot of
libraries anymore just because it's like
I know I don't think it um yeah I don't
know like it's definitely I think you're
right like you said earlier you spend a
lot of time a lot more time on Lake
documentation in facts and stuff like I
think that's that's the hallmark of a
good strong open source project is a
really good strong documentation
sure yeah I find it's a actually the
hardest thing to to the rising good
documentation but people are generally
quite satisfied if it's up it's going
well i guess and i get a lot of four
requests on documentation so that's
really helpful nice yeah that is awesome
don't see that all I usually
all right uh I think that was everything
I had I just wanna say thank you I'm
shelf for coming on the show really
appreciate it and if people want to find
you work where can they go to to find
you um so there's the demodex Gator
channel ah it's linked on top of the
readme ah they can follow me on twitter
which is a difficult aim uh and then
West rasa what's Maya I suggest you just
go to the Geezer pace and then copy my
name from the commit message sent and
there yeah it's also much as there's a
link to your Twitter down at the very
bottom of the mob X documentation page
so that'll work too oh cool yeah I
should have fix a mash funny twitter
name that's I didn't think of that six
years ago and and I ambiguous trigger
for four years in that night yeah it
happens alright well thank you again for
coming on the show really appreciate it
yes thank you alright see ya this video
has been in space dojo production you
can click the learn more button to find
out more about us at space dojo com or
