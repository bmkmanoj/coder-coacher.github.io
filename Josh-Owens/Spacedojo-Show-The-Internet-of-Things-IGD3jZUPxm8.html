host Josh along with my co-host been
Strahan and Ramsey linear welcome guys
what's up to you what's up Josh joshie
poo hey that's my nickname for him it
was all it I stole it guys I see how
this is gonna be alright alright like a
war over Josh quick quit fightin there's
nothing tired of total war oh it's on
one point up now edit out would you uh
we have a special guest with us this
week Charlie key welcome to the show
Charlie thanks I'm glad to be here
that's a measure to fight over Josh go
around two well you're at least closer
so I know I know I can I can act it out
you got a leg up there um so Charlie uh
we invited you to show well before we
get into why um you also okay let me
rewind you started a start-up recently
called lo Sam correct correct yeah so
what what is loosened solo but low
stance is an IOT developer platform and
and what that really means is we try to
do three things really easy for
developers building will be called
connected solutions I don't give an
example here a second but the you know
those three pillars that we kind of
think are really important is
connectivity and by connectivity we mean
being able to take any random piece of
hardware whether it's an Arduino board
or particle photon whatever happens to
be and connect it and pulled have it
start sending data to a platform and the
second piece of that is analyzing
visualizing data so you know inside of
our platform you can create dashboards
you can aggregate data there's a
powerful 8di behind all of that and the
last piece is taking action on that data
and we do that through a very simple to
use drag-and-drop workflow
and in that workflow engine you can kind
of define rules business logic up and
the cloud level for your devices and for
the data coming and running through and
that's all meant to happen kind of in
real time now we have kind of looked at
that is a ifttt workflow engine on crack
no is the way can we kind of think of
that but the really real time so now
we've working with the ton of developers
a lot of developers signed up for the
platform we kind of started out by
giving away a bunch of free hardware
that was fun we gave out like 600 kits
and hardware in like five days and then
stop doing that yeah that was a few many
pieces of hardware but you know we also
work with some enterprises really
looking at how they can solve some
bigger problems we're working with the
company of tracking forklifts and
understanding how those forklifts are
interacting in the space and trying not
to create incident so more or less they
run their forklifts in the crab is what
happens but you know like different
examples in the world but really we try
to build a platform for developers that
can be used to create these applications
and it's really targeted for developers
and and with with developers in mind so
like Charlie how did this like idea get
burst yeah so there was there was a lot
of different things that kind of came
together to really do this we had a
start up before this we started in
Cincinnati called modulus which was a no
Jas meteor node of platform as a service
that we started in while we were doing
that we ended up selling that company to
progress software and while doing that
we ended up having a lot of
conversations with people about IOT and
a lot of those conversations revolved
around like could modulus be this
platform for IOT and it really just
wasn't in the plan the vision so it kind
of gave us a little thought around what
that could be
where I live we kind of live in a very
Midwestern area lots of industrial lots
of manufacturing you know my family's
and have been in manufacturing for a
long time so talking to them talking
about some of the problems that they
have and what they're looking at doing
and how they're using technology to do
it really kind of gave me a lot of
passion about 20 trying to solve some of
this yeah I remember sitting down with
my family and talking about some of the
problems they were having with
automating their facilities and learning
about their processes and taking that
and going that's something that would be
a lot of interest and fun to kind of
build and help solve so kind of went
with that and I'm going to a cur so for
a long time my mind agree is in
engineering and have been playing with
Arduino 'he's since then so it's and
that's a bit of passion project to as
well just to get out and play around
with a bunch of different stuff nice so
i'm curious like uh if you I love the
interface by the way it reminds me a lot
like yahoo pipes uh back in the day um I
kind of wish like zapier if this and
that had a similar kind of interface
like what these apps are fun to play
with but I wish there was like a diagram
drawing like this but that's pretty
awesome um how does the data get into
low Sant go to dashboard or to do
real-time alerting area that kind of
stuff yeah so there's a couple different
ways that the data gets in there you
know behind the scenes basically we use
two different methods right now One is
using a REST API you can send data into
the platform the second is using MQTT
which is more of a real-time kind of pub
sub type platform protocol and we use
that as our kind of base layer for
pushing data in and out we've built SDKs
for arduino and nodejs and we've got a
few more coming out so you know kind of
really plug and play from that
perspective we also you can also send
data in using web hooks we've got some
people sitting
data in from a bunch of random kind of
different ways but you know kind of that
core mentality from us is take open
protocols like in few TT and rest and
give access to push the data using those
and push it as much as you want very
cool very cool so I'm interested it
seems like you're bridging the gap
between a enterprise and what I OT used
to be which is like like the hobbyist
yeah malin stuff like like what's what's
it like being that bridge you know uh
it's kind of tough sometimes out so you
know we we take that mentality for a lot
of reasons but you know we believe that
the way the market looks today in the
world of IOT it is is very much in that
stage of it has to be a bridge between
developers and the enterprise's you know
I think we really truly believe that
developers are going to help drive a lot
what a lot of these businesses choose
and how they choose to do it in the
future you know we've seen in the past
with our other companies but it becomes
a becomes a multi-headed problem though
you know one is is working with
developers and building a community and
the ecosystem and there's anything
that's for sure it's developers are
smart and they'll call on you
whenever they get a chance so you got to
be straight forward and be very
value-add in the enterprise space it's
about understanding how you can make
those developers the champions inside of
the company how you can help drive that
forward and and how you bring in the
relevant stakeholders across the
business in an enterprise setting in
order to make a solution app and that
that's a really multi-headed problem
that we find it's fun to solve because
we enjoy working with developers and we
enjoyed thinking about it from a kind of
a holistic solution do and and that's
fun to talk to the VPS and work with the
developers to kind of come come together
and meet that middle ground so but I
think it a lot of it starts with the
developers that's cool yeah can you go
so I noticed that you had like a couple
SD
or do we know and stuff like that so it
sounds like you make you know once you
collect the data like visualizing all
that super easy but keep talking about
how the SDK works a little bit and how
like it helps actually connect devices
to the platform yeah so what we did is
you know most of our SDKs are built on
top of MQTT for the platform's they can
fall back to different protocol and
methods but what they basically allow
you to do is in like seven lines of code
you know connect to the platform and and
start sending what we call state so
sending data directly to the platform
what that data looks like you know it's
kind of up to you inside of low science
you define devices and define more or
less the model of what that data should
look like going into the platform you
know there's some more ad hoc ways you
can do it too but you know that's that's
the preferred because you get automatic
kind of typing on that data and for
visualization and everything else so it
allows for a lot of easy stuff but yeah
the basis that is include the library
you have to generate some security keys
you know looking at io te security is
one of those kind of things you just got
it you got to make sure you cover any
cover well so we kind of do a lot of
different things from the security
aspect one is you can create device
level tokens so you can create a
security token per device that is part
of an application you create them at the
application level so there's a lot of
ways to kind of do that so you connect
put the device in with the security keys
in and and then you can pretty much pull
and push data from the platform that
that device has access to so it's pretty
simple I mean in order to get you know a
UH like a raspberry pi up and running
you or an arduino you're talking 5-10
minutes and kind of got data up and
running now we're playing with some some
cellular devices to start pushing data
to shout out to connect on that but you
know we're starting to work with a lot
of that cellular data as well we've
we've got solutions using the platform
using cellular data and I get answer
a similar so we use the Intel Edison a
lot for our base device which is then
running off the lip linux octo and using
nodejs to kind of push that data which
is a lot of fun we we love note you know
our entire platform is built on top of
node across the whole thing from the
back end and then all of our front ends
kind of build and react and it is a
static static site built to talk to the
API is what it is so that's it's pretty
cool we so it really anybody can build
the interface that we've got on top of
it using the API nice very good I was
actually going to ask like what does
that stack look like and are you guys
like building little micro services then
to kind of handle each each little piece
that you're working with yeah so
starting kind of at the bottom now we're
using google cloud as our infrastructure
layer so we use google compute engine as
the base compute you know there's a lot
of reasons that we chose to go that
route more or less it doesn't really
matter you know it's machines we don't
actually use any Google services
directly we just pretty much use linux
boxes it gives us advantages later on as
we kind of move and scale but so we've
got google compute the nice thing about
it is it does do like encryption at rest
for the drives and everything so that's
a nice security check box to stepping up
layer our main time series database
layer is in flux DB we found massive
success with that modulus we had scaled
that too oh I think we were doing about
maybe 10 billion data points a month
through it when we left there and and we
would ended up switching off a Mongo and
going into influx for that that database
layer now i will say that
we're always looking at other layers
database layers currently just because
we want to know what's available out
there and how the hell thanks for
changing especially in that time series
space because aggregation and and kind
of pulling that data out in real time is
a big part of the platform so we want to
keep evaluating that we also have
sitting next to that Mongo for a bunch
of random data like user data random
semi relational kind of data inside of
the platform and just super easy to use
so and then we've got pretty much node
talking to that across the board the way
that kind of looks like is we have one
service that is collecting the data with
an M qtt broker and that's kind of
horizontally scalable so we can we kind
of have that horizontally scalable using
DNS above it so we've got multiple
brokers that we can redundant Lee have
to pull the data in and kick it in a
database other then it gets really
microservice e with what we call kind of
the workflow runners so the things that
actual do the workflow runners are each
piece is basically a little composed
block that is sandboxed every time it
runs and that can be pulled up and
dropped on to as many machines as
possible to kind of handle the scale so
you know we can scale that workflow
runner fairly horizontally and then each
each block that you would see inside of
kind of our interface or each node is
just a sandboxed kind of piece of
software there oh let's see sitting on
top of that we have an API the API layer
that's directly accessible from the
external world that's that's just the
API that we use sitting on top of that
is an API that's available for
visualization of data someone's getting
you know that
zation of data so anything you've built
in like in a dashboard we actually have
an API to pull that data out directly
from what you would see in the dashboard
block and then the API on top of that
and then across the side or kind of
those SDKs that are all driving back
that um SEK I think that's pretty much
it there's a few other probably little
things here and there ya have have you
ever looked at um react story book just
came out a couple weeks ago I haven't I
haven't could tell me about it well so
it's the idea that like you can create a
react component and it's kind of an
can't encapsulated and you can do all
the design in something like story book
and then publish that what kind of
curious if you guys have thought about
like publishing react components since
like they're set up to really kind of
work with your API data I wonder if it
would be interesting to developers to be
able to pull those in and build their
own dashboard yeah we definitely have
and it's still something that we're
pretty actively looking at just because
we think that building custom interfaces
on on top of the API is going to be a
big way that the data can be used so
we're looking at that we're also looking
at options of any possibilities of open
sourcing any of the components whether
it's the whole thing looked to
individual pieces of the interface and
but yeah the react components is
definitely one of those that were
actively trying to figure out what the
best way to allow people to get their
hands on those and use those is so yeah
it's cool though it's super cool
actually sounds WAY awesome um so like i
want to take take a step back for a
moment and so do you think or is your
primary target like m2m oh you know we
thought about that a lot too and i
should say before you get going maybe
you could explain what m2m is for sure
how the job so m2m is machine a machine
is what it what it stands for but
in them is what we see a lot in some
manufacturing facilities at least in
some other use cases but a lot of its
directly talking machine to machine and
trying to make decisions between those
machines is kind of the lofty goal and
then you can automate a lot of this
pieces and so yeah I think that's a big
part of what we think long-term there's
a lot of potential there what we see
today is will same machine to service
you know is pulling data from machines
and driving them into a service in order
to derive information and insight
alphabet a lot of people are a little
bit weary of stepping back to the
machine now certainly we're gonna see a
lot of like random stuff like you know
and inside of a home or a smart house or
a smart office there'll be some machine
machine type stuff and the more of the
industrial space there's still a little
weary of you you know going through this
system and then back to a machine to
make a decision whereas you know they do
that via a PLC or a control system
inside of a manufacturing that they
would do today so you know I think
long-term absolutely shorter term I
think we'll see more of this machine to
service machine to information machine
to visualization and some of that I'll
dip back into the machine a machine and
that would expand over time so that
leads into my next question which kind
of goes back to an older one but um is
enterprise do you see enterprise like
adopting this like maker mentality more
rather than looking for a complete and
product um cuz like yours yours up your
part of like you're part of a larger
ecosystem that like an enterprise would
come and like kind of mash together
exactly what they need yeah yeah to a
certain extent we are but i will say
that from kind of our go-to-market
strategy is a lot around working with
the partners that are also delivering
these kind of Indians in the developers
in those spaces so
you take systems integrator that works
for PNG and helps build out a system for
their manufacturing facility you know we
think those are perfect partners for us
to work with you know because one they
understand the software layer enough to
integrate it with that whole machine
layer in the hardware layer that they're
really experts in so we see that it's a
long term that's a long term play I mean
building these partnerships is is a lot
of work and you have to build a lot of
them in order to kind of get that
adoption growth but we think that's a
it's one of the ways that we think long
term it is you know today we all are
trying to find those ones that have more
of a Mickey mentality and trying to
solve some of their own problems have
their own development teams and those
are usually bigger in size and a little
more scrappy so it's a variety long term
I think a lot of partners will come and
play with that this is might be a good
question and maybe it's because I live
in DC but has there been any interest or
have you had any talk to Renee like
dental services or like I said yeah
we've had several um you know there was
actually there was a really interesting
that came through earlier this year for
the government put out a what is a day
is it's a notification of funding
opportunity i think is what they call it
nfo or something like that thumb which
was around smart cities in around adding
information in using data and sensors to
to improve the lives of the cities i am
a little bit sad to say that cincinnati
did not actually put in an application
for this which was a little bit
disappointing and sad to see but you
know we talked to the city about some of
those opportunities you know they're
there they're trying to they're trying
to as like a midsize city they're trying
to figure out what the budgetary
thoughts are on a lot of this stuff and
and where the immediate value that they
could see on these i know some cities
are doing a fantastic job of this you
take a look at even in a kind of the
midwest you take a look at kansas city
what
boulders trying to do even Chicago and
Cleveland and Pittsburgh and they're all
trying to do a lot of this stuff and
push the boundaries there and then of
course you have the big cities which
obviously they they're doing a lot in
this space but there's a lot of
opportunity there it's a space that we
personally don't understand as well and
we're trying to you know we spend a lot
of time talking to our local officials
and people that are in that kind of
space to understand it a little bit
better in how those how the game is
played and how that you know the
proposals are put together and all
pieces there so yeah it's me I I would
think there's actually a lot of
interesting opportunity have you seen
the the bus detective stuff yeah yeah
did that Gaslight worked on some of that
stuff right yeah yeah yeah totally uh
which is I used to be a partner there
and like I don't know I always keep tabs
on those guys there they're doing cool
things but like for those aren't
familiar there the buses are
instrumented and so like there's a bus
schedule that hey you know we're gonna
stop at the stop at 4 45 p.m. but you
buses never run on time right they're
always late so um the all the buses are
instrument and have that the data like
where they're at right now and so you
could know like hey your bus is running
nine minutes behind and that's the idea
behind bus detectives well app on your
phone that tells you like hey your boss
is coming it'll be there at this time
instead of that time but uh like I got
to see kind of a behind-the-scenes look
and like the API that they were offering
he's really just like a file with a
bunch of data and they're like parsing
it out rather than like getting a true
API that they can make calls to so I
would think that that there's a lot of
potential there to like work in that
capacity with governments maybe I'm
going I definitely I've done some I did
I was like a hackathon for the let's put
on by the Census Bureau and like the
same thing like their API like I mean I
get to give no better source of data for
anything like it's just a ridiculous
amount of data but it's incredibly
complex and hard to get to and it's of
course like it takes two years to like
like a whole year for people for them to
compile this data and so I
I think like this would be there's gotta
be something like cooler way to like
help automate some of this data
collection and so I'm like really
impressive my happy that you even like
reached ad and thought about how about
like to help governments by the center
services that's cool I think it's
awesome I mean you know the some of the
stuff that New York is doing like yeah
they're working with a small private
group to do public Wi-Fi across the
entire city I mean there's there's a lot
of awesome stuff that's going on at the
government level you know like i said i
don't know i don't know--understand all
of the inner workings on getting all
those things to come together and that's
one of our you know just our internal
problems is we got to get better at that
but I think there's a lot of awesome
really useful value that can be added to
the citizens and to the government
itself you know obviously they want to
understand this better better not
understand this data better and easier
and and the citizens and the people in
the city definitely want to understand
it better and and we're trying to do a
couple early pilots and from air quality
and understanding what air quality is
across the city and individual
neighborhoods i think is an interesting
one because some of the data they have
says that air quality is one of one of
like the top four indicators of socio
economic value and kind of level and in
it in an area so but again we don't have
granular data on one of those pieces so
it that's the data that can be easily
grabbed and and put into a place that
they can get a hand on and very little
so I switching it up I guess what do you
see like like a long term like 20-30
years down the road look you know when
cars can start driving this time it's
not talking to each other and get the
magic ball out yeah yeah yeah so you
know so um yes cars will be driving
themselves I think 20 20 30 years down
the road definitely I think we'll see a
lot of industries take a massive change
let's take logistics truck
for instance you know there's one of the
highest employment occupations in the
country is being a truck driver and when
trucks can drive themselves I'm sure
that trucking companies will have
self-driving trucks so there's there's
going to be a lot of change I think
education has to be improved across the
technical sectors in order to give
people a better opportunity to expand
their second career I think I think
can't remember who is saying this but
you know it's it's continued education
but second career after world changes
and you have to pick up a skill set you
say it's so nicely so like like
economy's gonna crash is like the
transportation industries like our
biggest like thing that goes towards our
GDP pretty much and so like if we
automate that like I'm just glad that we
have the queers that we know yeah we're
definitely in a different position we're
the ones that are like causing they're
bringing the doom yeah yeah I was I had
this I had that exact same thought the
other day i was i was driving i think i
heard heard something on the on the
radio or something about automated
trucks and i was surrounded i was in
rush hour traffic and i was surrounded
by like these large trucks and i was
like kicking off with me andy's like
this is gonna be a real problem for
people um you know they're gonna yeah
it's gonna be a toast no I mean you're
going to see the same things happen in
manufacturing yeah you look at mid-tier
manufacturing from ten million dollars
to a billion dollars in revenue you know
those are all still manual processes
driven by people pretty much 95% of it
won't be that way in 30 years now
there's there's so many industries that
are going to be completely disrupted and
in partially torn apart from where the
technology is driven I don't think we'll
have flying cars yet
it just don't none of them we're ever
going to happen it doesn't make it
doesn't make sense it's too unsafe yeah
and and I speak a little bit from you
know personal my wife works for GE
aviation where she's she's in charge of
working with the FAA to certify an
engine and put onto a new plane and
that's a you know top to bottom six
seven eight year process to put one new
engine on a new plane you know and if
you're going to just start letting
people fly these things around I don't
think so it I just it's just not energy
efficient no no not energy efficiently I
mean yeah yeah there's a reason plane
tickets cost five hundred dollars yeah
it it's not because they're gouging you
yeah so switching so this is something
I'm real interested i have i have two
young daughters and always looking at
interesting ways to like get them to
learn technology basically for this
reason that I'm you know I want them to
have like successful careers in I mean
you know whatever it makes them happy
but because obviously there's going to
be more need for tech not technological
focused careers going down the road so
there's two knobs Thursday new jobs
either you could be a programmer or a
maker that's one the other one is an
entertainer it's going to be no
everyone's going to need to laugh and
everyone's going to need maintenance on
the robot so you make robots that are
fine yeah oh gosh yeah I'm sorry I guess
there's just one job Slade oh I get my
question is I don't know if you have
children but um like what are some good
ways that that we can get and not just
kids but like people who don't aren't
currently involved in technology or but
maybe they're interested what are your
exhaustion yeah um so called one part of
a question I don't have any kids yet so
you know I do actively think about this
though it especially working in it in
the field that we do and and and a lot
of people in friends to have kids and
are trying to think about this actively
to is I don't know i think it's it's a
that's
question 1 because I don't spend enough
time thinking about it maybe I should
should spend more time thinking about it
but now definitely more entertaining
educational programs you know it is
definitely one of those pieces I think
we've already seen a lot of kids try to
pick a programming because they wanted
to make a new minecraft level right like
yeah that's props that I mean that's
been a huge push in the right direction
and I remember you know one of the
things I wanted to do when I was growing
up was create video games no that's that
was what I wanted to do I wanted I
wanted to program video games you know
not just draw them and make them but
program them there was nothing really
that I can do until prolly college to
even really start really doing that
really in any respect I think we've got
enough tools that we can start teaching
people today to whether it's through
drag drop interface is whether it's you
know Lego Mindstorms and a bunch of
other kind of opportunities there I
think they're doing a really lot of
really cool things I mean you see
hardware hackers that are doing a lot of
kids stuff then and we'll see we'll see
that Hardware get easier and easier it I
think that gives a lot of opportunity to
to chip kids involved and I think you
gotta have some formal education
programs to and inside of the schools
that's a much bigger challenge I in my
mind is it's convincing the schools that
this needs to become more of a priority
yeah yeah I would agree with that like
are we our kids go to Wyoming which is
like one of the top they're always
talking for a top three position in the
state and they actually have what they
call fab lab here at the middle school
and it's like a fabrication laboratory
and so they have like CNC machines they
have 3d printers you know they have
access to like everything and they put
together clubs after school they have
classes you can take during the day that
like teach you how to do all this stuff
so I think that's an amazing step
towards it and you know back to what you
were saying about Minecraft I know you
and I
I have actually had a conversation about
this offline I've been working on
getting together a non-profit in this
area as well because i went to gaslight
actually had like a kid's tech day and
they did you're talking about right they
were teaching kids Scratch programming
they were teaching kids kind of wood
they didn't do a great job of modding
minecraft and I think that's maybe a
deeper class but um and then also doing
like Lego Mindstorms and I think that's
like kids have a natural curiosity and
they want to play games and so if you
can like hook them in young enough and
be like look you can make an exploding
cow if you're absolutely right like
they're gonna want to do that and
they're gonna be learning at the same
time and not even realize that they're
learning that just gonna be like Lou
this neat thing I made and to them
they're just being a maker they're not
really being like a program or anything
like that which can sometimes be a
turn-off I think to some kids like I
don't want to sit there and stare a code
all day but when they say they can
actually do something with it I think it
becomes way more interesting to them so
did you say exploding kittens I said
cows but kit works too if that's if
that's your game haha I never want to
show my kids a key yeah yeah so I'm
curious like talking about like bridging
the gap and getting kids involved in all
that stuff like like what are what are
some of the big hurdles that you see
right now in the IOT space yeah like
they need to get over I might preface
that too maybe you could talk a little
bit about what you guys did at
Christmastime too oh yeah sure sure so
I'll talk a little bit about the
challenges I don't talk a little bit
about what we did at Christmas and and
some of the projects that we're looking
at working on right now so I think
there's a couple things one of the
biggest is just availability of
easy-to-use hardware availability to
hardware in general you know you go to
even a hackathon for adults and and
almost there's almost going to be no
access to stuff they can hack around and
play with from a hacker and makers
and point so that's going to be
available that's one of the that's not
that hard to solve but it just it is
capital intensive from from at a large
scale you know I think that's the first
thing now the right tools so getting
them access to the right tools getting
them to understanding the right tools
training and whether it's a school
program after school program or
community program starting to build
those up from from the ground and I
think that's one that if you if we
started you know say this group started
to put around an organization and
started to think about how that plan
works and started get pull pull people
in I think you could move that forward a
bit and and drive that from a local
level and move it out and get some other
communities involved as well but those
are two big things one of the things
that we like doing and with that we've
done once will be doing a little bit
more of is we did an interactive space
for Christmas week we basically we said
call it how the Internet of Things saves
Christmas it was around it was around it
was really around you know how can we
make Internet of Things approachable to
a wide variety of the public and and
show them some of the novel ways that it
could be used and in people's lives and
and for fun so we basically took the
national lampoon's christmas vacation
movie and took some of the problems they
had in the movie whether it was burning
turkey or getting lights to work for or
some of the fun things so the sled and
showing how I OT could be used to either
fix those problems show some of the data
about it and get inside and and then you
know we did simple things and just had
little bits and me in the place which is
an awesome tool for teaching simple
circuits and stuff and invited people to
come check out these we talked about
them show them off and talked about IOT
as a whole and and also it was a fun
place
bring kids and hang out for an hour and
just to do stuff like that the summer
we're working with a group here in
Cincinnati about a it's called play
library it will be at the people's
Liberty globe building so people's
Liberty is a nonprofit organization that
gives groups grants to do interesting
projects and this one person won a grant
and they're going to have a library
where you can come to rent toys and have
fun in the space and we're working with
them to help liven it up through
different IOT stuff and and I think
those things just generally one help
help the brand but to help understand
and show everyone that look this stuff
is going to be in your lives and it's
going to be help solve some things it's
going to help entertain you know you
know we know that the only two jobs
later gonna be programmers and
entertainers so you know it's gotta
entertain you and we can help program
itself nice I like it I like yeah yeah
we'd we should we should totally do that
thing we talked about before which is
like not your dad's derby race Oh what
do we have like a derby track that's
totally instrumented off and then like
no rules like we'll just lift all the
Derby rules except it has to fit on the
track and stay in your tracks lot yeah
uh yeah with it I mean we can do that
that would be awesome be really cool all
right I think we're getting the end here
um so I want to say thank you truly for
being on the show was really awesome to
talk about all this stuff thank you for
having me yeah yeah I think it I think
it's great i also think you know maybe
one last question is like what you
talked about having SDKs and like you
know building these libraries that
people can kind of consumed with their
devices and utilize to send data like
most of that built with JavaScript or
are you finding other languages or so
you know we have a JavaScript library
will probably have another one or two
for
for client-side and a couple others but
we also have a C C++ library will have a
dotnet library python library java
library and then probably an iOS sdk as
well nice on board so it'll be done a
variety of languages but you know most
everything else is built in JavaScript
yeah awesome all right let's do our pics
guys absolutely when I go first so no
one can steal mine day after Game of
Thrones I'm gonna take Game of Thrones I
am I actually it's made my life better i
don't know about easier before one maybe
maybe more frustrating it was a slow
episode last night but I uh I watched it
watch huh oh yeah i watch this video on
like the theories behind Jon Snow and
how he's gonna come back to life and
like it was a very boring episode well
so but this I'll have to link this in
the show notes but this this theory
video came out about a month ago and the
guy was talking about how he believes
John Stowe is a Targaryen which I've
heard the theory but now that he's dead
and like the theory of how he's gonna
come back to life is all really really
interesting assuming it happens to
anyone I geek out on Game of Thrones can
I say I've only seen one episode get off
right now you're fired which one was it
I don't know how would I even know how
to compare yes I'll go next so you know
what I love is this isn't gonna be my
pick but I love house of cards and I
just wrapped up season two so I got
another two seasons to go I'm like I
don't watch TV that much I don't know
what clearly not yeah so anyway my pick
is an old one MIT spark oh yeah which is
programming for scratch scratch scratch
scratch that's what it is smells is
called have you seen a scratch jr. I
think it es kids has like a app for it
it's called scratch jr. oh yeah but it's
like you definitely check that out very
cool yeah this past weekend um my kids
are in like an enrichment program or
whatever and their programming they have
to answer all their math questions by
programming the answers and using that
service and so it was great I felt like
a good old dad teaching my kids had a
like basic programming it was like an
awesome weekend so yeah nice i started i
started my son on scratch or no on
JavaScript and then we found scratch and
like he probably spent a couple hours on
the Raspberry Pi actually like it hooked
up in his room and it came with the
raspberry pi so ton of fun playing with
that yeah yeah awesome kulaga by the way
that's scratched jr. dot org is a good
PBS version it's pretty fun that's for
like younger younger kids I'm gonna go
with slithered I Oh have you guys played
this at all you guys played a gar or a
guard aya yes slithered is kind of its
like that it's a game we just like
you're like a snake and you're on a
server with like 500 people and the goal
is to just keep these little dots and
like to be the biggest snake but then
you can like you have to cause other
snakes to run into your trail and then
when they do they like a dime you can
eat their their power or whatever it's
like the simplest it's like a really
simple game but it's incredibly
addicting and it's got a super fun I'm
started playing it last week um but yeah
check it out fun great I'm sitting here
playing in that's the biggest snake I've
ever seen did it when you start off a
little guy like Wright if you see like a
big guy
that's kind of that's awesome I add just
a quick side story of that I one of the
first successful iOS applications I ever
built was a snake game that ended up
getting to be number one in Sweden in a
few other countries on the app on the
App Store it was based off of the old
school nokia game alright so my pick is
going to be nice trails nice trails calm
and it is very different from the rest
of these but it allows you to upload GPS
data and will create a GPS Ralph data
and will create a 3d printed model of
the route and the surrounding terrain
very cool if you go outside and hike it
off I actually I had one I had to made
one was the route that my wife and I did
down into the Grand Canyon and back out
and actually one of skiing Ralph out in
Switzerland and they just 3d print on
and they basically 3d printed with the
color of the landscape and it's just
killer a lot of fun just super simple
now kind of taking a lot of a lot of
technologies and gluing them together to
make something really fun and
interesting that's awesome this is right
so my father-in-law is currently in in
Spain right now doing the like the
Compostela walk yeah yeah he's like he's
doing it for the second time so this is
cool so how do you so you put the gps
data in a flat and you subtract it
yourself and then you plan I actually
used a service to I'm going to remember
it right now but I use the service to
bet I can pull up the trailer out and
then modify it on their website and then
download the GPS coordinates is and what
I ended up doing now I'm going to try to
remember what that was
juju juju all right I can't remember I
can drop it in the meeting notes later
though but so it allowed me it allowed
me you know because we did like a
regular trail more or less at the Grand
Canyon so I can put that in and it would
visualize it and I could then modify it
inside of their software and then
download the GPS coordinates for it I
did the same thing for a route that we
did at Yosemite which was actually a
combination and it was pieced together
from three or four different routes so
it worked really well for for that but
yeah work out a lot of fun super easy
you know I did have to modify the data a
little bit using GPS visualizer which
just converted it to a very simple GPX
GPS file but it's awesome I'll
definitely be using this for a present a
simple oh yeah I've been wanting to try
autodesk has a software that they showed
off a while ago i don't know if you guys
know our desk is but they had a GoPro
attached to like a drone and as it as it
flies through hit um takes photos every
five seconds you upload the photos to
like their software and it creates a
point cloud file which then you can
generate like massive 3d topography with
and like it has the image overlaid on it
so I love that stuff unlike a total nerd
so I'm gonna definitely check this out
this that's super cool all trails ALL
trails calm is what I use to create the
trail trail maps and download the GPS
coordinates very cool and with that I
just died with slither are you playing
this whole time nice i like 1200 points
and I died to do with you guys you ever
get like 20,000 points that's crazy yeah
yeah I saw some guys flying in there
like it
super speed yeah you if you click that
if you hold the mouse down or use
spacebar you fly like those fast mm
didn't know that nice all right well
thanks guys for being on the show
special thanks to Charlie was awesome to
talk in another thing so thanks guys all
right and tune in next time I don't know
be but we're talking to like I'm trying
to get people to talk about graph ql or
um redox or any of those kinds of things
so who knows maybe someone interesting
for the next one as well sorry
interesting to talk about Redux you
start playing around with Apollo of the
weekend excellent hmm yeah maybe we can
get someone to talk about Paulo hey see
I don't know if we know anyone alright
guys thanks for tuning in see you next
