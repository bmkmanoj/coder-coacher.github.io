this one is with Mitchell actually how
do you say last name Mitchell is a wolf
Wolfman Wolfman okay right hi everyone
so the goal here is Mitchell and I are
going to pair and work on crater over a
series of some videos and the hope is
that we're improving crater and getting
some functionality out that that we need
for crater and at the same time pairing
showing how pairing works and hopefully
helping that you'll learn along the way
so to get started the first time I'm
going to drive Mitchell's gonna kind of
asked questions and and try to
understand what I'm doing and that kind
of thing so and then at some point we
may switch off probably not this video
but in future videos we may switch off
and in head Mitchell drive and I'll
watch and we may try to do some code
reviews at some point if Mitchell works
on his own so um yeah just just I don't
know kind of a fan of this idea and
hopefully it works out yeah sounds
awesome thanks for being my one of my
guinea pigs mature outdoors thanks for
having me yeah alright so let me share
my screen I promise I've got the font
size right unlike when I did the
telescope packing with Sasha haha tiny a
font so today the the goal is Nick win
tidge worked on a brand new design and I
want to figure out how to get his design
into the the version of telescope that
I've been deploying and kind of see what
it looks like and fix up anything that
needs fixed actually also like live
deploying crater right now which is
taking forever for some reason so you
want to integrate this into crater or
into a separate telescope
into integrator okay cool yeah look at
that he's got a telescope has been
updated nice that's pretty slick so if
you if you actually haven't seen it let
me give a font bump this is more what it
looks like when you're an admin on
crater you get to see some extra stuff
like there's an edit link here and you
get this score and we can see how many
people reviewing things and that kind of
stuff Thanks the click tracking was
actually broken but it looks like it
must be fixed tagline beginner package
huh want to see what that is Oh use the
tag line as title on the home page admin
settings cuz i made that go away tagline
here we go where meteor jazz news Lance
all right so I guess the first thing I
just kind of want to see what he did
yeah this just looks like a telescope
update looks like he did something here
oh yeah see this is kind of bad that's
in a package this is not horrible wait
did that looks like just ordering of
things hmm do you leave any comment
besides the title of whatever the
committee's no but we can we probably
ask him if we need to so here this is
where he's gotten started on the
telescope theme crater package yep so
that's good I like to see that that
means we're scoped properly there sorry
if the fonts a little small guys um wait
what was this file ok this is crater Jas
turn off notifications there all right
so I'm thinking what we can do i'm just
going to clone this down okay we'll
switch to his branch and then try to
copy it over to my aversion and see how
it looks at that point he said in
particular he was having trouble with
like categories and something else
showing up
which branch was that was the name of
the branch it was the of course I do
telescope or something no that's not it
he's actually no it's not dev was a
development her redesign that's it did
that yeah I'm gonna clone this over you
said he posted somewhere what he was
having trouble with did but I can't seem
to find it
you know it's just nothing mm-hmm she
liked online I don't think i have him
unless he's in the meteor club chat room
oh how much fun to fish ah set it up
yeah just to get check out a sh t
we design yeah we go let's look at her
okay so we've got our history there so
we go into packages he's gotta do I
promise and the next one will do more
interesting things maybe in a month
that's right telescope theme creator
it's a copy and yeah looks like it
finished that's good yeah on the App
telescope alright see you that looks
like when we load it hmm okay
I'm just clowning it as well okay too I
have to maybe his branch will give us an
idea of what we do to activate that
theme here we go I think I gotta add it
to the package lists okay here we go
let's see what we look like now mmm
still doesn't look great oh hey there
went ha must have been rebuilding in the
background holy smokes that is very
different Wow cool alright so let's fig
unless you're really zoomed in yeah I am
okay
see how responsive it is yeah still need
some work there well they'll probably
want the side menu to go away yeah
this is something that he's working on
and that you want to integrate once it's
finished integrator yeah cool so I guess
maybe the smartest thing to do is go
into media club will make a new repo
telescope creator theme somebody call it
being crater you leader why'd you decide
to make it a new repo um I think it'll
make it easier to we can like may be
treated as a sub module in that way like
if he works on it or I work on it or
whoever's working on it like we can but
yeah like I think it'll make it easier
to work with in the end okay cool so
what I'm going to do is copy again you
peter out here and get in it and it
here we go yeah thanks him off here dude
not getting any kind of count you didn't
say if it he was like he thought it was
done and then he wanted to pass it off
he was kind of part way through uh no he
just said
just gonna go to Google correctly
you
you
and I know isn't an email
here we go I don't know why I was in the
trash um style category labels style
notifications drop-down add some
animation polish build mobile responsive
version if you're able to pitch in these
things could save me time I can't seem
to get categories to show up in the UI
they are emptying the database and I
think when I tried to add them in the
admin it didn't work either I can't get
notifications show up in the UI either
even setting them as unread manually in
the database didn't seem to work cool
all right just now we know what we're
working on I locked in I'm not logged in
right now
button still red login forbidden ominous
tip it's not like you did something
wrong you just can't not allowed to yeah
you're not found okay so he's Robo Mongo
I don't know if you've ever used
anything like that yeah very nice indeed
let's go see what users we got Bruce
Arnold Julia clearly I have not set
myself up on this yet tagline scope it's
the lightning bolt to cause locations I
see what's the object object that must
be the tagline maybe Hey oh yeah
mm yeah I need some more care all right
um I'm logged in mine admin I gotta
compared to crater to get the URL fear
settings is just / settings title the
creator died oh cool
I don't know if this is a telescope
thing or a theme thing but we might want
to stick in something that just says not
to display that subheading if there is
no tag line because you know that's
better than object object oh yeah that's
it yeah that's probably a theme thing I
would imagine okay yeah that's nice I
like that trending where do i go to add
categories just slash categories so we
need like an admin drop there something
at some point
yeah that looks kind of weird okay so
when I post the categories are there so
that's good but they're not over here on
the left mm-hmm so let's go mu you know
how this is structured so it's open in
media you've been pulling Sasha hey I
could just tell let's go
be too common footer and layout greater
tabs yes that looks potentially
interesting you know here we go yeah
this is where they're coming from cool
so maybe if we look at the default
telescope hey looking four categories or
admin uh well we can just kind of
grabbed both and see what they look like
I guess ok cool but for now categories
you would be ideal
tag hooks publications
and you they are can we just call post
categories do we need to define that
template I wonder packages with the call
post categories
yeah it didn't seem to put anything in
guess we can wrap it in a hole I element
mmm guess we could just toss this in
here yep that's quite what we're going
to want but see what we get wow that's
slow to rebuild profile what yeah we're
just going to empty a hell I element
there mmm characters ready let's go look
maybe he's doing something that
JavaScript
Yeah right here map need to link to only
both these what this get template does
yeah I remember seeing that in telescope
um briefly I was looking through it
use the 88 times and JavaScript code
yeah i was just looking I see 234
occurrences and telescope now I just
have to find what it's defined
interesting is like ocean Pakistan is
really yeah and Aki that export down at
the bottom line 73 for the seam um which
package is no just talking about
package.json telescope you're looking
for um get template well there's no it's
in it's a whole lap there is no package
chess and out route hey I know I was in
telescope base okay there we go tell us
a good base there we go
so it's probably here somewhere here it
is template has been overwritten
returned this else return template name
wah cantt but has been overwritten by
what let's see what we have available to
us packages here we go so many ya
telescope Hubble well auto form puts a
crap ton in here there's categories menu
just I just set it
there we go totally there this is this
categories menu is that what I was using
I don't think this water is using ray i
am i standing limit haha switch my desk
are you new to a standing desk yeah i
just got it last week nice yeah it's not
an easy transition worth it though yeah
i can do just about 40 minutes right now
cool do you have a squishy matt i do
yeah good yeah big help I'll go there's
something now indeed aha we're getting
the drop down menu but it's not
functioning do we have like all the
click events and stuff we need I would
think so that's like just a basic
bootstrapping right there's anything we
need to do
the other question is likewise that text
so different did when you paste it into
that hTML is it does it have a different
class yeah see we don't have a greater
tab right mmm we can do that if you
could Tori that bus hmm and we've got
like nav ID crater tabs why not just
target the other lives under there added
to list not styled better but we're
still not getting the drop down the
trigger it's that one working yeah
that's totally zenned drop down toggle
swing get rid of that
dropdown top level that looks different
why are we seeing testing but nothing
else in there oh well that's all we have
okay so if i go to slash categories okay
right um we ask more news yes although
slugs for us just now we're getting all
three we need to do the taco drop down
this is a bootstrap thing unless you
want the drop down to be different than
it is in the default theme could you
just copy the HTML and CSS from there
what do you mean like just use what's
used for the categories drop down in the
default theme I'm not sure what's
causing it to trigger in the default
theme like oh yeah oh wait here
categories menu jf to get it no there's
no event you see I'm just not sure why
his HTML is triggering uh he says drop
down
yeah so I was just going to go look at
their docs on how drop-down works in
bootstrap itself
you
you
you
I understand that works
the data type on there hmm quick how is
that working in Crater it's gotta be
catching the click event I would think
connecting responde
hmm I'm trying to think of something we
could search for in the code that would
help us find the event just drop down my
do it it's going to be a little
ambiguous but yeah
javascript hmm haha he dropped down
class move will nab jf
huh
it's also won't have
you
it's just on the hub
actually hmm
click
is the mobile
CSS I'm looking but I just don't know
enough about the code base yet to like
know where to look yeah same here just
kind of grip it around essentially yeah
this is purely like I don't he's not
using the JavaScript drop-down maybe can
you do the drop down without the
JavaScript um I don't know I mean you
can hmm yeah I don't I've never mean I
haven't done that in pure CSS okay well
maybe what we can try to do is at least
trigger it I see and when the CSS files
at import specific drop-down know maybe
we don't have that
this is in screen scss in telescope
theme base
shouldn't hear from base though I would
think yeah we call telescope base right
here
11 telescope base
he pulls in his own boot
that's kind of weird bunch of boots
since I on account
greater love opponents
I'm just looking through the CSS for
Hubbard events at this point oops sorry
ah templates
you
you
yes
I was weird drop down a toggle I haven't
been watching your screen forfeited but
did you find the UM hover in the drop
down in the CSS now if you in the theme
base there's just an for dot has drop
down and drop down there's just an and
hover and now it does is display block
for the drop down menu so that looks
like that's how they're doing it
Eileen I'm sorry um sure the classes has
dropped down and drop down yeah there's
just an and hover right hand it just as
a display block on the drop-down menu
yeah I saw that ok cool earlier I guess
we can look for this and the CSS see if
we're getting it or not um yeah jeez
sorry this feels so laying for our first
time on alone that's right may have this
work on something else next time
look it looks here
you
I
if you want to look if you want to find
drop-down menu and see if it oh wait and
everyone it's the two top classes it's
has dropped down and drop down which
would have the hover
you
can you command F in there I was just
thinking if you wanted to look for
ampersand colon hover you could probably
find it quick ah but that's not what
it's going to look like in here because
this is compiled in that so SAS think
you would be around here somewhere
though
yeah I don't see it so I think you work
if we put our own data toggle on there
hmm then you'd have to like click it to
make it happen see I like I made it pop
out forcibly Oh yep but then it's not
styled right cause it's all white all
right guess I'm going to punt on this
so maybe more interesting things to work
on the next time we get together is uh
we could do see Sasha and I were talking
about maybe doing some SEO stuff so
maybe you and I can do the SEO stuff and
I can make Sasha do the crater hahaha
stuff with me yeah oh yeah or the other
one is like adding sponsors so my
thought was actually extra Oh see if
they've got one up right now
that top one just pinned that's not a
sponsored right yeah I think they can
put like a sponsored link in here
somewhere mmm so that's that's another
thing we can work on too nice hmm what
do you think what do you want to do next
time that sounds really good um I mean
we can definitely we could make progress
on this it's just I because we didn't
build it this is just like very specific
things that we don't know they're like
tough to find yeah well so Sasha like I
can find the hook too he said he added a
hook so you can do like an after post
thing um so I'll ask him about that
because I know boots trappers does have
the ability to show an ad okay he he
added that for them so I'll find the key
element that we need it maybe we can
just make a quick like creator add
package or something yet that would be
cool okay all right all right ah same
time next week does that work for you uh
yeah definitely I'm i would have to
check my calendar but i can't imagine i
would have something scheduled now so
okay sounds good yes it may have to be
later I don't know okay should I need to
check I'll be I'll be in San Francisco
so I'll talk about what time will work
for me alright cool alright well thanks
dude yeah yeah thank you sorry everyone
that may be full watches isn't this is
an hour of uh yeah well maybe maybe this
is good for Sasha cuz now he can see
like how hard it is understand theming
yeah yeah yeahs not obvious yeah cool
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
