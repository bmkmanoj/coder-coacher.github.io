st. Patrick's Day I've got my cut my
coffee I don't it's not Irish but ian is
an Irish originally so nice oh my gosh
so our guests this month is Ian Serling
is that how you say your last name
doctors like I right you think I'm I'm
here yeah that's exactly right Oh
awesome okay cut out there for a second
alright and so you're the CEO of useful
and you guys do you build meteor apps
for clients right up so that's exactly
what we do know awesome so um like what
I guess I'm gonna take my question first
I put some in here if you're if you're
watching remotely you can go to
crowdcast dot io / e / joshua Owens 16 I
don't make up these URL structures and
it's weird but that's where you go um
and you can you can pop in the questions
there if you want and I'll put that on
the Google+ page as well so people can
see that all right and yeah so so how'd
she get started with meteor like what
brought you to meteor ah what problem e
2 meteor was I'm the kind of software
developer that really likes things the
end product basically in the business
the the users the customers the whole
system like sort of working and so it's
never been about solving like really
hard technical challenges for me or like
data analysis or anything like that it's
always about getting getting stuff out
there and seeing what works with users
and so when i came across meteor because
i thought backbone was lame and amber
was overly convoluted which side note i
came to
would be looking at because I in a past
life when I was doing a live many too
many video chat startup we were using
flash and flex within the whole adobe
apple thing like killed flash basically
so I needed a different way to write
awesome web applications that were
interactive and so I was following media
for a little while and then I was the
same time Derby I don't know if you
remember derby at all but it was the
same time that Derby was like starting
basically starting out but I watched
what happened with the the meteor guys
over time and met them I actually up in
Portland that the real-time the first
real-time conference and that was pretty
epic and ever since then I've been
following the project really closely and
as soon as I could started building
stuff with meteor because it's basically
like the best way to build I'll even
just a normal website honestly that is
going to be super responsive yeah yeah
that makes sense and so um maybe another
question that I have for you is you know
when you like you you started a
development shop and you know I know
from my time at differential and even
like thinking back my time running
Gaslight you know early on in the days
of rails or early on in the days of
meteor it's kind of hard to convince
people to make that leap like what have
you did you find that you had to
convince people to use meteor or were
they coming to you for meteor work or
how was that working really good
question okay so like the heart of the
business how do you get how do you get a
client's doing video development work ah
for quite a while I was going to the
meteor def shots in San Francisco I'm
actually in Taiwan right now so if the
kinetic connection gets crappy that's
probably why but most of the time I
mistake
Cisco and that's where the dev shops are
and so just like naturally meeting
people in the community and seeing
what's going on and contributing and you
know giving talks and stuff like that
you find about out about some
opportunities like I've been doing
software development contracting for a
really long time but for the last
basically two years it's been a hundred
percent meteor development so the first
couple were opportunities were basically
through exposure of being a part of the
dev shot to the people that I knew or
people that found out about like a
presentation that i gave and contacted
me but the funny thing is even clients
at that time even just maybe like six
months ago even clients they had
originally come to me asking to do stuff
in meteor and like I say like we only do
MIDI or work right like we we might like
write some bash scripts for you or
something like that but it's basically
don't like it's basically all meteor
work is what we do and if you want like
something else did I hire somebody else
throughout the project as they would
talk to other people like other other
people that were technologists that
didn't know about meteor or weren't
familiar with it or whatever happened to
be we were constantly having these
conversations about his meteor the right
thing is me to the right thing and it
was confounded by the fact that every
minor version update to meteor from
about 0521 broke something significant
college true true and that was happening
like pretty consistently across across
client project select these libraries
would build to make our lives easier and
make stuff go faster we kept having to
like update and that would cause issues
and so um there's always been I to major
questions the first one is just as it as
a mature enough technology which now I
think it kind of is even though everyone
wants to see like you know the big
really big company that's using it the
other one is still and i think this is
every every technology or every project
you get this question
is it scalable and I know somewhere mdg
has like a low testing tool that they
use and they should totally open source
and let people what people prove it but
you know we've written scripts to spin
up like a bunch of phantom jes instances
or a bunch of DDP client no DDP clients
and simulate like thousands of
simultaneous connections to prove that
what we were doing you know will work
and to figure out what parts were were
causing slowdowns sort of along the same
lines of what Khedira does but all
command line know like a nice web GUI
interface oh that's nice a Coderre can
wanted that hopefully at some point they
integrate load testing otherwise if you
build a load testing tool I said all one
of the questions was like how can new
people contribute I think to to the
community there's a little a whole bunch
of wide open areas there yeah I don't
don't see that question but yeah no I
mean that that's always a good question
i know i remember being out the first
time i went to dev shop Adrian landing
like give a demo of load testing tool
that he had i think it was built a java
though yeah but yeah you just run it and
like point it at a meteor app and
basically you can just load test it that
way which is interesting and you know i
mean i guess for for me like that that's
definitely it's funny you bring up like
scalability in that kind of thing
because that always seems to be the
number one thing that I hear like you
know is it scalable or will it handle
the traffic and you know what does that
look like and I don't know like I always
tell people like yog me you know like
your business is likely going to fail
long before you ever have to scale to
the point where you're going to have
trouble with meteor in my opinion you
know because building and building an
audience building a customer base like
these are the really hard things to do
making the sales like if you're a small
shop that makes singular big sales like
these are the hard things for your
business too
in my opinion especially like as a
developer you know a lot of us aren't
necessarily wired that way so I I don't
think scalability is an issue like I'm
hosting crater on on a ten-dollar slice
on digital ocean and I've got I think
composed a Oh database setup elastic up
log database there and you know I'm
handling like 150 simultaneous
connections at peak during the day with
without even breaking a sweat like the
site I don't know it's running at like
ten percent cpu usage like eight percent
cpu usage on average according to
Khedira like just as not this is not a
problem in my opinion like I'm spending
twenty eight dollars and I'm able to
service 150 200 you know I would imagine
this thing will go up to like 500
concurrent users before I have to think
about maybe adding another ten dollar
slice like it just doesn't seem like a
hard problem to solve right now i heerd
the nail on the head the majority of the
time the problem is not going to be like
have been able to scale enough to handle
the amount of users its to get that
amount of users um but i can add a
little bit more to to that so when uplog
tailing came along basically meteor
became linearly scalable which means
like if you add another server if you
start with one server yet another server
you basically double the amount of
capacity you have also the biggest thing
our publications obviously that will
kill your server so be smart with your
publications but like one under the hood
it's no it's so like 1 384 megabyte
servo on modulus can actually handle
like a thousand simultaneous connections
and send updates to all of them if you
were subscribing to you know millions of
records then you're going to have a
problem you want to optimize that but
like generally speaking you're right
there's it's a scalability as a salt
well problem but because no one came out
and proved it near the beginning it was
always a question like Oh what if we get
on or what if we get on techcrunch and
we have a bunch of people or go to be on
hacker news and we get a bunch of people
on are we going to be able to handle
that sort of flight yeah and now modulus
also has auto scaling which is google
though so the the story is getting
better and better and better um nowadays
we don't really have to deal with those
kind of questions anymore people are
actually getting Nick's like meteors and
a better job marketing itself outside
the developer community so people are
actually getting excited about using
meteor for the benefits and a lot of
times that has to do with something
around the mobile story as well yeah
nice yeah definitely I think it was one
of those things I feel like was kind of
snuck in without fanfare right before 10
came out like surprised you can do
Cordova and you know everyone's still
like oh wow that's really cool and you
know now they're like just realizing
holy crap we can do amazing things with
this so and so now we're all learning
how to make like really a lot better
mobley you ice as well what yeah very
true that definitely seems to be the hot
space you know everyone's talking about
meteoric or you know other kind of CSS
frameworks that that work well for
building cordoba apps so all right next
question is from Stefan whole house
apparently he wants me to call him
meteor in action today a hello Minnie r
in action thank you for watching indeed
so how do you organize large development
teams when more than a single developer
works on an app do you use packages
split the app into micro surfaces
microservices or just pray for easy code
merges please please let the cup of
merge I so get solves a lot of those
problems for you by basically like how
do we organize our projects
I wouldn't call them I wouldn't call
them microservices if you're like
talking about in the way the araneta was
talking about in his his blog but a lot
of times we do split what I'd call a
product into maybe like three or four
different different meteor projects so
you might have you know your dub dub dub
that's serving your customers you might
have an admin site the admins of the
business log into and they could look at
the database or have a completely
different view on the data if you have
if it's a b2b company you might have two
sets of customers so you might have
another app that's serving the second
set of customers so like for flavor
please for instance which is food truck
booking we have the people that want to
book the food trucks and the food trucks
themselves and they use a different app
and then there's usually one meteor
meteor application that is handling what
I just typically call services so these
are things like background jobs we use a
cute email system so like emails get put
into into a collection and then
processed by a separate server they do
reminder emails like all those sorts of
like maybe importing data from a third
party oh that would be handled in like a
services application and we do that for
a couple different reasons one of them
is scalability so if you need it you
could scale each of those applications
independently but really what it's about
is conciseness of the code because when
each application is only targeted
towards one type of user with one type
of access control then everything gets a
lot simpler you don't have / admin and /
admin checks all over all over your
application code or even like you know
in a library sort of underneath or in
your collections you have one admin app
and you can login or you can't and and
that's it I'm same deal with you know
different kinds of users and then how to
like generally speaking
get handles all of our merge conflicts
pretty easily and like if someone on our
team doesn't know how to use get them we
walk through that and then how do we
make sure people aren't stepping on each
other's toes if a client doesn't already
have a project management tool that
they're using them we use pivotal
tracker mmm listen I've actually learned
the reuse pivotal tracker in a very
specific way that I thought was
relatively common I don't know a bit
curious like how do you how do you do it
Josh uh we tend to just throw everything
in the icebox and then we'll line up
like a column for like what we're gonna
be working on in a sprint maybe or we'll
put like a marker somewhere and then
we'll just pull from the icebox in order
and just start working on stories how do
you write the stories like do you write
them do you have the clients right them
oh why do you write you know oh gosh if
this is not me here um so I would say uh
you know if if i can i'll have the user
write the stories but sometimes there's
some pushback on that you know and they
don't want to write the stories or
they're not interested and so typically
you know it's been a while since I've
used pivotal tip what you guys oh gosh
what's your preference I guess uh well
personally I use just Trillo you know I
spent half the time working on media
club stuff and the other half the time
you know I'm working on an application
and they use JIRA uh so oh you know what
yeah they're kind of an animal suite
which isn't it's not horrible but you
know they've got a project manager
that's interfacing with the client and
kind of writing those stories so gotcha
not something I'm handling but yeah I
would say like anytime you can like I'm
I'm a fan of cucumber so anytime you can
have the client writing the story I
think it makes it easy to get them
involved in the development cycle and
you know when they see when they can
open a page and see a bunch of you know
green check marks on the page showing
that all the stories they wrote are
passing I think that that's that's like
a really good rapport to have
and you know you can set that up on CI
and get a notification when it breaks
and like that to me that's like that
would be the dream client setup which
I've only ever had happened like once or
twice in my development like yeah I've
yet to get someone to write their own
cucumber test that's that's pretty that
would be there would be like the unicorn
that's cool or even just you know the
business side of it right that the
english part yeah that would be the the
goal there so we always have the out
like Walker client through but I always
have them go through and write out their
pivotal tracker stories because I want
all the stories to be written from like
a business value standpoint and not I
had a collection here and I paint make
an allow rule there sort of thing that's
like not particularly useful to us or to
the client so it's and it takes a little
bit of like iteration and refinement
because a lot of times they'll start
with massive massive stories and so then
we'll go back and break them down and
all that kind of stuff and eventually
they sort of get the get the hang of it
ya know the clients hand you the epics
right there like I need a feature that's
going to cover all this and like you
realize like you get into it and you've
got to like chop it up into all the
little pieces that are involved yeah so
back to the original question I've also
seen I've been part of a number of teams
and you know at differential we were
definitely going the package route
trying to build open source packages
that we saw a lot but the other thing
that I've seen is you know I've actually
I would say a lot of teams tend to go
the package around like I've been on
three different three or four different
teams in the last six months and
definitely everyone seems to be driving
you know the package kind of route for
functionality what is what is the
package route uh basically like when
you're working on a feature pushing it
into a package and then it's just I've
noticed
lot of people will make local packages
and so you know I was working on meeting
hero and so they had a bunch of packages
in the in the package folder that sort
of like MH dash and each little package
had some kind of wrapper functionality
or you know some is it was like
functionality based package and so um
you know maybe it was only used on one
page but that that package kind of drove
that piece of the application so hmm
almost like a micro service but you know
just garage shed yeah I forgot about the
package for the question okay yeah ah so
that's awesome what we typically do is
there for that's that suite of
applications that makes up one product
there will also be a packages directory
and there's usually one core package for
the application which has the common
collections for all the different
applications maybe mmm like a collection
hooks that need to be run all the time
to like Craig time stamps or you know do
this or that sort of thing and I think
it's definitely definitely a good idea
to even think of your own application
that you're building as sort of an API
that you're building for yourself so
that you have a separation sort of
between the functionality and the user
interface code or like the UI code so
the difference between putting like a
meteor method call or putting like a
database update in an event handler and
a template versus having that event
handler call into some library to
actually do like the business action and
that library could be you know your
private library that's just called the
name of your application do my business
value or or however you want it to be
but that separation is good and that's
not something that we've done for very
long we just started pulling that stuff
more and like down abstracting two to
one more level because you
I changes so much like I it just makes
it makes a lot is in it it like clarify
as you're thinking when you try to build
yourself your own API assorted to use
now you can always go down a rabbit hole
with that but yeah but one of the guys
on our team Josh Joshua Holman actually
same initials I he just oh you know a
lot of the time when he comes across
like a something that he thinks should
be reusable he'll just create a package
and publish at the hemisphere so if you
go to atmosphere and search for CW OHL
at my head you'll probably see like I
don't know there's probably 20 packages
in there by now then they all do like
little tiny things yeah and that's
something I think is really cool yeah
definitely I would agree like that was
that was a lot of my strategy when I was
at differential you know like we had mmm
excuse me we had like 10 packages and
six of those were we're mine so um you
know definitely like even even tiny
stuff like handling like time ago and
words right like it wasn't much but they
just have one little helper and used a
moment actually i don't even think i was
using moment at the time i used
something else but you know it just it
just basically would take a timestamp
and give you back a time ago in words
their packages used to be more crazy
because you it was like such a pain in
the ass to use something from npm and
media for the longest time so there were
literally duplicate package wrappers
they're like you know 20 packages that
wrap the same npm library for like long
long time yeah it's kind of a little bit
more interesting since then yeah all
right
let's take a new question um this is
from joris when do you decide to fork
and maintain an outdated meteor package
versus waiting for it to be updated and
you guys run into this at all oh we used
to do this a lot like Manning it
basically but privately so we would grab
grab a package that might be close to
what we want and then make it our own
private package for that project because
maybe it did you know seventy percent of
what we needed or something or maybe it
existed but happen there's actually a
package out there right now called mylar
which encrypts things in your database
and then decrypts them on the client
side so it's like secure all the way
through which might be good for you know
certain classes of applications but they
haven't updated it in like six months
and man if I had the time that's
something that I think would be awesome
to like bring up to speed hmm so but the
question was like how do you decide when
when 24 can maintain or you know push or
wait on you know i don't i don't know
like my my response to this question
would be I don't know that I'd wait and
I don't know that I have to wait anymore
I think there's enough like the
packaging ecosystem has gotten big
enough where you have choices for a lot
of the functionality that you want to do
and so you can easily go find like a
maintain version of a package you know
so i don't i don't know if this is a
huge problem i would say like absolutely
i would like if it if there was a bug
where there was a feature i needed i
would reach out to the owner and see if
you know they're they're open to a pull
request or something and nine times out
of ten they are so i should do a good
job
and if it's something small and it looks
like the package is not maintained but
you want a base for it like honestly you
can just drop that code into your
project especially if it's a single
application project and maybe and if
you're doing client cut if it's a
short-term project that basically just
becomes part of like the base code of
the project with like a little
attribution for wired originally came
from yeah yeah definitely and you know
the interesting thing like i missed the
old days of meteor right where you could
just pop in a get URL and it would pull
that package in for you that was nice
yeah well that when that went away at
screwed up so much stuff that's agree
all right um okay here's another good
one from Jan ah another meteor club
member here or there's some cases where
you would advise somebody not to use
meteor but instead go for maybe a
classic older CMS platform or something
like that yeah absolutely um typically
what happens is a client will contact us
until they usually includes like a
paragraph about what they want to do and
I usually respond to that with you know
nice to meet you thanks for contacting
useful a oh I'd be happy to chat with
you about if meteor and or useful IO is
like a good match for you and so that
conversation is really about getting to
know them in their business and I'm
looking for a good client but I'm also
looking for things that are that are
good matches for meteor or they they
really want to use meteor so there could
be like a simple website and they could
be using anything like and it might be
even like a better match for rails and
sometimes I'll tell people that but
they're like they want to use meteor
because they have a perception that will
be faster and like you and I know that
really just depends on the development
team about wow how fast the developments
feet is really going to go but if you're
if you want like okay so there
good a good example there's someone to
contact me recently and wanted to build
like a highly interactive blog for their
like interior design company or
something like that and I just told them
you know by the time we build all of the
basic blog function I mean there are
like okay so Sam you know it's salvio
made it md blog our markdown blog and
stuff like that but by the time you
build all the stuff that you would
normally want into a blog that would
come from WordPress like you're going to
spend eighty percent of its going to be
the same amount of time and probably
less money for you to build your fancy
experience on WordPress so like if
there's a ready-made solution out there
for you I would say don't use meteor if
there if it really is just a static
website or like a non highly interactive
website then i would say use rails so
like you know it could still be database
driven and dynamic or whatever but if
it's not supposed to be more like a nap
and supposed to be more like a website
sure use rails and then you know there
it's meteor is still in New so there are
pieces of infrastructure that are
missing that you have to build for every
project so you want someone that's fired
up about using meteor instead of trying
to convince them to to use me there so
explain like what the advantages are and
what kinds of kind of sort of cool
things that they you can do with it and
if they're into it roll with it if
they're not into it you're probably
going to save yourself a lot of pain by
by not taking the job from the beginning
then fighting with them later on down
the line yeah so I think maybe my
perspective on this is this is a problem
you know we've got another question here
like how do you tackle SEO with meteor
and I think maybe the problem here is
there's one good use case where i'd say
like
you're gonna this is going to be maybe a
little more painful and meteor than
somewhere else and so if you're going to
build custom software and like SEO is a
concern or you know I don't know that
there's other little small corner cases
around server-side rendering like if
that's going to be a problem for you
then I would say maybe don't look at
media right now but you know the
interesting thing is like I saw a demo
the other days someone popped to react
into meteor at our local since nine
media meetup and you know they've got
server-side rendering out of the box
which is kind of interesting you know
and basically it's spitting out the HTML
and then making like react is making the
call back to the data sources and like
it starts reactively flowing the data
through so they're using like they're
able to use fast render to get the data
there on page load and it renders the
actual HTML output to the browser which
you know is exactly what you need for
something like SEO purposes or you know
any of that kind of stuff so I know it's
really really interesting to me yeah I
definitely agree like if you know you're
more likely better off just adding
disqus t to wordpress to get your side
comment functionality or whatever the
the new UI blog hotness design is rather
than going out and building custom
software and that's always an
interesting point like when i was at
gaslight we had a partner there who
always said like you know you don't you
don't want to build custom software you
don't want to work with us like you know
we're gonna our entire sales process is
convincing you you don't want to do this
and you know if at the end of the day
you still say you need this then we'll
build it for you but chances are this is
going to be a long process and it might
be a little painful because there's
going to be like mashing of you know
kind of ideals and figuring out how to
build the idea the way that it needs to
be built
or as feasibly you're able to build it
and you know uh it's it's a tough
process so custom software is hard
custom software is totally hard so you
wanna you definitely I mean to your
point you want to clamp it invested in
using the technology and getting the
benefits out of it so that you know as
you build each feature and you get
feedback it's okay that you're adding
like and that's one of the nice things
about Tynan pivotal tracker to or like
some kind of project management process
where clients are forced to prioritize
because as I think that comes in as you
collaborate then your fourth power you
understand like the decisions in the
trade-offs that you're making like it
does always take longer than then you
think if you're trying to make a really
excellent piece of software and so like
you don't want to go the customer out if
eighty or ninety percent of what you
want is already built like a good
quality for custom software and then as
far as SEO goes like I'm sure
server-side rendering is going to come
sometime soon I spy durable and phantom
Jas does fine like I it does for us to
like we first I mean it wouldn't want to
be in terms of Google search results for
for some of the products so like hey it
worked it happens yeah i'm gonna do a
google search for crater we could get
better with like our site maps i think
but i think there's a package for that
too yeah yeah i haven't done any site
mapping stuff um I don't know it seems
okay now like it's picking up the
tagline and stuff and it's got content
yeah the biggest problem for me with
spider ball and phantom j/s is like you
never really know when it dies like it
doesn't really tell you that hey we
actually just failed at doing the
singular job we were supposed to do for
you as a package you get something in
the logs but like you know
I mean who's who's closely monitoring
their logs to ensure that Google's
getting what they want so I don't know
like for me I i switched hosting
providers for crater and apparently
phantom wasn't set up right on the new
one and so you know for like a four
month period they're like Google was
just indexing a page i said loading
which was really bad so yeah I mean you
gotta you gotta check and like I
wouldn't say that we got it perfect but
um Google indexes us fairly often i
would say like every few days and so if
we make changes like they get picked up
relatively quickly hmm yeah yeah i would
also say like if if that's a concern for
people you should look at pre-render dot
io have you looked at that at all know
what screaming is at the houston yeah
yeah yeah someone's built a meteor
package I don't know how well it's
maintained I know it came out close to
10 coming out so I would imagine it
still works but I think it does a
similar thing to spy durable and that it
just detects the user agent and then it
serves up cached versions from the the
pre-render database rather than like
firing up fandom like they handle the
Phantom part for you and cashing it in
their database and that kind of thing so
nice yeah it's yeah because the one
thing that it is the one thing that's
not as fast as super fast and like
eventually that could affect your your
SEO I mean but this is again like the
sort of the icing on the cake unless
your business as a marketing business
all based on SEO but like really the
speed if you've if you've got good
content like you're eventually gonna
make it up there yeah yeah I mean you
know ASAP is hard anyway like if you're
building a SAS app the majority that
stuff's behind a log in wall right so
you don't need SEO for a lot of that and
you know there's you can all
split off the marketing side too and
totally when they hit the login button
it goes to ab dot you know my my SAS app
com or something like that there's a lot
of a lot of sites that are a lot of sass
yeah absolutely use that are exactly
like that and I think if that's a really
good suggestion i'm glad you brought
that out too to do that if market or SEO
is a big deal for you yeah this tool for
the job alright i think this is this is
close to when i asked earlier but been
Strahan asks uh do your clients come
with an existing meteor app or do you
usually just start fresh with just an
idea for the majority of your clients
the majority of the clients come fresh
and so we're doing greenfield projects
but there have been a few times where
we've taken over an application usually
that is a frustrated client and so it's
a it's interesting and for whatever for
one reason or another the previous
development team or single developer
didn't work out for them and yeah so we
come in and we basically give an
assessment of how we think things are
and like what how the time needs to be
spent to like stuff up to state because
we won't work on like we you know we're
actually working on an application in
collaboration with differential right
now but you know ninety nine percent of
time we're not doing that and we won't
like continue working on a project
without bringing it up to two are
basically our standards and our
standards evolved over time of course as
like all of us have gotten more
experience with meteor but in order for
us to like actually move fast and give
good value we need to get things
structured a certain way and to be able
to actually like yeah provide great
value to the client but the answer the
question is most of them come with with
brand new projects which is actually
kind of cool cuz
it's always fun the flip side of that is
that means most of the clients are
startups versus you know big enterprise
type clients or like huge venture-backed
startups or like mid tier venture-backed
startups and so those kind of clients
come with different sorts of challenges
like paying you money like I anybody
yeah so super budget-conscious clients
can be you know if you don't have the
buy-in for for meteor super
budget-conscious clients can kind of
kill kill your cash flow and especially
if you have other people on your team
that need to get paid that can be rough
and I've definitely got nailed with that
more than more than once yeah especially
last year yeah actually I was it's funny
I was like just talking to my lawyer
yesterday about this very problem like
you know I've got someone from two or
three years ago that didn't pay me for
some work I did for their startup and
you know we've been going back and forth
about it you know all these legal
agreements and crap and trying to get it
paid and stupid and then like all of a
sudden I had another client like a month
like 45 days ago I did some work and
this don't pay me and like you know it's
just it's getting to that point where
you know you maybe not going to get a
payment and you know I reach out to my
lawyer and he's like can I suggest that
maybe you just start working on a
retainer basis and you won't hear any
more so have you changed your practices
at all based on based on that yeah you
know I I I knew yes yeah it's based on
the original client like I always always
require deposit now to get going and I
always apply that deposit to the kind of
like the last bill once we finish work
so they're they're kind of paying and
you tend to get a feel for it I don't
know but it's definitely like I knew
this person they had taken my class and
you know they were putting together a
team and I was like a sounds interesting
and you know I want to do a
they brought me in to do a lot of
cucumber work which you know I always
loved helping out with velocity and that
kind of thing and it just didn't you
know like I don't know like I didn't get
the warm and fuzzies I didn't ask for
the deposit right because they knew the
people and then you know probably 3-4
weeks in like you know I'm not hearing
anything about when I'm gonna get paid
and you start to wonder and then like it
gets worse and worse and then you're
like I'm gonna take a pause for now guys
I can't afford an occupied it's so it's
the the worst thing as a contractor to
have that or as a consultant or a
freelancer or however big or small your
shop is to have that sort of uncertainty
in your cash flow cuz like you want to
be spending all your time you know
thinking about solving the problems like
writing the software and none of the
time doing dealing with accounting and
billing but unfortunately that there
really is the way it is so that's that's
cool yeah like taking a deposit up front
makes a lot a lot of sense um I don't
know how much you got shafted by four
are in the process of maybe not being
shafted um we'll see in the next week so
I guess I got uh I got shafted for about
about 7,500 bucks and it wasn't they
know like a make or break but it was
definitely like ah I wish that hadn't
happened right and you know it would
weave you know if we make mistakes like
we write something that has bugs in it
that we do everything we can to to fix
it and all that kind of stuff even after
you know if you contact me like a month
after whatever like we'll spend a day to
fix whatever random thing it was that
was there was our fault we won't do like
new future development all that kind of
stuff but we do our best to like you
know make it right and we want that
business statistics see but when a
client seems like they're not going to
pay then we so what
pins for us and this is something I had
to just implement as a policy so that we
wouldn't get these cash flow issues as
bad anymore is we don't continue working
if there's two outstanding invoices like
we just don't as a rule and we invoice
every two weeks and then if that happens
then anything after that requires like
partial payment up front to continue
working for the next period of time
which would be like a month basically um
and proves that the client is serious
one thing I always talk about with
clients to before we start I since I
think a lot of people in media are doing
freelance and stuff is I always always
always try to find out where the money
is coming from you know is it coming
from their own personal checkbook did
they get funding do they get a grant did
they you know are they spending
thousands and thousands of dollars on
like graphic designers and other project
managers and all its kind of stuff too I
so that I know one how much time we
should dedicate to the project like on
um on a week Lana like you know monthly
basis basically so we don't break the
bank but two is this it's people get
them much crazier when you know their
financing things out of credit author on
credit personal credit cards so like you
really really don't want someone that's
financing things off of their own
personal credit cards if you want to you
know unless you just want like a
one-month project and then you're going
to go off and do something else but if
you want long-term projects you need the
money to be coming from somewhere that's
that's a real business source of funding
yeah yeah and you know it's funny like
even though even the project I got
stiffed on you know when they originally
when I originally put the time out on
them this is the one from a couple years
ago was a rails app and you know they
like
I want to say like twelve thousand
dollars and they've you know paid it
down little by little over it's almost
three years now um but you know still
like I even asked for a deposit from
them and never start up and you know
they were telling me hey you know we're
about to close a round of funding and I
mean the deposit wasn't a small check it
was like seven thousand dollars so I
mean it's always a tough thing you know
22 just gauge this kind of stuff like as
a your right as a freelancer or a
contractor like this is this is the
tough thing right and um I don't know I
don't know it's it's hard so let's let's
get back to meteor crap and stop crying
in my coffee um what are your thoughts
this is from Bennigan's what are your
thoughts on famous react or you know
some of the other kind of front-end
frameworks that are available meteoric
have you guys used any of this kind of
stuff and what are you thoughts sure I
have experience with meteoric and nick
is super cool next the guy that's manly
behind it meteoric is great if it's
going to be a tablet or mobile app or
maybe you have a product in your doing
like you know you have your web UI and
you have your meteoric mobile UI and
maybe have a like a package or a common
app that sits underneath but either
those powers of functionality yeah
because I mean meteoric for people that
don't know is is it a media wrapper
around ionic to work with blaze and the
idea is that it gives you specific
interfaces for each mobile platform but
there's like there's no good way to do
like a web UI in that right it's not
it's not built for making a desktop
application or like a web application
it's specifically built for web and
mobile but it gives you so like my
favorite CSS framework right now is
materialized CSS com but you know they
what you get with meteoric is one like a
basic infrastructure for building
different sorts of mobile interactions
like different kinds different kinds of
navigation style so not just decide many
but also tie bars and all that kind of
stuff and then you also get what you
come to expect from a mobile application
which is like transitions between pages
and all that kind of stuff comfort free
which is really cool at the expense of
doing desktop stuff so where's material
I CSS does a pretty good job of being
like material google it's not going to
have all those page transitions and
stuff for you by the fall ah the others
were reacting was either other option
famous famous okay so famous made a in
my opinion famous made like a really
really big height there's a huge buildup
and then basically no delivery like I
don't really see I see using famous for
anything and then as far as I can tell I
because we will probably never be
building like a real-time game at useful
I oh but if you were then maybe that
would be something that would be cool to
vote on as far as react goes it's pretty
excited but I think the what's going to
end up happening is a lot of the
benefits the people and next time ended
people have four different parts of
reacts they're going to someone's going
to take that stuff and build it back
into meteor in the Reds manager
eventually some of that stuff you know
it's going to end up into core like the
server-side rendering and all that kind
of jazz the one thing that is a little
interesting as I've heard a few meteor
developers talk about they're worried
that something like react is going to
that meteor basically missed the window
because react came into existence or
meteor to become like the rails and I
think that is definitely not true
because just like angular they're like
completely different it's solving a
subset of the entire problem that you
deal with in web development and so the
advantage of react is that you can use
multiple kinds of backends but the
advantage with meteor is that it's all
taken care of for you so yeah I also
think you know the interesting thing
watching the the talk that Gerard gave a
meteor cincy
react number one looks very interesting
to me it's definitely caught my interest
but the other interesting thing is you
know two out of the three solutions that
he talked about forgetting react in the
media right now are actively being
worked on by meteor development group
and not you know that the third one
which is probably the most interesting
was like its own little router is being
worked on by a third party person but
the official like media react package is
being worked on by i believe ben newman
so um yeah I don't know I i think that's
that's that's that's really interesting
to me in signals that I think mediator
cares about this stuff and even with
blaze to coming out I think they're
they're still trying to think about how
to be a good citizen in this regard and
maybe how to include something like
react and you know I had a conversation
with Matt de Burgh Alice about this and
he pointed out something interesting he
said you know early on in the the
JavaScript lifetime you know everyone
there was a while there where everyone
thought mootools was going to be kind of
the de facto client-side library and you
know it turned out to be jquery in the
end so I mean it's still very very early
days for this this front-end kind of
framework thing client-side library I
guess whatever you want to call it so
totally totally so I didn't actually
know that's that's awesome so I will
basically be able to sit for like a
month maybe get the benefits of using
using that stuff that they're building
which is great as one of the things I
like about meteors they continue to
solve the problems I think the only
thing that's gonna kill meteor at this
point is if it's some at some point if
it gets because they've built a decent
developer community around and most
technologies that build a decent
developer community around it actually
shares code sticks around in one way or
another for a while as far as I can tell
from my little corner of the universe
I would I would agree with you it feels
like this feels very similar to early
days excuse me in rails land where a lot
of people were excited and a lot of
people were doing very cool stuff and
that's not to say that isn't happening
now but it definitely feels like there's
a point at which the community grows big
and mature and maybe there's some
stagnation and like what's happening in
rails or maybe they're going the wrong
direction right like we were all there
for what do they call that rjs and then
turbo links and like all these really
bad attempts at client-side kind of
interactivity solutions so and to be
fair like the the technology wasn't
quite where I needed to be either so
yeah a lot of stuff has changed in just
in there and the capabilities of mobile
devices and stuff like that to be able
to run and Cordova and phonegap and like
all these things that are pushing like
client-side applications forward and
that was from you know it was originally
from a different era but like it had it
done like competing project it was
pretty epic called merb mrb and then
eventually that got merged into rails I
think that became like rails to or
something like real three yeah there was
three okay it was painful yeah so like I
actually was in us and as our company
was using Merv and then that transition
was really quite interesting so you know
if meteor become if me or the framework
becomes super huge imploded then
someone's going to come along and either
for kit or write something that does
something like very similar like API is
but a lot faster and cleaner and people
are going to love it maybe integrates
with atmosphere and all that kind of
stuff yeah or it doesn't and even if it
does it'll probably end up making meteor
better but regardless all of this is
going basically in the right direction
oh yeah so speaking of like for king and
doing something different we'll take one
last question here it's from joris again
he says can you use meteor without a
back end for example to publish on
github pages and I'm curious I know that
you can and I'm curious if you've heard
of asteroid or looked at it at all now I
have it okay there are ended so I'll
take this one I would say definitely
look at asteroid it's they build
themselves is an alternative client for
a meteor back end and the interesting
thing is there's just some libraries
that you include basically they're using
DDP library on the front end and they're
using Q which is the the promises of
library and then they have an asteroid
browser JS file as well and you're
basically able to just instantiate on
the client side like an asteroid
connection back to a DDP URL and then
all of a sudden like real-time data can
flow back and forth and you can just
build a regular kind of JavaScript front
front adapt and my guess is this this is
the kind of thing that you could build
what yours is asking about where you
don't have to have the the full kind of
mini Mongo front end you just have the
DDP and it's it's bringing the data over
for you and doing the real-time updates
that is pretty interesting we wrote a
java DDP client at one point for a
customer then what a front-end in Java
and you know DDP is actually super easy
so if you can if you have web sockets
and you can and you know half a day you
can implement a DDP client and get like
the whole like real-time data everybody
who the back end part of meteor is quite
a bit different so this is like you
build you build an app that you don't
have to deploy to you okay so yeah you
pull this you would you build a meteor
app on the back end and publish data and
then on the on the front end you could
just use this DDP library and subscribe
to data and it would just like you could
for instance
what do they do this yeah so they've got
something called reactive query maybe
yeah so they've got like a they show you
like if they set up a collection called
tasks they can insert one just using an
insert call they can set up a reactive
query I don't know what that does
exactly but you can see like they just
console.log the results but you could
just as easily do like a jQuery change
some HTML on the page basically and it
looks like that reactive query just
reruns every time like something changes
it should fire so you know it's what's
super awesome is that web sockets don't
have the same like cross domain issues
and you can actually connect to multiple
multiple DDP servers from your meteor
client as well mm-hmm um but was the guy
was I George George a asking joris Doris
okay was he asking can you build like an
application in meteor and then just used
the front end and and put it somewhere
ah yeah he was looking specifically he
mentioned like publishing something to
get hub pages that maybe reactively
backed by meteor which I think asteroid
could do yeah and so maybe maybe a good
instance of this is if you look at
differential there github pages like
their their main page if you go to like
github differential com you can see
there it says like they have this many
public repos as many members this many
commits like all that is being tallied
in a meteor app on the back end and then
they're just using jQuery to kind of
like fetch this from a restful api but
it's already a meteor app so it would be
much more interesting to may be used
just DD pjs and get these and fill them
in the page rather than
having a lake do a bunch of jQuery
rappers and have this expose a restful
interface and all that kind of stuff
well I I think you can totally take the
the javascript in the CSS that meteor
bundles for you and drop it into a page
and as long as you're pointing the
connection at a DDP server like there it
will sort of work what before meter
supported cordova directly this is
basically how we were experimenting with
making mobile apps using cordova was
taking this pre built like contaminated
javascript and CSS files and putting
them into page because that's all meteor
and yeah i mean that's really all meteor
is so you could totally I think grab it
drop into a github page and have it
connect back to something yeah I guess
that's about the point um asteroid is
sweet though I'm going to look more into
that but that actually I wanted to ask
you a question assists or toll on these
lines do you think that there are going
toward are there already maybe you know
better than I do services that are
specifically besides like khedira but
besides quedaras specifically tailored
to plugging into meteor applications and
like providing some sort of
functionality I haven't seen a ton of
that I've actually been working on one
but I've I put it on pause for a while
about working on training material but
um you know my idea was uh what I've
started on is a bug tracking kind of
application which will attract the
client side in the server side bugs
honestly I put that one on the shelf
when I heard Khedira was going to be
adding that kind of functionality and
I've since heard that it's it's still
not quite up to snuff for people but um
also have other thoughts of you know I I
would really love to see a security
conscious like application that's doing
maybe code reviews for you and
suggesting places you might be leaking
data or exposing more than you mean to I
don't know I think that would be hard to
write I've been trying to figure out
like the best way that you could
accomplish that but I think that could
be interesting as well what what other
kinds of things that he looking for I I
okay so it's not a big deal but it would
be I think way more awesome if
eventually I wasn't doing this on rust
calls at all anymore I was just
basically doing an RPC on someone's
remote server and this would all
obviously probably be wrapped in a
package but like you know if let's say I
need to dump a bunch of stuff into like
an Amazon service or something like that
I would much rather do that over a DDP
connection to somebody or like okay so
here's another one let's say like I want
to send an SMS if to Leo had a meteor
package or just like a DDP API that I
could connect my I could do DDP connect
to API dental Leo calm and then coolio
call you know to Leo's API basically and
get callbacks not my kind of stuff like
these are the things eventually I would
rather do and probably like these
existing companies are not going to do
that but something along those lines I
would love to see hmm more even though
you're going to definitely knit yourself
down you know I think that community is
building enough stuff and there's enough
new media projects going along that if
you can solve one of these core problems
people like for people like even more
along the DevOps I'd logging to a third
party mmm that has a nice interface like
Khedira is not the first app that came
along that does performance monitoring
even for nodejs applications right but
it
pretty well for meteor specifically
right by doing a few things so like
stuff like that that I can drop into my
application I know it works and I pay X
amount per month for the client pays X
amount per month then mm and then we end
up focusing more on what makes that
application unique then figuring out how
to like do push notifications for you
know apple or something like that hmm
yeah that's interesting yeah I have
thought about like push notifications
I'd love to see like a package that that
makes that a lot easier or something
there's probably something Cordova
plugins but like I I get really excited
when I think about all like the micro
services that could be there for me to
connect my meteor applications to yeah I
would agree so I mean we had again like
when I was out there last month you know
I had a conversation with Matt and a few
other folks at MDG and you know the
interesting thing to me is like why why
go DDP right and that's because you want
like all that reactivity for free
perhaps right uh okay so using the HTTP
client libraries is pretty
straightforward um yeah if it was
something that I could use polar
subscribe I think that'd be pretty sexy
but just you know the JSON res stuff
always gets obstructed in an NPM package
into something that has more semantic
value and call like a cheapy i call this
restful URL it becomes like stripe dot
add credit card or something like that
mmhmm yeah so I mean my suggestion was
like I don't know like active resource
didn't work very well for rails but it
is still kind of interesting like what
if we could have you know a restful HTTP
backed kind of pub sub that's reactive
and you know we can interact with and
it's it's pulling the data that we want
I think that could be very very
interesting then we don't care about
these mpm rapper packages anymore
um we can just quickly build build our
own kind of version and I don't know
like I think I think enough of the
components are there you could build
something interesting component of
building like a rerun RESTful API yeah
yeah building like a like active
resource right which is it looks like a
database or it looks like a pub sub but
it's actually backed by restful calls
that you're making to a service so
rather than being Mongo backed it's just
restful fact some instance yeah yeah and
I like that separation in in the
framework between actually I like if I
would like the fact that you can
actually fake publications and stuff
like that as well feel like you know if
you wanted to provide real-time like a
paid service to provide real-time stock
updates or something like that to DDP
clients or like to meet your things over
DDP I think that would be I mean
anything this real-time could be a
pretty good use case too and that you're
right you're absolutely right the data
could be coming from anywhere it doesn't
need to be coming from an all talk tail
or anything like that bring it on it
would be I think it would be nice for me
personally to live in DDP left all of
all of the time instead of drop into
like media raccoon hissing calls to
restful third parties so I guess what
you're saying is you'd love to see
firebase that outputs DDP something so
I'd like to consume DDP services yeah to
do our base gives you the ability to
like build up like you can pull from
different sources and then they like
output I don't know if it's pub/sub but
something similar to pub sub like you
know based on the code that's running
for you um but yeah I don't know like
you're not the first one to think about
this or ask about this there's actually
I don't know how much traction it got
but someone built a
you know a quick meteor app that just
lists out available public DDP
connections that you can hook into and I
think the first one that they put in
there did have something to do with
stocks and so you can connect an in and
pull stock info out but yeah I
definitely think like that could be very
interesting like definitely having
things like weather data or you know
even publicly consumable DDP data could
be very very interesting all right ah we
went over our hour but it's all good i
think was a good conversation so I just
want to say thanks to you in for being
on the show and thanks to everyone that
tune in and watch live and for every one
that will continue to watch remotely I
do this once a month i'm thinking about
bumping up to twice a month if you want
to help support this kind of stuff you
can go to patreon.com/scishow that hey
that's patreon.com/lenguin amatt some
point and just put this on my own meteor
j s club site but how do you how do you
spell patreon patron goodness okay it's
a patr aon calm and then / meteor club
get you to the get you to the page cold
yeah an API but they don't so they make
me sad I've asked them several times for
it and I think they're gonna lose my
business cuz they won't give me one
alright well thanks for being on the
show man oh I guess
yeah in closing I will say Josh you're
awesome thank you for having me on the
show I think this is really cool i love
the community i hope we get the chance
to work together sometime soon yeah I so
if anybody has any like follow-up
questions anything like that my email
address is yet I am I is it like a train
going by yeah sorry it's like it goes
right by my backyard it's the musical
ending okay yeah i sent email address is
ian i ani useful dot IO and we are also
