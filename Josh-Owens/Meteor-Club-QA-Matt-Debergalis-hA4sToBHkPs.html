everyone so this month like we have an
extra special guest with us matt from
mdg welcome to the show Matt hey Josh I
was gone good good ready yeah I'm pretty
excited to have you on here I think
beard yeah I think maybe we'll have some
tougher questions than we don't like it
I don't know we this isn't a quiz is it
no no no you can make up the answers
right there's no right or wrong answer
uh yeah so um it looks like we've got
198 people registered and if you haven't
seen the show this show before it saves
on to youtube and I've got a play list
over there so you can go to my youtube
channel and find the meteor club QA and
just once a month I have a guest on we
talk about all things meteor and take
live questions and that kind of thing so
uh yeah so I think a lot of a lot of the
questions seemed to center around either
galaxy or sequel or wins the roadmap
going to be updated so maybe maybe start
thinking that way I'm kind of curious uh
you know I didn't see this question in
here so i'll just ask like what how are
you guys feeling and thinking about
react and angular and that kind of thing
Oh interesting places to start again it
all this stuff ties together so true and
we can hop around a little bit yeah and
and I should well let's just jump into
it yeah so we're really interested in
this stuff and the reason besides the
obvious just that there's been so much
interest in react if you look at what
people are talking about on hacker news
and angular if you look at the number of
developers the number of apps being
written the number of questions on stack
overflow things like that are both
getting a lot of attention so the way we
look at this let's take a step back is
just how fast JavaScript
own as risen and I think back to 2012
when we first announced meteor and you
know that was still a time when the the
people thinking really on the edge we're
building apps and JavaScript certainly
if you were delivering a first class
product out of a company like Google or
Facebook or Korra or whatnot you were
immersed in this idea that you could
write a lot on the front end of your app
in JavaScript and you would do it
because it gave you this really great
desktop like experience it gave you
better collaboration it gave you more of
an engaging multi-user user experience
right and that for a lot of those
companies define the product I mean
another example maybe more recently as
uber where you know the whole idea of
seeing in real time where the different
cars are for a driver to be able to
respond in real time to accept the fair
those are things that don't make any
sense unless your application is built
in this new style this new engaging some
people call real time or reactive style
so that was that was pretty bleeding
edge back in 2012-2013 as we started
building the first version of the year
but what we found now is of course
everybody's writing in JavaScript um you
know and we see it in the enterprise
when we talked to two large companies
they're trying to understand how do i
get my apps on the mobile on the tablets
why is it that you know the apps I use
in my company are really old and slow
and then I go home and you know the apps
we use on the internet or my kids use on
the internet seem really amazing and
advanced that's kind of a weird a weird
state of history so um the way we think
about this is we're building a
JavaScript application platform right
the language the language has gotten
really popular and it's exciting that
now it's I think accepted among many
developers that the best
way to build the front end of your
application is to use javascript it's
certainly the language that runs in the
most places so you can have a single
code base that lets you have a
complication on your web browser on your
tablet on your phone it's almost of the
code base you could use to run your your
cloud back-end right so it's it's got
this property that no other language has
about running in all these different
places that your app would run it's also
got this great ecosystem now of
components of you know everything from
from bootstrap and jQuery plugins and
ionic and I mean just the list goes on
and on of all these different higher
level elements that we can bring into an
application as we're writing or the
tools behind those things so sass and
stylist and last right the idea that you
can really start to build a library of
presentation layer technology and and
things build against that that you can
use very quickly the problem is it's a
total mess right it's it's a fragmented
ecosystem so the the rise of you know
one technology like react happens in
parallel with another very different
technology like angular we've got node
which is now forked in two different
versions we've got um just you know all
throughout the stack on the one hand we
have this amazing collection of really
great stuff and on the other hand what
we don't have is a platform right a way
to use all that or the best parts of it
or a good combination of some of them at
least they're gonna in a reasonable
repeatable way so here's some examples
of what you don't get without a platform
you can't take one team of developers
that's built an application and hand
that application to another team of
developers because they don't
necessarily agree on which tools they
used which which systems or libraries
are in there how they're connected what
are the convention
around how that code is written and
that's everything from like coding style
to how do we use you know class like
things in JavaScript to where our files
are arranged and so forth you don't have
that transferable knowledge that any
rails developer has if they walk into a
rails shop right they can look at a
rails project and immediately get a map
of how that applications set up another
example is on the more technical side
you don't have a wire protocol so any
rails app speaks rest so I can connect
to it from any other rest system I don't
have to agree with the backend team on
exactly how I built that right whereas
in the JavaScript world when we build
one of these really rich interactive
apps typically the connections between
the different parts the piece that runs
on the phone versus the piece that runs
in the cloud that's completely made up
by each team as they go and maybe it's
based on web sockets or maybe it's based
on long pulling but we don't have all
these interoperable tools so we don't
have proxy servers we don't have
something like curl we don't have
something like a patchy bench and there
again you end up with this really
fragmented world where something one
team bill doesn't particularly well
integrate with anything than another
team built even in the same organization
so the just to give you a sense of what
we're thinking the the way we want to
tie all this together is the idea of an
application platform so our job in some
sense is to collect the best parts of
that rich ecosystem that's emerged and a
lot of its emerged since we started
building meteor which gets to your point
about you know react for example and
bring those into a really well
maintained a system that has you know
one way to think about it is one book
you can read that lets you build the
whole app using your basic JavaScript
skills and your basic HTML skills so you
know the way we think about react is
some really interesting stuff is emerged
in the last couple years one of them is
um the the work that Facebook's done on
reactive dawn and we're really excited
about it so probably some of you have
seen we have a project in the works and
this will be part of the next video
release of offering a choice of few
layers so if you want to use react as a
view layer people are already doing that
of course but we want to make that
something that's well supported
something that's very easy to use out of
the box as a complement to the template
based system that we ship with blaze so
you have you have your choice if you
want to build jsx and react components
that's great if you want to build blaze
components that's great too and in fact
they all fit together so we we have an
example that we've been fooling around
with where we where we use both we had
better react component into a place
template right and this stuff is like I
think really exciting mostly because it
it there's so much out there that
developers can take advantage of and
what we want to do is make the patterns
behind that stuff really clear and easy
to understand so there's probably a
dozen different ways that people have
bolted reactivity onto a meteor react
application right how do you how do you
exchange between react component and
live data meteor we've we've tried to
figure out what is the best API for
doing that what's a standard API for
doing that so now anybody who wants to
use reacting to meet your application
doesn't have to spend a day thinking
through that particular detail and they
can get right to the business of writing
the app yeah that makes sense and I you
know it's interesting too because if you
watch your hires you know like you guys
hired Yuri and we tweet he's actually
gonna be on a future episode of the
media club podcast where we talked about
a lot of this stuff all right on yeah
yeah and I said all that about react but
the same thing is true for angular and
write it an angular as a new layer as
well especially in the enterprise you
see massive adoption of angular it's
it's emerged as a very popular option
for taking a back-end and someone
Ernie has and making a reactive
interface on top of it the challenge
that we keep hearing from angular
developers as well that's great but how
do I get my data in there and especially
how do I get Milt I'm data or live
updating data into my angular app and
meteor is is a great story there right
it's the rest of the platform that you
need yeah so we've been exploring what
that stack would look like also yeah
well and you guys you also have been
Newman I don't know like he was
definitely working on the react stuff or
has been at least since working with you
guys and then you guys also hired the
guy that wrote view jas right and then
you yeah benin aventura in New York and
Ben Ben was with Facebook Evan was with
Google and they both brought I think a
really good sense of the the modern
JavaScript ecosystem the kind of stuff
that you know these companies are
exploring and then we think there's a
way to package up in a really useful way
yeah alright so that was uh that was one
big one at least I had that I I hadn't
seen in here yet so we'll take some more
of these this one's from Neil O'Brien I
assume you say Neil I don't know I
butcher then I'm sorry man and his
question is the community seems in flux
and openness I can't seem to click here
with their something is wrong with the
app all right so anyway the community
seems in flux at the minute with flow
router and flowlayout gaining some
popularity people want server-side
rendering etc uh what do you think you
can do to address this should they
address this I mean if you think about
it like I'm ad-libbing on this question
here like the URL is the the most
fundamental piece of the web and by
default like media doesn't have any
support that out of the box so what are
your thoughts there yeah there's a
challenge that that we always run into
where
I think flow router is really
interesting by the way we've talked to
our new about it and we're using it
ourselves in some projects we also you
know Chris Mader's here and we've worked
with him on iron-router for a long time
and I you know even our own website is
built on that so the challenge for us is
we can't do everything internally and we
shouldn't there's some real downsides to
doing that so you want to encourage
experimentation I think it's been a real
positive that iron-router emerged and
remember that was even a couple projects
that came together with with many pages
and Tom's router and I think flow router
is a really valuable perspective and
another take on how to do this so in
some sense I think the best possible
outcome is to continue to experiment and
to push forward on the platform because
that's how we're going to find the real
innovation it's going to come from
projects like these that emerged as
really good patterns for building these
apps and it's going to take needing
oxygen and they need room to grow and
fork and merge and all the other sort of
evolutionary steps that happen in an
open source project that's really
healthy so I I knew that as a plus that
there are multiple options out there
that said I think routings a little bit
special the biggest problem is that
because it's not a core package it's not
in the documentation so the way I look
at the problem here is someone sits down
to build an application and meteor it's
a given that they're going to want a
router I think they're very few apps
don't have one and yet we don't provide
any guidance whatsoever on how that
should work or what you should use and
that's really in conflict with this
JavaScript application platform idea
that I talked about before right if you
think that URLs are central to an app
that you probably ought to have a story
for routing just like we have a story
for data synchronization or live
updating templates
you know the other key building blocks
of the app so I do think it's inevitable
that routing is going to is going to
come into core sooner or later um I
think there's some questions here about
the details and I'm not going to sit
here and say yeah it's going to be
project backs or project why or you know
exactly how or when we're going to do
that but the the way I look at anything
like this and routing is a good example
is if something emerges that feels like
the right fit for the meteor
architecture and if there's a way that
we can work together with the group
that's built that or bring that code
into core itself and remember in
corporate doesn't really mean anything
technically because a package of the
package so this is really about well I
think it's settling on a pattern and
then putting it in the docs more than
anything it's a confidence thing right
yeah exactly for a low we can tell
people low this is this is the standard
way again you can use a different router
if you want right nobody's forcing you
to use any of the core packages you
could pull out the router just as easily
as you could pull out you know
templating or any of the server-side
packages and so forth server-side
rendering is another example there where
you know I think different people want
different things it's it's really easy
to say yeah of course we want to render
the templates on the server and I say
templates but I actually think react
offers a nice approach here that we
would want to explore because of the the
architecture of the virtual Dom just
giving us a really straightforward way
to put some HTML on the wire initially
but you know if you dig into that it
turns out there's there's different
requirements from different teams some
people are really interested in just
fast SEO and the challenge there is that
relying on a whole Dom implementation on
the server side the way we do with
phantom is really heavy weight therefore
slow others are interested in something
a little bit more around the initial
page load time for the user and
server-side rendering can help but a lot
of things can help right so you might
also look at optimizing the size of the
meteor application itself for ways to
accelerate loading
absolute the the thing I try to do with
all this stuff is just dig in to what's
actually going on lord knows there's a
lot we could do to add to the meteor
ecosystem and to improve these different
aspects of building an application I
think in some sense of challenge is just
finding things that are mostly settled
in the community where we're not too far
out in front of everything and we can
establish that there is now a pretty
clear story for a pattern that we can
move forward with that's really the you
know the long and short of it I would
expect that we'll do something like that
on routing on the sooner side just
because it's it has emerged as a really
critical piece of the pattern and I
think you'll see us doing something
similar you know I can I could talk
about models or you know schemas or
whatever where again we've got lots of
different things in the community that
have emerged and I'm very fond of them
and I think it's starting to be clear
that most developers sitting down to
write most apps are going to lon more
explicit guidance on where do I put my
models right what do they look like what
what does uh what does a validator look
like a meteor veils give us a really
clear answer to that in the previous
generation maybe not so much with the
having to invent that from scratch each
time and so that's that's a family of
things that I think will do more and
more explicitly as we get toward two
point oh yeah and so the I I can't
remember his name but the astronomer
developer is logged in here in the chat
and he pointed out you know if
iron-router would have been floated into
core would we have seen flow router
would we of exactly you know known about
this so that this very interesting
points for sure the other thing we're
getting in the comments is can you
please put up your hood they've noticed
your your custom buddy it's kind of a
wizard like yes that is absolutely
original year custom printed background
and i'm pretty sure it's going it's cold
here what you know
it's like I'm pretty sure there are 230
people in this room right now that would
buy one of those if you sold it all
right so we'll move on so this one's up
let me just say that our R&amp;amp;D budget is
probably too large to support it with
with clothing sales yeah we're here I've
got my my fancy writing as well all
right so that the next one's from from
Neil as well uh MTG is has been
surprisingly quiet and the road map has
had some stuff in there for ages we've
seen firebase offer a galaxy like
solution uh why the quietness and
perceived slowness on meteor itself
lately and i'm gonna guess you're gonna
answer galaxy but that would be my guess
uh no i'd say mostly this is just I
haven't I haven't spent the right amount
of time talking doing things like this
and then updating things online like the
road map on the Trello board blog post
and so forth just to give a sense of
where we're going and the part of the
reason for that is that meteor 10 came
out meteor 11 with Windows support comes
out early 2015 and it's a good time to
take stock of the ecosystem as a whole
so I mentioned a little bit about how
quickly things have happened in
JavaScript so let me give you an example
of a few things on our mind there's a
new version of a language right es6 is
starting to emerge as a fairly well
baked standard and i think if you if you
want to think about what a modern
JavaScript application platform is going
to look like it's got to have a story
around the modern version of the
language so es6 brings in all kinds of
questions we've got actual classes for
the first time right my goodness we've
got lots of developer conveniences I'm
really fond of just the more concise
syntax for dictionaries of functions for
arrow functions when you just
lambda that you want to define right
inline-block scoping of variables Wow
right so there's there's a lot of these
programmer conveniences that we're going
to want to adopt for sure then there's
then there's some things like modules
right so es6 has a an opinion and
finally the language has an opinion on
what a module lot of look like something
that we've all as a ecosystem struggled
not having so meteor has some stuff that
you know we built in the interim for
that there have been some standards that
have emerged from the node community
there have been other standards that
have emerged from the client side
JavaScript community I think now that
the language is settled on something it
makes a lot of sense to think about how
to align around that so we've spent a
lot of time thinking about a lot of the
questions around how do we bring meteor
the application platform more in line
with some of what's emerged from the
JavaScript Standards Committee the atmos
crypt group and you mentioned ben newman
been sits on the technical standards
body for for atmos crypt so we've been
really involved in trying to think about
some of that stuff and how do we align
with some of the other things that have
emerged on top of that language standard
and I think that I always like to be
more vocal and more transparent about it
I I really think it's helpful when the
community pushes us to do that and you
know we do hear that and we do want that
feedback so i think the the biggest
story here is just to renew our focus on
talking more about what we're up to and
explaining the direction that we're
headed i think there's a role for a
formal roadmap but i also think there's
a role here for just more frequent
technical conversation around the
day-to-day and you're starting to see
more that on our blog Justin wrote a
post about the Cooper neji's
architecture for galaxy and I'm you know
we have time to talk about that today
sashko has been writing posts about some
of the work we're doing on reacting you
can expect to see a lot more of that
over time so I think its a mix of both
of those what I'd almost say it's the
size of the team to write because you
guys just hired a new VP of Marketing
you've got a VP of you know business
development coming in so you know you
you have people that can kind of like
have this stuff in there the forefront
of their mind and making sure you guys
the kempei attach it to her right yeah
and it's been a transition from the way
I think about the company is we were an
RnB shop for a long time right we were
we were building crazy javascript stuff
that you know was just far beyond what
what the the JavaScript ecosystem had
had settled on up to this point and
we're now making the transition to there
are a lot of people building a lot of
apps and they they want more guidance
more guidance around the architecture
that app but the thing I hear most when
I talk to people is show me how to write
the thing tell me where to put the files
tell me where to put the models tell me
how to connect this and that I I don't
want this like completely flexible can
do anything architecture we hear a lot
of requests for training right we hear a
lot of requests for support we get a lot
of interest in how do I take a you know
an application that i built and persuade
the organization to do that with four or
five more apps so there's there's a
bunch of this stuff that's all happening
around the idea of building the
ecosystem up and you know none of that
means that we should go and not be
transparent about where the platform is
headed so I hear you loud and clear on
that one it's just one of a bunch of
things that people are asking for at the
same time yeah that makes sense all
right so we'll call that one done uh the
next one is a kind of pertains to Mongo
and I'm sure you knew this one was
coming as well
you know there's there's been a lot of
negative coverage even still recently
about meteor or not meteor Mongo having
trouble with data consistency and that
kind of stuff there's an article a
couple weeks back hacker news I think
and so you know the question is um
there's a lot of different this is from
Lauren by the way Lauren rancho sans
right got it on my screen out um and
he's just uh talking about like reactive
joy there's a bunch of third party
packages and I actually think like just
I haven't delved deep into the code but
I actually think like there would be
performance issues than the one I'm
using in a nap i'm building so the
question is like if you need normalized
data what's your suggestion be to
migrate to a sequel based solution and
if so like what what would that be yeah
there's a bunch here that's time
together sure so you know we're
committed to database independence we've
always said that the architectures built
that way is why we invested so heavily
in DDP and a wire protocol that isn't
tied to the Mongo database or to the
Mongo schema so I think like any
application platform different apps want
different database technologies behind
them and there are trade-offs that any
developer makes should be making when
they when they make that selection so
that's that's one thing and you know we
we've talked some about our plans around
SQL that's a high priority for me we've
been hiring to help us build that faster
and the model I have in my head is if
you want to build your app with a
relational or relational database engine
behind it you should be able to do that
if you want to build your app with a
Jason document-oriented database behind
it you should be able to do that and the
the position of mongo in meteor is I
think you know we picked it because it's
a good fit but you should think of it as
the four
one way they not the only one who picked
right right so um I think Mongo itself
is going through a really interesting
transition the new Mongo three point 0
is built on a very different
architecture from previous versions of
mongo and there's there's some good
material on their website about a
technology called wire tiger that they
acquired and it folded it as a
alternative storage engine effectively
and people who come from though my
sequel world will remember that my
sequel went through a similar transition
at one point where it went from a
storage engine that was very fast but
had some questionable guarantees around
data integrity to an engine in I know
you be that was very much along the
lines of a traditional you know sequel
engine with the acid properties that you
would expect so I'm very excited we have
some developers that are using the wire
tiger engine in Mongo they've reported
very good results with respect to
performance they've reported good
results with respect to stability I
think in the future that is a very
interesting direction and we're we're
committed to making sure that that works
well so in meteor 11 we support where
Tigers back end if you want to use that
MongoDB hasn't made that the default
engine yet so we haven't either in the
in the meteor SDK but it's an option and
I think it's a good one for a lot of
people that are interested in questions
around Adam icity or data integrity when
they use Mongo yeah um the other thing
here is around joins and an a pattern
for reactive publishing I think that's
exactly like what we talked about
earlier with routing and with models and
so forth right it's a common application
pattern we've seen some experimentation
in the community it's probably at a
point where something ought to be in
core that puts a stamp of approval on a
pattern that we think is the best one
for being able to take two different
collections at a mondo database and
publish either documents from both
depending
on you know a foreign key or some sort
of composite document that pulls
together information for two different
collections we see it a lot it's
obviously high on people's minds and I I
I think there's a family of things like
that that all go under the banner of
giving people a more standard default
application architecture we'd very much
like to see in a future version of me to
your court yeah yeah I mean night so the
other interesting thing is I think if we
had like tracker auto run on the server
we could actually probably build a lot
of this ourselves as well so like during
my mastering meteor class we take
probably like 30 to 40 minutes to go
over how to do like in a publication you
can return more than one cursor and so
we walked through like how to create
that Twitter view where you're
publishing users and tweets through one
publication but then like we're grabbing
follower IDs and if if that code would
rerun you know on the live query side
whenever those follower IDs changed yeah
i think i think this theater has to be
something more like what you get from
rails or even the hibernate right it's
you know in rails there's there's one
option to pass to a fine is it include
it makes sense and you get back the
mechanics behind that are really
complicated and they've changed right
rails used to do eager loading using
left outer join that changed at some
point to be based on a series of queries
to the database but not an end number of
queries just a query against one table
then according against a second table
right and that is not in my opinion the
mechanics that an application developer
ought to be spending their time thinking
about that's a great it's hard to write
correctly hard to write in a performant
way and so I do think that that's best
put in the data layer the situation
isn't quite the same in meteor
especially against Mongo as it is with
rails but a lot of the same ideas apply
I again the test for me is should this
be in the documentation I think the
answer is clearly yes then on our wish
list for quite a while and you know at
the end of the day most most of these
queries look pretty similar in terms of
what you're trying to do exactly like
the example you gave ya the challenge
and just fitting into the autorun thing
the challenge a lot to run on the server
is I think in some sense that's the
wrong direction because that puts the
burden of thinking about reactivity back
on the developer in a place where it's
not as helpful so I think autoruns can
be really useful in certain places on
the client not always there a very sharp
knife right so you want to use them
carefully but what I found is that the
places people most often think about
using them on the server it is very easy
to inadvertently right incredibly
inefficient code yeah and because the
circumstances are more constrained on
the server in other words they're almost
always used or you almost always want to
use them in some sense for a joint of
this form or for a repeating task when
something changes the primitives around
observable queries and I think around a
higher level built in version of some
kind of chilly and end up being a better
direction to go just because they bacon
worth the high-performance
implementation that you know we can do
once and do well and then and then
support for everyone cool all right so
like we kind of covered the sequel
question and I'm gonna I'm so there's
another one here the next top one is
about a terrace jeaious which i think is
along the same lines as you know react
or i don't maybe maybe the interesting
question is if we get react do you think
we'll see react native follow closely
behind or how easy do you think it is to
maybe switch out Cordova I don't know
either those questions would be fun to
enter
um react natives very very interesting
for us it's a you know right I think the
really compelling story for a JavaScript
application platform is that you can
write a single code base with a single
team of developers that know normal
stuff and that's the basis of your app
on any mobile device that you'd want to
support plus the web that's you know
that's the ballgame for a lot of teams
it's incredibly expensive and difficult
to build an app that feels good when you
have to do that on each of all these
different platforms so for your you know
if you're a company maybe you're one
most important app you will have an iOS
team and an Android team or you'll have
a team that spends a lot of time
optimizing the the JavaScript version of
that using Cordova and you're really
careful about your CSS transitions all
of the different little details that
have to go into a great mobile app but
for a lot of teams it's just you know
it's too complicated and too difficult
to make the commitment all these
different mobile platforms yeah I would
have drilled react native is is we'll
see right it's really early but I think
it's a compelling and interesting
direction because there's a the
potential to get the best of both worlds
right we can write our code in
JavaScript our models are data
synchronization our business logic we
can even share some of that code between
the clients that are running on the
devices in the cloud or you have to run
your your validators in a secure place
with your real database but you get
access to the native widgets the native
UI components and most importantly the
native performance and so we'll see I I
think it's an area that's way too early
to settle on and say yeah the future
direction is to use something like react
native but we're keeping a really close
eye on that and I think a lot of this
next couple years with JavaScript
applications in general is really going
to be focused around the mobile
experience so you know any any work that
happens on that front is I think a super
exciting to see and you know we'll see
there's there's a chance that the
angular team could make a similar choice
with angular 2 point 0 you know other
things may emerge as well we're excited
about anything that makes it easier and
better to use JavaScript on the device
and I think that the the trajectory for
that is a really promising one overall
yeah yeah I would agree I mean it's so
I'll just say like the last six months
I've been working on a Cordova
application for a client and it's been a
very fun process there's certainly been
some I don't have any hair but beard
pulling moments i guess around for me
but overall I would say it still been a
positive experience and my guess is like
turning on the Android side of things
would probably take us about a week that
but the client only wanted iOS out of
the gate so it's definitely been
interesting and we're going to see that
pattern again and again in JavaScript
right there's there's things that are
possible but they're challenging meteor
could make those things a little bit
easier more accessible a look a lot of
world where a client doesn't say I only
want it for iOS nobody only wants it for
iOS right I guess Apple right but most
people want their apps on all the
devices well it is it is an enterprise
and I think that they have like they've
they've invested in the Apple enterprise
architecture so but there's so many you
know bring your own device now is
driving so much of this stuff yeah you
know it's it's getting harder and harder
to exclude any of the big mobile
platforms it's it's I think almost
always done out of a concern around
budget or time to market right and
that's where JavaScript can completely
change the equation I think that's where
meteor has the most offer for the for
the mobile developer it's a opportunity
to reach everyone on day one
and with a really great application
experience yeah yeah and I would say I
mean you know there's there's great
examples of that like having I go to
church at Crossroads Church and
differential did a blog post about
scaling the twenty thousand users and
the course of a weekend and that post
was about Cordova app that they built
with meteor and it scaled out you know
web browser android and iOS so I mean
you know they provided a pretty seamless
experience across all those platforms
which is pretty pretty awesome honestly
in a 12 week time period so kudos to
them um alright so we've got a couple
more questions while we're on Cordova
I'm gonna cherry pick some of these out
of here as well um the where did it go
there was one up towards the top I
thought I saw so I know one of them was
about offline app support are you guys
looking at that at all or you know
should we be looking at Ground DB you
think or what are your thoughts there I
think we're going to need to see some
some more research from the community on
this one before something or land in
core light is an interesting use case
it's a there's a class of apps where
it's incredibly valuable it's key to the
experience but those tend to be a very
particular kind of app right and if you
if you think about the idea of an app
that's collaborative where multiple
people are using it if you think about
an app that's live updating in the sense
that you can see each other's actions at
the same time that kind of goes in a
different direction and we've seen I
think a lot of the excitement about
what's possible to write in meteor and
with JavaScript really wants always to
be connected because that's where you're
you're you know you're working on a task
with other people or you're looking at
data that other people are changing his
they as they look at it so I think
there's a place for a clean offline too
get a story for a very particular kind
of data-driven app like a telescope well
what's an offline toes see I don't think
that's the top line requirement for
telescope right are you going to post
comments offline and then sync them once
you're back it's that's a fairly nice
use case right I I think a better
example would be um but I was able to
read people want to be able to read the
news right yeah um I think caching
content can be really valuable but right
but all flight support usually implies
something much bigger right it means
you're going to have multiple changes
you're going to synchronize those
changes once devices come back online it
ends up being a really specific data
model that I think has its place but is
not what the average application ends up
wanting to be able to do yeah so the
I've got a couple more questions around
kind of around when the next version of
meteor is going to drop because it looks
like it's in the developer anch anyway
there's a support for switching to
Cordova 5 so what we mean to a release
in the next few weeks where we're just
looking at the timing now there's
actually a lot that's landed on develops
into the last release so I I'm eager to
get that stuff out where we're mostly
always just trying to balance you know
releases go through a process here
because part of the value of an
application platform is that all of
these parts are QA together yeah you
mentioned Cordova probably the most
expensive part of the QA process is the
mobile QA element so testing that you
know on the Android development
environment on different desktop
platforms you can make your application
testing that those applications work
properly on the different mobile devices
that we support that ends up being a
fair amount of work and particularly
when there is a
to the mobile tool chain we want to be
extra careful about making sure that
that stuff's all buttoned up nicely so
we'll see we may push that out as its
own thing but we're also getting closer
to some of the initial support for
reactive you layer that I mentioned
we've also got a project running around
changes to the bill tool itself to
support CSS preprocessors and higher
performance by avoiding unnecessary
recompilation or trans violation of
different files so we'll just find the
right point where we can land a good
piece of that at once in a release yeah
so in oh just selfishly ask the question
like if someone wants to get something
merged into develop what's what's the
best way to do that because i had a pull
request out there that actually had
tests with it and it's just been sitting
there untouched for a while so like how
does a community member contribute to
mediacorp I guess full requests are
great and we've tried to steer all that
stuff to github the the first thing
we've tried to do is is get back to
everyone as quickly as we can and we
actually have a we have a tool built in
meteor to help us track everything
that's on github and make sure that we
make sure that we've got someone looking
at it and understanding what's going on
and a lot of times what happens is
there's a pull request and it doesn't
cleanly drop in it has implications
around api's for example or may involve
changes to a module that you know
someone's just going to want to have a
chance to think more about and I think a
place we need to keep working on is
helping give people a sense of what
we're thinking about and how best to how
best to fold that in or what changes may
need to be made before we could folded
it and I think a lot of that frankly is
just about building the team you know
meteor is this is not a small platform
there's a lot in there a lot of
different cross-cutting concerns so it
changed to a
templating could have an implication for
blaze or for live data or lots of other
parts of the stack Rana and I I think
it's a surprise to a lot of people who
are submitting more requests from the
community how much has to go in to
thinking through the implications of
each of those changes and then pulling
that stuff in the court so we want to
get better about a couple things one of
them is being faster and more responsive
on that stuff we always do there's never
never a point where that's good enough
and I think the biggest thing there is
just having more time and more more more
people on the team that can do that now
the other is is finding ways to expose
more of the the way we think about that
stuff so that people can have an
intuition for why something ends up
being a little bit more involved in is
obvious at first glance so we're trying
to write more just be more vocal about
that and I think also on my side I can
do more to point people in different
directions with respect to the roadmap
and say look here's an area like offline
support what we really welcome
experimentation we're not saying we're
going to merge every PR that comes in
right I don't think any project does but
a place where that kind of innovation
would be really cool maybe there's other
places where we have very specific
things that you know this is the way it
should work and we'd love to invite
people to help contribute
implementations of that and maybe
there's areas where we say look this is
about to change in a significant way and
frankly we don't recommend a lot of
attention here because it's going to be
hard for us to merge suggestions if
we're about to completely wrote until a
particular package or go in a different
direction with something okay makes
sense so yeah well we'll call that one
done as well well I can't call it them
that was my question um let's see so I I
do we got about 11 minutes left so I did
want to touch on galaxy stuff here so
that's probably what will focus the rest
of the time on the very first one is
when will galaxy be ready for production
quality media applications and is galaxy
the only business model for MTG
so we're working on it I'm not going to
give a date I think it's it's a we want
to make sure things are in really great
shape and you know especially when we
talk about running Production apps in
the cloud that's a high standard that's
got to be rock solid that's got to be
something that you know you've put a lot
of effort into building the app it's got
to run smoothly and correctly our
strategy for that is to build on top of
the best stuff that's out there so if
you haven't read it Justin Santa Barbara
wrote a post on the blog a couple weeks
ago about the architecture of galaxies
and why we chose Cooper navies as the
core piece of open-source technology
behind that and I won't go over the
whole thing but the short version is I
don't think there's anybody in the world
more knowledgeable about how to the
reliable distributed systems than the
team at Google and they have been baking
the very best practices and the best
architectures into Cooper natives we've
been working very closely with them on
that because we've been maintaining the
parts of Cooper natives and support AWS
which is where most people want to run
their apps today right so that's all
evolving Cooper Navy's just recently hit
code freeze around one point of features
and Google and partners like us are
working really hard to get that into
really great shape so I think the first
question around when is it ready for a
stable production use a lot of that
comes down to how quickly we can land a
stable version of Cooper Navy's and that
is moving very very quickly we're really
excited about the pace of that in the
direction that that's going and I think
that we're really good shape on that
front actually and it's just a great
foundation to be able to build on
because it's open source it's something
that everybody can look inside of and
trust and understand and again is based
on like the way that probably the very
best people in the world and the teams
that have had the most at stake around
building these big distribute systems
that have worked on um
what was the other question uh is this
the the only business model that you
guys right have in front of you the only
business model Dulli way to make money
we've said for a long time that we want
to ship a service called galaxy that
will let you run your apps at scale and
that's how the company will make money
so what I'd say is look there's there is
a lot of interest in having a reliable
way to run these apps and I think a lot
of larger organizations are excited to
purchase that as a commercial service
and the reason is because when you run
your app in production there's a lot at
stake right and down time can be really
expensive everybody knows this story
right so that the stakes can be very
high if it's a if it's an app that's
critical to your company maybe it's
something customers use maybe it's an
internal process that you've got running
it's really important that that stuff
work really well so the way I think
about this is galaxy is a good place to
start because it's a service that we can
run based on the best possible
architecture designed around the needs
of a modern meteor app and then there's
a lot of stuff they can sit around that
so we talked really early I think about
you know people asking for help with
their app and help income in a lot of
different forms but I think it's
important that if you sit down to make a
commitment to building an app in meteor
we want to be able to help you with all
the pieces that story so we ought to be
able to help you run the application at
scale we ought to be able to help you
make sure that it's written in the right
way we ought to be able to help train
potentially the people that are going to
write that out and give them the best
practices around the architecture for
that stuff so I think you'll see a lot
of stuff on that front but definitely
the the anchor of all this is a really
strong story for a modern cloud
environment for run
yeah and that's what galaxy is the long
and short of it yeah so I mean it it's
interesting to me to watch happen too
because uh you know you get you
mentioned earlier you guys started as an
R&amp;amp;D shop and so going from you know an
R&amp;amp;D shop to hosting and support platform
like you know that that's a pretty big
transition in my brain anyway I don't
know if that's true a lot of hiring and
whatnot but what I mean have you guys
talked about SLA s and support and like
the paid offerings that you'll have
there at all I think different people on
different things it's you know and we
can look at the way that I look at the
job in ecosystem is a good map for how
this stuff works because it's such a
rich history of how to take applications
that were built using a platform in that
case Java and in different settings with
customers that have different needs
making sure that they have everything
they need to be able to run that in
organization so yeah look some people
want 24 7 365 I want to call you at any
time and make sure that any problems i
run into or addressed right away and
that's something we're going to be a law
for people at some point others are
going to want look you know i wrote i
have i'm a i'm a JavaScript developer I
am NOT you know first of all I'm not
controlling an Apollo launch here right
it's it's the states are different and i
just want i want to know that we have
running well i wanted to run the right
way i want it to run in the right place
and I don't want to sweat the details
right so just a really give me a good
story for what do I have to do to make
sure I'm doing everything the right way
and I think of that as sort of a
continuum of the same questions we
helped answer when you're writing your
app so just like we point you in
packages that are in core because
they're the best way to build a nap and
we'll add to that list for things like
routing and so forth when it comes time
to run that app in the cloud it
shouldn't be a bunch of complicated
decisions right it should be um it
should be the right decision and it
should be reliable enough that you don't
have to think about it too much right
there are better things to spend your
time on and wondering if if your
application processes are healthy and I
think there's a lot we can do here
because we can make changes in the
meteor open source core that align with
the capabilities of a cloud hosting
platform to make this stuff work really
smoothly it shouldn't be a big mystery
to figure out if your app needs more
horsepower behind it because the loads
going up or if you know one of the
machines fails and so we have to
reconnect all of the active clients to
some other copy of the application want
to do that really smooth way those are
exciting to people like us but I think
for a lot of developers it's like I just
want the thing to work well right so a
lot of that stuff we want to we want to
put in the galaxy in a way that anybody
can take advantage of it without being
an expert in these questions and without
having to learn a whole new set of
technologies just to be able to run an
app effectively yeah yeah I mean I
totally agree that that's definitely
seems to be like a main client concern
is you know are there scaling experts or
like how am I gonna get this done that
kind of thing so yeah you know look it's
this stuff doesn't have to be so hard I
think if you look at a lot of developer
technologies in history they're just
uselessly complicated and we've always
set out to make things accessible and
easy and I don't mean that they're dumb
and simple and stupid I just mean
there's no excuse for a platform it's
hard to use when we have the technology
in front of us to make it easy to use
there's no excuse for posting that
requires you learn all the intricacies
of web sockets when we have the
technology to make that stuff really
really simple and easy to get started
with and I think there's an art to doing
it in a way where if you do have the
sophisticated understanding of how it
works on the inside if you for example
know what couperin 80s looks like you
want to be able to take advantage of
that so you ought to be able to observe
how the system is working
to be able to swap out different
elements of a system with either a
custom component that you wrote or just
a different direction but those should
be choices that are optional not
required and the starting point should
be really really simple and
straightforward and that's the
experience we've always strive to give
developers on the meteor side and it's
the experience where we're carrying over
to the question of how do you run that
application once you've written it and
you're excited to get it on the net and
have people use it yeah so I'm going to
skip the top voted question because I
think scaling like we've talked about a
little bit but its its individual to
each app right like I can build an app
that could probably scale to 10 min 10
million users and 45 yeah 10 million
user 40,000 concurrent that's the thing
that can be done but it's going to be
different for each app so i don't i
don't know that it's worth us talking a
ton about my comment on that is one of
the things that javascript so new and
JavaScript apps are so new one of the
things that isn't as established as it
is in the in the old generation of web
technologies is a good story around
benchmarking and something that we're
excited to work on is how do we kind of
answer that question right how do we
prove that the you built an app I want
to I want to load test it what does that
look like there's a lot of stuff in the
community around that but there isn't in
my mind a really clear standard
benchmark for the performance of a live
updating or a cloud client app like what
you build with meteor and we're gonna
we're gonna make some progress on that
yeah all right awesome all right so
maybe we have time for two more do you
have a heart-stopper yeah okay uh so in
one sentence David socorro wants to know
what what feature are you most excited
about that you think will lay in the
meteor this year yes six yes six there
we go that's awesome I am also equally
excited about that it's a great language
it on and we'll do some work to talk
about each of these things that we're so
excited about in it but if you want to
talk about how to architect your app in
a clean standard way
there's so much here around watch
scoping around classes around modules
that we just think really makes
JavaScript a great choice for
application development and we're
excited about each of those things we're
going to make it really really easy to
use in a meteor say awesome I'm excited
all right so last question and I will
say I got into a heavily heated debate
last night about this one and so this is
from Nathan mmm Castilla I opened send
that right sorry I butcher names all the
time uh what's your take on paid meteor
packages will that impact the chemistry
inside the media community i'm looking
at WordPress and Drupal communities and
I feel like one effect that paid plugins
had on WordPress was changing the focus
from the community as a whole to the
developer as an individual do you think
this is a good or bad thing so if we
have that kind of time I mean look I
think people should make money when they
write software it's very bad thing for a
package author and we've seen some
examples of this in the meteor community
right it's bad thing for a package
author to write something great people
want to use and and make a living on
that and then something we've always set
out to do is create an ecosystem where
things like that are possible and
frankly encouraged but I think the
question gets at a really interesting
point which is community we've focused
on this since the very first day we've
always thought that a strong healthy
community is essential to the success of
any of this stuff and we're all in this
together like it's it's it's it's not
just open source in the sense that code
comes from a lot of people it's also a
community in the sense of cheating with
other how to write software we've
invested in debt shop as a way to share
stories and help people see the kinds of
things you can build and how to how to
think about you
meteor to accomplish something bold
right whether it's building an app for a
company or whether it's building
something for a community of your own
and everything we do has to has to
support that so I think it's going to be
a really exciting challenge to help the
community evolve in a way that allows
more and more of this commercial
ecosystem to emerge whether that's
consulting shops were packages that you
purchase or plugins to galaxy or all
these other things that could happen
yeah well also I think there's something
really really special about to be here
community and it's not lost on any of us
and we're really excited to help
continue to press that forward and to
make sure that it's a really welcoming
place for anybody who wants to
collaborate and share ideas and be and
be open and welcome been rewarded for
doing that and inside the community too
yeah I totally agree and I i agree with
you cinnamon right like uh it's very
hard to be an open source package
maintainer where you get a lot of
requests coming in from people and you
know you get that angry shakes fist like
this broke my app you should fix it and
you know here you are like giving your
time and you know it's it's it can be
very frustrating problem to deal with
and I I see no problem in asking for
some dollars up front to help kind of
offset your time involvement and
something like that and especially if
you you give a good experience in my
opinion the other thing I'd love to do
is we're in the same boat right meteors
an open-source company and we have to
make money a package author that wrote
an open source software package wants to
make money right there's a lot we can
share about what we've learned and uh
you know I don't know what form that
comes in and obviously this is waving my
hands a bit but I'd love to get to a
place where a lot of what we know and a
lot of what we've learned is something
that we can share and give back to the
community as a whole and help you know
with everything from like how do I price
this to what does it look like to
package it up to just that turns out
there's some really interesting new
ideas around
open source and business models that I'd
love to I'd love to have just be a part
of the ber ecosystem as a whole and
however would learn learn for that use
that yeah agreed all right well I don't
I don't want to run over too much here
first I want to say thank you very much
for coming on the show it was awesome
having you on here and everyone saying
thanks for your for your taking the time
out to do this everyone seems like they
enjoyed it so yeah I do yeah awesome
alright guys well I don't know I don't
know if I can top this one this was
definitely like a lot of people watching
and commenting and way more questions
usually we'll have a couple left over
but next month we'll definitely find
someone interesting to talk to and
hopefully keep talking about all your
meteor questions so thanks again and
tune in next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
