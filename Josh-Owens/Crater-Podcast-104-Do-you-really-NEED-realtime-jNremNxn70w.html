welcome crater fans i'm your host Josh
along with my co-host I'm up be hired
hey ami how's it going yeah yeah to the
week break I guess yeah yeah come on
things happen but you know back so back
to business yeah yeah I had a crazy week
last week so we just took the week off
yeah so he'd wait with a show I guess
yeah yeah really it's been a lot going
on you know yeah Grug going on since our
last two last show that's for sure yeah
yeah I looked you know again I got some
compliments to like everyone enjoyed
Lauren stuff thanks alright so let's uh
let's get to it yeah I'm gonna take my
mind today so uh yeah this week we are
going to talk about why entrepreneurs
choose meteor which sadly I cannot load
that article uh and then we are going to
talk about reaction is testing with
mocha and an enzyme making sense of the
mobile development ecosystem and the
activity with Redux and meteor one what
is this yeah I you know I really
seriously I can't load this article so
there's this article that was found on
created by these guys like jazz solution
debs joshua i still don't know if you
guys are just spammers but you had a
really good topic here on why
entrepreneurs should choose meteor and
in the topic and it has like a bunch of
people who are co-founders or founders
at companies that pic me here as their
software and they all say the same stuff
they just say it like you know ease of
development and you know you can do run
one thing everywhere but um it was kind
of like
like this article actually just says you
all the good stuff you know I why you
should choose it like as an entrepreneur
that there's more stuff than like all
the positives shown in the article you
know I don't know it's tough play well I
choose meteor is a lot harder argument
to make these days then that was it
before yeah I mean is it though like I
feel like I know it's tough right
because on the one hand you have a lot
of meteor was a hugely opinionated stack
but as with a lot of opinionated stacks
you tend to move towards like offering
more choice and now we're at that stage
where we're offering more choice um you
know it's migrating towards NPM like we
didn't we didn't really talk about it
but 1.5 someone pointed out in the chat
room that one point five uh had they've
been working on it and like it they've
done a lot more on that branch than I
had realized yeah oh like it's it's
getting closer to the point where all of
media will actually be packages on NPM
so I think that's a good move but you
know you're choosing I guess there's
different parts of it right and I think
if you're an entrepreneur you wanna you
want to get things done quickly so you
have to decide you know it doesn't make
sense to choose something like reactor
blaze and personally I i would if you're
expecting your businesses to succeed to
some degree I would try I would probably
choose react I mean what are your
thoughts there yeah I would definitely
choose react right now probably because
when you're building a company from the
ground up you want to just try to
leverage as much of the community it's
possible there's a lot of stuff that you
don't want to build you don't want to
build the simple stuff like especially
maybe if you don't have a designer you
don't really want to build like all the
buttons yourself or you probably want to
use like some material design or boost
wrappers for that you don't want to be
making them like making you I ponents
all over from scratch every single time
you want to be going to empty a more
some other
source and installing components and
you're using the ecosystem itself you
know but I think like so that's that's a
good that's an easy decision to make is
because like there's a lot of vision you
know turn waste for react but like for
people who are building their businesses
on the back end or on the server side
you know where the database is actually
pretty you know you want to have an
array of data sources things like that
like um that's might be harder decision
to make you know but is it I mean so I
try to think about the mindset where I'm
an entrepreneur and I'm building
something which I've done a couple times
like a built Twitter apps and some apps
that hook into the Facebook API and like
I can work with those api's with meteor
so like I sent you your answer is gonna
be like maybe Apollo right no actually
I'm not even well maybe but I'm not
having about that but actually because
see not every business let's say it's
not every software company is gonna be
like primarily on the web you know like
they may have api's on the web but they
may be servicing like offline products
or you know or like they're like a big
bank and they want to have a huge
amounts of security in the car apps and
stuff like that and it's not like it's
not like on day one you need all that
stuff but like if that's the nature of
your business it means like like you
have to be HIPAA compliant or something
is the nature of your business you know
but you might get you know road block
from certain choices meteor has a forks
for other maintained young people are
maintaining forks of these compliant
versions but if you're risking your you
can't risk your whole business college
some community contributor that are
going to actually you know keep it up to
date you always run that risk of it like
fizzling so well I think you're deciding
that it's okay to take on that technical
debt of maintaining that project later
if it does fizzle out right or having to
switch at that point but I guess like
here's the thing if someone came to me
and said I'm gonna build the next slack
i would say number one like meteors
probably guitar
for that yeah which right now like it
makes me a little sad right I think you
can get I think you can get some amount
of growth out of it but it'll be a
Twitter situation where later you'll
switch the back ends and things will
grow but you know I I look at slack and
I wonder like how long was Stewart
butterfield and team working on slack
before it blew up to a billion dollar
unicorn yeah you know and and to me like
the fact that you can iterate quickly
and build things is helpful the fact
that you can use react that's not
something you'll ever probably ditch on
the front end like it's proven to be
scalable for someone like Facebook so I
mean I I wouldn't really worry about
that component and so then it becomes
like you know what does the back end
look like and I don't know it isn't is
really interesting but i think is an
entrepreneur like you're always gonna
wear a bunch of other hats and like
getting code out the door and in front
of people is super important and that is
something that meteor is good at so yeah
i agree with that that's you're sure
cool nice so the next article i'm
excited this one yeah the next articles
by michael show me he's in the media
community and he has a pose called react
unit testing with mocha and enzyme now
that should we have 1.3 we can empty em
sell a lot of other package or mpm
modules from the greater your ecosystem
and you can actually start using enzyme
which is made by Airbnb to unit test
your reaction front end components it's
really cool because they use this they
use your mocha mocha can be your test
driver which is awesome so you don't you
can still use like a practical mocha or
you can even use like mpm in just like
the npm of everclear module for mocha
and essentially what you can do is
actually shallow render components into
a test right so if you have some
component let's say it's a to-do item
you know you want to bet you want to
assert certain things on it
components on pcu I because reactors
just functions because everything is
just a function you can actually render
everything into this you know this Don
that is actually just you know invisible
it's only visible to the test and then
you can just great bunch of assertions
like you would using like mochas library
or chai which is just an assertion
library so you can assert like I'm gonna
stir that the you know that the title of
my to do is like I gotta go to the
grocery store you can make assertions
like that which is super cool and that's
what this whole blog post is about is
explaining that and getting you started
because I think unit testing front end
is gonna be huge thing this year that's
it yeah no I totally agree like so like
my pitch is always gonna be like you
should be testing if you're not testing
like shame on you hey always always try
to convince my clients they should be
testing as well so um this is not like I
try to practice what I preach when I can
convince them there's value there but
like here's the thing you can write
documentation and that is a way of kind
of giving other developers an idea of
what your code intended to do but that
documentation can easily get out of date
there's no way to verify that the code
is doing what you wrote the
documentation to do and instead to me
tests help convey that message of here's
what I intended this component to do in
the case of in react unit testing the
front end um and so like you can think
about like refactoring becomes a lot
easier because I can understand that
obby wrote this component to like handle
to-do list items and have like
checkboxes that should do something and
like depending on the you know the props
that are being passed it should display
this way or that way and so like we can
test all those different pieces and you
want to be able to think about like what
are the edge cases here like you know
and you
test all that kind of stuff and once
those tests are written they're checked
in you can put them into a CI and you
can start running that that CI any time
codes checked in and if I decide I need
to refactor a piece of the application
and it touches let's say the actual
underlying collection and changes what
the schema looks like maybe I break
Bobby's component and I didn't realize I
bro copies component the test should
tell me you know yeah that's a really
good point it's given by the UI testing
used to be super hard back in fact
couple years ago yeah but no one ever
did it then like protractor came out of
angular developers so using like
protractor and karma to start riding in
a test because front end libraries that
more mature to allow for it but we react
man if you guys use it using the enzyme
is just so easy like it's it's like as
if you were writing react like I always
remembered unit testing fun and all you
seem like a different like framework
like a different like mindset than what
you are actually doing so those like oh
I'm gonna use completely different
syntax to test my angular components
that actually writing angular components
does it but now it looks like the steam
is the same sentence please just
JavaScript it it's just totally oh nice
thats that work yeah I like this because
it's it's definitely like it's talking
about react UI testing which i think is
really really good but it also like
shows you quickly how to get it done
with meteor now that 1.3 is here as well
so it's not like meteor specific totally
but there's a nice component to it yeah
and full full disclosure I did I did I
did not pick this topic obby did but I
did help with the feedback on the on the
posts all right um what is next show I
think you know I get this question a lot
from people like what should i be using
for mobile development and I know you
and I have had this conversation before
too you know there's there's the option
of like you could just make html5 right
and I think back to do you remember moon
dot Co those guys have made a little
space game oh that day that's pelleted
that's the whole time yeah so like that
was done in html5 of meteor and like it
was already active and wearing great on
the phone right and like I just pulled
it up in a browser didn't have to
install anything perfect game right on
my phone so like that that's the
instance of just html5 it just works
right from mobile development and then
you start to move into the hybrid apps
which would be Cordova which is it's
still HTML Javascript CSS but it's
compiled and running a web view on the
phone instead of you know running as a
native app on the phone and so because
when in that web view container we can
now start tapping into AP is like
getting the location which you can still
do through html5 but we can start to
access other parts of the phone that we
can't necessarily access like blues
bluetooth I don't think you can access
Bluetooth through just native html5 so
you know you can build an app that maybe
taps into that a little bit more but
you're still writing HTML CSS JavaScript
and so that's definitely an option and
so like number one you should go read
this this is like a four-part article by
Brian Rinaldi who works at telerik and I
actually have to reading this article
like we're doing crater remote comp
mobile edition and I after reading this
article i decided i want to put a panel
together to cap off the end of the
conference and so Brian's gonna speak
i'm gonna speak i'm gonna probably
moderate i'm gonna try to find one or
two other people to come on and sit on
that panel as well someone who's like
pro native and someone who's maybe like
yeah HTML or pro cordova um and we'll
just have a debate about all this as
well like you know kind of going back
and forth I think that'll be there just
so many camps in the mobile party like
there's just so many camps and the thing
is you talking about entrepreneurs today
the first thing I was prettier needs to
think is how are they gonna have a
mobile experience to them how are they
going to
whatever their idea is include on mobile
yeah and if you have a plant and you see
like the thing is would you want to hire
a web developer who can put it on both
platforms android and iOS four you a
quick them a quick amount of time or do
you want to finesse it you want to get
an android developer iOS developer and
this like suppose so many camps have
like different opinions on like what
even the talent was what you should do
at that level yeah so right and that's
that's what this article talks about
it's like it says you got to look at the
skill sets of your team are you
targeting one platform both platforms um
I like I mean he says both major
platforms but you know I mean don't talk
in dos bonita um how essential is
performance like we talked about I felt
like the moon game worked great I didn't
get any leg eNOS like canvas worked it
was great I think it's perfectly fine
but I I don't think you could go build
like ladies kingdom rush or something in
html5 with camus maybe I'm wrong I don't
know I'd be curious to explore that a
little more and then like how much of
how much code you have that could be
reused right if you're already building
an app and react can you reuse it has it
been built in a way that you could reuse
some of it as react native components
maybe yeah so I mean there's a lot of
questions you gotta answer here and I
think you're absolutely right like if i
look at work pop right who has you know
landed millions of dollars in funding
through its life cycle you guys are
hiring developers to specifically work
on both platforms to deliver a native
experience correct and i think some of
that comes down to like if i look at the
cordova app and maybe this is like my
media bias coming into it but i think we
don't have code splitting and so I
remember being at an early vanguard
meeting with uh it's been right you're
CTO yeah yeah yeah so as an early
meeting with that
and he was he was talking about like
load times and like how big the
javascript files are from meteor and
like you know loading a 2 Meg javascript
file is crazy and you know we even were
putting out a space dojo show probably
like Monday or something and we talked
to Jen looper from she works with native
script and she's talking about putting
out like angular 2 and native script app
and it was like over to Meg's for this
simple little wind chimes app that just
built in html5 was way smaller so you
know you got to consider a lot of these
types of things like what's that
experience gonna be like you know she
said in the show you're really just
charging your customers for you to be
able to deliver this experience in this
way right because that data load over
cellular connection that's why 1.5 will
be a lot more exciting because you get
to get rid of the bill tool can be yeah
I'll tell you work pop is 11 mix Wow big
a sap dude that's crazy 11 Meg's and we
have a to do a lot of stuff to reduce
that for our users so yeah yeah we're
not very happy right but we're trying to
figure it out yeah I think you're right
like 1.5 will definitely so there's like
interesting ideas right like you could
do code splitting so you only load the
code you need for the page that you're
looking at yeah it would be helpful but
I actually think the thing that'll be
more helpful is like this idea of tree
shaking which I just heard about a
couple weeks ago and it's just the idea
that now that you're importing all the
things that you're depending on you can
go look and say like oh look there there
depending on moment but they're only
bringing in like you know this piece of
moment and so we only have to like bring
in the pieces that are all needed and
rather than bringing the entire moment
library so kind of interesting yeah so
you know i'm i'm excited i think
building apps building mobile apps
javascript is the way the future like I
think the amount of like ramp that you
by building one platform that works on
two environments like kind of a big deal
yeah no no there's not there's a lot of
there's not that much like industry
information on it too so it's why the
remote conference will be pretty good
yeah let me say it yep so if you guys
are you know what I'll make a code right
when we get off the show but if you guys
are listeners go to cough dot cratered
io should be able to pull up the
conference and see what's going on I
actually have more speakers I gotta get
up there I've got no down but uh yeah
and just use the code crater and you'll
get five bucks off the ticket so I think
that'll be something nice for listeners
but uh I definitely think like to me
looking back it's all I've done for the
last year and a half is build mobile
hybrid apps so I think yeah I think he's
gonna be bidding on the future an
electrode the current speakers are
pretty good you know you got a was
Spencer Carly he's buildin what needed
that new spring John Pickett in theory
about John's talk yeah I think James
back to you as well so there's about a
lot of fun is much there's more speakers
to film so sweet great definitely we're
gonna be covering the gamut to I just
picked up another game developer who's
gonna talk about Cordova so oh yeah
we've got to tocs ones on react native
building a game the other ones react or
Cordova and Bonilla games oh man alright
yes check that one out that tell us
about the next story alright so the last
topic of the day is that actually I
wrote this one I'm not going to talk
about we're not talking about the actual
the actual posted so we're talking about
this concept that Josh and I have been
here and over the last couple weeks when
people say oh is that is that is it this
does it have real-time support and so my
article is called reactivity with three
notes a meteor and I pretty much explain
like for meteor apps that do not have
any real time components that's you know
picture pic meteor because if it's like
other qualities right easy
used and shared shared code and all that
all the jazz that we love we're never in
it for the real time get right so we had
to pay the performance cost of real time
this whole two years that we've been
using it and we cut the line and due to
the line in the sand and said we're not
going to do real time step we don't need
to so I'll just ask with how are we
going to convert our live query
experiences where things are just easy
and just always react and all that stuff
how are we going to do that in turn
change that into a reactive experience
and that's when I started thinking
what's the difference between real time
and reactive and I there's it is
actually a clean different real time
means you're using technology that as
soon as something changes your users get
to see the data right away like and
without with paying all whatever cost it
takes they will see the data
instantaneously a reactive is different
reactive this means that your your
system is message it's like it's message
driven reactive it means that in
response is some stimulus I'm going to
update whoever's listening right that
doesn't necessarily have to be put on
the server like watching queries right
reactor doesn't mean the server just
means that your system is can scale you
can speak to other parts of the system
and update their information all in this
you know this like message bus or then
driven you know paradigm or pattern of
program so for a meteor ass if you can
you can use meteor methods to mutate
data right we can also use meteor
methods return click plain JavaScript
objects and that's the best way to make
things nonreactive on the servers they
have yeah and you actually what you can
do because you know the frenetic
community has made stores and grab kill
and all this cool stuff you can actually
use Redux stores to dump that meteor
method data and it can actually just
feed the UI as a reactive pics you know
and I go into how to make optimistic
methods which are kind of just like
meteor methods that hit mini manga but
they're just optimistic for redux and
that's the whole thing like with this
even with all of everyone first question
is oh is it real time
and there's always this question it's
like you really need to understand that
most tools should not be built for a
real time unless like the major major
people using the tool are building real
time applications right by rethinking
db's horizon I feel is for real time max
it's for people who are real time to
need real-time experiences that's why
they picked them in the first place you
know who's gonna pick like we think DB
or like horizon if they don't have any
real time features in their application
you pay a lot of costs for no reason so
that was your article what do you think
about all this yeah you know I gosh yeah
I have strong opinions here and I think
you're on to something because like I
don't did very very very very very few
times I care about real time right like
I look at it and you nailed a head-on
like uber sure absolutely I want to know
when the driver is a few blocks down the
street so I can walk out my front door
absolutely my sense you know I you can
almost make an argument I don't care
about super real time when it comes to
slack like don't notify me yeah I don't
know maybe like I do i do think that
needs to be a real time experience to be
to be honest but um but it is like it's
another inbox you have to check uh but
if you think about it like you go and
you look at Twitter right and you're
okay like there's enough data to consume
there that you want it to be reactive
every few minutes you don't really care
that it's every 30 seconds or every 10
seconds work as it happened that someone
hit return you care about seeing right
away you know yeah there's very very few
instances where you care about that
return key being hit and using reaction
to that and so yeah I just I I think
you're right like there's there's
definitely been a cost that's been
associated with it I know like Max
savin's posted about this before like
why is there no easy way to publish some
data but you don't really care about
watching it or
getting reactive updates from it and
like we've gotten little tweaks along
the way when it comes to meteor um I
think you're right like it's hilarious
because I'm in the Apollo chat room and
like every day you see someone come in
so it's real time working yet I you
don't know time you don't need real time
I promise yeah like I think there's
probably one percent two percent of the
population that would actually be
building an app that needs real-time
functionality yeah and you know there's
you can get away with user-driven
behavior you know you know music if you
expect some data to change in front of
their eyes you can be the magician and
just say oh I cooked it and you know it
did what you thought it was going to do
but doesn't don't necessary to pay the
costs on the server to do that right you
know honestly like is it that bad to
have a set time out in the client and
let it recall and 30 seconds to save
data change like we literally had this
conversation with the client and they
were trying to decide like we'd have a
major performance issues loading like
thousands of client records into the
front end to run to get some aggregate
data and like we didn't it didn't matter
like it turned out like I found out
later like they're okay if it was five
minutes delayed and so we just we run an
aggregation quoted on the back end
instead shove it into the record every
five minutes and because it's reactive
like if you're looking at the page it'll
update what we do like I could have
probably instead just put a set timeout
or set interval every five minutes to
just call an Apollo endpoint a graph qln
point or something to just give me like
didn't any data update you know yeah and
then Apollo that pole thing for you so
that you've not you not to do all this
at time of stuff so yeah those are
always in the article I just said like
you know if you're not gonna use a palo
right now or grass hill or something
then you can take the meteor method
approach but i highly recommend getting
into apollo and grass killer and now for
your front end but in the meantime
you can always use methods and make
things out there yeah yeah I don't know
like I'm I may be opinionated that I
would rather not wait on return method
returns but I mean you can use like
promise stuff to kind of wrap up your
method calls and yeah you guys yet you
can always like figuring this thing is
like there's like there's never always
like the silver bullet but you can at
least like make it happen yeah you
figure it yeah like I another good
example is crater right like you load
that front page and there's 20 stories
there and like we're probably paying a
pretty heavily heavy penalty costs and
monitoring that data and like there's a
little observer reuse the guy just put a
video out about all this by the way yeah
cube about like using Khedira to hunt
down performance problems but plumps up
like it's always where you're gonna have
your performance problems right on the
cake always yeah like maybe sometimes
methods but very rarely pub/sub yeah
yeah but if you have high observers okay
dude okay so yeah and you know this I
don't want to get too far on rampu it's
like I don't know if you knew this but
all publications are blocking my default
did you know that well I didn't know
that yeah yeah yeah totally blocking by
default so when you issue a request for
five publications it will sit and wait
and answer each one in order that's when
when you go in a key deer and you look
at that weight time that it has and it
shows you like it was waiting on five
subscriptions that's because those five
had to get done before it could answer
the next one and can you unblock them
with this dog unblock you can if you
install a meteor hack sunblock package
yeah but you know it you can't you can't
go in and easily unblock packages that
are doing subscriptions for you either
so that that's kind of a problem because
like I just think of all the places my
puter and I waiting cut that stuff oh
yeah so I want an intact it and like
made it a global unblock but I really
think it should be part of media Corps
because like we're fighting against how
node works by blocking and waiting on
those right because there's no reason
away like you fire
request and say I need some data and
then you don't even get a return right
you just you get a subscription handle
and then everything comes back over the
web socket so you're not even waiting
for a return years like just sunblock
let node and fibers do it's Jake the
subscriptions have called that function
so like that's why you know you can put
a callback function in a subscription so
with a subscript returns you can do live
on air or like whatever or you can fetch
the next subscription right that's on a
client right like there's no reason the
client just gets a handle and all that
data on air already or any of that stuff
all comes over the WebSocket it doesn't
it's not returned immediately from all
we get is what it is return the
subscription would then do it some Sun
callback function where you can do more
added functionality I bet you that's
what's blocking this whole thing because
it needs to know I don't dis little
differently this ought to be done
different that's what it is I agree like
so I look at the Apollo project and
wonder like is it worth fixing this
problem in DDP I don't know like I
haven't really heard a clear commitment
mdg like what what is what does DDP look
like in the face of you know major
pushes for a possible yeah let's trip
I'd love to hear that but I don't ya
what is the media data system look like
without using fibers you know like
farmers farmers works with note for note
6 so yeah ma'am and I don't know no node
can do its thing let it do its thing
