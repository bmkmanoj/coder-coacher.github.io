2015 black friday welcome crater fans
i'm your host Josh Owens I'm your
co-host been Strahan hey Ben you try and
steal my Thunder there is that sure you
said that's your black friday hating yes
my black that's what happens after you
have to pick through the lines and like
little people to get your three dollar
blu-ray this is where my wife comes home
it shows me the receipts ah nice how
would you spend what how much did you
save what ah gosh yeah that's what she
bearable this was terrible but I you
know I felt so we used to do it like
every year up until about four years ago
I felt a little left out so I decided to
have a black friday sale my on my
training whoo fifty percent off at huge
man that is him actually I didn't I
wasn't gonna do it and then this morning
I just woke up and said hey what what
the heck one mm-hmm crazy go through it
I haven't been on crater today um da bum
all day yes honor did you put it on
there I did not I should I'm gonna leave
it up till cyber monday um so we'll see
maybe I should put it on crater I don't
know you should so then tweet having I'm
between what I don't think it's
newsworthy but I will tell you what is
newsworthy this week oops let's pitch
there we go gallery view now we now you
can see us both in equal sizes ah graph
ql is king wordpress switch to node and
react well i do it ah how's the thing
that's a bit of a misnomer and yes react
in tracker integration flow router
four-point-oh air notice column for some
help help wanted nope help and does
media need a data layer mmm some of
these things might fit together i don't
know let's see ya
alright so graph ql is king yeah I uh
number one I love the little animated
gif on there I'm a big fan of means and
gifts and blog posts in case you haven't
figured that out yet with that this is
this is really good because I don't know
like I just I haven't really paid that
much attention to graph ql I've just
kind of like had my heads down in my
head's my head down if the mediator
community just working on apps and
teaching people to do things with meteor
and i really like played with react much
and I'm played with graph ql and i
honestly the first time i looked at
something for graph q I was like well I
don't I'll get it what's the big deal
and um so after reading this post I was
like oh this this makes a ton more sense
to me and why you'd want to use graph ql
so i thought was a great post and popped
it up their own crater and namely it
just I i think if you think of graph q
eles like rest but you can specify the
field you want to get back you know
that's that's kind of interesting and
then those fields that you specify they
show the Star Wars version of it where
you ask for like a hero and you want
their name and then you want their
friends and it's got like what movies
they appear in and that kind of stuff
and and then it shifts the friends since
they're also heroes like they come with
their name attached as well and that
that's a good explanation of kind of how
it works and how it even cascades down
to when you're asking for other things
that are similar it'll format them
similarly I don't know would you think
of this post I read like the first part
of it and then i retweeted it like the
day that I came out yeah and then I was
like I'm gonna reread this on the
weekend yeah get to a rate watch since
we recorded on friday it's not the
weekends I didn't finish it
so I mean do you feel like you had a
good grasp on what graph ql was no no
not at all okay it's a replacement for
d3 right know how kid you know kitty wow
you're done you're off the yes
graphs man fancy grass right that's
exactly a fan you know here's the thing
like you're gonna say that a bunch of
people might not pick up that you're
joking and oh I'm totally joking guys
yeah um yeah no I mean I think it's you
know it's interesting right it's like
this idea of schema and strong typing
and REST API requests kind of all rolled
into one idea I don't even think do they
even put out an implementation of it
themselves I don't know maybe relay does
that I don't know anyway um this is I
think they just they put out these ideas
of things facebook and I think it's a
little weird but you know it looks
interesting and I yeah I don't know I
guess it's not a lot more to say till we
get to the other story I should have put
them back to back I guess yeah no I like
it yeah I'm thinking right now going
through it I just like stream through it
right when you were going through your
little spiel on it and right away I saw
the benefits on a project I'm working on
right now yeah yeah yeah i mean III can
think back to my days of consuming rest
api's and Link it was so long ago like
just yesterday yeah consuming stuff from
facebook or twitter or something like
that and you know there's a bunch of
 in there I don't need so mm-hmm why
you send it yes Twitter and it just
slows us down I mean we have to iterate
through that stuff possibly and yeah I
just throw it away and it's just right
there so yeah yeah if we can get back uh
exactly what we want and like someone
doesn't have to build out a really
complicated rest api or a bunch of rest
routes and all that stuff and instead
they can into my craft ql
yeah everyone passed her it's gonna make
everyone faster the server the front end
that's awesome yeah I'm down for that
it's very cool the conclusions awesome
it says basically basically ref ql is
the future of the internet period he
likes himself I'll say that she the mic
the poster definitely likes his stuff
there were there were some comments on
crater where they were comparing like
making three dress calls to like you
know making different graph ql type
calls and faster and I don't know you're
starting to get down to like the nit
picky like measuring it is probably not
faster it's like we're talking
milliseconds faster difference here I
mean tcp overhead is really what you're
talking about in that case and I don't
know you may be splitting hairs I don't
know if your Amazon that maybe that
comes down to like a million dollars
lost but most of us well I'll give you
an example so i was messing around with
moving rested EVP into a package mmm-hmm
we have that rolling on our side right
now and we're about to release it but i
was building some more examples out and
i wanted to get like wind data real-time
wind data from yahoo weather from
different cities I had that show and and
ping that like every second right yeah
well the only way to get the wind data
was I need to get the whole uh whether
object for each city and then I was hit
when I was calling it every second i was
having performance issues already with
with Yahoo's API yeah that stuff's not
always the fastest and you know it can
be sometimes it fast sometimes it's slow
to like I've had times where i use a
google local api and it's like boom you
know you get results and other times
you're like waiting waiting waiting oh
there it is well the thing was like if
you're asking for just like the forecast
the five-day forecast that's really fast
all the time boom boom boom yeah it
spread cash train but just like their
api or just how it's made i have to ask
the for the whole object and there's
some calculation in there and i'm sure
and that's just it down
well you know what's interesting is I
guess I could still use a cache on the
backend and still use something like
graph ql it only return the results you
need um yeah that's the work yeah I
don't know it's interesting stuff it is
worth like if you if you're not sure
what graph ql is like stop press pause
go read this thing right now yeah and
and also I like need to mention that
it's on my short list to like master the
stuff to learn in 2016 yeah yeah all
right just tell us about wordpress been
okay so like they threw it every day it
didn't eat everything PHP gone yeah yeah
no it seems like it is though the
marketing seems like this is huge thing
true it's like it's it's the WordPress
admin it's like Donald Trump hair huge
so it's like it's like so the admin is
like a theme of itself right and then
you got your front end theme and so like
they they replace that all I with
JavaScript you know and they're using
react and they have nodes serve that up
and then it interacts just with a REST
API all right so the book he is still
there and you're still using that
through a REST API yes yeah but this is
kind of a big deal because I mean this
was a terrible in her face like I always
hated getting into the admin section and
working on my wife's website because
it's like it's so slow like you click
something and it's like wait wait wait
wait oh there it is tell there's always
been really innovative with like the
user interface and the usability of that
of the admin theme and then they've
always showed it off and marketed really
well whenever a new version came out
right and distraction free writing I
remember that came out and like I think
Matt's blog posted that you link to is
like perfect like he's like man we just
like felt like we had a couple anchors
and he called out two of them one was
being backwards compatible and the other
one was PHP in there and he's like we
had to move to a modern JavaScript
and interact just with with the API yeah
now it's like he was right on but it
does send shockwaves through that
community kind of like oh yeah because I
mean you have people that could build
plugins and packages and now they have
to kind of learn react and figure out
some new stuff it's probably not like
terrible because the plugins and
packages generally you you would do
something on the front end and then you
have like a configuration in the back
end and my guess is they probably done
an okay job but exposing some easy api's
for building your configuration pages
and all that kind of stuff yep and you
know frankly like everyone's like oh
they're ditch in PHP like they don't
need to ditch PHP PHP hosting is pretty
cheap yeah and I feel like on the front
end you don't really need like serving a
blog is probably not best done in a
JavaScript app just being on it like
that's like that particular pattern is
probably best server rendered and sent
to the client as is and you know the
client doesn't really have to do
anything yeah there's a lot of advantage
wordpress blogs haven't always been
about performance on the client cool
i'll order one with advertising anyway
huh they load them up with advertising
anyway some do ya have affiliate links
another crazy crap oh yeah i mean that's
this true of like every i don't know
vlog yeah yeah everybody so look but
this is a huge win for javascript taking
over the world and like Matt pinged a
little bit you're there like hey we
power 25 percent of the web now they do
and so here's the thing you know I I
think that's an addition genuis
statement to make in this article
because I think people by proxy are
thinking oh well twenty-five percent of
the Internet's on reality that's not
true you know those a lot of those sites
don't have react on the front end and
the WordPress thing but if you install
the jet pack or whatever and you've got
your own install WordPress you can now
manage it through wordpress com and you
using Clipstone react and all that jazz
so you know this is this is a there's
there's a lot of blog authors who are
now being exposed to this single page
app and JavaScript react that kind of
stuff well and JavaScript seat in the
world I'm really surprised that react
got this I mean huge win for react I'm
not I said in the fact that it's like
kind of brand new like he was saying he
alluded to them starting working on it
last January yeah so I was like a year
and like right above the rear conf that
and that was really raw that was really
knew I mean I would be I just like I
don't know I tip my hat to the wordpress
team I was working on it I frankly you
gotta look at it and say did they make
the decision because react native did
that announcement come out in January
and they thought well what the hell like
we'll build this react app and you know
in two months maybe we see iphone and
android versions coming out because
react natives there and they're able to
build it quickly maybe yeah maybe I know
that they've always had a problem with
keeping the place the cross-platform
mobile apps in sync with each other with
features because I had separate teams
working on them mm-hmm so if they could
try and get like one team working on it
I could definitely see a huge benefit
for them yeah i mean that's that's not
to be underestimated i can tell you from
experience like being on i was i I ran
the mobile team at excuse me a company
that godaddy acquired called out right
and uh it was painful because you had
people consuming an API no one wasn't
there was no API team no one was keeping
that stuff consistent the there was a
team writing backbone apps that were
like monkeying with api's and then they
had like a titanium app which was
terrible and frankly we had to move to a
native app and we were rewriting the API
I was just it was a lot of pain because
yeah some people writing Ruby some
people writing iOS some people writing
JavaScript and like get a coordinator
recently just
mess yeah I have a feeling or and here's
an interesting thing that I'm curious
about I haven't done any more research
on but like wordpress hosting is known
to be like really cheap and it's PHP
awesome are those hosts going to now
start providing a note hosting as well I
don't think they have to so based on
what I was reading as long as you have
jet pack installed you can just use
wordpress com to manage your blog even
though your blog is self hosted and
installed so pulse like day basically
they get a hook in and then they can
start using that rest api on your your
machine and i think they handle
permissions that way i think maybe i
read it wrong but i'm pretty sure that's
how that works yeah well when I was
doing wordpress I like never wanted to
touch anything wordpress com as a
customization and they lacked a lot of
things out for like little upsells so I
always did private hosting especially
for the admin side yeah yes yeah anyway
huge wimpy don't you get it I'll know
more later yeah this is exciting this
exciting yep you know what else is
exciting react and tractor integration
tell me about that what is that I feel
like we're sneaky sales sales snake oil
salesman there's something I don't know
we totally are yeah all right uh yeah
what about next time we record this huh
I'm just being gross haha doesn't have
to listen to it uh faci spacey james
from the sideburn project which is now
the blaze react project made another new
project called tracker react I totally
like it would have been me out of called
a tracker jacker but you know what
that'd be awesome I'm a fan of the
movies if you know what I'm talking
about what's their org name their org
name is ultimate yes that's awesome yeah
uh I don't know if that's his or the
react blaze react I don't know anyway um
but they release this thing called
tracker react
its a mix in that you can pop in to
react right now today and you can start
using things like session right within
your react I was blew my mind so
interesting I didn't read this at all no
okay no and I'm wondering like why they
would want to do this uh well so I'm the
dress I think the problem is a lot of
people don't like react because you have
to do that whole like get meteor data
and like set that up ahead of time and
then and then deal with that and so this
allows you to get back to using
reactivity directly within react instead
of having that just wide of this get
meteor data call and you know he talks
about like some people might be
concerned that it's not the react way
but he says actually get me to your data
is already sideways data loading and
they're working on making a first-class
API to do sideways data loading and like
that's different than just regular state
that you would track not so I don't know
like this is this a long article but I
think if you're if you're already using
react this might be something you want
to take a look at I'm scrolling down and
I'm seeing the first few comments and
it's all this guy in sashko and Tom
going back and forth and so that piques
my interest right there it does it does
ah because if they're like diving into
it enough where they're going back and
forth that means it's a good
conversation to be had yeah I actually
didn't read any of these comments so
yeah I'm interesting now I'm gonna leave
this tab open and read it I was gonna
just ignore it until like someone hit me
over the head later on in my life saying
hey you need to know this or not because
there's so much noise out there in the
world like like just like shuffle stuff
on suicide and just focus on important
things for now yeah i see so like the
initial response talks about using a
reactive are
and if you call like a get inside the
render and then do a set outside of the
render call it won't actually cause the
data to update it won't cause a rear
ender right yeah because the only thing
that invalidates in react is this that
props and this that ah that data oh yes
that's Satan and prams I'm sorry what it
boils down to is you have to write a
helper method like in his example he
shows a title method a title helper
method that returns session doc yet
title and that works fine and that's
reactive and will update and cause
render to rerun but that's not the case
if you do the session get inside the
render then that won't be reactive so
right that's kind of interesting little
caveat there yeah and this goes uh disco
hanahan kind of with the conversation
that were having with RK rock star or
something like that in our in our chat
maybe or even like they handled the data
the meteor mixin remember like last
weekend we are talking about the article
on why they decided to use this data
bring a meteor data into it mmm I didn't
I didn't see that coma okay there's too
much been too much oh my gosh the chat
room is insane yeah zoom all of meteor
club chat room anymore I'm just happy
that like react conversations have taken
over the Phoenix conversations yeah yeah
I mean you know here's the thing like I
don't think it's gonna disappear oh come
on i think it will now with the
wordpress news coming out no
but I did I did enjoy the why I won't
use meteor rails for my next startup oh
yeah did you I like that article to you
saw that you doing yes it'll putting it
on did I know I tweeted that myself too
because I enjoyed that yeah that was a
fun article yeah so flow router
four-point-oh a Help Wanted call help
wanted if it weren't for the call to bug
them I don't know if it was like a help
wanted as much as a help and discussion
welcome type of call yeah so
congratulations to Erin Oda for doing
this i think he handled this right I
agree this is the type of communication
that we want to see from mdg right just
like this open conversation and he was
very inviting to ask people their
opinions move things around you know
start having a conversation with us
about this and erin oda is like
amazingly busy like it's not like this
guy's twiddling his thumbs so for him to
like come out and be like yo like life
let's work together and make this great
and he'll he'll be involved in that i I
think he realizes you know there's like
there's only so far he can take things
you know and if he wants things to be
good and ongoing and you know I think if
you look at mob it's mostly him and I
think in order to build something bigger
and more sustainable than yourself I
think you really have to do something
like this in an open source project you
have to say please tribute ideas
come help write code I mean basically
you have to build a team of core
contributors just like I mean you look
at rails or any other projects out there
that are open source they have teams of
people that have permission to alter
code without oversight or overview and
you know start to build that that kind
of process it it sounds like a lot of
overhead but you know at the same time
like you got to think about your bus
factor I like if errno that we're hit by
a bus what's the likelihood this project
will go on yeah and that's the other
thing is aaron Oda like dude he's like
out there
startups he has Coderre he is his own
training then he starts going so he's
rocking the world man he is rocking it
and so this could easily the first thing
I thought of when I saw this was oh
great this is not gonna go the way
iron-router way right this is the right
thinking to like have Isaac hard for
Chris to build like I'm router was very
very complicated and very very I mean if
you look at it it's just super complex
code and you rewrote it all to be
smaller packages so hopefully people
could consume it easier but I mean at
the end of the day you still have to
understand what each piece is doing and
kind of grok that and and really get
down in and he just hit a lot of crazy
coke going on yeah well and he
definitely made the effort so like I'm
not knocking Chris and that but I Sierra
nota like making it uh as in like a
conversation piece mm-hmm you know he's
like he's driving the conversation not
only is he driving the code but he's
also driving a conversation about it you
know yeah and I think it's easier to
have that conversation too because I
mean you look and a meteor essentially
made the same announcement and it was
much more controversial because they
just they have a lot of apps and people
are worried about what's gonna happen
whereas I think with flow router he's
still catching on and you know it's not
not gonna be super painful and if you
want to see something a router needs to
do something then you should jump in
here and contribute for sure yeah yeah
so four-point-oh is gonna bring
server-side rendering actual regular
package yeah I love it I read the call
and they're working off SS our branch
currently so I think they're just trying
to get it shored up and ready to go okay
because I know like they have the flow
router dash SS our package and then
thats our branch if you'll bring this
into regular flow rather than i'm
guessing yeah okay cool we use flow
router SSR on our okay grow com site
right now yeah with reactor yeah we
loved it
yeah it's probably way more awesome than
that mess of spider bullcrap that I had
a while back with a crater that was
terrible I got a screenshot on my other
machine and it's like 40 spider what
phantom j/s thread spun up because
Google is trying to consume crater yeah
that's insane yeah take down the site so
speaking of era nada he posted this
today and I thought it was interesting
especially given we've been talking
about graphic ul and he's been big on
graph ql mm-hmm he's gonna promise
promising us graph ql posts but i guess
it's like my promises on a CDN post well
I mean maybe okay so you're on this page
looking at this blog post right above
the title you had the categories for the
Coderre blog and what's on there all
product meteor graph ql user stories
other uh yeah but if you if you click on
that it actually shows you like it's
only meteors highlighted those other
ones aren't tags that are applied to
this no what I'm saying is you can click
on basically I'm saying as Aaron oda has
a whole category for graft you all he
does yeah and I he believes the lot in
graph ql and i'm starting to see why and
i think when you read this post you
start to understand why as well um i
think that huh okay I'm sorry I got you
I'll check oh yeah grab ql no want to
get this out like I think he's
absolutely a hundred percent right in
this blog post that I think live query
is super super interesting but I also
think that it can be super super
expensive and I can just I can see like
Max seven like fist pumping as I'm
saying this he's also championed for
some kind of data layer that exists
between Mongo and the client and live
query is not that optimal data layer um
you know and he's he suggested what if
we have some
kind of smart layer that sits in between
there that keeps track of like the merge
box is expensive right now and
monitoring the hawk log is expensive and
you know we need we need something
better that scales better than what we
have now and you know maybe maybe graph
ql integration starts to get us there
and then we need something to kind of
work with that and I I don't know how
else to say this but we don't see sequel
support right now because it's really
expensive to go out and write something
else like it works really really well
with Mongo and it's tightly integrated
and that's in the long run that's a bad
thing it makes it hard for us to consume
other api's in similar fashions whether
that be like a sequel database or rest
api or whatever like there's we don't
have a great story for that right now
and he's essentially he's proposing that
we have you know we need some kind of
data layer that handles schemas and you
know I think he's advocating for is what
if graph ql worked but it sent data over
the DDP layer hmm kind of interesting
I'm right at that right now yeah yeah i
think i think all meteor developer
should read this blog post absolutely
yeah see you you need to understand that
using meteor it can lead you to some
potential pain I mean if you if you look
he actually says in the article they're
not using live query to run their graphs
on khedira and I think that's very very
telling because that's a very very
expensive feature if you just if you
need the data every 30 seconds like you
don't necessarily need to be consuming
the OP log to get that update mm-hmm I
like it yeah
yeah good stuff yeah I don't want to see
the conversation continued and I also
think you know he talks about what is
meteor and and he gets into you know the
fact that he thinks that you know meteor
should handle the transport between the
client and the server but it should not
be responsible for the data layer
necessarily well I think this is
something me the md do you might look at
uh yeah I do too based on every case but
I'm hearing whisperings of I think that
this is definitely something that
they're looking at and I you know I I
said write in the comments that I think
this is something that meteors talking
about and I'd love for this to not be
like a backroom thing I'd love for this
to be a discussion out in the open Allah
you know what they did with blaze and
what what uh air note is doing with flow
router likely yeah let's have this
discussion let's have a branch of code
and play around and I know they like to
you know sit down and their cubicles and
like shut the door whatever they do
there and like just write some code and
toss something really polished and
impressive out at the end of the day but
at the same time like I think that's
expensive and slow and you know we we
can't learn off of that until it's done
and you know I think there's some
learnings that can happen like certainly
two years after blaise came out we've
we've learned that it has its problems
and maybe it's best to start over I
don't know but we can't have those
learnings until it gets out the door
yeah yeah so guys over Christmas break
and girls learn grad q all learn what it
is start playing around with it I have a
feeling I have a feeling there's going
to be some stuff in 2016 they were gonna
be hearing from meteor I mean they are
looking to shed some weight become lean
mean fighting machine make the best
developer experience possible and they
need the best open source projects to do
that and I hear you have aaron owed a
super smart guy super uh like a leader
in his own right and everything
he does and he's advocating for graphic
you all right now and he's making a
really good point for it we want to have
more database support that's a huge
thing that we've been crying for mm-hmm
so it is yeah I have some feeling got
some tingles Josh tingles keep your
dingoes to yourself pal um oh you know I
think for me the biggest thing is like I
I like mdg they put out some really
smart stuff these guys they don't build
apps frankly they just don't they don't
build apps you know who built apps
facebook they built really big apps not
tiny apps so I feel like I know they're
doing some interesting stuff and I'm
pushing their look for it on on web
development i think meteor has as well
don't get me wrong i just think you know
at the end of the day some of the stuff
that's coming out of facebook is gonna
be more relevant or interesting in the
long run because um i don't know like
well on mdg has mad respect for for the
guys at facebook oh yeah absolutely i
mean you know you look at ben newman
came over from facebook and i don't know
what he was working on I think he's
doing he has six stuff there too but I
would remember one like react like first
came out we're talking about it and
graphic you Alan right hahaha and like
sashko was an advocate from day one he
was like this is really interesting
stuff yeah so yeah yeah and that's a
that just furthers why I think all right
I guess what I'm trying to say is I when
I when it comes to like trusting people
like I'm I'm starting to pay more
attention to facebook and what they're
doing and I'm also you know I just pay
attention to Aaron dota 2 because he's
out there and he's building stuff that's
bigger than what anything anyone elses
building right now yeah with meteor
react or any of that kind of stuff well
maybe not react but I mean obviously
have netflix and some other bigger
players but he's consuming a massive
amount of data rate is and he's hit
these walls long before us and so for
him to mention that this is a problem or
something we should think about a fix
like I pay attention mmhmm yeah good
stop did we wrap this up
is great on time for tea what are we 40
minutes no less I don't know what time
we got a little bit later Yeah right 30
minutes let's just say all right we'll
call it 30 that's awesome uh yes always
sponsors just one sponsor those guys the
hosting what are they Oh modulus that's
it I thought I oh they're awesome for
hosting your apps they do a good job I
wouldn't I wouldn't host my database
there I don't host my database there but
they do everything else great and I
think they know and they're trying to
improve their database stuff but they
definitely do a good job with the app
hosting if you want to get your app up
to date I don't know I mean I use a
modulus for money but I oh and we have
mass amount of marketing from market
data currently yes and we use their
database so you see that sweet yes I
responded to Eric tomorrow good good
yeah so money bought that I yo if you
heard us say that but you don't know
what it is and you want to know go there
