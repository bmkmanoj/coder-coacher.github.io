one of those days where you just don't
get a ton of time to do the things that
you expected you something to write a
few more emails for an email sequence
for a crater comp to get to that to get
some client stuff done so that that's
good but I was meeting a friend for
lunch today and wanted to have some time
for that so that's where I'm heading
right now
Oh
stuff is terrible his energy and
endurance gives you go-go juice this dog
doesn't wanna run but this one really
does so wasn't feeling it but here we
are Scott from level up tutorials Scotty
told me I should get out and run so
we're gonna do it hmm we got done pup
push me pretty hard if we got a mile 1
point 0 9 miles in 10 minutes so it's a
good pace she's pretty worn out too
I was watching WWDC sounds like
wrestling match announcement and was
super excited when Tim Cook got on there
I was talking about the Swift play huh
huh huh Tim Cook was he got on there at
the end I was talking about uh how
important it is for kids to learn to
code and how they believe that Swift is
the language that they should be
learning obviously he's a bit invested
in Swift but you know that the important
thing is they came out with this Swift
playground and you can now learn to code
on an iPad and it's going to be a free
app it actually looks really good it's
very much along the lines of something
I've been thinking about for quite a
while I have this idea that we can bend
the curve for generational poverty by
teaching all kids how to code how to
program how to write and build things
how to make things it's a big goal for
me it gets a big life goal for me to
pursue this idea and so I've been
working on it quietly trying to find
people and funding and put it all
together but now I guess I'm gonna put
it out there I think Apple like if you
haven't seen the video I'll see if I can
put a link into it but the videos just
spot-on for what I'm thinking like there
are people all around this world that
don't even have access to computers and
never even get a chance to learn to
program and they may be some of the
smartest programmers in the world and we
need to change that
someone from YouTube left a comment
asked if they could ask me questions on
the vlog absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
