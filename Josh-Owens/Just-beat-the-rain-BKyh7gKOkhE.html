morning actually looks like rain
you
but it's gonna be a hot day say I'm
ridin high and I wanted to get out and
run early so there's a trail right
behind the swimmingpool I'm gonna hit
that out see if I do like I did three
and a half last night maybe uh we'll see
where I get he's got an hour of swim
practice no targets just run got two
miles in in 21 minutes I'm gonna run
back and get penny regard to swim
practice and then get brayden and take
him home and then I'm gonna do an early
podcast with avi which should be
interesting because he's quite
frustrated with meteor as of late trying
to upgrade to 1.3 so I'm feeling that
will come up today
Oh
should we talk about them now yeah go
ahead seems like a good this is a PSA
guys as a PSA so as I predicted this
morning I did the podcast with AMI and
you know there was a lot of teeth
gnashing about meteor 13 and the amount
of work that it's causing him and it got
me thinking that software development
isn't like you know a finite thing I
read a great article about web
development versus native development
and I think that you know in it the the
guy was arguing that as a CEO it it
becomes it's more apparent what building
a native app will cost you and I'm not
sure that's necessarily true either like
having run teams that have built web
apps and mobile apps and worked with
both honestly like integrating an API
into a mobile app that also was being
used by any background application like
it all this stuff's hard all of it is
living breathing always changing like if
soft water is not being touched than it
is dying in my opinion and so like
that's something to consider whenever
you're going to build an application or
custom software like you should think
about the ongoing maintenance costs so
weekends in the Owens household are
always a little crazy or chaotic really
have no idea what's going on like maybe
tomorrow we'll go to church I have no
idea well we're definitely going to the
parking lot because we got to pick up
zoe but i just got a call from windy
let's go to dinner let can you pick up
dinner and bring me dinner and booze so
that's where I'm heading right now we'll
see what we get
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh glad I rent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
