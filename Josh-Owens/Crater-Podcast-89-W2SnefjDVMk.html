2016 or 2006 has been nice to call it
yes welcome frame and josh owens blowing
the co-hosts been Strahan hello
everybody welcome Ben welcome Josh
wonder 60 run wonderful to see you
brother ah been the the mdg inside man
oh man what a what a coincidence kind of
humbled with all that stuff it's fun
yeah it's awesome so if you don't know
guys then just put up a new show called
transmission and you guys hit the top
150 for a tech podcast on iTunes that
was pretty awesome yeah yeah after being
released only for three days yeah I got
a lot of press and all stuff and it's
cool yeah well yeah it's it it it's kind
of like it just confirms like it I don't
think it's anything special that i did
i'm just glad to be part of it it just
confirmed that everybody's hungry for
mdg in place exactly exactly this is
something that has been needed it's
almost like people are kind of starving
to hear it um and not that like mdg
doesn't put out or communicate with us
it's just like there's not there's a
lack of a human element I would have to
say like that's probably way to describe
it yeah um things felt a little too
corporate in every well I mean it's all
just online blog posts and so yeah I
think I mean you get the what was called
Deb shop the meteor night that kind of
stuff and that's okay but you know it's
not the same i said i don't are they
even taking Twitter questions anymore
that thing I didn't even watch the last
one ah you know what the last one they
didn't mention Twitter once so I don't
think so I was on the meteor for or the
YouTube chat during the last one and I
think they took one question from there
yeah so I mean it's yeah it's definitely
not as interactive so it's nice to like
have
guys highlighting for him stuff and
respond and I'm looking forward to
sashko having a better mic I was
relieved that that was the aunt that was
in number one comment yeah yeah yeah and
I was very amused by by that person that
you paid money to make that first
youtube comment I did not pay him no I
know you didn't but I read that coming
I'm like really come on guys like I
appreciate your fan of mine and Ben is
on the show and he does an awesome job
and I appreciate him being here but like
let's be supportive that comment was
unnecessary yeah there is a do that said
what would he say obviously josh owens
is a talent behind all the podcasts he
says that was directed at me hi he's
like the first exciting thing was like
the in 14 minutes a psycho guy walked by
like him I didn't make it that forward
night now I gotta watch out forward to
see the guy walked by 14 minutes so
behind the scenes what people don't know
is so that guy is is actually real real
creep real crazy so for the whole show
you couldn't see it but when I was
sitting there my angle I could see him
and there was a guy over there just like
looking at me like this the whole show
like big eyes and you like go like come
over the edge and just like eat go over
the edge finally at the 14-minute mark
ii like finally really walked out and
you only see him for a second in the
video but the whole time i was recording
i'm like whoa who is this guy staring at
me through the window I I don't know I I
may not get to see it on to fast-forward
to 14 minutes but I generally listen to
stuff when I run so like no long run I
got that cute off this weekend from I
was astonished to how many people
watched it on YouTube I think whatever
there's a thousand there they've got a
good subscription base on youtube so
yeah I think um dev shop has helped kind
of build that up a lot so yeah which I
mean if you guys also don't realize like
I've got a YouTube channel and I put
these podcasts up weekly so you can see
our smiling faces that's right
this is crazy haircut oh my gosh it's
just getting crazier dude I don't know
what to do as a host it's looking pretty
good now yeah nice just wait and then
take it off then I'll leave that looks
good all right let's get into it and
let's do this bro so we're going to talk
about testing with meteor 1.3 reactive
graph qo mm-hmm react primer for meteor
and optimizing your react performance
bah bah bah all right you have to
optimize react what guess so I don't
know you tell us so I know it's a great
article yeah like I I kind of looked
over it and read a little bit and liked
it so I I threw him greater but um yes
so a first implementation of meteor app
testing for 1.3 this was actually posted
in the meteor forums I popped it up on
critter as well because I wanted to get
a lot more eyeballs on it and you know I
think I was talking to someone about
this I think the the forms are good for
having some discussions but the problem
is like so much discussion happens in
there things easily get lost mm-hmm and
so I think crater is really good at like
highlighting and getting a lot of
eyeballs on something Dom so yeah I
posted it over there and basically tom
was talking about some of the work that
avital has been doing with a new command
and the tool called meteor test staff
and basically they built a mocha driver
using Ronan re offs I guess that's how
you say a package and it allows you to
easily integrate mocha tests into your
app so you can start to do integration
testing using mocha which I thought was
was really really interesting so I think
you know if you look at like testing and
the different modes you get you get like
unit testing and then you get
integration testing and then you have
Ende Ende testing you know integration
testing is kind of in there in the
middle unit testing
I think you know people have already
been talking about that and I think the
way the modules work it's going to be
pretty easy to get going and mm-hmm so
you don't have to worry about that too
much but the the integration testing is
the hard part and this is a part that
always kind of like velocity struggled
with as well like you have to load up
meteor and then you have to do something
to be able to run those tests against
like the full meteor stack to get that
integration or the pieces you are
curious about testing and so if you
think about it this is like where you
maybe do some pub/sub testing or that
kind of thing and then you've got the
full and then testing which is open up a
browser and click through essentially
like a user would do and make sure
things come out the way you want them to
be right mm-hmm no database speaking and
then um so yeah this is this is more
about the integration testing I'm happy
to see that they're working on it it
makes me maybe a little sad that you
know we we've ditched velocity and now
we're going to something that's also
been around for a while like clear they
didn't think about this ahead of time
like this this has been around almost as
long as velocity like Ronan was part of
the original velocity team so before I
probably could have done this awhile ago
without too much heartbreak um but I'm
glad to see ya happening now it's
happening yeah this is what we wanted I
mean you know I think you know Sam had
to make the tough call and he did and
that kind of like I don't know spurred
things on a little bit and now we're
here we got testing officially supported
it's awesome at the same time like Aaron
Oda came out with mantra and you could
see unit testing in his mantra examples
and so I think that's what you're easily
the looting to like with the new module
system unit tell ya so these Pete's got
a good article opponent to yes yeah and
we did report on that too yep remind me
yeah I'm stoked good stuff sashko said
um in our meeting in our talk that like
testing is is a cornerstone that he is
finally really happy
be to say is officially supported by
meteor and it's been apart that's been
missing for a long time so absolutely
absolutely well I mean like in a weird
state right like velocity decided the
velocity group decided to needed to be
done and so they tried and DJ stamp but
it has been a weird story it has been
but now things are finally yeah anywho
the past is the past I'm happy with what
I'm seeing uh how we got here let's not
talk about it yeah we're just going
let's go with it you can't just pretend
nothing happened but you're right i'm
glad that there's an easy way and i
think you know the hope is what we'll
see out of this is maybe a slightly more
extensible tool that we can tap into now
and you know this meteor test app maybe
we can find other ways to hook into it
so it's not just Ronan's implementation
but other people can build an
implementation that works and you know
you kind of get this really good tight
kind of integration with your app and
you're able to test it so you know i
think in the future uh like I said I'm
glad to see that they're working on it
they put a good guy on and I like a fat
also yeah yeah um you can see that they
have a guide article about it mmm yeah
i'll link to it and that was something
that sashko kind of touched on where
they want to do guide driven development
mm-hmm like go put a guide out there or
a blog post yeah what's oscoda with
reactive graph ql and that kind of like
puts their feet to the fire that also
like opens up and tells us what they're
working on absolutely yeah and so I like
that because now it now they have
expectations that they are literally
putting themselves under and a
community's job is to like keep him
responsible for that and I like that
yeah yeah I think documentation driven
development was coined by maybe tom
preston Werner and like I've always been
a fan of the idea especially for open
source you know or i think is it was
initially
like read me driven development like
right to read me say what you want the
thing to do and like even by expressing
some of that you're gonna have people
come along and they'll be like oh it
doesn't quite do that yet but I clearly
see your intentions here's a pull
request if that's maybe that's a little
magical but um I like the idea of it
myself so I'm glad they're doing it and
like you could definitely see like there
was a what day was it um it's like
tuesday or something when they talked
about reactive graph ql there was like
this orchestrated like here's all the
things we're working on that seemed to
all get posted all about the same time
and it was like yeah monday or tuesday
oh my gosh is it was nice right like I'm
glad to see like Evans talking about his
work Ben's talking about his work like
he's been to be open about it but you
know now we're seeing this testing stuff
posted like it's good it's good I'm
liking it yeah small team they all are
like kicking butt in different areas so
what what is this reactive graph Cuban
tell me yeah so so uh sashko kind of
throughout this blog post the day after
we released a podcast now it's like what
what what is this fun stuff but even
hear about it anywho so the inside scoop
he's like working with the graph ql team
over at Facebook mm-hmm and they are the
whole thing is that this this is
potentially massive mm-hmm your
developers like massive they are working
on reactive graph ql ah not only will it
work phenomenally well for me dear I
apps where it's going to have the same
arts can reuse to like building query
strings on on the client side and then
everything just works like that's what
he wants to accomplish but the big news
is here I can we can go through the list
one by one but the big news that caught
me and I'm curious what you're thinking
josh is they're going to make a server
layer for existing apps
and so then we can so we'll throw graph
ql meteor a layer in there so then
existing apps existing like rails python
and all those f can have a reactive
client mm-hmm and it's powered by
reactive graph ql which is i don't know
how much meteor is going to be in there
this is exciting this is exciting hello
the other side ending is multiple
databases but right well so the
interesting thing is by creating that
layer used or to decouple the fact that
it's a database behind there or rest
endpoint or anything else you know and
lo I mean that's the hardest thing right
like everyone's like oh we're sequel
support gonna come from where's it gonna
come from I wins it appear like actually
doing mini sequel or mini postgres
whatever you want to call it like that
actually turned out to be a terrible
idea and I blogged about this um that
you know the the postgres experiment
seemed to go nowhere and then sashko
talked about a little bit in the forums
like he didn't really view the
experiment as a failure because they
learned that there's a lot of changes
that have to happen in a great postgres
like mini postgres into some of the
stuff like if you look at user accounts
like that's just totally opinionated
towards Mongo and you'd really have to
rethink a lot of that and and kind of
separate it out and if you're gonna do
that like you'd have to do it for each
little implementation you're going to
write and instead what makes more sense
is if we just have if we're just
consuming graph ql and we're able to get
the data there like it doesn't matter
what the back end is written in it's
been disconnected now from the front end
but you still have a way to get that
data there and it looks the same to the
to the client and we've got this
graphing or we've got this query
language that's in the middle right yes
so I think to me that's super smart and
I I I love that they're ambitious in the
fact that they're directly working with
Facebook and that they want to be you
know a server layer that sits in front
of like any endpoint via database arrest
I think that's smart as well like if i
look at you know what do i do when i'm
building a nap i'm either writing
publications on the server or i'm
consuming some kind of rest data so
super stoked yeah this also opens up the
whole world of where you don't need to
use meteor for greenfield projects only
you know this is with with module
support coming in with NPM support
coming in and now with this news of
reactive graph ql like meteors going to
launch like we're gonna I I think we're
going to see our community like this
grow yeah you know my my biggest concern
here you know I'm excited about it but
at the same time with the ambition of
the goal is you know how are they going
to manage that project because you know
I think if you look at facebook or rails
like they do a good job of working with
the open source community and I think if
you have a goal of being able to sit in
between a lot of these different kinds
of frameworks and whatnot you know
you're gonna have a lot of people coming
in so mm-hmm my hope is they get a good
handle on like how they're going to
manage this open-source project because
I think that's going to be super
important well and this sounded like
that it's going to be a whole separate
team over at meteor write the data team
right so they do recognize exactly what
you're recognizing which is like we're
gonna if we go this route it's going to
be a significant it needs to have a
significant portion of our attention and
so they're building a whole team off for
that to be dedicated to it sasha was
going to be on it i'm pretty excited
seems like they saw what you just talked
about so yeah yeah i posted did we
talked about it last week like some of
the stats that i found oh I don't think
we did but they're super interesting
yeah yeah so um yeah I'm looking at the
stats now and I'd love for you guys to
talk about this actually I think we did
talk about it now that I'm recalling it
yeah we could mention it again commits
per contributor and then I I'm still not
quite sure what exactly the fort's two
stars
ratio shows us but meteor an odor at
like twelve percent Forks two stars
which is really really low where is like
angular's up 46 and rails up 41 so
thought that was really interesting
considering like you know nodes had a
split off and they've come back together
now and I was actually looking at their
newer repo not their auto repost they
have to regionals so I don't know if you
do a fork like I guess it tells us like
okay stars are people who are using it
well maybe they have Forks are people
who are who want to contribute yeah yeah
so if you get so that's what the ratio
will show you how much of your of your
user base is actually contributing to
the core right and well and I think the
other interesting thing is um I think to
me twelve percent indicates a number or
a problem right like that number
indicates a problem because obviously
like nodes splitting off and then coming
back together was a problem I think it
made the community better but I think it
indicates that something's fishy going
on there with meteor as well um I don't
know maybe it's maybe it's just they
just got that huge influx of stars
somewhere which I mean if you remember
they had that campaign for contributing
to code now they got a bar so maybe that
was it I don't know yeah yeah that was a
that always felt like they are kind of
like really pulling at people's heart
strings to get stars instead of like on
their own merits but whatever it worked
whatever and um now that I see
everything that's coming I'm not talking
for MTG because i have no idea really
but uh there's so much change going
right now and think mdg you want like I
could see where someone will want to
like be like oh we got to really like
stay under control on this we can't just
let our framework kind of like go we're
like maybe where the community wants see
it go because we don't we don't really
know we see all this change coming to
JavaScript now it seems like
the like the future is pretty clear on
where things are going and I we should
have a talk about this in like six
months and see if things have changed
see it's like to see if like the
communities more involved in the corner
because I feel like with less churn
that's going to be happening we know
where things are going I think I'm
hoping that they would open up more
that's what I'm saying mm-hmm I could
see why they didn't in the past yeah I
don't think it's so much like a node
thing like what happened with node all
those number number wise it looks
similar yeah yeah so anyway so um any
other big things that we should talk
about on this reactive graph ql I mean
it's not meteors blog yeah totally I I
think you should read it I think it's
interesting um I'm really really curious
to see this come out as well like what's
just going to look like performance wise
like it's gonna really completely tear
away the current pub/sub the
implementation and it's going to change
our notions of like how to scale and
stuff so mmhmm yeah they had it they had
a nod at relay and the article so you
can kind of like got the article just so
rich with like if you know possibilities
that come from this article you just
that's why it's so important to read
indeed all right okay so before we get
into the next one react primer for
meteor it's from Sasha I also wanted to
mention didn't really have enough space
in the number of articles we had but he
also posted a state of telescope and so
if you're interested or using telescope
and you're not already like helping out
I think it's important to step up and
help out I think it's been a lot of work
on Sasha and he's still going to
continue on with it but he's taking a
little bit of a step back to not be as
actively engaged on building new
versions right now and it's certainly I
think
some of it is the current state of flux
like it feels very confusing about blaze
and reacts still mm-hmm you know I spent
25 minutes talking with a client today
and you know they're they're still not
sure if they want to go with blazer or
react and you know I feel like we're
we're still like drinking our tea and
reading the leaves at the bottom to
figure out what's what's the best one to
go with but mmhmm yeah if you want to
help out I think Sasha's totally open to
taking some open source hope it's a
great project to work out on nah it yeah
I mean you're gonna get some exposure
your codes gonna matter it's like one of
the top five apps that are fired up on
Heroku yeah ranis you know I think it's
it's actually written pretty well from a
like structural standpoint mm-hmm you
know you can add packages and do all
kinds of interesting things yeah yeah so
it's like if you want to like dive in
and work on a production level meteor
app and see what it takes to like get it
out the door there you go and like
craters built on top of telescope and
like you get huge numbers so yeah yeah
guys contribute that's a really exciting
project to be a part of it has a really
cool slack room to section so you guys
should get on the telescope channel so
sorry thing that people sasha has done
is he's been kind of converting I think
he's been converting microscope to react
and he's got like nine or ten episodes
on youtube that are worth watching um
and he's been talking about it little by
little like what he's been doing in each
one uh but now he's put together like
all of his learnings into like one kind
of big post you know like it's worth
taking a look at um you know he's done a
lot of research and playing around and
trying to get everything working and
it's all been kind of distilled into
this document mm-hmm I would highly
recommend it
he even points out you know the
interesting thing to me is that mix-ins
are kind of going away and react meteor
data makes is it mix in and so like he
talks about how like it's probably going
to be going away but for now it works so
you know it's it's probably okay to use
and meteors probably going to come up
with something that shouldn't be too
hard migrate to if you're using the the
current vixen yeah so that's really
astute of him to have links to that hmm
I just did a quick breeze through the
whole thing and I am really impressed
with what he laid out here and how
simply he laid it out so he talks about
mix-ins that's really cool he also talks
about functional stateless components
which is also a really good thing to get
your mind around mm-hmm and then he goes
into a little bit of structuring your
component like component level
subscriptions yep it just it really is a
great write-up it isn't long to go
through and he also like kind of pegs
all the little future things that might
be happening soon yeah or the gotchas
like come on watch out for this that
kind of thing yeah integrating with one
of the big things that are difficult
people move into react are going to be
really surprised when they get this is
like working with other third-party
libraries or jQuery plugins like
sometimes you're going to be like
racking your brain on how you're going
to do that because reacts going to be
controlling the DOM and then do you
watch a query to control it well
sometimes you do so he even jumps into
that you know yeah yeah I've noticed
like I haven't really used a lot of
jquery stuff with react yet but a lot of
people say like you got to be careful
with what you do because react is
keeping like its own copy and okay yeah
it's something that's not modded in
their their copy so yep yeah exactly so
like you got a if you're gonna be
touching that Dom you have to do it
after
after its it's created but then if you
change it and react they hold Dom
elements destroyed you get a new Dom
element back so you got to re-implement
any of your jquery stuff like all that
state and everything or whatever Jim
Crow is doing is not there so there's
different ways on how to do that react
they actually built around that so they
have the methods needed it's almost like
do anything along with animations and
all that stuff so ah hello mr. train how
are you doing today oh man pedda I'm you
to myself for a second i had a sneeze
coming down my eyes are like watering
cuz it didn't come it's sad you hate you
get you guys all know the secret on how
not to sneeze right no well I want to
dislike you need to come out yeah well
if you don't want to sneeze instead you
want to give yourself a headache and
have your eyes almost popped out serious
keep your eyelids open you could even
hold them open the fact that your eyelid
can't close you won't it won't sneeze
it's so weird and it doesn't make sense
to me but I haven't found one person yet
what does Rebecca just needs with my
eyes open if you need to get this knees
out I've always found like looking at
the Sun house and maybe that's why
because like I close my eyes I don't
know where they were the experiment life
hack if you're on a podcast you can't
sneeze all the time right but they can't
see you so much so it's okay to look
like a fool yeah you look like does he
like no good see you though now everyone
has to watch you too cuz now we look
like it is yes look like a
three-year-old making a face oh my gosh
fun stuff so tell us how do we make our
react more performant okay so like this
is like like kind of fun this is a
another play on words but it's like
totally true but a lot of people come to
react because of performance you know I
remember back in the day when people
were all talking about famous and then
one of the things that still stands out
to me about famous is is they hit like a
famous day out there famous
for some small and the guys from
facebook over the react team came over
there and they're like hey look we just
made the most performant Dom thing ever
these animations with famous that is a
but it's being executed to react and so
then all of a sudden everyone start
diving in reacts they want to perform it
down and it makes a lot of sense and
that's what their whole argument is is
there saying hey like we make we make
the down fast by not messing with the
damn that much and we have a virtual dam
which is in javascript javascript is
fast the dom is slow and that's the main
thing so now this article comes out and
says you know optimizing react
performance and and it's totally true
like you kind of need this so now that
you have the virtual down there are some
tricks that you need to know in order to
increase performance and as a two-part
article is part 2 out I it was I'm
opening up right now yes it is out yeah
we're gonna report on number one cuz I
didn't read part two yet yeah it's but
it's at the top so if you click in the
show notes which we do have you can read
the article and there's a link right at
the top or two yeah totally so this is a
two-parter or there's two sections in
this first article one is showing you
how you can increase the performance of
the virtual Dom based off of providing
indexes or four elements or like keys
four elements and he runs through and
I'm really glad like this is a really
in-depth article just on on this part
itself he goes through three different
ways on how you can achieve assigning a
key to an element and how it's going to
help the iteration a lot faster random
key index key ID key he covers it all
and I love it you know what I really
will really stood out to me going
through it like we all we would we would
just do an ID key as always because
that's just what we do right now mm-hmm
but really still
to me was the performance tools that are
built in to react mm-hmm you know isn't
that cool yeah and what was printing out
on the council like I was unaware of
that stuff so I'm gonna be starting to
use that in my code yeah like the print
inclusive print exclusive print wasted
print Dom yeah yeah and the print wasted
was really interested interesting so
this is the set this gets into the
second part of the article which is you
have a method on your component that
says I should the component update and
if you utilize that then you could cut
down a lot of reacts waste of time on
them computing if it should be updated
or not or if it just does it anyway so
that is where a huge amount of time
savings can come in he goes through that
pretty good in here you got to remember
when you have a virtual Dom and then you
have a real damn the virtual Dom is
going to be created and then it's going
to destroy I actual that part of the
actual down the nodes in the actual time
yeah the changes that come over from the
virtual Dom will destroy what's in the
actual Dom and and that's like a big
issue like what we talked about with
jquery an old stuff but you guys think
about it like if you're able to fine
tune that that's where you're going to
begin a lot of performance as well right
and that's I mean that's different right
because if you look at blaze a meteor
like they don't they don't keep track of
the virtual Dom it all they just kind of
like go in and figure out where
something is and then make a change
right in the Dom yeah and that's where
you start to run into performance
problems hmm yeah so I mean this is like
I don't know i love react but it's kind
of like it's kind of like the German
sports car right when you first get in
it it has all these buttons and you're
like I don't know what to do and
someone's like ah just use the pedals
that you're used to but then add you
start driving it some more than all
these extra buttons and performance
buttons and all stuff makes sense and
then before you know it like you're
driving better than you've ever driven
before so if you want the German sports
car or view layers
get in to react it's good stuff so yeah
I really like part 1 i'll to read part
two now oh wow this is older i think
this is some medium no I mean it just
looks like medium yeah clever circles
actually order it came out in August
really yeah yeah that's about it Wow
well you know us man we just love not
being relevant just like no this is very
relevant very relevant yeah definitely
this has changed with what does a wit
that I say he's given in the pot in that
article so yeah right on I really like
this new for topic yeah uh strategy that
we got going on here yeah I think it
works out well yeah let's go a little
bit deeper like we were going deeper
anyway but it keeps the timeline you
know closer to the 30 minute mark
because okay we're windbags and we like
to be s sometimes about stuff so yeah
like salami just like dry news like WBBM
this is the news for today report like I
now man serious what do you expect for
me anyhoo today and Donald Trump Lynn
just kidding um I can't stand out
trouble i'm so scared if he becomes
president oh my gosh my my 11 year old
like she's she like dislikes him with
such passion it's quite funny to watch
she's like I want to leave this country
if he gets elected it's like okay well
clearly you guys have been talking about
this at school how old your daughter
again 11 yeah she's gonna be a little
activist she's ready to escape to Canada
if he gets elected all right actually
you know I made a joke to to the okay
growers about day like I I'm gonna join
you in Canada if Trump gets elected yes
yeah give me citizenship guys step but
Canada's not doing too good either
and so I think we should just like you
know go escape to like a warmer climate
there's a governments are just kind of
like you know go at it why not what have
you worked on anything interesting this
week been big props to the people who
maintain the the fast lane repo project
basically what it is is it's a scripted
way on how to do all the crap that you
need to do to submit an app to the app
store nice are you using that for that
project you have mm-hmm yep yep so I got
I got like what my Twitter didn't it no
but the core maintain errs are or like
the core maintainer got hired by Twitter
and Twitter's like hey work on fast lane
all right so that's cool but it's used
by everyone much like all the huge
companies that they post some of their
example uh s files online like Wikipedia
and stuff like that so you can see how
they're implementing it so it's like a
CI build tool for your app yeah yeah
it's like it's it's built in Ruby but
it's like it's like it's like a you know
Ruby I don't care I just beast API I
just need to get done yeah uh it
does it man I'm just stoked I'm stoked
like okay so it would take if you're
really fast dealing with provisioning
profiles hacking Xcode working out
problems you like you can submit an app
in like three hours right using pests
later by handle just buy it by yourself
right if you're lucky yea though I mean
this is after you know a little bit it's
not the fastest dude thank you I feel
like I knew a lot and like we had our
cert expire like our developer cert and
like that took me it felt like two days
to get strong my gosh cuz like it's such
a long feedback loop to figure out what
you did and then even even when it's
hard to figure out what is wrong yeah
yeah cuz heirs aren't intuitive and
stack overflows like well no maybe it's
one of these ten
sorry yeah yeah yeah so fast lane kind
of just like it just makes it simple
it's like it's like it has its own
issues you know it's an abstraction of
they actually scrape the UI and stuff
too so it's I mean it's not like perfect
not a magic bullet but I have like over
300 apps to submit the app store and I'm
like kicking them out in 10 minutes nice
and and do an Android as well and you
know we got our own bash script as well
that does like a free like a pre set up
with meteor not stuff but I'm stoked I
am so stoked so much easy that's the
throw off sorry man mmm a little bit
more too much time but they really
deserve props man fast yeah no that's
good yeah I watch you manage what are
you working on what's interesting I have
actually been working to revamp my
master a meteor course hmm meteor 13
react modules like all that jazz so I'm
excited that sounds exciting yeah and
then the other big thing is just like
renaming all the meteor club stuff is
going to be switching to space dojo and
so trying to think there's a lot of
little mentions of media club that needs
shifted and change so I'm trying to get
all that but kind of excited I'm really
excited yeah 1.3 is really a shift in
meteor I believe you're going to have
testing better Cordova integration you
can have modules is there a professional
level teaching or class on that
including react and how all that will
integrate no nope so I'm stoked man
there will be oh yeah well you got like
it can I put your feet to the fire you
got an ETA for this uh well the the live
class is februari 22nd 23rd and right
now people can get that for 299 with the
early bird code exit deal yeah I dropped
a price it used to be 499 I dropped it
to 3 99 and then early bird for the
looks like half a week you can get 100
bucks off that so 299 are you capping
the limit of people that are going to be
in and on yeah yeah I think I'm going to
cap it at 16 just so it like we don't
get overwhelmed with questions and stuff
I still want to be able to get through
all the material but I want to have time
if people do have questions they can ask
them but I think going up to like 24
people might just be a little too much
they still might where do people go to
sign up for this like this is it's
killer ah yeah okay sorry man it'll be
the link will be at space dojo calm but
I've got a blog post up to on thoughts
space dojo calm the latest posts about
