crater remote cough mobile edition this
talk focuses on building mobile apps
using javascript you can find out more
information about upcoming critter
remote coughs at conf crater IO enjoy
the talk welcome to day two of crater
cough mobile edition I am josh owens and
i just wanted to say a quick thank you
to our sponsors all i had that ready oh
we had two sponsors the first is
progress and their team there they're
telerik team has recently put out
something called native script and so if
you're looking for something to build
native apps with using typescript in
angular 2 you can do that with native
scripts so give that a check out and
what we're actually going to here to
talk about that later too kind of
excited if angular is your thing and the
other one is ray gun so you know if
you're deploying to production getting
the code there is really only half the
battle the other half is making sure
that it's stable and usable for your
clients are your customers and ray gun
has a suite of tools for air monitoring
and performance monitoring that you can
check out there they're pretty awesome
so I'm excited for this next talk we
have John Pinkerton with us from new
spring and he's going to talk about how
they've automated their deploy process
from start to finish and it gets the you
know their application that they're
building all the way to like app store
submission so welcome John and I'll let
you take over from here hey guys all
right let me share my screen
you guys see that alright so today I
want to talk to you about continuous
meteor app deploys so specifically what
I'm talking about is using meteor
Cordova and the meteor build tool to
automate the process of building an iOS
app building an Android app to link to
galaxy so getting your server on big
galaxy deploying to hockey which if
you're not familiar with hockey hockey
is a a way of distributing alpha and
beta versions of your app they support
iOS Android and a bunch of other things
actually too so and then as well as
deploying to test flight and iTunes
Store and deploying to the google play
store so the goal of all of this is to
automate it so that you can kind of set
it and forget it and then you know you
really only have to set up this process
one time so why why would you want to do
this maybe you only do a deploy to test
flight or to iTunes you know every once
in a while what we didn't want to do
that so we have a sane at NewSpring we
didn't invent it I googled it and a
bunch of people have said this like
pretty much everybody said this but we
try to automate what's important and the
reason why we do that is because we
support a lot of different sites and
services we're a relative compared to
the amount of sites and services we
support we you know a relatively small
team I would say we have a very large
user base so we want a predictable and
automated build and deploy process for
all of our sites and services that way
we can spend time actually adding value
to art abusers so building features you
know and supporting the different sites
and services that we have so how did we
get here
let's see we were tasked at towards the
end of last year with building a new
native app for for new spring and we the
the the church currently has a kind of
third-party app so it's like a nap as a
service which has served us really well
because we experienced a large amount of
growth and we didn't have the resources
at the time to kind of do it right so we
used an app as a service and got you
know kind of a lot of things out of the
box and that's worked well for us for a
while but we were really in a good place
now so we wanted to go back and rebuild
this app and and you know add all the
features that we want that will really
add a lot more value so another thing
that we realized when we you know kind
of started down this path was that we
have a lot of stakeholders there are a
lot of people above me in the
organization that you are going to have
an opinion and are going to have a say
in you know the app and how it gets
built and how it looks so we decided
that we want it to be as transparent
with them as possible rather than just
you know hey we're building an app would
come back in six months and you know
we'll show you what we've done so we set
a goal of shipping one alpha build a
week to all of our stakeholders so that
they could see you know the progress and
how long it takes them you know when we
run into issues you know why and all of
that so that was our goal was to ship
one alpha build a week we chose meteor
22 built to build these apps be the
Cordova process and the meteor build
tool allowing us to target both iOS and
Android from the same code base was
really attractive to us because you know
like i said mentioned we you know we
kind of have a lot on our plates and so
this is this is a really great process
for us so after doing some research into
all of this here's what we discovered
this is this is what it looks like to
there
this is what it looks like for us to do
a deploy of an alpha app so we you know
you got to do the meteor build we've got
to upload our tarball to s3 we've gotta
you know update ecs so we're using the
amazon container service to deploy the
server so that's that's what steps two
and three are there and then obviously a
lot of these involve waiting so then you
know in order to deploy the iOS app you
have to open Xcode you have to do a
bunch of things in there then to deploy
the Android app you have to open the
Android app and or sorry you have to
sign and align the Android app so
there's just a lot of steps involved and
they're very repetitive steps so after
we kind of did this for a while here's
what we found out it takes us about 30
minutes to to do all of those steps so
doing that one week which was our goal
is not really that bad sacrificing 30
minutes you know here there's not really
that big of a deal but one thing we did
learn was it requires the whole team to
understand the process of doing this
because one of our goals is for
everybody on the team everybody working
on the app to be able to actually ship a
build and so in order for that to happen
they would have to understand how to do
all of this they um they would have to
have all of the necessary credentials
and they'd have to have their machine
setup so have the Android SDK installed
and all of that so that's that's kind of
a bummer and this process is pretty
tedious so if you're doing it more than
once a week you know it gets old really
fast trying to you know remember all of
these things so so as we go All Things
Considered that things are going to go
wrong and actually I just lied to you
and 30 minutes is very generous I was
only able to do it in about 30 minutes
after I practiced and like really
memorized you know
the whole process so things are going to
go wrong and you guys may have run into
some of these before there's you know
certificate signing issues that happen
there's user error like I mentioned just
memorizing that whole process you kind
of have to do it in a specific order you
know you lose passwords you you forget
how to Xcode and so what one of the one
of the biggest one of the things that
attracted me the most to automating
process was I don't want to open Xcode
and I don't have to now and I'll show
you that but and then another thing that
happens is you know forget to update
some external dependency that your app
with little eyes on for us it's our
graph ql server so if i'm working on you
know updating our drill endpoint and i
forget to do that i forget to you know
push it into production then you know
lots of things go wrong so I'm here to
tell you today that there's a better way
and that is lunch so we have developed
internally a an app that we're calling
launched its just a command line node
application to automate this process for
us and so we've got a bunch of different
launch actions that you can use and that
so we have lots build so this builds
your app for iOS and Android and it
actually builds the server as well but
and then we have launched galaxy so this
autumn eights the process of deploying
your app to gala T then we have launched
hockey which will distribute the iOS and
Android versions of the app through paki
so it goes through the process of
uploading it and you know making sure
all of your certs are right and all of
that it just it just does it and so this
this works for both iOS and Android and
it depends on what platforms you have
added to your meteor project so if you
just have iOS then it'll just try to do
iOS we have launched test flight
so this will upload the app to the it
builds the iOS app for production
distribution and then uploads it test
flight so that you can distribute it
through test flight and then actually
promote a build to the app store if you
want to and then we have launched Play
Store which takes the Android build and
uploads it to the google play store so
what I'd like to do now is show you
let's see I can jump back out of here
see you got a straighter different
screen or is it here it is alright so
what I'm going to show you now is this
whole process working using a a2 dues
example so this is the meteor to do is
example so i took that project and added
in all of the launch tools so you can
see here this is the launch to do this
example running our sorry uploaded to
hockey so you can see there's a bunch of
different versions of the app that have
been uploaded these have all been
uploaded using the launch tool and it's
all automated and so here's in the same
project the iOS build on hockey and so
here you can see the same thing bunch of
versions all automated then here we have
this is the google play store and this
is our launch to do is example and down
here you'll see they're a bunch of apks
that have been uploaded again all
automated and then here's iTunes Connect
and this is the test flight builds that
we've been sitting out for the launch
the news project and as you can see here
again lots of lots of different builds
these were all automated so what I was
planning on doing was showing you I
actually built another example and this
is just the that this is just the
boilerplate you get when you do like a
meteor create so that's the launch basic
example and what I set up that project
to do was to build an Android app and
then deploy the server galaxy and then
upload the Android app to paki so that
you can download it and there's a public
download link to download it however
Travis which is what we've been using to
to automate this process that's our CI
or CD it's been a little slow to respond
today so I'm not going to show you that
live but I am going to show you an
actual build that was
on a couple days are actually earlier
today and a little bit so here is the
launch basic example running on meteor
so this is like I said just the meteor
boilerplate so let me jump back alright
so good question is why would you want
to use launch there are automation tools
for iOS and Android that exists already
however we when we went about the
process of trying to automate this we
found that there there are some very
specific use cases that need to be
handled because of the meteor build
process so we get a new Xcode project
each build every time you do a meteor
build you get a new Xcode project so
there's the that creates a couple
problems with the schemes that Xcode
generates and it a lot of the other
tools require that either require
storing stuff in the index code
environment or project or directory or
having yeah having things that just
exist in that directory and so that's
that's a hurdle to jump over and then we
found that using some of these others
tools that it wasn't extremely easy to
target both iOS and Android from the
same code base which is what meteor you
know obviously that's why we chose
meteor was so that we could target both
of those os's and again most don't play
well with the new Xcode project if
you've never opened that code project
before when you open it it actually
generates some schemes and does some
other things behind the scenes so that
was an issue so we built launched to
target meteor specifically and it's
really easy to use we went with just
including a launch JSON file in your
project and in that file you're able to
set up all the different environment
variables like
api tokens and directories to android
sdk is and stuff like that you can on
you can manage it all just from this one
file so this is an example of how you
would get started using launch obviously
it's available on NPM so you would just
you would do npm install dash G meteor
launch so that it's available globally
and then you can open your launch file
and start filling out all of the
different variables that you need for
your specific project so I'm not going
to go through and explain all of these
right now but as you can see we have
recovering a bunch of different
scenarios alerts and slack here's the
Android and stuff here's things related
to uploading to hockey and then Google
Play and galaxy so there's that so say
you wanted to like I was mentioning in
the launch basic example you wanted to
build an app building it sorry build an
Android app and then you wanted to
deploy the server to galaxy and then
upload the Android build to hockey so
that you can distribute it to testers or
to your team or whoever this is this is
the process you would build about to to
add that to your project first thing
that we would need to do is generate a
couple of keys so this generates a this
command will generate a key for signing
your Android app and then so you can
just run that command and then the
second thing we'll need to do is
generate the galaxy authorization file
so that you can talk to the galaxy
servers without having to log in every
time so if you are doing this on a CI
you would want this type of file and
we're actually we're thinking about add
some different actions to launch so that
we could even automate this process for
you but in our documentation all of the
different variables that I showed you
earlier there's specific documentation
on how you would get each one of those
variables so it just kind of
we're not automating this part of the
process yet but it does there is a clear
path to getting each one of these things
so the next thing you would need to do
is go into your launch JSON file and
fill out all of these variables so the
name of the key that we just generated
would be your android key and then your
android store pass would be the password
for the key that you just generated then
path to some android sdk stuff fill out
your hobby token and ID and then place
in start so this is epoxy deploy
hostname all that is is the region of
galaxies that you want to deploy tzu and
then you just include the path to your
galaxy session file that we generated on
the previous screen and now you're ready
to to just to deploy all these things so
and doing that is simple all you have to
do is run launched galaxy and then the
name of your domain name and then launch
build which will actually build the
android app that you're wanting to
deploy and then launch hockey and this
will upload it to hockey to the project
you specified in the lunch jason and
then it'll be available for whoever is
on that project to download so what else
we as i mentioned before we have actions
for build and galaxy and hockey but we
also have an action for test flight so
it will you know to upload something to
test flight and then an action for play
store so that you can upload to the
google play store so we're trying to run
the gamut of all the types of places you
might want to send your ear cordova app
and we have a lot of ideas about more
actions that we can add more parts of
this process that we can automate so
continuous delivery this is why we
really built this right now with that
with the Android example I just showed
you you could if you set that up you
run that locally on your machine and
that's great I do that from time to time
but we really wanted to throw all of
this on Travis or circle CI or whatever
and you know a bit be able to deploy
just by either merging a pull request or
doing a github release so we adding this
to a continuous integration environment
is really easy launch will run on both
linux and OSX environments but you
actually you will need an OSX
environment to build iOS I don't see
this changing anytime soon it's
unfortunate but Apple does require an
OSX environment so i've been using
travis a good bit and for for making
this work on Travis that Travis's
command-line tool has a really great way
excuse me of encrypting files so you can
just run the Travis encrypt command for
your launch JSON file and it will
actually encrypt it and then add
environment variables to your Travis
project that will be used inside the
Travis build to decrypt the file so now
that you have the encrypted file you can
actually commit that encrypted file to
your github repository and then
obviously making sure that you ignore
the unencrypted file but then went on
your Travis build it will decrypt it and
then your launched a json with all of
your credentials will be available for
deploying to hockey or to test flight or
wherever in other other CIS you can
actually just place the contents of the
launch that JSON file in an environment
variable and then you could just echo it
out to the file it's it's not that hard
to do another thing to note is all of
our launch variables are can easily be
overridden by environment variables so
this is important especially with
Android the Android SDK because on your
system it's it may be in a different
place than on the CI or it might be a
Linux environment
on the CI and so that it gets installed
in a different place so that's that's
pretty easy to do either by using the
the Travis environment variables or by
just exporting it in your Travis IMO
file so here's the config that we would
use if we for Travis if you wanted to do
this Android to galaxy excuse me build
an Android file to pull it together and
it uploaded to hockey so it's very easy
this is just some caching stuff that
makes running to build go a little bit
faster after it's been cached this is
where the the launch that JSON file
actually gets decrypted in this specific
case I've actually created a tarball
locally that has the launch that JSON
file in it as well as some other files
that we might need on the CI so I do a
create that tar ball and then encrypt
the tarball and commit that to the
repository so this openssl file is using
the environment variables that Travis
created for me to decrypt that tar ball
and then below on line 13 you see it on
tars the file and then we copy the
keystore the key store is the is where
Android stores the key that signs your
app and so we just copy that over to the
home directory so that the when you go
sign the app on the on Travis it'll know
where that stuff is so then obviously we
just do the npm install meteor lunch and
it's pretty lightweight so it doesn't
take that long to do and then we run our
three commands launched galaxy launched
basic example that meteor app com so
that will deploy our app and then we do
a launch build which is going to
actually build the Android app and then
launch hockey which is going to take the
Android app sign it and align it which
just does some
formats compression and stuff like that
and then upload it to hockey so that
then you can download it and distribute
it however you see fit so the
documentation each each one of these
actions that I've told you about and I
mentioned before we have documentation
on each one of those actions and how to
get each one of those environment
variables that's available for you and
then as I mentioned includes details
about how to get all the variables so
you only have to do this stuff one time
and then rely on launch to handle it for
you in the future and we have examples I
mentioned both the launch to do this
example and the launch basic example
those are both up on github with with
Travis files so you can just go and copy
how I did it the the launch to do's
example actually will build the app
deploy it to galaxy upload both iOS and
Android versions to hockey and then
upload the iOS version to test flight
and then upload the Android version to
the Google Play Store and does this
using a Travis build metric oops Travis
build matrix so there's four different
jobs they give run in the build that
show you how to deploy so each one of
those different places includes Travis
builds and the source code we've open
sourced this and that's available and
I'll pull requests are welcome we'd love
if you guys have any feedback or things
you might want to add or bug fixes
obviously all of that is is welcome so
then to show you kind of how this has
helped us because all this is great but
you know what what is what are the
results here our original goal was to
ship one alpha build a week and
we've actually using launch we've been
shipping multiple builds a day because
we are just using a github tag system so
that when when we do a specific tag then
it alerts obviously travis is alerted
and it will just start building and
deploying our apt to based on the tag
name so I don't spend any time deploying
this stuff anymore and now we've also
accomplished our goal where anyone on
our team can ship a build to alpha and
beta environments through pull requests
or excuse me we actually use the github
releases get a tax system but you could
easily do this using pull requests as
well we did that for a while where you'd
have like an alpha branch and a beta
branch and a production branch and you
just merge you know into that branch to
deploy and that's that's easy to do we
did we decided to go with the github
releases we find that a little bit
easier to manage but another thing
that's happened is our stakeholders are
super happy they get new features
multiple times a day and that's created
a lot of trust with the people in our
organization so when we when we have
issues that come up and you know issues
always come up in software because who
can estimate anything but we when those
issues come up they they've seen our
progress and they understand okay we
understand why you're running to this
issue and you know take the time that
you need so that's been extremely
helpful because we've run into some
issues and I'm super happy because going
through that deploy process is awful I
hate doing it and if I had to do it you
know the three four five times a day I
do insane and it would take up my whole
day so that's not good and okay and if
we ship to build a day we are saving
over five hours a week if that's based
on the 30-minute build time and I say
over five hours because as I mentioned
before things always go wrong when
you're in that process
like forgetting how to do it and so
we're probably saving a good bit more
than that especially since anyone our
team can do it and not everybody has to
be educated about how to do it so that's
awesome and it takes just a fraction of
time to set a fraction of the of the
excuse me it takes just a fraction of
the time to set up lunch so you'd be
saving five hours a week if you're
shipping multiple builds a day it took
me about an hour to set up the launch
basic project which just to remind you
will deploy the galaxy and to hockey so
it just took me like an hour to do that
and then now it just happens
automatically so we've we've been really
stoked on that so this was where i was
going to actually go back and show you
the the build that i was going to
attempt to run but since i didn't
attempt to run it because that would be
risky given Travis's issues i'm going to
show you just a if i can find it see
there we go i'm going to show you a
build that ran previously so this was
earlier today about four hours ago only
takes but you know between seven and
nine minutes to run and this is using
the travis config that I walked you
through earlier as well so you can see
it goes through and does all of those
actions where's let's see if I can make
this text a little bit bigger eclipse
the information for you dig the launched
a JSON file here it is installing me to
your launch so I'll just break that open
for you and then it does installs the
Android SDK and then exports that so
it's available and let's see what else
and then here it is deploying to galaxy
so it just does launch galaxy and then
deploying the galaxy talking to the
servers blah blah blah and then now
version 10 is available in the u.s. East
and you can just open that and see your
app and then here it is doing the launch
build which is actually building the
android app so this is using meteor
build behind-the-scenes obviously and
then doing a couple other things to kind
of prepare the android app to be
uploaded so here's all the android logs
and then get down here and build was
successful and then here it is doing the
launch to hockey so uploading the
android app to hockey so it signs the
android APK using the key that we
generated and then it does the alignment
as well and that's here and then it's
uploading to hockey and then right here
this is the response you get back from
hockey when it's successful so that was
successful and let's see and was this
earlier today and here is from earlier
today a build that was uploaded and you
could actually go to this public page
here and download it and today is the
14th right yeah okay good I was in line
so there it was uploaded this morning
and let's see
jump back into the presentation here
and that's it so I what I showed you was
how to deploy to build and deploy a
meteor Cordova app using our launch tool
so that you can automate it and not
think about it anymore and I hope you do
all this stuff is available I'm on
github as John the pink and basically
everything else to Twitter JAMA pink so
if you have questions or need help I'd
love to help you do this and also if you
want to check back in with this
presentation it's hosted on search so
you could open it up and look over again
if you need to so thank you
you
awesome and now brief word from our
sponsors before you see the rest of the
talk Raygun spend more time building
great software and less time fighting it
Raygun helps keep a watchful eye on your
web and mobile applications and tells
you when problems arise you can learn
more at Reagan com native script back by
telerik by progress is an open source
framework for building truly native
mobile apps with typescript and angular
to use your web skills to get native UI
and performance on iOS and Android enjoy
the rest of the time we appreciate that
talk no problem right ah so I I actually
had some questions i cued up a bunch
okay I'm curious like uh you know I I
don't know if you've ever heard the
story but like github has as part of
their automation whenever they do a
deploy they track like the air raid
after deploy are you guys doing anything
like that like day if that everybody
goes to high though like roll back the
deploy and like notify the employer that
they broke the going to fill it somehow
right we don't we don't have any of that
automated yet we are using century which
is a great service for tracking error
rates on the on the content we also have
hockey has a well I don't think we will
use this in production but hockey has a
crash detection so any time that our our
builds are crashing on Android or iOS
we're getting alerts about that so we'll
figure out something different when we
actually move into production but um yep
awesome yeah yeah I know there's a lot
of options out there and I saw that is
it's just hockey hockey app.net is that
the site I believe so yes it is so
that's they've been great for deploying
our alpha releases its it works a lot
faster than test flight if you've ever
uploaded
something to test flight it takes a long
it takes longer to upload and it also it
has to process the build and then if
you're wanting to which can take I've
seen it up to 45 minutes which is just
not acceptable if we're trying to move
fast and then I was going to mention one
other thing oh and then if you're trying
to do external testing with test flight
and you if you have to actually get it
reviewed it they do the like beta app
store review so after you do that once
then the the process is a little bit
faster but in practice when we've sent
stuff out through test flight it takes
you know like 12 hours to for them to
approve it so that when can do external
testing so alphas we generally
distribute internally so using hockey's
been really great for that it's so fast
nice um and I think some of us were just
wondering where to find launch which you
did mention in your presentation but if
people are doing a search for it it's
just meteor dash launch yes it is meter
dash lunch I can paste that into the
chat room yeah I already busy oh you did
okay so I wasn't looking yeah it's
meteor dash lunch on github and then
it's meteor dash launch on NPM as well
awesome and you know I'm kind of curious
to lake it's meteor specific but people
could probably fork it and change it up
for react native or whatever they need
it would you think yeah you could if you
were if you were doing straight react
native then I would suggest probably
using fast lane which which is a tool
that we're using behind the scenes to do
the iOS related actions flash line is a
great project so if you are using react
native i would highly suggest that what
launch does is it when it's using fast
lane it's setting a bunch of different
options that you would it kind of has
defaults out of the box
work great for media projects ok cool ah
and that that maybe leads into the next
question which is like are you guys just
using this for alpha and beta build
releases or you are are you actually
like deploying the whole app start to
finish production level like deployments
as well as using this process well our
app isn't in production yet but we will
use it yes and so on Google Play you can
actually deploy straight to production
if you wanted to and that's something
that we're thinking about doing on the
kind of itunes side when you're using
test flight it's actually if you have a
build uploaded to test flight and you're
testing it externally you can promote
that build and there's probably
something similar in the in the google
play store as well i haven't messed
around with it as much but will probably
go that route instead on the on the iOS
side is just promoting the build we
already been testing yeah interesting
and when you just use you mention like
tagging releases will you just like keep
master like deployable like that version
is always deployable then I do your work
in branches or something like that is
that what you're envisioning once you
get yeah we are doing that and then the
way that we're doing releases right now
as we have a naming convention that we
that we've kind of set up in our read
meets for deploying so when we have a
version that we want to like send it
into our alkyl environment all you have
to do is name it you know app / alpha /
and then the build number or version um
and that's what Travis is using to know
where to deploy so if it's if it finds
alpha then it's going to deploy to our
hockey setup and if it finds beta then
it's going to deploy the test flight and
to the Google Play Store to use their
beta setup I see
alright we found that that's cleaner
than trying to maintain different
branches that deploy to different places
but that works as well too yeah so Steve
had a question there are two iOS app
settings for export compliance that need
to be set and info top healers file and
submitting the app store which I've not
figured out how to do using mobile pig
or config die XML can launch automate
setting these or is there another way to
automate setting these and he actually
mentions two settings hmm I I haven't
run into the specific issue the the way
that we're doing the build and maybe
this I did run into some issues using
beta versions of meteor where it wasn't
setting the right it wasn't generating
the plist correctly and so you'd have to
go into Xcode and set them in newly but
with the latest version of meteor I've
we're not having to change anything in
the configs we're just having to
download the either the ad hoc /
tificate or the distribution certificate
and then apply it using the provisioning
profiles and then upload it and you know
there's no plist or config that you have
to change so if if that's an issue for
you maybe you know i'm not sure i could
look into it yeah i would say like it
probably helpful Steve to know like what
version of meteor on I know with 13 they
just updated the entire Cordova build
process so perhaps that would fix from I
don't know yeah I haven't run into
issues in a while with having to
manually set the Xcode project said
anything in the Xcode project yeah yeah
which I mean he's right like once you
have to do that that it's kind of a pain
because everything to fix a little
purpose yeah yeah I guess you could like
automated inserting those settings into
the plist file but it is possible
and when we first were building this out
I was actually accounting for a specific
attribute needed to be set and that's
easy to do using there's a like an Xcode
NPM package that will go into your
cordova build and set whatever you want
so maybe that's something we could add
in the future is defining specific
variables that you need to have set all
right ah so I had another question like
we've been talking about continuous
deployment I'm kind of wondering like
are you guys doing any kind of testing
like integration testing and building
that into your Travis process at all and
even if it's not something you do now is
it something on your horizon the answer
to that is yes and no we're asking
certain parts of our project we have a
like shared code library that is all
written in typescript and tested a lot
of it steps that is not fully tested so
we are running those tests we the some
of the other parts of the app are
untested and we don't like that but
we'll hopefully fix that soon yeah
awesome and then you also mention that
you guys are using graph ql yes curious
can you talk a little bit more about
that like how you're utilizing that
absolutely so at NewSpring we have a
bunch of legacy systems or legs legacy
is kind of a demeaning term we have a
bunch of systems that were in place
prior to building this app so one of
them is a a has all of our people data
and it's a dotnet stack so it has
everything that we know about our users
in it then we have an expression engine
site which powers are actual the main
site and it has all of our content in it
like articles stories videos so that's
another part of it
then we have Mongo which is where we're
doing you know me to your specific stuff
and stuff that only needs to be tracked
in the app and then we have some
external services like Google search and
other external API so in order to build
this app we needed to be able to access
all of that data and graph ql was a
really great way to do that and so if
you're not familiar with graph ql graph
G L is the server thats its kind of in
between all of your data stores and the
thing that needs to access those data
stores and provides a uniform way for
accessing that data so as an app
developer I don't have to know how to
access the dotnet or the sequel server
database or how any of that stuff is
mapped I just have to call the specific
graph ql query that we've set up so if
you have a kind of a similar situation
like that where you you want to build
kind of a newer app and you need to be
able to access some data that is not
easily accessible then check out graph
ql it's been really great for us yeah i
would imagine like having i wanted Go
Daddy for a little while on a project
called out right and like they had
nobody's in backbone and they were using
titanium the time but we were working to
switch to native iOS and like I was
heading up the project to clean up the
API because the backbone team had just
kind of like parked little API geez town
calls like whatever they needed them
they would just kind of like make one
and make it work and there was no like
documentation or consistency and then as
we started do the iOS app like that that
became a problem because like we may be
needed something slightly different for
iOS than what the backbone team needed
and so like we always had to like have
meetings and give both teams to sit down
and talk about it and I think graph qol
would be a great way to to solve that
kind of issue because
like no one needs to know like they just
need to know like okay I'm going to
query for this kind of data and as long
as we support it like we can do whatever
we want on the back end so kind of
excited about craft you all myself too
yeah all right um that looks like all
the questions we had so thank you John
really appreciate you giving the talk
today and open sourcing that tool that's
really awesome so thank you yeah
absolutely thanks guys for listening and
if you have any questions I'm available
all right awesome so we'll just take
like 15 minute break 13 minute break and
then we'll be back to hear Luanne talk
about the challenges of Cordova thanks
guys thanks for watching this crater
