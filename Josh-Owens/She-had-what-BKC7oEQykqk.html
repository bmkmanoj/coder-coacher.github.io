decided to try somewhere new running
today running next to the Cumberland
River
so I made it to the pedestrian bridge
here along the cumberland river but I
got to turn around we got stuff to do
today so I'm not gonna be able to cross
it it's a good run I would turn it on
and do the rest the other half ended up
getting three miles I wasn't gonna do
that much but I just kept going I wanted
to see that bridge that pedestrian
bridge so wasn't a bad scenic run but
it's hard to compare to other places
like when I've run in the run along the
San Francisco coastline down by the was
the war for the pier I've done six miles
along there and that was pretty amazing
so but this was good it was good looked
like it was some kind of parade going on
I'm assuming a gay pride pray prayed
that was a I was pretty awesome to see
we came over to the Grand Old Opry hotel
I'm gonna try to find a place for lunch
place is enormous it's a huge indoor
greenhouse
we ended up after I did my run on
Saturday winded have gone to the gaylord
opryland hotel which is pretty awesome I
gotta say like it's like a whole city
under under a greenhouse but it is
really cool so we had a lunch share with
my cousin and her husband and we ended
up going and sitting like under the dome
Stephen King book and like everyone was
working i was editing video wendy was
was outlining and my cousin was writing
and her husband kevin was sketching and
doing some art there
we're just sitting there and all of a
sudden someone comes up and scares the
living daylights out of windy it was
hilarious and it just it turned out it
was another author just totally scared
the crap up so we stood there talking
for a while then we ended up going back
and we did the whole award ceremony you
got a bad headache so we ended up
leaving that early we went somewhere
quieter and got some milkshakes so we
got a good start today back on the road
there's a fun trip we met some new
people and I'm exhausted so we'll see

home hopefully we're by two fingers even
on cement any of you uh yeah can I get a
