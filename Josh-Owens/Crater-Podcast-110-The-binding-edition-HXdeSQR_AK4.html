2016 welcome crater fans i'm your host
Josh along with my co-host Bobbi I her
hey ami how's it going good man it's
good things have been really busy for me
but can't complain man about you nice
yeah yeah just good to like be home and
be podcasting like the kids are back in
school feel like I'm getting settled
back into a regular schedule now a
little chaotic over the summer nice yeah
so successful now right huh kids are
back in school now yeah they went back
this week so they started Monday which
is like way earlier than I remember
school starting when I was a kid like we
always went the last week in august
usually not the middle yeah but i'll
taste ready prepare yeah well you don't
have any but you know if you did nice so
what's this week we are going to be
talking about i'm gonna keep talking
slowly well I look up the list building
real-time react applications with Redux
and your graph qln the amazing Apollo
client out that time 141 is out and
react binding patterns five approaches
to handling this as a clever title yeah
so uh yeah I don't know like the
interesting thing too I've been working
on getting the new version of a crater
up and running and so they're not really
good I've been either testing in
including a hobby looks amazing man yeah
yeah do it fast stupid fast n is better
than meteor forums stuff yeah my
prediction is like I me like maybe a
little
commenting has died off just because
like navigating to the post and leaving
a comment was a very slow process and
with the new version it's like silly
fast and plus like the the other nice
benefit is will be able to itch the
pre-render servers and just use meteor
at this point because it's all
server-side rendered and not like all of
this all of it has been major heavy
lifting problem Sasha and you know I've
just been kind of tweaking and deploying
an updated version so yeah it's a good
showcase for what you can do after the
blaze era you know so you know a lot of
you know before crater was done in blaze
and so is all telescope apps mmm and now
you have this opportunity is newer
technology so it's a good example of
what you can do with the credits you
know yes they're like it's worth noting
to like the back end has stayed
relatively the same like there's been
some small tweaks um and I actually have
like both versions deployed now like the
blaze version and the react version and
they react version is significantly
faster and it's not because the backend
has been sped up or anything it's
because it's built and react which has
been kind of an interesting thing to
watch happen yeah yeah can we excited
about that and I also launched the site
for Space Camp 2 point 0 so if anyone is
interested in coming to that we still
have some tickets left I know I launched
you a lot of the previous attendees and
we sold quite a few tickets there but if
you left and it's going to be in corolla
North Carolina this year and we've got
like a mansion right near the beach
which is going to be amazing so check it
out camp dot space to Joe com find out
more info yeah it's also during my
birthday so is it really yeah my weekend
there you read up
yeah do huh nice but I will say this
whenever I go to these meteor things I
only go to the events for a little bit
and then I go do my own thing this will
be insane yeah well it's not really
meteor specific either so late technique
yeah the nice thing is like the other
things I'll occur at the same venue
right and like yes sleep there you hang
out there you play game drink beer like
it was it was a lot of fun last year and
I need for this year maybe we can get
Ben to come down to because I think it's
his birthday as well so oh yeah healthy
option yeah alright so yeah I you know I
really just I think this was posted like
maybe two weeks ago but we didn't get a
podcast out um but I really really enjoy
this a story about building like a
real-time react app with Redux and
meteor because it's it's along the same
lines of a story we got from like Julian
before and he was talking about using um
asteroid and doing like DDP on the front
end and just going and building an app
and I don't know it didn't feel quite
right to me but then like I was reading
this article and it was like it just
smacked me in the face that this felt
like a much better way to implement like
a meteor and react application using
asteroid and redox and so basically like
the article walks you through it but
he's taking the DDP messages that are
coming in are being removed and like
processing it all to a redox and it's
all just one big Redux source so you're
like a king mini Mongo on the front end
you're ditching you know the actual like
meteor DDP client and instead just using
the asteroid ETP client and your front
end is completely separate from your
back end but they still have that
communication channel and they can talk
back and forth yeah I think what people
what people don't realize is DDP is
actually really cool like BP is like one
of the things I wish meteor actually
focused on a little bit more because
there's no other client out there that
will give you this seamless of
integration yeah obviously I feel like
maybe a misstep that mdg made a while
back was not getting more behind DDP and
trying to push it as a standard like
maybe maybe it's not the smartest
standard right like we look at the graph
ql standard and that looks pretty
interesting and significantly shakes
things up and improves things maybe DDP
wasn't a significant improvement may be
graphic you all hit it more on the nose
and that's why we're seeing that be more
interesting we're seeing meteor shift to
that but at the same time there's not a
ton of specifications for real time like
we've got finals and we've got actually
cable and rails and you know you got a
couple other kind of competing standards
but like no one's really nailed it like
they did a meteor and I almost be like
what they should have done is just hired
a couple developers from other languages
to develop DDP clients and put them out
there and like try to get those
communities to latch on to them as well
and that would have become pretty
interesting and I think that's what
graph ql will be but yeah I mean in
terms of Apollo grab your subscriptions
are being worked on by Amanda right now
so you should which is getting ready for
1.5 meter 1.5 so there'll be graph 20
subs but I don't believe they're
speaking over DP or anything ha I'm
websocket interesting enough um so I've
complained about this before but like
medium build times are crazy right
especially you know with one point four
point two or something they're gonna fix
it the next version we agree that i'm
working on a bill your it'll work on it
i hear it every version but what
happened with us is like what the stage
now where we have nine Meg's JavaScript
being served to our clients and it's
like kind of like hit us in the face we
did like a page you know page speed
performance and all that stuff it's
terrible Google AdWords is screwing us
over because the pay is load times and
it finally they hit us because you know
once you start making revenue and you
have all these you know search engine
marketing channels that are being
affected directed by page like
everything just starts making more sense
right I feel like our engineering
manager previously kind of like did not
want us to focus on things like that
rather just build features but now we're
at the point where we're making good
good money and we need to figure out
this so we can make more money right and
we have to build we had to build the
sales dashboard which most of the time I
think most people like err on the side
of like oh yeah let's build an admin
dashboard India right yeah but this is
dash boards I pretty crazy um and we
could have been like a micro service or
we get done something else but we are
trying to ship something super quickly
you know so it is we boot up the
asteroid client we have a web pack
builded app that is just serving an
index dot HTML file bundles all the
JavaScript whatever and we're putting
that on s3 and now we have a fully
functional admin site that is just a
HTML Javascript and CSS and just
connected asteroid and uses reuses all
of our AP is that we have on the gig in
EP client and we use Redux as well on
that too so I think that if you are
struggling of like you know building
separate sites and all that I think ash
word is super good it's actually really
well built it relies on a lot of the
node like product practices like the
meters and stuff like that so it's
pretty cool I mean I use it and it's
going to be used in production so but
that's going to be it's a good
alternative also you could possibly if
you're worried if you have a big meteor
app right now this is like the perfect
way to get aqua meteor if you want to be
a meteor anymore you start moving on
your front end out of meteor into and
then connect over he's like you know the
asteroid client then eventually you can
start moving your back-end API is inches
microservices mm-hmm actually what your
ended up with is no meteor at all
because your friend is gone and if
you're back into slowly on so if you're
trying to make that move which you know
slowly work papads want to transition
into some bigger infrastructure
the first day to get there yeah yeah
yeah you know I think I was talking to
Sasha about this like while we were
working on the new version of crater and
he was trying to get like I tried twice
to get webpack meteor lake talking to
each other and there's actually a
package for it and like I just I could
not get it to work for you to the apps i
was trying you will not telescope client
apps and like build times were I feel
like becoming a significant problem like
i was pairing with people and like
remotely just you had save in your like
Emily comes back you know and reload the
page and it just it feels like there's
that mismatch were like your mind starts
to wander if it's too slow you know like
you focus on the task at hand you're
like oh let's open up reddit let's open
up hacker news and like that's terrible
for victory yeah especially if you're
managing a team like just to touch on
that you're managing a team like not
everyone is going to be like you know a
hundred percent contributor right like
there's always gonna be people in team
that easily distracted or whatever and
the build time gives everyone an excuse
you know you know it's really I it's
what I've been seeing in my in my daily
life it's like oh well I was waiting for
the build tools so you know I didn't get
this tiresome no I know so I guess Sasha
tried to do web pack as well especially
on the crater branch and he posted a
video about it um I think it's on his
YouTube channel but like he found it
hard and then we started talking about
code splitting and he's like code
splitting just looks difficult and so
like there's there's definitely this
this dichotomy between meteor being easy
to get started and when pack kind of
being this power tool but it takes a lot
of configuration you know yeah so like
the stuff that you're talking about the
pain that you're feeling is like it's
definitely real and it's definitely
something that has to be solved but it's
not necessarily a problem that everybody
has read is that you know
yeah and so I don't know I just don't
know if we'll ever see an easy-to-use
tool that will do things like code
splitting you know and make it super
easy on the user to integrate in a smart
way and it's not always best practice
like for a while they're like so I'll
say the new crater sites at like four
point four mags JavaScript like it's not
tiny and i'm feeling like i just added
all the stuff and I'm feeling it
probably got bigger so um but it's just
it's it's one of those things like it
used to be better to load one giant
tarball of JavaScript through one
request but I don't think that's the
case anymore like once you start
approaching four or five megs like it's
actually probably better to split it up
and what the page needs to render you
know exactly and these things start to
matter more when you have users that
care right like sometimes your users
will put up with you know five megs
download time and that'll be good until
a bunch of users don't you know so well
I mean speed always matters right like
you said Google dings you like I
absolutely think we've been losing
google search traffic because yeah
getting slower and slower and we've been
having problems with pre-render and that
kind of thing and so like moving to this
faster version with you know server-side
rendering like should be a significant
boost and I bet Google will reward us
for that and like these are known things
right like you can read opposed by
amazon when they talk about like 100
milliseconds is the loss of millions of
dollars for them and rendering time so
like it may not seem like it adds up at
first but it like over time it will vote
up and probably like cost you some users
of your application if you're not
careful yeah I wish the only thing I
would have done differently is worried
about that's feed before you know like
when my appt was at 4 Meg's instead of
9i should have worried about it then now
we're worrying about it when it's in the
Sun not too late cuz this you know not
you know we still got people and we're
so alive and everything but man I were
to do it again I would have worried
about this problem a lot earlier I would
imply done things like asteroid a lot
earlier to you I mean it's it's hard
like in hindsight yeah you you would you
get time to pay that technical debt
sooner but at the same time like it's
hard when you're still trying to find
product market fit a lot of time so yeah
yeah totally alright well the next topic
today is grab ql and the amazing apollo
client ID amazing in there the author
did yeah this is a this is a really good
post a lot of people have been wondering
like how do i get started with gradual
and meteor and apollo and all these
different things this specific ones i
really media related but like how do i
you get started with you know a view
layer and apollo and it hasn't been many
tutorials out i'll be honest the apology
documentation is pretty crappy right now
because it's on the focus you know
that's not the focus yet um and so this
guy forget its name let me see one
second uh Gee sands which I don't know
his actual name let's see it's like
Gerard I want to say I followed him on
twitter address all this G sands Gerard
sands yeah that he's actually angular to
death which is cool because you know
angular to Apollo client is actually
very very getting very mature thanks to
Camilla um anyway back to the story so
he goes through what girl asks why is
the wider benefits and for people who
are new to the show or neutral gradual
gradual is a query language that
replaces effectively replaces rest api's
um and it allows you to have a uniform
on syntax for fetching data and mutating
data on any client whether that be in
mobile web or Windows Phone just kidding
um and uh so that's pretty much
graphical does appalled
client is trying to solve the problem of
how do I get started with grab 20 by
giving you a pretty much a standard
graph 2l client library that integrates
with react native react angular 2 and
that's it right now we just recently the
react integration was rewritten api's or
rewritten to be more flexible for other
view letters to come in and now there's
a bunch of changes which are really
really awesome there's caching by
defaults their server side rendering
this is amazing things going on with the
reactive Paulo angular follow the same
way if you guys are changing so the
company's products are in flux but this
post goes through how to build a to view
application in angular and react so you
know pick your flavor and you can start
learning Apollo um work clock is
starting to architect our graphical
solution we are gonna go with Apollo
clients on the client obviously react
Apollo and our the server on the other
hand we were thinking if we're going to
use Apollo server or not just give me a
bunch of smart guys and they want more
control over you know what they what
what what this structure is going to be
but but just take that step back Apollo
server is not necessarily like it's just
an implementation of you know Express
graph you'll express it also has
integrations with happy and you know
Cola and those type of server-side
libraries so it's just it's just a set
of tools so you know anyone can build it
on graphical server but this is an oj s
version so that's the whole graph you
all day this is a very post if you want
to get into it and you know I think now
that people are seriously trying to
think you know think about how they're
going to put into production I think
it's probably a good time for people to
get involved and get interested in the
project you know we we first we have we
have grabbed pillow running enough work
pub on our you know our internal its
internal dashboard we integrate
with elastic search so you can search
users dinar in our app like you know for
people who need to like moderate and
like you know user management for our
people are in sales and stuff they can
like you know we indexed everyone into
elasticsearch put the elastic search api
is different than the Mongo users API
right so what we do is we unified that
via the Apollo client so you know
building that you I was super easy
because we have to worry about different
syntactical sugar elastic strap which
elasticsearch is super weird if you
never work with it like how there was
the datas or the results come back and
one thing I will say about elasticsearch
in graph 20 and it a meteor at the same
time is media has this problem of
publishing like counts right like
everyone has a everyone has like this
concept of like wanting to know the
total amount of documents and you know
that count um so like currently you have
to do a bunch of like you know observes
to understand like how many how many
documents are in query the good thing
about electrician graph to oil is you
just depend on elastic search for
publishing those counts so there's not
like this live query cost of constantly
washing counts now so as you make the
grab field query to elastic search it
will give you the results from that
query and will give you the total amount
of search results so you can use that to
power pagination or whatever so other
data sources become a huge thing with
graphical and especially if you're
coming from meteor world you don't have
you never had access to these these data
sources and the leverage that they have
but now you do so that's it get into it
nice that's awesome because I you know I
was just thinking about I've got a
client project that I think could
benefit from elastic search and I
government started on it yet so may you
graphed you all a try yes it just makes
see the thing is what we realize that
worked out with the server guys is grab
kill doesn't make their life easier
only makes the people building like you
I and product stuff like mobile apps
easier there's still to do the same
amount of work on the back again I like
it's easier amount of work but there's
gonna be less like here's the problem
with the rest right the problem with the
rest api is is the way you write a rest
api could be completely different than
the way i write one yeah always I've
always had trouble like Twitter never
does the right thing for their rest api
and the kidding the data you need out of
the twitter api is always frustrating so
like I I totally get that because you
want to be able to say like you usually
here's all the data I need give it back
to me and like you can't do that you
gotta like make five different calls to
get all the data you want and that's
kind of terrible so also like I
definitely see a benefit in graph qol
and I think you know for people who
haven't heard of it like to put it into
2 meteor terms it's like graph ql server
is going to be like the publication side
right like you're going to write your
resolvers and they're going to be like
your your meteor publications and then
to react or Apollo client or the angular
Apollo client like those are your mini
Mongo essentially and they're gonna
outlive get that data in and then let
you do things with it and then whenever
it updates like it should we run that
code on the front end and do the right
thing it's exactly one last thing about
rest api is vs media her versus you know
Apollo meteor is good because you have
simple schema right and you can always
validate your request for check or you
can use match or you can simply scan it
so yeah all those the type system a
graph Jill is a type system so you can
validate you know that certain queries
or mutations are doing but rest has no
validation system right so everyone
rolls their own yeah everybody has their
own validation so this is just another
reason to stay away from rest api's
because you're constantly going to be
inconsistent you're gonna be rolling
suck yourself and while gonna leave
easter eggs in your pjs on blob that
satan have no point of liking there so
anyway that's another cool all right so
meteor 141 came out like yesterday like
this is hot off the presence yeah um I
actually was not expecting this I wasn't
paying attention to the git repo I've
been like heads down working on other
stuff but like this this kind of hit me
out of nowhere and so they've done some
improvement I actually haven't even put
it into the app that I'm working on
right now to see what kind of timing
improvement there is but um they've
replaced pauper or so before they were
using a javascript implementation of tar
yeah and like in a red the deeper
article so if you go like in the show
notes we'll have a link to the the
announcement but in the announcement the
Newman in a couple spots says hey you
want to read deeper go here like I read
some of those legs and so like he saw he
went from like 30 plus seconds to like
four seconds by using native machine tar
versus a java javascript implementation
of car and so basically when they
download a pitch from you know the the
package server then they would have to
extract that and it was that extraction
process that was taking quite a while
and so you know he's saying that's like
30 seconds town of 4 is almost an order
of magnitude they're like close um to an
order of magnitude so like I'm pretty
excited for this myself the other thing
that they did is they switched to four
point five point zero which is funny
because I think the state of deployment
and meteor 14 is actually pretty pretty
terrible I mean that was one of the
things that help me up the most with
crater I literally lost a day to trying
to deploy a crater using mop and meteor
14 and like it's terrible like we gave
up we moved it back to 13 and just
deployed that way so no note for 47 but
so it's like I'm feeling since mup
hasn't even caught up with a working
doctor image I worry like what's it
going to look like when it's got to be
meteor or no 4.5 now but the good news
is like this is the brand new LTS
long-term supported version of nodes so
hopefully that'll stick around for a
while and it won't be quite as painful
down the road but it's really cool to
see like how quickly they were able to
to make that that switch to know yet the
other thing and this is part of it is
that there's no more published for arc
and so if you publish the package i had
a binary a dependency from node then you
you would know that you had to do this
publish for arc which would basically go
out and make a build a binary built so
when you download a package meteor would
look at your the system you were on and
it would download the correct pre-built
binaries for you um which was nice but
at the same time now that they're
switching node versions a lot uh that's
gonna be a lot more painful on package
maintainer so he he outlines this um you
know basically for each version of node
that they deployed you're gonna have to
relaunch and re-release your packages
and so instead what makes sense now and
I felt this was coming in part of one
for you actually just download
everything you need and then you could
pile it on the target machine which i
think is the right thing to do that's
the right thing to do but at the same
time like I'm feeling the forums and
stack overflow are gonna fill up with
like new saying I can't do this you know
is like then I'll have the compiler
toolchain installed and like it's cool
if you can't figure that out but at the
same time like what used to be part of a
user friendly process no longer will be
what a clear out the more and more I
realize like what user friendly really
means well this might be a
generalization but the more weird
experience I get and then
more my product is scaling I realize
that user friendly has a lot of holes it
you know there's a lot of coals for user
friendly stuff I seem like that it seems
like the best tools are not user
friendly right so I'll say like they're
more like the more powerful tool is the
more configurable a tool is the less
user-friendly it's going to be yeah try
to set defaults but at the same time
like it becomes hard because like it's
hard to document this hard land in all
the options that you have and um like
you know it's it's I don't know like I
mean I'm at this place i actually
started writing an article that was like
framework versus libraries and which
ones better and I think I at this point
err on the side of libraries because I
think they can build smaller and more
focused teams that can put out something
of higher quality versus what you know
of a big team can put out and you know
this this you complain about the build
time this isn't this is a an appropriate
thing to talk about is like they say
meteor 142 will focus on fixing the belt
times but at the same time you know at
what expenses that coming because we're
not like we only have been and most
people don't realize it's only been and
so most people didn't like when I
commented there was a threat on crater
about improving the build times and um
you know I made a comment there that
it's only been working on meteor now and
who like it you serious like that to me
that seems like the project's tab I'm
like guys just look all you have to do
is click through and look at the the
developer a meteor and it's just the
solid wall of ben's avatar for all the
commits there like two or three commits
in the first page from tom coleman and I
think he's like part-time zoals part
time on meteor like everyone else is on
a pot and that's fine but you have to
understand that like if the community
has to take up the cause here or we're
just going to get slower releases um and
you know
like these are not easy problems either
if you know and look up the the link on
creator about improving build time the
ticket talks about there's a link to the
like how to basically meteor has a
profiling tool to check out the speed
for the builds and like they know
roughly where you could probably make
gains but something's still are
instrumented there so they don't know
what's taking a long time you know and
like median 14 seem to increase CSS
precompiler time dramatically so that's
I know that's one thing they're looking
at 41 42 but like people can pitch in
and help so I would advise you to do the
research and go find these and try to
pitch in and help like that's if meteors
your jam then it's on you to make it
better yep I post it on there too my my
profile Lori pretty slow but I will say
we found out that twenty five percent of
our build time is with tap i 18 n so if
you guys have come I think compilers the
compilers if you're using a package that
is using the 1.2 in previous compilers
which tap I 18 min is you might be
screwed you know so it's not just about
helping meteor out of stopping these
packages that a lot of people use or
have been upgraded to 1.3 or 1.4 because
1.3 had a huge gains in the compiler
plugins but a lot of people haven't done
that I understand why because it's you
know it's pretty touchy you know I'm
breakaways it it's hard to like is it as
a guy that that previously wrote
packages like I stopped it because it
was just hard to keep up with the
changes and like I remember we had
probably like 15 packages out for
differential and when they went from
zero not 708 that's when they switch up
blaze like that was that was a terrible
week like I feel like I spent the entire
week just updating packaging and media
plays um which you know this part of the
game I guess but
like it just it wasn't a great
experience and so I think and then like
on top of that you got to find all the
hidden documentation everywhere that
kind of talks about the changes that are
happening the hidden documentation
that's the real problem right like it's
a real problem yeah it's like all these
little links like I really appreciate
them putting in these longer discussion
links and stuff like that because that's
the kind of stuff that was hard to find
before yeah and now it's a little bit
easier but like unless you're like super
plugged into up-to-the-minute media
development like it's kind of hard to
find that sometimes yeah another
interesting thing is just bends kind of
like and advanced of saying like this
code is really important like poorly
written I'm going to fix this you know
like like yeah he is the only one he's
the only one writing meteor work on the
media platform but he there's no one
else i would rather want working on oh
yeah i agree with that yeah and I'll
take him over pretty much any developer
and you go like I mean I loved I'll beat
all I thought he was very very good mmm
but like you know I remember when we
first started using meteor and the
community to to like you know Greenspan
and glass or like these guys that like
you know even Jeff who wrote the the
beginnings of the framework everyone
looked up to these guys is like oh my
god like so smart you know then this guy
from facebook comes in and he just like
set their Cody's like starts rewriting
most of it right the media platform is
still the way it was you know that all
the stuff that we complained about is
because the legacy I really feel like
Ben is making strides into he's you know
he's touching the things that no one
else wanted to touch right yeah yeah
absolutely like you know a good dope for
that is like I worked on a project right
after our avital left mdg we were on a
project together and we both had the
same objective which was to speed up the
overall learning time on mobile for this
application and like it just it was
tough task it was up to I think four
seconds to load like initial like
open the app and then data was there and
it was ready to use was like four
seconds of time and so like he was he
was picking through and finding a little
100 millisecond tweaks here and there
she's coming um but I knew I knew an
easy one and like you know he he he was
just trying to figure out all these
these little wins and like I went
through and just did of this stock
unblock global in the application and
cut the time in half you know and like I
think sometimes that can be an
engineering problem as well like you
have to be able to take a step back and
say actually where's our biggest win
gonna be and like you know with meteor
141 at our like that that feels like a
pretty big win too yeah water magnitudes
of speed game there so yeah that's cool
all right last topic of the day is funny
react finding patterns five approaches
for handling this and this isn't close
cuz you know this I'm actually went on I
went on the meteor interviews once I
talked about how I hate discs in
JavaScript because because even the most
advanced engineers think they know the
context of it when half the time you
still wrong you know okay so anyway you
know in react when you're using classes
there's several methods to actually bind
the context of the react component to
this yeah and quarry house who's been
just ballin lately with these articles
like he did one of a stainless come see
this functional component so we covered
um and I think he has a bunch of home
but I think he works at Pluto side and
he went he did he just like wanted to
fill the air or spilled the beans or
whatever on like the different patterns
because I know a lot of people are very
opinionated about how they find or use
this you know there's so I'll go through
them number one um is if you're old he
just said you could use the ol
school reactor create class and that's
that used to auto bind this doing sorry
using es6 react people they're up in
arms like oh my god I can't do anything
it's all broken but it's because I just
didn't ought to buy this which I'm
actually a favor for you should never
auto bind anything it's like blaze auto
binding this to be the data context like
who the hell do that right so I'm not a
fan of this but you can with you could a
you know you could use great class and
he'll still work for you if you you can
bind in the render function which if you
use airbnb react style guide they will
ban that because obviously they're huge
application so they don't want to bind
in the regular function because that
will create a new instance of a function
every time render is called McCrory says
that if your app is small that's just a
premature optimization you know but yeah
hey I don't know I'm not a fan of it and
i'll tell you why i like binding in the
render i think you know looking at es7
and getting decorators like I'm feeling
will get auto binding back and and I'm
fine with auto binding as long as you
know you're doing it and it's like
explicitly done at the top of the file
or whatever and I think that binding in
the render is going to be an additional
problem at that point right because
you're going to have to hunt through
your HTML code to find those like bind
calls and replace them and I just think
it's not super obvious so yeah I don't
think so you there that's why I was
that's why you guys you know who usually
act you should lean on the style guide
and yes yes length because then you'll
never even get into the habit in the
first place you know I have a co-worker
that is super into binding in the render
function and have several arguments
several arguments until I you know I
kept saying that Oh de Lille actually
caused a lot of problems no one believed
me then lo and behold upon the es Lynch
react style guide which where it says
exactly what I just said something okay
oh do you believe me now everyone
freaking believe me then so
okay fine whatever trust your sound I
trust yes land Airbnb does a great job
of keeping you honest so yes um arrow
functions in render that's another thing
they love it and these first one or the
last one way which one if you if you do
it yeah the arrow function like you
mention same thing right terrible
terrible don't do it don't go do this
one either and he is lint Airbnb react
won't let you do this one either oh
really interesting i got honestly like I
never even thought to use a fat arrow so
yeah like I hey you should you can use
function the word function that's
because they don't want you although you
know giving the context from the
component into your functions thanks
anyway I don't recommend this but Cory
says it didn't really matter that's
because he's trying to be neutral I'm
more popular than that number for
binding the constructor this is the
recommended approach I'm into this one
this is what I do all the time sure I
may have 20 methods bound to the
constructor but first you shouldn't have
20 methods about to the constructor you
should make smaller components okay and
to this is just this is like be most
clear a plate is to do it cuz it's
called the constructor it's where
everything starts so you can understand
and read from top to bottom where things
are going to go with the methods are
exact you know stuff like that so I'm
into this this is what everyone else
recommends um yeah and so like you know
for me I do code reviews in like if I
see any other style but this out didn't
you on it because number one you write
performance concerns and the number to
like future code concerns if the people
coming in behind you should be able to
open the file make a relatively quick
glance and understand the events that
are being handled essentially right like
you write these functions and you need
to have the the context bound properly
because you're you're handling some kind
of event that happened
react and you want to run a function as
a result so like there's a lot of pluses
to this and I fully get behind this one
so yeah and the last one is you use
arrow functions in the class property
this is actually pretty interesting
might be the future of how we do these
things but there's a class property
feature that's being proposed I believe
in the in NES 2016 or 2617 which allows
you to have ecstatic properties and like
class fields outside the constructors
are just like you know just the AMA
class and then is able to transform
those methods into into the constructor
i believe uh it's just good people don't
like writing stuff so you know they
don't want to do that all right also it
will also replace like component will
mount you will need to do like the wheel
mount calls but anyway that's besides
the point this is also interesting just
because you know Eric functions are
great because you do want to buy in
context in and but yet you know like I
never really had the need to and I've
worked on complex you I I never really
needed to do rely on air functions that
much and no like I don't know so pick
your poison I don't know their candy
like coming from a backbone background
and using coffeescript like the arrow
function was super handy that's why i
like when i see it i call it the fan
arrow because in CoffeeScript you have
fenner skinny arrow and like federer
rebound your context properly and skinny
arrow just kept the context what it was
yeah I miss I miss the skinny arrow yeah
do you think using aerial functions in
your class is pretty much it's the
easiest way to go can create class to
this because you can just replace world
you're not going to have performance
concerns like binding the renderer or
error functions and render and you're
not going to have to write dot bind on
everything so you felt like for those
who want to save lines of code like four
letters or whatever um that'll be good
for you too I personally will go with
the fifth one just because that's
going to be the same thing as number
four yeah but you know just syntactic
sugar you know like yeah find the best
one but what if you're a team that's
kind of wary about adopting adopting new
features I'd hold off a little bit you
know but if you're like gung ho and go
for yeah yeah so I think like my concern
here would be like if this gets shot
down exactly that's gonna be a little
weird right but it is as a stage 2
proposal which I don't even know that
means stage 2 that means that it is a
draft out and the author is very sure
about it they they're sure but the
committee's not yeah so but you know a
lot of us are using stage to a property
stay like you know object rests spread
objects spread which is is to realize
that you know like decorators are stage
two as well mm-hmm use decorators though
but you know but you look at the authors
right so like objects spread author is
Sebastian mark bitch can react so is it
a lot of people look up to him so I'm
sure that'll go through and then
decorators are from yehuda katz who is
from amber so that's going to go through
for sure these two like people do people
look up to I don't know who did transfer
this class property picture I think it's
uh who's this dad Dana Daniel to
Schinder opposite that right yeah so if
we don't know who he is probably not
going to go through I was kidding no
come on now you don't story it's so good
this is a good change I think it will go
through it's just you know if you like
living on the wild side and go for it if
you don't then don't do it yeah yeah
cool awesome
all right so I guess that's the end of
the show let's the end of the show yeah
that's how much to get stuff going yeah
yeah it's good to catch up again this
week I'm excited and I will say like I
am committed to getting the new version
of Crater launched like I'm this close
this close and if you're listening like
it's super super close if you're
watching on YouTube you can see ya it's
not an actual measurement but like so at
this point we've got um the stuff seems
broken and I've got to download either
the den version of mup or roll back to a
slightly older version of up because the
1 i'm using now the log command doesn't
work so i can't see the darker logs for
the new crater which sucks I don't know
exactly what's wrong with the OAuth I
think it's throwing a 500 error so I got
afraid that I loud once that's done like
you know we've got podcast integration
in the sidebar we've got um it links to
the conference up in the top bar I want
to the other thing I want to do is try
to set up a public slack rooms anyone
that's a crater fan can jump in and we
can have a slack channel or we can talk
a little different then say like space
dojo slack room which you can get into
through patreon but you know i wanna i
want to have somewhere where people can
it doesn't cost you anything if you're a
fan of Crater you can just go and talk
and have those those conversations you
want to have put oh yeah like we never
really got like a meteor slack chat room
like there's one for a problem which is
pretty good but there was never one for
me um so I feel like I want to bring the
community together in that way and
hopefully it's a positive thing so I
will say this like meteor forums so
there's a time or creditor was like the
place to go from news like cuz that back
and it was like meteor news mm-hmm then
the whole media reforms came out and it
was a bunch of drama several went to the
meter forms now that your forums is
where dreams go to die there's just like
nothing productive going on there
I never asked for help they don't even
get responses um like they used to yeah
well I mean place to ask for help either
extent that's true but you know Epis is
like that place is dying and I think
with the crater rebirth it's gonna bring
back the traffic you know all the
questions and everything articles are
going to come back to crater so I'm
really looking forward to it well the
thing that I think probably heard the
most of creditor is the fact that you
have to have positive karma in order to
post now and so like and I don't really
talk about it um I'll just say this like
if you're a spammer and you listen to
this podcast we set the bar pretty high
and so I'll say it like you have to have
at least five positive karma which means
you have to get five upload top comments
and like I even I feel like there was a
spammer the other day that asked me like
how to get karma on Twitter and I want
looked at his Twitter feed I didn't
answer this question because like look
at me but like you know that that kind
of hurts because you can't just come in
and start you can leave a comment but
you can't you can't post a link so and
that's you know we just can't have nice
things because spammers thats why we
can't have nice things man do you know
my name is Bamber's all right now oh
thanks man sorry no worries I'll see
that to eat and tune in next week and
we'll have more deaf news this video has
been in space dojo production you can
click the learn more button to find out
more about us at space dojo com or
increase the subscribe button to get
notified about new videos who put out
each week thanks for watching
