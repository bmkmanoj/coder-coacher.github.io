let's dive right into the browsing and
searching the site as you can see here
we have the list of recipes already
pulled up we can do a search for tomato
pull up all the relevant recipes will go
back here we can pull up game de chile
so you can see we have a nice recipe
card you I that Kevin build we have a
nice built-in rating system here if we
go down over here you can see the
metadata like the category the chef's
name which is clickable over here we
have the recipe picture serving
information ingredients instructions and
then we have an ad to recipe box feature
which you can store your favorites on if
we click on the chef's name here you can
see you can pull up all the recipes that
Chef has entered in to the site here we
are at the new member signup page you
can see data birth there that's actually
going away in the next version it's just
a standard signup form if we click on
login here I can go ahead and log into
the site you can see all the recipes we
have here scroll down hit the pagination
link will pull up that same game de
chile link and i'll show you the weekly
planner so here we are in the game de
chile and you'll notice down to the
bottom we now have a toggle weekly
planner which you can bring up i
actually already have gameday chili so
let's go back and i'll pull up another
recipe and add that so go back here and
we'll click on this insalata and you'll
notice we have the weekly planner and
then we scroll down a little bit and
here's the drop down hit the add to
planar you see the nice little Ajax add
let's talk about actually creating the
recipe so you can see here to standard
form input we can choose the category
put in the title you'll notice over here
we have a live preview so as you type it
will actually update and give you an
idea of what the recipe will look like
as you put it in so as we put in all the
information like the prep time the cook
time go down here say how many it serves
let me actually put in the ingredients
we have a nice little example there
of how you separate the ingredients we
have a custom partial we wrote that
breaks it up into a quantity a
measurement unit in the actual
ingredients themselves so that that was
one of the features that we wrote that
we wanted to be able to have a custom
input method so you didn't have to add
all these individual fields for each
ingredient so we'll just type in a
little description we'll add some tags
down here if I can type and we'll hit
create new as the author i do get an
edit link or as the chef I guess I
should say so we can go back in here and
edit it so i can add the picture go
ahead and choose a picture i downloaded
off the unit in here and we'll hit save
there's the recipe with the new picture
so if we go back to the main menu here
we can go back into my tasty pita and I
can give you an idea of how the grocery
list builder works so we go back to the
weekly planner like I said we'll pull up
the my tasty pizza and we'll add it to
my weekly planner and it added it down
here on the menu now if we go up to the
top we can click on make a grocery list
you'll see our new custom grocery list
for our weekly planner you'll see I have
some custom items in here you can remove
those and you can go in and add other
custom items like dish soap or dog food
click Add and it adds them nice Ajax
effect here we have the print and the
iphone links speaking of the iphone
let's take a look at that interface you
can see here i'm using iphone ii and i
pulled up the website and you can see
what the custom grocery list looks like
you can see the dog food down there so
let's talk a little bit about campfire
in our design process we use campfire to
chat back and forth that's where we we
meet every day to kind of discuss what
we're going to build
this is where we met to come up with the
feature list the domain name ideas you
can see you know this was a chat from
the actual day of the competition let's
look at some of the sketches we were
able to share so here's an example that
Kevin did he drew it up and scanned it
in and this was the recipe planner that
we wanted to add this was the initial
version of it here's a thumbnail layouts
of various pages we wanted to build out
again kevin drew this up and scanned it
in this next shot is actually of the
database schema Chris wrote or actually
sketched this up about an hour before
the competition started and once the
competition started he was working on
installing the depre can getting the
server up and running and it took so
long to install everything because 150
people were installing rubygems and it
was incredibly slow so he was able to do
this up an omni graffle so let's take a
look at some of the comps this
screenshot is what happens when
developers get first crack at designing
the layout not too pretty by about 5am
kevin had come up with our first comp as
you can see here so Kevin finally got
about five hours of sleep and then we
started going over various color ideas
and iterations so let's jump into edge
and how we use that and the plugins we
used we decided to build this on edge
because it gave us the most flexibility
to get things built quickly as you can
see here's edge here's the plugins we
used you can see access fair access
rateable access taggable restful
authentication r-spec r-spec on Rails
will page na here's a look at that
recipe ingredient parser method that I
mentioned earlier in the screencast you
can see here the parsing part and then
here's the measurement part it will
actually break out the individual
measurements based on keywords if we
pull a break stats here real quick you
can see we had 782 lines of code 1500
lines of test code
and with the one to 1.9 code to test
ratio that concludes our presentation of
