welcome crater fans i'm your host Josh
on some of my special co-host Bobbi I
how you guys doing hey man oh figures my
dog oh uh yeah so I uh we had it we had
some issues and I tried swapping out
some mics and I got a new camera now so
if you're watching you'll see that but
it seems like we're studying a little
bit static I'm not sure what's going on
they're gonna try to maybe after the
show try to swap out some cables see if
that fixes it I don't know yeah yeah
where's the AV Department man yeah yeah
carnotaurus those our tech guys uh oh
yeah where the tech guys are forgot
that's awkward so this week well welcome
back to the show i'll be at thanks for
having me i love coming on the show yeah
so uh Ben and I just wrapped a show for
we were talking to the feathers guys so
after we talked about feathers last week
we invited them on the show and they
said okay so guys that's awesome yeah
great topic good talk we had there but
this week we're going to talk about 11
lines of JavaScript breaking the
internet I can't believe that ominous of
it how in the world do I host multiple
media apps on one digital droplet being
over day meteor developer is different
haha and a react native meteor fact yep
some good i like these topics especially
i mean the ones i got were like kind of
out of my wheelhouse a little bit but I
learned a lot of cool stuff so I can't
wait to share with everyone yeah yeah
definitely so uh let's just get into it
sure
so some crazy stuff happened this week
Brooke broke the internet didn't really
break the internet but broke a bunch of
notebook apps anyone that's using boot
itself or able j/s probably had trouble
pulling stuff from mpm earlier this week
it turns out that there was a package
that was published along with 249 ish
other packages by someone and azar so
very prolific NPM package publisher and
there was a bit of a kerfuffle over one
of his packages being named kick k ik
and apparently some some lawyers from
the instant messaging app qik came along
and said you need to take that down
you're you're you're infringing on our
trademark we're gonna we're gonna come
after you if you don't and he said I'm
not gonna take it out whoa apparently
they didn't like that answer so they
went to mpm the business and said hey we
have a lot of lawyers we're going to
make a big deal out of this either with
us or take down or something or you know
we're gonna be forced to a more
high-powered rifle of lawyers at you
know how else to put that but um and so
they they took it down and uh I guess
either was was pretty upset at that
point I think I would be to roll um it's
definitely not cool like this is an open
source project and whoa I don't know um
certainly like I've never been on the
receiving end of any kind of legal
threat like that so I don't I don't know
what that's like but
you know he just decided on publish all
his modules and it turns out he had a
little 11 line package collect pad that
quite a few the other node modules are
relying on like like we're talking a lot
this dang thing uh was fetched 2.5
million times just in the last month
right this is for light upon package um
and the fact that it got unpublished
just kind of like broke everything
including hood its open and Babel it's
just so crazy how like something as
small as like putting padding on strings
which is like what the module did right
there's like pads look good it puts left
padding on strings and you know some
node module authors just started running
with it and then now the guy unpublished
day which is it's just so funny like I
never thought that there'd be legal
battles for open-source names I never
thought that apparently this company was
trying to make their own modules called
kick or something the kick module cuz
they're the company's name kick and I
can't believe it went with such force
like oh we're going to we're going to
sue this out of you you know like it's
not weird I mean will we be surprised if
Facebook or Twitter did it that's true
that's true like if I was like if I was
like if I was like I had like the
Facebook before Facebook with facebook i
like some module name facebook something
like yeah they probably come after you I
wonder if they pay you out I wonder if
you just buy really by you at it does it
look like this guy got an offer just
like hey give me your good for money
back I would feel like a big company
like Google or Facebook rather just pay
the person rather get the legal team
involved you know it's dad what you
gonna see i'd happily move off a node
module name for a four-figure
five-figure check yeah brainer that's a
no-brainer I think this guy being for
this guy was about pride I think it's
just like
is that a lot for the community and in
terms of his modules and I I think some
of it is just you know he in his uh he
had a blog post and he talked about um
you know he feels like I want to get the
quote right um they end up putting a
module back up by the way you kind of
got everything fixed pretty quickly so
I'm p.m. did handle that part of it
pretty well um this situation made me
realize that mpm is someone's private
land where corporate is more powerful
than people and I do open source because
power to the people and I think that
that's me that's pretty accurate
sentiment to the table um I feel like
you know you feel like mpm itself is
maybe um something that's that's for the
people but it turns out it's not um they
are a business at the end of the day and
businesses I don't know if their
nonprofit business is this making money
yeah generally so I don't know it's
interesting and so he sparked a whole
debate you know I see David Hunt of my
hands in having fun at node because this
little leaven line package broke whole
ecosystem yeah you know it they were
able to fix it quickly and I know he's
more in the monolith camp but i think
that i don't know like it sparked
interesting discussion around the fact
that he you get to move faster because
you're able to utilize someone else's
work versus like having to write
everything from scratch and you know
it's really interesting because looking
at like feathers j/s versus meteor in
the the podcast i just say with men like
you know that it's kind of the same
thing right like they're they're
leveraging as much other people's work
as they can well they can just write the
stuff that's core to what they're
building and with a d'architecture
pattern they're kind of promoting here
and you know I
I still think that's a smart thing to do
I think that in the end the situation
was resolved like even if it's a 200
line you know package I think someone
would have republished it somehow and
maybe you update a bunch of things but
it worked out in the end I find you know
I'm not doing a great job at supporting
all my open source stuff and when I
don't do that someone comes along and
works it and and does what they need to
do and other people figure that out yeah
we don't really I don't know I see the
node ecosystem a little bit more like
embracing true open source where like
people are actually becoming
contributors and stuff on the flip side
with meteor some meteor packages will
exist for like a day and the next day
there'll be some split or some different
variation or you know a good example not
to get on those practical practical
meteor people but they like took Mike's
package and they made practical meteor
mocha and like I feel like in the NPM
world they would have figured out a way
to make the module more you know elastic
in terms of it could work for different
use cases and stuff like that I haven't
seen this like concept a lot in the NPM
community where oh this is a fork of
this package that we just did a bunch of
stuff and then you know there are a
couple of things out there like this is
MPA module called juice that helps
people in line that CSS well there's
like juice one juice to juice three
juice for there's like people just fork
it and they add little things to it
first I don't know if that is productive
for the ecosystem especially since I
know like Josh you have a forms package
I'll dita some forms package and then
some other companies that have net your
meteor developers they have their own
forms packages Abigail Watson has their
own form packs see I'm saying like it's
just like a thing I don't know where the
resolution there is but this this did
bring a lot of like healthy debate about
I get my company especially we're like
oh yeah so half there's half the team
was like oh that's why we build our own
stuff so we we only can only have to
worry about our own mistakes and stuff
I'm on the flip side saying like we had
a build are all of our own stuff you
guys would be here till three a.m. every
night working just to catch up just to
just to be where you need to be just
because this cuz you could build
yourself as mean you should write and
where does it stop to its cuz I thought
they're right like just because these
are ok to use MongoDB or do we say like
we gotta run our own database you know
um which i think is is something you can
certainly undertake at some point when
it makes sense for your business if you
need to write like um the the people
behind Cassandra I think Twitter and
Facebook we're both kind of throwing
efforts in there or you know did just I
once you have scaling problems you start
to tackle those but yeah I agree like to
me like were where we're at today with
computing because of open source in my
um and I think that that will continue
to move forward yeah so and and the
caliber of developers will only get
better because of open source because
they get to use NPM modules they get to
learn something maybe like about the
module that they would have had to go on
a huge yak shave to learn they can go
look at a module understand how the
architecture was laid out they don't
have to go second-guess it for
themselves you know later can adopt
those things and you know they can get a
be a better developer so it is ah I
would agree with that I would almost
compare it to the car industry right
like if you look back at cars in the 60s
or 70s like they were built in a way
that people could look at them and
understand the standards well where is
now like everything's getting
computerized and become a praia Terry
and you're gonna have this tool to be
able to interact the car's engine so I
mean like I think things are gonna get
more and more complicated in that regard
and it's not really like open source
right like Tesla's of course Wow
interesting good stuff alright so next
the next is my topic and it's something
that I never usually never really
actually think about on the daily which
is like how to host my meteor app and we
had the last time I was on the show we
talked about hosting
and I feel like this is a perfect
article that came out of a lot of
discussions about the recent posting
changes with going from free or free to
not free and all the drama I remember in
that episode I talked about like how I
love galaxy because I don't have to
think about it I don't have to do
anything it just does it for me well we
have this great article from a guy named
Julian and it's how do i hook host
multiple media wraps on one digital
ocean droplet now I've never used
digital ocean to be honest you know my
hosting providers of choice have been
modulus and in the past I did Heroku and
I never use digital ocean so I thought
this was a really interesting take on
you know just deploying meteor apps
before galaxy at work pop we used the
commedia riser which I think a lot of
people do use 2d meteor eyes the meteor
app turn it into a note app and then
host it on modulus this cool thing about
digital ocean one is a sponsor of the
show right that's a good thing and to
like you get to use some of the meteor
community tools but such as like meteor
up our nota made and you can manage the
deployment process like that I think at
the end the day with deployments if
you're not that into due to the whole
DevOps thing like I think the wish list
that you really want is like give me a
command that I can just say deploy and I
don't have to worry about it right
that's like everyone's dream let me just
sit deployed blah blah blah and it's
done right so this article goes from
just the top to the bottom like how if I
have a meteor app if I have multiple
media wraps how am I going to set it up
under visual ocean so he tells you how
to do the server setup he does the
engines set up and he just gives you the
he actually gives you all the code
you'll need to do so like the great
thing about this article is if you want
to learn you can just copy and paste
stuff which is the best way to like to
see and figure things out you didn't
copy and paste is his content just see
if it works for you
and he goes through all of it he'll go
he goes in depth into mop X which is the
meteor up to i just described and yea
once again has a bunch of code for you
to just copy and paste and see how it
goes you know that's pretty much the the
life cycle is article it's really Kamal
concrete just blocks of code that have
good descriptions on how to do things
and how to just deploy on digital ocean
where at the end of the whole tutorial
you get that beautiful line this is am
up x deploy and everything works right
so that's is the beauty of the soul
DevOps process especially if you're not
into DevOps kind of like me this is a
great thing to learn just cuz I didn't
understand all this stuff that you have
to worry about you know like I never
really thought about it because I don't
my company it's not my job to think
about this step stuff you know I so I
would say the thing to be careful of and
you're right like in full disclosure
both modulus and digital ocean sponsor
the show um but you know like my pecs
III think it's it's deceptively be easy
to get set up and deployed but if if
you're not a DevOps person I would
almost be leery of going this route just
because you know when when crap breaks
uh you gotta hope someone it broke for
someone else first and they put in a
github issue whoa if you're using my
pecs so I mean hey can you can feel
under the gun right and you you really
want to understand some of this
technology if you're gonna take on the
hosting yourself right so if I go and
move my database to compose I oh then
I'm now relying on them to do the
support and make sure my crap works
whereas if I hosted myself and some
breaks I gotta figure out how to fix it
so i think that's that's definitely like
the difference for me and he mentions
let's encrypt at the end of the article
but i would say it should be part of
this article and in 2016 like let's
encrypt like I saw a tweet the other day
that's like let's encrypt is definitely
bending the curve upward on
sell adoption and since there's no cost
associated with it at this point like
you should do SSL and you should
consider donating as well if you're
using it so yeah yeah so I remember like
you used mop back back a while ago right
I really do you still use map that for
crater yeah crater um they're actually
all my stuff's hosted on digital ocean
at the moment use him up using them up
and do you think that's a it was a good
like just developer experience you know
I'll battle for the most part so I'll
say like again if you're not used to
troubleshooting like this this could be
a source of frustration for you um like
I did that that training class back in
mid-february and we try to do digital
ocean with mop and 1.3 and we hit snags
and we spent when I time boxed it to
about five minutes we couldn't get it
fixed him we just moved on and deployed
to like meteor deploy okay yeah so I
mean you know just be prepared to spend
that time troubleshooting and
understanding what's going on like
looking through logs and yeah so that's
the MUP x side but on the digital ocean
side since all your stuffs on digital
ocean right now what's the digital ocean
developer experience for so i guess
that's pretty easy you know i I just I
login press a button and like it its
fins up a box i get a night it drops my
ssh key on there for me yeah kanessa chn
as brutal automatically after that yeah
pretty cool i feel a lot of tutorials
and stuff will be revisited from like
remember doing i remember reading a lot
about deployments months ago when people
were just iterating on their deploy
scripts like month and even ourselves
give me the riser now with the end of
free meteor hosting a lot of people
gonna have to learn these skills right
yeah digital oceans by the best place to
go for a beginner and mop like this
combo is there a good beginner
something like I would I gave it to a
crater cough and I I just straight upset
like don't do this just go go pay
modulus copay galaxy go pay okay someone
else to do this crap right because
chances are if you're trying to build a
real business this is not something that
you necessarily want to spend your time
on right it's not interesting it's not
unique it's not part of your value
proposition um go spend your time
building that for your business don't
don't spend a building necessarily
hosting and I've I you know I say that
it's like do as I say not as I do right
oh but I also enjoy this stuff right so
I i I've had Iran web pulp TV a podcast
for the longest time that was all about
like building and scaling out
infrastructure and I worked for several
companies I worked on words with friends
so I mean this mean this stuff's all
been a passion of mine over the years so
yeah well i guess i would say for anyone
reading this article you really got to
know where like spend your time wisely
like if you're interested in this stuff
i would say read the whole thing i was
interested in it because i didn't know
anything about it but i would still give
my money to modulus or galaxy but it's a
great read I think it's really cool a
lot of knowledge and props are notif
from up X and everything else he does
and props a julian perretta yes yeah
definitely definitely good stuff all
right so uh you know honestly I feel
like we haven't really talked much about
Floyd price but he's uh he's been making
some noise lately and so I was glad to
see this post made it up high enough in
the vote count that it made it on the
show this week cuz I'm still doing that
experiment where we take the top vote it
posts um and so he's been doing some
meteor cast off which has been good oh
really is he wrote this article as well
on being a freelance video developers
print and I know I kind of hooked up
right because obviously like I'm a
freelance meteor developer and I've gone
through some iterations I never did of
HP professionally but uh when I got into
it was rails order to get into backbone
and then it was kind of doing a rails
backbone hybrid started a Belinda
angular I never did angular
professionally then moved into two doing
meteor kind of whoa so you know it kind
of struck a chord with me obviously like
he's been through a lot of iterations as
well he kinda list out the things he's
done rail excuse me rails and dotnet and
Java visual basic and all that stuff and
um I don't know I I think he's spot on
with some of these points like he said
um your clients get freaked out by how
high your productivity cuz it's like you
know you can add full stack like I can
say Wade user accounts and it's like I
just got a bunch of stuff for free oh
yeah you won Twitter support there you
go done um it's kind of funny and he was
talking about how his clients are leery
that like you're moving too fast um and
maybe that's funny I think that that
does drop off at some point yeah what
sharab becomes large enough you've got
enough code to maintain that you slow
down um and if you don't want to slow
down you're right test that's maybe the
missing piece of that that paragraph but
um uh he points out all of a sudden
you're a mobile app shop which I think
though that's probably been the most
surprising part to me and if I look over
the last year and a half the the
majority of my time has been spent
building mobile apps which I would have
never guessed getting a meteor that
would be the case Oh which is been quite
eye-opening um you'll enjoy coding again
I I think for the most part that's
that's true I think frustrating points I
was dealing with the user account system
and the inconsistencies that exist with
kidding um but for the most part yeah
like it's definitely it can be
refreshing to move quickly I don't know
like a cookie code shootings um which is
you know I think at the end of the day
when you're freelance or the thing you
gotta learn to do well as ship ship as
quick as you can in this frequent as you
can because that's gonna help the client
yeah and I've seen a lot of like
reusability come out of freelance work
in meteor like people have multiple
projects so they build some boilerplate
that help bootstrap different client
projects I know okay bro has a little
toolbox of things that they use when
they're doing projects because I guess
you know as as a freelancer or like a
deaf shop like you're getting multiple
types of projects you know frequently
they kind of overlap sometimes or you
have a basic structure that you do
everything in and I think I think it's
interesting I it is interesting to be a
meteor freelancer it is different
because the your full stack which is
which is crazy like two people to think
that oh I have to hire you to do the
design i gotta hire this guy to code the
design and I gotta go find a whole team
in Russia to do everything else and you
can be just a guy from America or
wherever and just be like yeah I'll do
all of it I'll do it pretty fast too I
think that's a testament to meteor once
you get into a big app though that then
you're just you know you've already done
the fast stuff you've already done the
iteration really quickly and I just
grinding new things out and I think
that's I think that's where halts for
sure but you another thing in this
article which was which is funny you
have to explain to people why you don't
miss sequel much even if you really do I
feel like this was at the biggest push
back on people who want to hire meteor
free less developers I thought they
didn't like think Mongo could scale or
all this stuff always or any relational
DB benders better so they don't they're
unsure about meteor I remember you
having a some conflict with the client
of yours because they you know because
you they're your guys are using manga
right and it was going to be right for
that yeah well I maybe maybe when i was
at differential we had that question was
for a lot i could see that but there was
a shift maybe you're almost two years
ago where i noticed more people were
coming because they wanted to use meet
here and not there was less selling on
hey you should try meteor um yeah I
think it's a smart thing for your
business but you're getting a lot more
like we need you to build this meteor
app which I think changes that
particular piece of the story but I'm
starting to notice maybe maybe a trend
towards the decline of like meteor
focused people coming along they're more
just I need an app built um yeah you
know whatever works like we'll go with
what you suggest so I don't know I think
things things are swinging back and
forth i guess it's it's interesting this
is this was a good article you know I've
never stopped to think about these
little differences but they're a good i
guess i have right like I I do a talk on
Y media and I talked about like building
things faster and get encouraged and
that kind of stuff this is long the same
light have you ever had a freelance
project that was like meteor based right
where the maybe the owners of the
project were technical and they had
their own opinions on how to build a
meteor app but they don't know how to
build meteorites hmmm not no no I'm so
I'll say we came close when I was at
differential uh we had max from white
rabbit a bit in Japan and like he was
wanting to hire differential and I feel
like that was maybe the case they're
like they they were building meteor apps
and they wanted to augment their team
and so maybe maybe that would have been
the case but um other than that not
really i find most people are wanting to
build brand new things or they maybe
have a developer that's left and they
need to replace them and so those are
the the majority of leads i get that's
good yeah i mean you kind of position
yourself as like a meteor guru type type
deal so like do you mostly
mediator hi project uh I did you know
it's weird because I had one big project
Freddie here didn't like that kind of
slowed way down and so um the in-between
I started doing a lot of training and
conferences and that kind of thing and
that kind of help help keep the money
flowing in so what had but now I'm back
to doing a lot more media freelancing
stuff cool so yeah I would say though
like the last two clients that have come
in just wants something built and then
I'll care how it's built less a lot less
meteor specific work coming in what I'm
trying to change that as well you know
I've got a code review service I gotta
get the page up for it but you know 450
bucks cheat code review that comes with
the video of me like telling you what's
wrong with the Apple one needs fixed
well what's good with the app and um so
you get a lot of suggestions my dog's
very upset she doesn't like the price
for the coder video I was kidding that's
the sweet point for the very sweet point
I've company I work in the past we got
charged 1.2 k for some nobody to review
our code which I we paid which at the
other day was just footnotes um yeah you
should post semicolon here like oh thank
you thank thank you for all your help
there are a thousand dollars yeah I find
the majority of my code reviews reveal
like clearing security holes um what I'm
like you you pretty much have truck
security holes that we can drive it dump
yeah so you should fix that yeah it's
that actually open example I open up one
more point that I want to say is like
meteor freelancing is not necessarily
client work right it's code review its
teaching its conferences it's so much
more than that and because meteor so
fast it actually allows you to iterate
quickly on a conference for example like
the crater comp which was super awesome
by the way like that's
I was so much more to come out and I
think that's a little bit more thing
with Floyd with talking about more
client work but I feel like your type of
freelancing is more like big picture
type you know meteor you know work Tina
so yeah this is a great article yeah
yeah thanks fluey and I keep up with the
meteor chance that's good yeah those are
really good indeed which is happy react
native o react native meteor faq so this
is written by Spencer Carly and he has a
bunch of blog posts about react native
and meteor and he just wanted I guess
like you know in medium may write blog
posts on medium and I do a lot you get a
bunch of the same questions a lot of
people and they either email you or the
tweet you or they messaged you via skype
or stripe or skype or slack and they're
always ask the same question so I really
appreciate I should do an epic you type
thing on the meteor redux tutorial that
i did but for him he just put all these
questions in one spot and uh they're
actually some good talking points here
i'll go through a couple of them some of
them are just you know i only it's like
no brainer but i'll go through the ones
that i thought were really interesting
so like we at work pop have a native
mobile app and some of these a point
today said are they go the same for the
native app so the first point is make
sure your react native app is pointing
to the correct URL for your meteor act
right and we we we struggle with this a
lot of work pop because we have like
three or four environments so some
people are opening up the test test app
on their phone they're playing with it
then they realize oh crap which which
which server my honor which database is
this and then they have to make sure Leo
am I'm on staging okay am I on the
developer and my might accidentally on
master and I'm actually doing some real
stuff right now so he should make sure
that you always check your URLs a good
thing to do and that's what we did at a
work pop it's not react native but it's
nae
we have we have a little like bar at the
top of our apps let's say switch URL or
switch environment you click it oh you
want to use develop okay click that
button then it will reformat the app so
anybody can do that and I suggest that
for anybody else here's another one
which I think anybody who making like
meteor mobile apps will know is like
when i try to subscribe i get an error
that says invalid state error and it's
because you're not connected yet to the
server like there's not this there's no
DDP connection yet so you're going to
get invalid state error like we'll get
them a bunch in your console and then
you'll get you'll get their actual
connection and this is the biggest this
is the point I wanted to I open up like
in meteor native and mobile land like
these DVP cook clients that people have
like meteor I out iOS is good and you
know maybe the DD pjs that react native
is using is good android EBP sucks and
the biggest problem between all these
things is keeping connection right so
many web our mobile developers are so
used to a rest interface where they open
it up the go grab it some data or
whatever when you're doing it through
web sockets like you can drop connection
at any point right you can drop
connection man are ab drops connection
when you go into elevator like these are
the things that you have to task it they
go into a parking garage and see if
you're dropping connection and all the
stuff that we did and if you don't have
a good DDP client you will drop
connection like no other it'll just drop
on you if you don't have a nice like
interface to handle a graceful
connection loss your users will hate you
because literally they'll try to be
doing something they can it will freeze
and then it was reflow it's like
completely a terrible time so worried
about your connection like yeah you can
understand that you're not connected to
the server yet that's cool but it's not
good enough to just say oh I'm
reconnecting I don't have my connection
you really have to worry about the user
experience of losing connection because
it will happen a lot and guesses from
experience yeah it's funny you bring
that up because I think back to this
time I was working yet
gaslight software their local shop
shopkins tonight we're building rails
apps and was like the first foray into
an iOS client now my dog isn't sure um
and you know they were building it was a
literal bug tracking app they would go
out into the field they were hired by
this this farming company that would
come out do book reviews of your your
farming field and be like yeah you got
corn smut over here and they wanted to
build an app so rather than like having
a pen and paper and a map well they just
wanted to have like have the ipad and be
like here it is you know drop a pin
right there and so it was funny to watch
that like dev psychol because I'd like
write some code mmm get it onto the ipad
and then get up and like walk outside go
like just testing and then walk back in
and like change the code it was pretty
funny um but yeah I find that um that
that's maybe the most painful part of
mobile development is just like getting
that flow correctly and like making sure
you're testing for all those different
edge cases and stuff that's that's true
and specifically with the social
subscription pattern on mobile I
personally do not think it's the right
thing to do is in terms of architecture
it's a personal opinion for native at
least from native and maybe react native
like I've been trying to push that if
you're if you're building mobile mobile
media apps you should do everything
through meteor methods it's it's still
using bdp for your messaging but you're
not having to stream messages over the
connection at all times you it's you
pretty much call and forget get what you
need and you keep going it's similar to
rest if people like rest and mobile
developers usually like the rest pattern
so then the evidence of meteor methods
and they can just call and do all that
stuff but dealing with connection issues
because of subscription because you
expected something to be there and it's
not like those are the worst bugs so
this is beware hey that guy's I'm good
I'm just kind of question like how much
do you really need reactivity and DP and
a mobile app yeah really like are you is
this uber yeah
right I think there's very few use cases
where matters matters but I mean I guess
if it doesn't matter this article's good
for you yeah so then two other points
that I really want to bring up our can
you do hot could push that was a big
question I've gotten from people who
want to use react native and meteor like
do i still get hot cocoa ish because
technically it's compiling into an appt
not JavaScript and yeah there as a as a
Spencer notes that there are like a
couple of third-party places like such
as app hub or code push that allow you
to handle hot code push but it's the
same type of the same type of
limitations that you would have a meteor
Cordova land and Josh you haven't you
have Cordova apps right or and so does
been like yeah how do you push for you
guys like in the Cordova world it mostly
works good we were having some problems
we had to use the lake what was it
called like update on reload or
something like that they've got a packet
meteor has a package that is really
install I once they haven't played with
it in 1.3 so I'm kind of curious what
its gonna look like they're um and I
don't know what kind of hepatitis is
gonna have to move to 1.3 but yeah the
most part I would say they're happy with
what was built um and as a developer I
was pretty happy with it yeah I would
say the things that the trouble I had
really had to do they were like project
specific number silly with it here
itself like uh there's some oddities
around caching mom like the iOS or the
Xcode build it's cached and it doesn't
seem to update parts of it when you tell
it to build so you gotta like go find
all the little instances of the cash and
then my hidden all around your hard
drive so they're not always easy to find
someone like get all the way down into
like your your your user library folder
and you don't even realize those are
there and you got
as a way to UM but I I just I'm
wondering like that's probably a Mexico
thing and not necessarily a meteor thing
oh no that's that's the thing at the end
of the day like you gotta you gotta
start feeling comfortable in Xcode if
you're gonna be building an iOS app
because you're gonna spend a lot of time
there and and some of its like super
confusing you know I don't have this mid
to the house or he's an enterprise
deployments but it's still like even
just getting the build working right or
like we had its certificate expire and
like that was painful as well yeah I
feel like when you build a mobile apps
even if you're using me here yet the
approach like a mobile developer as
opposed to a meteor develop because the
same rules don't really apply you know
like there's much of terrible some do
some don't know one thing that I loved
about this block close and one day a
little bit meteor in general is mini
Mongo and so like there's this mini
Mongo cash that you can use for react
native so you know allows you to use the
same type of data store like that and
one thing our mobile developers are
really missing out on is having a
client-side cat Astrid data but you know
they're managing a lot of stuff in
memory and you know it's essentially
they're like recreating little data
stores but it'd be nice to just have a
standard solution for client data stores
on the mobile devices or non meteor apps
are you know you know this Web I know so
there was some mini Mongo discussions
between Sasha sashko and Pete hunt and
Pete actually implemented a just a
standalone NPM module that implements
mini Mongo on the client so you guys can
check that out if you're in JavaScript
land but check out the the react native
meteor mini Mongo cash and that will
probably help you out in terms of that
client-side datastore and that's pretty
much as a particle there's other points
like Boulder CO lights and such I just
wanted to bring up the points of
connection and making sure you're in the
right the app state is right where you
are because those things transcend react
and not actually I really look at this
article I'll see it as a meteor mobile
development article it just so happens
to use react native a lot of the
principles are very very similar between
react native Cordova and native
development so I think it's just
approaching it as a mobile developer
like get yourself out of the web
mentality again to a mobile mentality
and I think I'll have a really
successful app whether you pick Cordova
or you know phone gap or sorry a
reactive and phonegap whatever yeah yeah
I would agree and if if you go read this
article at the bottom looks like
Spencer's thinking about writing a book
I which was Spencer at differential
smart guy um and so yeah there's a
there's a link there we can get notified
get early access oh that sounds super
interesting a little water meteor books
in the wild yeah I'm what maybe maybe
there was a time when there were a bunch
and then no one wrote it one app for
like those ones yeah yeah yeah i don't
know like writing a book is a really
intense process man i will say like
having tried to have done it and then
like choosing like testings probably the
most terrible thing i could have chosen
cool because like you'd write a chapter
and then like by the time you got done
with the chapter it turns out that
chapter was invalid and everything at
changed and I finally like after the the
fifth iteration of the cucumber chapter
I just kind of you know through the
manuscript up in the air a lot of your
effort I'm done yeah um but yeah no it's
definitely it's a lot of work I prefer
the live training and video myself each
I feel like it's maybe easier to produce
in the long run and writing words but no
I it could be interesting like I to me
um I'm not really looking at meteor
anymore for for mobile I'm actually
looking at feathers now so Oh gonna
start playing with feathers Jess and
react native over the weekend and see
how that pans out be interesting yeah
Jack native man just blowing up think
it's anyone should just learn it just
for you know sake of like your career I
guess just cuz they sweat yeah yeah yeah
like I was watching ken wheeler like I'm
gonna be doing there's actually gonna be
another crater conf happening this year
and it's gonna be focused on mobile so
and react native and I was talking to
Kim wheeler about it and you know like
just go watch his talk and like the
things that they were doing a Walmart to
like build their pharmacy app was super
interesting whoa and you know they were
able to take what they learned from
react and kind of apply it to building
mobile apps so pretty awesome that's
awful yes cool alright guys well show
for this week Thank You hobby for for
being here for the birth I man and as
always modulus thought I oh and digital
ocean calm our sponsors if you need
hosting if you want to go more of the on
the cost-effective side and build your
own structure you can go with its motion
if you want a little more turnkey and
look at modulus two great options yeah
awesome and then as always if you want
to support here a patreon Preon calm /
meteor club and ten bucks will get you
into this space so just like channel and
I'm actually thinking I'm gonna put up a
new target so if we get up to 1500 um a
month in patrons then I'm gonna start a
space dojo like a one to one space dojo
kolkata video series well maybe once a
week but um oh cool yeah yeah I'm kind
of excited to attend so right let me
offer awesome yeah all right we'll see
ya next time I'd say next week but I
don't know who's gonna be here yeah I'll
see you when I see you yeah alright no
me salen tune in next week guys yeah
this video has been in space dojo
production you can click the learn more
button to find out more about us at
space dojo com
or you can click the subscribe button to
