own so we have Diego gone chat with us
welcome hey thanks for having me yeah so
uh this is part of the apprentice series
I'm hoping this one's maybe a little
more successful than the first two I did
we definitely hit significant snags and
I feel like kanima that might have been
boring but uh you know we're we've got
some tightly scoped stuff that we're
going to do so hopefully we'll get some
things accomplished in this this session
this one in particular is for the meteor
podcast website so we're going to be
working on we've got a static design and
we're going to just start chopping it up
a little bit and getting it getting it
working with actual data in the database
so should be interesting here all right
let me share my screen and we'll get
going and if you're not familiar like
this series is really just about number
one I really enjoy pair programming I
think it's great way to learn and so I
think better code comes out of it as
well having another pair of eyes kind of
on the code that your writing is always
helpful and then really just a you know
Diego asking questions and hopefully
learning and forcing me to think about
the code is going to make for better
code in the long run as well so a little
bit of learning about meteor a little
bit of learning about how parenting
works and that kind of thing so Oh get
on with it share my screen so if you
you guys haven't seen it yet this is
what the the new website will look like
we have a nice like this is the most
current episode right here and the
playbar is going to be scoped to the
current episode and then it will have
links to the various places where you
can get it and then at some point I plan
to maybe hire transcription service so
you'll be able to click here and see the
full transcript and that may change we
may tweak that a little bit because
there's a I think there's a few oh look
at that it's already working so when you
click on each episode is changing up top
my biggest thing like the transcriptions
I think they're nice for people to read
but it's also good for a google to kind
of consume a lot of that I see you get
the hose newer older yeah all right so I
think for me this is going to be similar
to building a kind of a blog platform so
let's pull this code down see what
developer has for us to start with or
the designer here 10 let's get a team ox
then I can font bump this for you
you
that readable for you or does it need to
be a little bigger can you make it just
a tad bit bigger yep okay great awesome
resize the window there okay so just
look at what our structure looks like
here so it looks like we've got a client
folder let's get a helpers yes and index
dot HTML and then the layout looks like
we got loading layout a header footer
we've got a main dot style so it's using
stylist and then we've got one in the
views folder we got home coffee and home
HTML ah and then we do have episodes and
a router file and the server we've got
some fixtures and some publications so
let's maybe look at the collections in
the pictures first nice so it's pretty
basic so it looks like she's expecting
title date and description order to make
that work I think a lot of what we're
going to be building is going to be like
a like an admin kind of panel so that we
can input this data right here and then
I'm wondering look here as this thing
power does it work
doesn't actually do anything it looks
like it's just a bar so my goal is to
use simple kfm and they've got a player
already and I did ask them early on kind
of if if their player stretches so I
think we'll probably just replace that
sorry people are being goofy um will
replace that that bar with a simple cash
bar once it's ready to go so we'll we'll
get all that stuff ready for next week
for the bar this week we'll just work on
maybe wiring this up and then the other
thing we'll have to do is actually like
hopefully import what we have now on
podbean like I'd like to spend some time
maybe parsing that RSS feed and getting
that data in here somehow so that we
don't I don't want to move it over by
hand necessarily because we do have like
50 episodes so all right so you do we
have it running locally now got an apt
running so when you were when you're
looking at the collections yeah it
looked like mom or not Mongo but meteor
was in the global scope 0 Mongo is in
the global scope yeah yes it definitely
is um and so if you look at dark
Mediacom meteor is also in the global
scope okay so like if I do an inspect
element here there is you know I can say
whoa it's a lot of stuff going on in the
console yeah I can sit a meteor dot
right and there's a bunch of stuff you
can do here and then
so you can call collection that actually
works still but they did change it
because they want it to be more obvious
that you're actually creating a manga
collection when you do it so they've
renamed the the media collection stuff
is now manga collection and then
actually what we're doing right here is
we're also assigning episodes into the
global name space as well yeah we're not
using the bar keyword right and so that
allows us to do like episodes right here
like anywhere in our code yeah we can do
a find it's going to return a cursor we
could do a fetch and you can see like
these are all the objects from the
database that are being published so
another interesting thing is maybe to
look at our publications and is is this
the standard practice with meteor to
like to not like modularize the code or
like I'm just so so at work we use AMD
and so used to having to like explicitly
set dependencies and and a name modules
which includes like views and you know
collections and models and yeah so I
would say like when it comes to code
that's going to be in both the front and
back end like this is probably the way
that it's usually handled there's no
requiring of dependencies or anything
like that like if you do want to do that
stuff like we can maybe tinker with a
package later and you can you can set
some of that stuff with the packaging
system but yeah like a lot of this is
just getting exposed in the global
namespace ok cool no that's just good to
know he reads ya know awesome cushion um
so right now we'll probably have to
scope this as well because looking at
the design she's purposely creating one
two three four five six oh and I guess
if anyone's curious my designers name is
a
and uh Saffer so um you know she's she's
available for freelance work if you like
her design stuff so she's created
purposely created five of these is that
right one two three four five six six of
these ones active and then we've got
five more on the page so we'll probably
want to restrict our publication to only
return that data down the road because
once we get 50 in here like we don't
want the whole page to scroll when they
click older it would actually then go
fetch more all right so but this is this
is probably good enough for now yeah so
we need a way to input so normally I'd
look at Houston but i actually just
heard about a new package so we'll go to
atmosphere and then ah they're all
called admin that is not super helpful
oh here's this oh okay so this is this
is for a live server that's probably not
what we want maybe well we'll look at
Houston admin will start playing with it
grab that we'll just do a meteor add
Houston admin and basically this is
going to go out to the ISO build server
it's going to say hey I need a package
called Houston colon admin can you get
it for me it's going to download it it
actually goes to so the way meteor works
it goes to my home folder there's a
media
a folder in the root there and you can
see there's a bunch of packages mm-hmm
you can see there's a bunch that I've
got installed and these are all being
pulled in through dependencies and that
kind of thing and then what they do is
they they symlink this in so if i
connect to the local running version
this over here we don't need the one on
the web there anymore pull up the
inspector you can go to the sources tab
here and you can kind of see everything
that's involved in building your meteor
app too so you can see like this is
actually the template being put together
so you can see there's there's really
nothing in this template so if we go
into home the template home here you can
see like this is all the HTML and it's
all been wrapped up in space bars and
similar to handle bars and they apply
the data context and then kind of fill
in the all the pieces into the HTML
using the the data context you give it
so are you familiar with handlebars yeah
and we have all mustache as well what's
up the home coffee file so that's coffee
coffee script it is and we may at some
point I'll probably switch to JavaScript
so i told my designer i liked coffee
script but at this point I probably feel
more comfortable in JavaScript but
anything we write will provide ooh in
JavaScript you can look at that one
client use home coffee but basically
it's just the helpers the events and
then we it looks like we've got a
rendered function in there and so she's
uh she's returning some episodes here oh
I see so she's limiting it to five right
here and
and she's using a session to save off
the spotlight ID so that's what's
actually changing what's in the top bar
there so like when you click on this guy
here you notice it it changes this top
bar and then it also changes this text
right here yeah so turn off my
notifications being a bad pair um what's
happening under the covers you can see
right here touched our body that's
dragging this not the only one here we
go a click episode or touch end episode
right here she's trying to detect if
you're dragging or not and then if
you're not dragging then she prevents
the click handler from running right
here with this line and then she sets
the spotlight ID to be the ID which
would be the it's interesting current
target dot ID huh I wonder Oh says that
the HTML ID tag I think it is yeah it's
uh let's find out so I just put a
debugger there and we'll click this we
can look in the console target that ID
ah she's she's shoving that's that's
clever that's clever if she's having an
ID on to the element so let's look at
current target um yeah nice not bad but
there is another way to get at it so we
can say uh is it trying to be clever so
is that the model ID
yeah yeah that's the Mongo ID basically
so the other thing we can do here like
with an event handler it gets an event
and it also gets a template and so she
might not have known this so let's scoot
past that code let it reload and now
we'll we'll hit it again with my
debugger but this time we've got the t
there so he is our event and then T is
our template and so we can actually say
template data ah I see she's not working
with the data at all yeah I think the
better way to to handle this is to set
the data context so maybe we'll just
spend some time tweaking this a little
bit to be more meteor ish my opinion
because I'm not a huge fan of having
those i beez in the view maybe a better
thing here too is we can start breaking
these out into sub templates as well
mm-hmm get the hero we got the playbar
then here's the episodes so she loops
over the episodes she's already doing
this a little bit and here's where she's
putting in the ID oh yeah why do I did
it prefix with that underscore ah that's
a Mongo thing so if we look at is it is
it because it's a protected property or
attribute I don't know honestly that's
that is definitely a Mongo question that
was probably some kind of decision they
made early on yeah but if we connect so
use robo Mongo Julia yeah easy way to
kind of browse data here um
oops we want to go in the media here
it's in the wrong place so here's like
our episodes collection yeah and you can
see it's got that underscore ID here
that's that's totally a Mongo thing so
but if you're if you do come for like am
on google background the ID might look a
little weird to you because it's just a
string rather than an object ID so
normal Mongo like view if we imported
data straight through Mongo this ID
field would be an object I need and they
do that because it has something to do
with latency compensation and the way
that they do they want to be able to
generate just a string rather than the
object ID and so they you you're able to
generate an ID string client-side if you
need to and pass that on to the server
until the server to create the object
with that ID and in that way when it
comes back like that that object will be
in your mini Mongo and when the server
finishes and it comes back through a
publication it's already in your mini
Mongo so you're kind of getting that it
looks really speedy even though the
server hasn't finished mm-hmm that kind
of makes sense yeah so that that's kind
of what latency compensation is never
heard a super great thorough explanation
on input all right um so to me what we
really want here is something like this
so with space bars this little symbol
here denotes that we want to render
another template so we can go over here
to client views and we'll just make I
usually start a partial with an
underscore so we'll just make an
underscore episode not HTML template nu
equals episode
close our template we can just steal all
this stuff over here what save that and
now our data context should be set for
this template the any other thing that I
think we have to do this guy's probably
going to have to be moved which one the
helper on the bottom left down here I
think that's going to have to be moved
to be part of that the episode template
events so where is really yeah yeah
we're setting the episode class right
here and that's what we're catching the
click on so because we moved it into a
sub template we've got to move the
associated event code into to be owned
by that template so to speak that make
sense um I guess so where would we want
to put that oicc remaking a so views
always have a a paired JS file usually
the events every that hand yeah okay we
that's good to like template episode
events you know oops and it's
it's just JavaScript object here and
we're just passing in it's a string so
each each event map is just a string
here and it says catch the click on any
episode class or catch the touch end on
any episode class so this is probably
similar to backbone the way this works
and we'll just be undo the CoffeeScript
here ugly actually the shoe is saving um
she's got explicit returns in here but
you don't need them with coffee script
huh she was saving to the session to the
user session yes but it's it's may be
different then set the idea of a section
for other frameworks or languages you
can rip this real quick and we can walk
through that as well ok cool semicolons
everywhere but realize why I like
coffeescript see you know what let's
just get this whole thing just going to
keep it coffeescript sorry if that's
gonna be a little weird for you for you
and I can get used to it that's fine
okay it's feel silly
a week a doll that cruft right such as
template episode events well that should
get it working so we'll save this guy
same that guy this guy Oh double check
our functionality still works oops we
broke something can't type type 2
episode wrong here we go I'm Dyslexic ah
there we go so we triggered that guy now
let's see their template look like
template data here we go boom this is
what we wanted right like this makes
more sense to me and so we can call
template data ID whoops underscore ID
you remember where Mongo land and we get
back what we want right and so that to
me is a more meteor shui to work and
what we can do now we can ditch this ID
here and the new ID would actually be
template data underscore ID we use new
ID anywhere ya see
I won't even save this off like let's
just just do it right here and get rid
of a line of code bugger alright so
let's talk about session for a second if
you haven't seen this either like if you
go to docs out meteor com you can just
start typing on the page and it will
like search the docs and then you can
use the keyboard to kind of go up and
down I'll just blend yeah so I can just
type section that set here we can see
what it kind of looks like but
essentially this is a reactive variable
that we can save off and work with and
so in particular were this is global to
the user that is logged in but this
isn't saved in a cookie anywhere so like
coming from rails land a session was Sam
dolphin cookie and that was always
available to you and I'm assuming like
PHP was the same for you well yeah so
like if if you reload this page this so
we click on episode 41 it's changed when
i come back and reload the page like
that session to actually been completely
wiped out because meteors been restarted
in there there are ways like if you want
to save that there are packages uh let's
see it some session amplify here
persistent session this one popping up
but it uses the amplify jas library to
store everything into local storage so
then when you say session set it kind of
looks like it overrides it oh there you
go set persistent or set temp to kind of
do the two different versions there
ah default method so it looks like you
can tell it a default method that you
wanted to use whether it's persistent or
temporary um and in there are good use
cases for that too right like so in
particular the the best use case I've
seen of using persisted sessions would
be like fantasy hub is an app that I
helped build and you build you build a
fantasy team based on salary caps and so
like you're you get fifty thousand
dollar salary cap but you got to pick
eight players and you know the best
players cost you like 20,000 and the
cheapest players cost you like 3,000 so
you it's like a puzzle you want to try
to pick the players that have the best
games and maybe are going to score the
best for you because they're you know
competing against the crappy team and
they're going to score well and maybe
they're a little cheaper so anyway the
idea is like this process of building
your team takes like 10 or 15 minutes
and if the app were to somehow reload
like let's say I deploy a new version
and the hawk code push forces a reload
that's going to be bad for the user
experience so we want to actually just
store each of those button clicks that
they've selected someone into the draft
or they've drafted someone essentially
we save that off into the that ID off
into the session and that goes to local
storage and that way if they reload like
it's just looking to all come back out
of local storage that make sense yeah so
we don't need it but you know that's
just kind of like high level overview of
session and the other thing I would say
is because we move this to a sub
template we do need to use session here
but if this day it oh wasn't being used
out outside of the template that we just
created then you could use reactive are
is another option as well so works just
like session but i scoped to the
template and it it's not global anymore
so the thing you have to worry about
with like this spotlight ID being set is
that you know maybe it doesn't matter
here but you know if you forget to unset
the spotlight ID for some reason then
you know you might get weird behavior so
can't think of a great use case for it
right now but so session is global and
reactive bar is only scope to the
template yeah yeah and they're actually
going to like in an in the next version
that they release it'll be even easier
to get the reactive ours set up for each
template so they're revamping all that
nice yeah all right so we did refactor
that a little bit let's see if there's
any other oddities here got the day
we've got title ok so the description is
truncated that's interesting anything
else in there nope that's about it right
now um alright so katana helpers
so this is maybe another interesting
thing here is with this with featured
she's she's setting the context for this
part of the template to be a one
particular episode and then she's
powering it off this session doc yet
spotlight ID so it's going to rerun any
time this session not set happens this
code right here is going to rerun and
that's what sets the featured episode so
to speak right here so this is probably
worth putting into its own template as
well me human on that not right now so
feel like a client views featured email
template name equals
Oh interesting that's just the is that
just the bar it's been in the episode
title old life title room we're just
like these all right where's that part
ok I'll have to keep looking I would
think that would all be part of featured
latest episode oh here you go featured
area oh she did she did make a uh yeah
okay so this is more of the the playbar
right all right I'm gonna I'm gonna undo
that deal with that later cuz we're
gonna need something else to run that so
we can look at this feature to area I'm
just curious what that looks like
clients views she had multiple templates
in here maybe she does that's a fan of
multiple templates in one HTML file so
we'll do a fuse will just me this
featured so dot HTML and figured episode
and we'll just change the reference to
it like it just reads a little cleaner
alright ever installed at admin did I
this should be fun too because we're
going to import this bar up here but
then we're gonna have to catch his click
and then tell it to play and it'll be
fun I don't know if that's an iframe or
what but alright um so we've got Houston
installed so if you go into the meteor
folder there's a couple files in there
that are interesting one of them as
packages and that tells us all the
packages we have installed mm we see
we're relying on like stylist bootstrap
3 font awesome iron-router this actually
hasn't been updated in awhile collection
helpers user accounts but the
interesting thing is we never explicitly
relied on accounts password your ad
so I prefer to put that in there so it's
a little more obvious that's what we're
relying on but it looks like maybe
Houston rings that along so just create
an account here it's not written it's
not awesome even though it's zero config
yeah haha I don't know like maybe we
shouldn't rely on this maybe we should
just build our own thing I don't know
what are your thoughts yeah I mean I
it's nice if we can get this working i
think but if not then we're going to
have to build it
there we go customizing Houston oh you
know where this might be coming from
actually is they have something in here
right for setting up user accounts
package or maybe their default is
actually what's happening to us mmm I'm
guessing it's the default so let's go
look at user accounts
here we go I'm just going to grab this
here where do they suggest I'll just in
lib I see okay so there are special
folders by the way I don't I didn't
really explain that very well but client
lib public and server these are all
special folders so we're lib its server
only goes the server client only goes to
the client and then anything else goes
to kind of both spots public is where
you how's images and stuff it just
serves those up but then like live will
go to both environments but it'll
actually load first so if we do like
live user accounts config yes asus
sucker in it in for big client account
creation false see that fixes us so
without that you can't create user
accounts right yeah that's an option
again this is actually coming from
meteor accounts password it's part of
their config here so you can forbid
client account creation we can restrict
creation by email domain that's actually
kind of fun maybe we could do that of
course I use gmail everywhere so don't
know maybe that's not so fun
uh yeah okay oops we broke something
because I cargo cult it all that code
don't need these hooks you don't need
this text we can leave it yes what are
the hooks for um looks like they were
for like on log out and on submit oh I
see so like run these other functions
yeah which don't exist yeah yeah they
were not real functions unki and field
lowercase username was that the terminal
that you were looking at just now yeah
this is the meteor tool itself running
okay cool yeah so these functions aren't
defined and then there's some unknown
key yeah I think this is a an air being
thrown at us because of uh add mattress
actually the thing we might want to do
is just go ahead and update is that a
global update like does it up yet all
your packages yeah you can see so like
I've got it here in the command line we
went from 10 to 10 31 yeah so you can
see like all this stuff up here is all
like core meteor stuff yeah and then
down here was all the stuff that got
updated that wasn't core meteor okay so
it's kind of broken up into two things
there so we got a lot of the sea
yeah I don't even think you could need
iron layout anymore i'm pretty sure
that's just a dependency packages kids
don't work now now we're not dying to
Tom I still so sign up for bid hmm that
is not awesome all right did the config
get overridden I don't think so I mean
like by the update and prep for forbid
that's too much too much oh yeah there's
the UA configure we made oh yeah that's
it client nothing server just what we
put in live there ourselves
houston we have a problem yeah oh gosh
there's so much stuff in here
this is all from the core package but
that looks okay did something
collections yeah I really don't know
what's causing that forbidden that's
what wasn't there like a you are like in
the config for Houston wasn't there like
you had to point it somewhere was one of
the things said ah the this root path
from Houston or of Houston from admin no
it seems to be working though um okay
let's look over it again once installed
navigate to admin to set up your admin
account you can either create a new user
to act as houston's I men or upgrade an
existing user into an admin yeah I don't
know I'm starting to think maybe this is
more trouble than it's worth yeah so
does meteor come with like a default um
I guess it doesn't come with like a
default admin page nine okay by default
it comes with insecure and auto publish
which is would allow you to play in the
console with all the data oh no that's
that's been removed from this app
so I was just talking to someone exact
problem is this the slack or I have many
slacks which lack are you asking about
telescope is that the one for the book
discover meteor right ah no this is more
for I mean so microscope is what they
built in the book but say telescope is
like the full-fledged version so that's
what crater runs on so this is all
people that helped work on crater oh
cool yeah so did to fine and at sign in
route I think we've got to make our own
sign on page which kind of sucks client
views lib router is this the main router
yeah you're like sign in earth would be
Simon
your podcast I never are you gonna keep
going or do you need to stop at three no
I need to stop at 3 15 but we can do it
cool we'll just make a sign in template
and I think all we need to do is put a
cue from here maybe is that like a
default form template or yeah it comes
from user accounts it so yeah okay cool
so let's let's see if we can register
yes we're under strict this line so now
we're logged in alright so
not impressive the user accounts it I
feel like it's still missing some stuff
but well we'll keep going with it
alright so we get the signed in so now
maybe it will make all our what the path
will be but we need to make something
where we can like add an episode
essentially and it'll just be a form it
only has three fields right the name the
description length Yeah right now and
then in the next session will probably
add like a simple cast FM URL or
something so then it can pull over that
with all that stuff that we need from
simple cast so are you gonna upload all
your past episodes too simple cast yeah
they've got a tool that I actually do it
for me so that's all probably work on
that this weekend and then the other
thing that we need to do is like they
keep track of your metrics for you which
is one of the reasons why I kind of like
using them and they'll generate an RSS
feed for us as well oh um that's itunes
compliant I mean we could do all that
stuff ourselves but you know they do it
and I feel like they would have better
statistics then I could maybe build out
of the great we could always change it
later i guess um so call it like a depa
sewed I don't know that's a lame name
but we'll start there so
and maybe new makes more sense so that
that path that you have episode new yeah
is that so is it going to look in the
views folder for that template and then
an action I called new or is it like a
new template inside the episode folder
of the views folder uh yeah I would
probably like logically group them
together but templates are just pushed
on to the onto the then I guess the
global namespace so it's just going to
look for a template name new up so it
doesn't like care about the pathing at
all does that make sense like everything
that is in a meteor app just kind of
gets glommed on to the application ok so
this the path name gets converted then
yeah the path name is really just this
path up here like your URL path ok I
don't think I can make that a bigger
story oh is that episode dash New it's
episode / new it's just like what we see
here in the code ok yeah I guess my
question is like what uh where's like
the controller that handles that you
know what you see or what template gets
this this is it iron-router is your
controller so to speak your router is
your controller here so I would say by
default like meteors missing it's uh
controller it's more like an MV stack
and so I think their idea was that
templates would kind of be your
gatekeeper like your template helpers um
ok but in reality like everyone wants
URLs and like the web is shareable so
you need URLs and that's
I router steps in so do client views
yeah and then try to name them similar
okay and when you define a template
inside of the HTML that where you'll say
its name is yeah the file names are
relevant that's more for humans to
consume I've seen a few jerkwads who
don't name things the same and that's
always been very confusing like you'll
you'll see there's a file called
register underscore user and like the
template name inside of it is like
signup user or something like that no
one's maybe oh not so bad because it's
obvious what registered user does but
man there's seen some heinous stuff
before my girlfriend is them hey babe
yes you can say I each other uh I am
pairing with Josh okay that's so cool
thank you for there hahaha right now
you're live on the internet on the
internet is awesome oh my better half
coming home that's true knows that like
all cold and snowy there too or oh yeah
we had to get a guy with a bobcat to
come and help us dig out our parking lot
oh wow things are much taller than
either of us yeah yeah that's not saying
much we're pretty sure yeah you have
your like we couldn't get it up there
you know what I mean like it just yeah
how high would you say like seven feet
18 yeah something that you like throwing
my goodness then it crumbles down anyhow
you're like don't care yeah we usually
don't get that much snow in Boston I
mean like we might get like a storm
that's like
but here there will have like three or
four of those like a winter but this was
life well that's my record I but we had
like four feet in in a week and a half
for two weeks so it's been kind of crazy
yeah and there's more coming right like
Saturday are supposed to get a storm
yeah yeah like a foot this weekend I
think I'm sunday event today maybe yeah
I'm in cincy so you'll get it like
probably half a day to a day after me
it's crazy what I hope Cincinnati is
used to dealing with snow uh we've got
like 80 inches and like that that
stopped everything for a couple of days
but then like none of the kids have gone
to school like the roads are clear but
it's like every morning it's been like
negative five negative 10 degrees so the
kids have been off all week just because
it's apparently too cold to go to school
Wow yeah remember that so got the
template name that matches what you got
in the route cool we're just kind of
boating what we want to form to look
like you like input type equals text you
find that you use labels much please
show you real quick text field what do
we want we want title this is simple
form and you can get similar things if
you use like auto form um but this one
actually builds the the form for you oh
that's cool yeah so we just told it we
wanted a title so it gives you the label
and it gives you the day already and
everything's matched up so we can just
kind of
keep this a so we have so so we got
title date and description so let's do
date we can tell it type equals eight
until you can get like a special text
field set up for date input oh that's
cool so it'll have like a date picker
yeah so html5 has this notion of a date
picker now yeah you can see it right
there it just gives you like I think I
think this is a localized format so like
it because I'm in the US it's going to
be month month date a year year but then
like if you look over here there's
actually a drop-down and so this is that
an html5 date picker hmm I'm so used to
having to use like the jQuery one or I
was just looking at the angular date
picker as part of the UI bootstrap um
library I guess yeah yeah I like just
relying on html5 and the other nice
thing is to like it it'll do a little
bit of validation here to like we can
tell it um required weird true and it'll
it'll put the required element on there
and then it's the last thing we want to
do is get a submit button it
I don't know why when I wrote this I
used underscores which is not media hora
shy should change that us with button
equals and episode should it be a camel
case yeah camel case would be more media
hora Sh so to speak oh nice see that
that's pretty sweet is that part of
blaze no that's my own package that's
quite a small with it simple so simple
form ha and again there's there's an
alternative to that called auto form but
you know the problem i have with auto
form is I don't really like having to
define my like it's interesting because
they force you to find your schema like
in your collection and then they do some
validation as well which is interesting
but then you know you've got a I don't
know like I like the flexibility of just
kind of like not defining my schema and
as I'm building like let it naturally
grow so kind of the idea there but yeah
just uh josh owens colon simple form
cool kind of get the idea but yeah it's
just boating like semantic bootstrap
friendly fields so it's putting the
class form control so i don't know it's
probably it would be a worthy effort to
go back and remove the bootstrap and
like make that configurable like what
gets applied but uh yeah that's kind of
the idea behind it and then we are the
class names that get applied yeah yeah
but I I I don't like that it's just
scope to bootstrap right now tends to be
what I use but like the meteor
communities all over the board in terms
of design kind of
works that they use will make a new
episode ah yes here so manic template
dot totes it so we'll just catch the
submission of the form and we get the
event and the template gets passed along
to us and sort of the bugger here yeah
this is so reminiscent that piece of the
the backbone event hash mmhmm yeah it's
like spot-on I honestly I was talking
about it earlier meteor came with
backbone early on as part of the client
piece so real i think that's that's
maybe why like as they started to grow
their own front end that's where that
came from but so if we just hear you yes
pick a date quick today testing testing
23 now we trigger this event we need an
event that target which is the forum and
the thing I like about simple form is I
added this process form whoops process
form method and it gives you back an
object at the pool created and so we can
just shove that straight into what do
you call it straight into Mongo and so I
wanted something that that would easily
work with the Mongo so you just do
something like a data equals simple form
process form
eat a target do something like episodes
dot insert data and that I'll get you
your episode nice so put a pin in it
right here but we'll just see if it
works oops I forgot to tell it to
prevent default either prevent default
so forms by default only thing yeah they
reload the page right yeah yeah with
with all the the data in the URL there
tries to do a post basically testing 122
sting now when I do oh actually see it
failed because we don't have permissions
that's what we can work all next time oh
so the user so this admin user can't
write the Mongo yeah okay actually we're
not even an admin user we're just a user
but will probably want to put
permissions on it and get that all wired
up as well well that'll be cool to learn
about yeah yeah awesome stuff all right
man well I'll uh I'll hit you up on
email we'll figure out another time to
pick this up and keep working on it
sounds great yeah I'm basically at home
just uh interviewing like crazy and so
I'm pretty flexible yeah awesome yeah
awesome well thanks for your time this
is really cool I learned a lot yeah Bob
you got stuff yeah thanks for being my
second set eyes yeah no worries all
