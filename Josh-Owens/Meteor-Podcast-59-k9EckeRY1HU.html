2015 look at meteor fans i'm your host
josh owens along with my special guest
co-host Dean Radcliffe AKA chicago
grooves welcome back Dean thanks for
being here it's awesome to have you fill
in for I he he had some family stuff
going on today so you filled in at the
last minute that's always awesome bro
Robin alright so this week we actually
have six stories I don't know we'll see
how that goes uh we're going to talk
about ama is on crater desktop apps
rethink DB package kitchen repriced
Heroku a meteor and meteor toys alright
so first up this week is I don't know
maybe this isn't a deep conversation but
I decided that on crater you know I want
to have maybe different content than
what is on meteor forums and one of the
ways I felt things could be
differentiated was having a mas on there
and so when I was out gosh this has been
something I've been thinking about for a
while when i was in san francisco in
February I a sashko if he would do the
first day I mean he said sure and so
like you know I came back it was busy
doing client working and writing blog
posting that kind of thing and didn't
think much of it and then it just
occurred to me like if I don't do
anything then it'll never happen so I
got the first one up sashko is going to
start answering questions may I believe
oh yeah yeah so get in there you know
click go go to the show notes click the
link leave some comments a vote and
downvote the ones that are already there
and he's gonna start going through and
answering all the like top questions so
he's a good time to get in there and
start asking questions and you know i
don't know like he only works on one
part of meteor but i guess he's only one
guy at meteor so you might not be able
to answer all the questions i know
there's like all these like deep what
direction is meteor
going question I don't know how well he
can answer some of those but if you've
got other questions like I would
definitely throw them out there and
what's the format of that it's like a
live chat uh yeah we just queue up the
questions in the thread and then he's
gonna show up probably you know sometime
in the afternoon and he'll start
answering them live you know we'll we'll
say something on Twitter and I'll
probably nail down an actual time that
he's going to start answering questions
and i'll edit the topic and it'll have
your time in there as well yeah yeah so
it'll just be nice because he'll start
answering those and then I'm you know
everyone will get emails as long as you
have the notifications turn on and then
hopefully like conversations will flow
and we'll get some nice long comment
arms going and that kind of thing yeah
that's good is sashko you know
particularly is he just like the most
willing a meteor developer guy to do
this he's certainly the most outspoken
right like I think we've got another
story from Slava so sashko and Slava
seem like the guys that publicly put
their stuff out there the most yeah yeah
kudos to them I love it good I have to
make sure I asked him about a certain
pull request I sent him that I ya know
it's great i mean i know he eated a lot
of work on the windows stuff there's
probably you know new questions on that
and i saw some of the questions in the
thread already and it can only be a good
thing to get the stuff discussed yeah
definitely definitely alright so next up
is the desktop app story tell us about
it Wow well if I was if I was gonna you
know make an application you know line a
business application a lot of the
windows devs are into making wine
business apps that you know will run on
your desktop and even the editor i use
adam is a pretty much a hybrid you know
web-based technologies but you know
running as a native desktop application
so what this is about
um the sea where electron is the name of
the project here that you know you know
this in the same way made at the Cordova
integration help speed the process of
taking your web technology site and you
know deploying it in a need of container
this is electron is doing the same for
for creating a desktop app do you have
that about right that sounds about right
I think maybe the chief difference is
electron as far as I can tell it doesn't
really give you a bunch of native API
access does it mmm I didn't I didn't see
that it did so I don't know what the
answer to that is I don't know how it
overlaps with as it node WebKit the kind
of core technology that Adam is based
around and a couple of my co-workers
have made games recently in that in that
stack I'm not sure that this does I
don't know if it provides need of access
yeah yeah I don't know I'm just kind of
like looking over the docs here I didn't
realize this was from the atom
organization itself awesome oh cool yeah
I guess that makes sense right like Adam
and electron yeah how long till we get
nucleus to do you watch Silicon Valley
mm no no no oh you totally made a
reference there okay that's funny oh
alright um yeah I don't know this is
pretty awesome um yeah it looks I mean
it looks like really it's just a browser
rapper but you know yeah it'll totally
get it there on the machine um I'm
curious someone should like compare
electron with like Mac gap right so my
understanding is Matt gap they're using
mac app for the slack mm app the native
slack app that you can install on your
machine so I wonder if that one maybe
gives you
Oh more API access but I mean browsers
have desktop notifications and stuff too
so you can probably hook into that
pretty easily yeah the number of
technologies that are implemented in the
browser even an even the accelerometer
if you wanted to access the desktop
machines accelerometer you can do that
straight from JavaScript you know with
or without the native API is that's been
the trend is more and more functionality
allowed directly through JavaScript so I
haven't a you know I don't know I don't
do the client stuff that you do
certainly at my current company nobody's
asked me to build a desktop app in a
while but I would keep this in mind if I
if I was gonna build one yeah you know I
wondered her now hmm I wonder if we
could do a crater app that would be fun
oh sure sure yeah maybe get some desktop
notifications going on with that thing
whenever a new story pops yeah and like
this kind of reminds you to of Ruby Coco
they're like hey do you write Ruby all
day you know here's our you know way to
let you write desktop apps with the
language and to an ecosystem you love
yeah yeah awesome all right uh so next
story is on rethink TB so um you know I
think if you if you look up rethink DB
their slogan yeah here you go the open
source database for the real-time web so
I think they they're definitely geared
towards like pushing out real-time data
and seems like you know had this been
out a long time ago maybe it would have
been the first choice for meteor but you
know that that wasn't the case but I
love seeing so the the the impetus for
this conversation is the fact that Slava
took his hack week and worked on rethink
TV support and so he put out a video at
the end of week that showed him getting
kind of the server side stuff going so
he's got publication
working and you can subscribe and data
is flowing across it's an interesting
video to watch did you watch a video by
Jane I've not it's only it's only five
minutes and I got videos under 10
minutes for how easily the absorbed they
are but but no I haven't watched this
one I have looked at rethink DB over
time and you know I think one of the
things that let me hear kind of a
springboard as far as it did in a short
amount of time was was using a instead
of a like concatenated sequel strings
there's query objects like the idea of
the kinds of queries you do is very easy
for a developer to build up these
objects and rethink TB also aligns
philosophically really well with that
yeah but it also has a lot of no
different takes that mango on
consistency and so like my my ops
friends who are still wary about
supporting MongoDB and I know that's
been covered and whether that's a valid
perception or not it's it's it's a
perception yeah deal with but they have
said you know why not rethink TV why not
just start with that so you know the
people that I talked to are intrigued by
rethink DB yeah it definitely intrigues
me right like i don't i don't really
know it's scaling story very well but
i've got to imagine in this day and age
like they're doing a pretty good job
with it i find most people are getting
clusters right nowadays so I you know I
mean I haven't seen any kind of data on
it but they've got aggregations they've
got MapReduce indexing looks like they
even have something similar to what do
you call this the storage grid FS looks
like they've got like multimedia storage
or you can store time series data
there's a lot of interesting things here
and yeah I don't know like I'm excited
to see this I love that Slava's working
on it and it would be awesome if we find
out like
a month from now that this is going to
ship in decor or something and you know
it took him five weeks to get it done
maybe I don't know that would be awesome
well yeah now what about that database
company that meteor bought a while back
I haven't heard much news about that
fellow me betha yeah so I really think
that was an acquire higher personally um
you know Justin if you look at the the
guy that would that have founded that
that's doing the media team he's working
on galaxy so I'm doing the doctor and
the Cooper net a stuff and all that kind
of thing um you know what I'm curious
about and I want to find out i watch
this video and slava like had this
really nice output when he did a meteor
subscribe it was like putting data into
his console but it was like in this
formatted table that looked really
awesome I want to know how he did that
like is that some package he's using or
something who's pretty mm-hmm pretty
prints like some kind of meteor toy that
we uh we don't have yeah all right ah
let's see what else did we say to talk
about Oh pal genright have it yeah the
package kitchen uh I know I now have a
couple of allies with me who are who are
crazy enough to keep trying to you know
use packages as the solution to
everything they're not the solution to
everything but there's a lot that I've
been getting out of playing you know
with you know what what can you package
and how so one of the changes to package
kitchen it previously let you download a
zip file of the scaffold it out package
it now is installable as a package that
you can install a package kitchen into
your application and then that gives you
a route where if you go there and do the
same thing that the public package
kitchen media com site does but if you
do that if you go to that route in your
app and you can save the scaffolding out
package directly to your app
that's interesting and I was thinking
about you know the inspiration for that
probably came from how each velocity
test framework package has a method as
part of the you know base class that you
in a literate based class with funding
there's that you you know base your your
velocity testing package on you can
expose some sample files right and so if
velocity sees you don't have any files
oh here right these files to your
application and so it's it's the
beginning of you know meter so reactive
and you can you know do a little more
developments inside your web application
right velocity means you're not
switching to a command line looking for
green or red text it's right there in
your app and so I wonder how many other
tools will will converge to be
accessible directly in the browser you
know while you're developing your app
yeah definitely um it's kind of
interesting right like I don't I mean
that that idea is very interesting to me
I think the downside here too is uh it
might be more awesome if you could
integrate directly with the command line
tool to right and that makes me a little
sad because it's not very easy to do
right now oh the meteor create command
yeah like meteor you know package
kitchen meteor create package or
something like that right and then you
could take options and spit files out as
well I don't know maybe this is better
who knows yeah I hear you and I did get
some feedback where you know people were
comparing it to two things normal meteor
create Double Dash package mm-hmm which
will you know it doesn't prompt you for
your input like whether you want to use
this framework or that framework it
doesn't really kick start you with a
travesty amo that is all set up and
ready to go so
that when you if you do decide to check
this into its own repo you know that
you'll get you know tests running
automatically so some of that stuff is
what I was hoping to help people with
above and beyond just you know a
standard boilerplate yeah of package jas
yeah yeah yeah I mean that's all very
valid points right like we want to
encourage testing as much as we can and
in our community and that's uh that's a
great idea yeah um you know command-line
stuff for testing packages do you have a
you have an answer to that I've been in
a discussion on the forums about how to
do that uh for testing packages from the
command line yeah yeah I mean you just
issue the one command right it's like
meteor test dash packages and then you
tell it I think what package you want to
test and it'll fire it up a separate
version of meteor like a reactive test
version of meteor that's running those
tests so what you mean yeah yeah there's
there's that tool and then that that one
lets you you know see the results in in
a browser and then there's been some
other development to you know for like
for example your Travis CI it uses a
phantom Jas way of capturing those
results so yeah Aaron Oda wrote some
scripts that I think are probably the
most popular thing to use for testing
and Travis yeah which just fires up
phantom fires up the meteor test
packages and then connects and and just
make sure there's no airs there I think
there's also another starry night so I'm
guessing maybe starry nights gonna have
a way to do that I don't know if it does
already I believe there was some
additions made in the last few days
they're nice and then there's also space
jam as well which will fire your tests
off and I believe it lets you use more
like different testing frameworks than
just a tiny test tiny test or
well obviously like Mike's got mocha
working as well too uh he does em unit
tests so I don't know if there's any
yeah so all those are part of the
options yeah yeah yeah it just again
like it makes me sad that the way that
we have to hook into the command line is
by releasing our own NPM package rather
than being able to hook into them the
meteor command-line tool yea though
probably didn't ask sashko about me ama
right there we go that'll be my question
when when can we get command line
support all right uh Heroku and meteor
like this this one hit me out of nowhere
like I actually had someone email me
they're like oh my god quite ! and I
clicked on the link and sure enough
there is experimental Heroku lab support
for session affinity and they're doing
their session affinity via cookies and
so their router will drop a cookie on to
the session and then every time it's
coming back through with another request
it will look at that cookie and route it
to the to the right spot right and so
that means that you're gonna connect
back to the same meteor instance app
instance that you are connected to you
before and that's important for the
state fulness of your connection okay so
this was the key thing that that Heroku
had to offer to make it a practical to
work with meteor correct yes alright so
great announcement right like oh we're
so we're so pleased up here and then you
kind of go there and you look and
they've changed or they're getting ready
to change their entire pricing to your
model and you won't be able to run your
first I know free for a whole month you
can only run it for you for half a month
mmm okay so effectively if you're going
to production you're gonna have to pay
them money
um which I think means like you know
it's it's on par with modulus I think so
I don't know seems like one of those
things they could edged modulus on a
little bit but now they're gonna kind of
be the same so really you got to look at
other factors when you're comparing the
two now you gotta look at like support
and um you know you've got the fact that
modulus can auto scale and stuff like
that so i don't know i think modulus
still has a pretty big edge here for
made your hosting myself Molly they've
been doing it the longest and you
certainly a larger is it true that a
larger well that a modulus doesn't only
do meteor hosting is that right know
that yeah they started as a node host I
wasn't oh okay yeah and so I think you
know the last time I heard something it
was some somewhere around fifteen
percent of their installed or like app
base was meteor so I mean it's it's
pretty sizable considering um but you
know this certainly not the biggest
thing they host not the biggest thing
but ever they're probably you know
fifteen percent is probably a lot larger
than the you know pretty sure of Heroku
that's certainly as far as being on
meteor Heroku I discovered during the
rails days I imagine that's what a lot
of their clientele is yeah and and
they're a big enough company that they
can probably coexist with a couple of
different technologies so it's a
question of you know are you if you're
familiar with Heroku this is good news
for you that you can use your familiar
environment and and still play with
meteor there but if you're not a if
you're if you're into you know kind of
the most media hora coast they had no
it'll take some time for them to prove
whether they are yeah you know I said
maybe they're not like the best option
but it just occurred to me with the
build pack I was talking to someone
yesterday and they're they're building a
site that relies on ffmpeg to encode
audio files
and they were talking about maybe using
digital ocean and we started talking
about Heroku and someone's like oh hey
you can do a custom built pack on a real
coup and I'm like that's totally right
like meteor support itself is a custom
build pack and so what that means is
like every time you do a git push it
runs your build pack which is
essentially just a fancy setup ash
scripts that it runs and installs what
you need installed and so you could
totally go for Kai I think the current
working one is the horse build pack
because they said why not horse all the
other ones were named meteor so I just
stand out somehow but you can you can
fork that and like add the ffmpeg build
into the process and get a compiled
version there that you can then you know
shell out to and run your ffmpeg
commands and all that kind of stuff and
I don't know that you could do that as
easily with modulus so maybe there is a
little little upside there yeah yeah you
definitely need supporting utilities and
you're going to get them through a build
pack or that sounds like the kind of
thing that a team might use a docker
file for am i right like to install
something to the OS as part of the
dependencies yeah you could you could
but obviously not on Heroku or modulus
right if you're on digital ocean or
something you could do docker yeah yeah
there's a lot of dev ops ii the
landscape is pretty broad right now I'm
still trying to figure out what the heck
of Cooper Nettie's is as well yeah you
know I don't know we should we should
have someone on here to talk about that
at some point yeah all right so the last
thing I just wanted to mention like
kudos to max Davin um he actually will
be on the meteor club podcast that will
come out this Wednesday we we
interviewed him on Wednesday and we
actually had another episode in front of
his but we're gonna jockey them around
and get it out this wednesday so it's a
little fresher but he talks about meteor
toys what it is how it came about and
all that kind of stuff but he just
launched paid versions in the meteor
toys and
I think they're they're pretty amazing
so I mean I'm sure everyone's seen
jetsetter a Mongol but basically the the
pro versions take it a little further a
little extra features in those two
packages and then you can also get what
he's calling the seven orbs and they're
just like these little circles that like
dot you that you know the top of your
screen and they do different things and
so you can actually watch the like the
the data flowing back and forth if you
turn it on that's one of them you can
impersonate people there's just all
kinds of Ling great little tools in
there that I think most people
eventually go and build on their own so
it's like yeah it's kind of nice that
they're they're out there um and you
know I'm curious he also built a pretty
awesome looking website it's got like a
guy standing next to a meter flag like
an astronaut and as your mouse moves he
kind of watches it when it's in the top
half of this haha kind of fun little
animation there um yes so what's uh
let's see it's ninety nine dollars to
get the whole thing um I thought maybe
he didn't um Oh interesting he's writing
an e-book on using Mongol and production
um reduction I was picturing these as
debug only card debug only but you know
the interesting thing is obvi was on the
podcast as well and he was asking like
is there a way we could just limit this
to be like an admin only tool i got
flagged people as admins and then they
can hit the keyboard command and bring
up on goal or something and they were
specifically talking about their support
people like you know they've they've
already built an impersonation tool but
if they could jettison that code and
just rely on this one and and secure it
then you know that's that's to me that's
always a win less code that you're yeah
kind of maintaining yeah impersonation
is one of those things that you
certainly don't usually find in
you know the hello world bill you know
like discover meteor necessarily mesh is
not a core concept but in terms of
supporting an application and production
that's used by other people everyone
like you said ends up building some kind
of way to do that because yeah because
you get a support request and they're
like well some of my accounts messed up
and then you're like I don't know like I
just push through the database or
something like that sounds terrible can
you send me your password so i can log
in as you yeah that's this yeah that's
pretty bad as well not the way you do at
these days yeah yeah so again like kudos
to max so happy he got that launched and
you know I don't know I don't know how
pay packages are going to work out but I
certainly think that the bar has been
set particularly high here um you know
someone else is going to come along and
do some kind of pro package you got to
pay for this this feels like I don't
know meteor level quality right like MTG
level quality uh because it feels like
it makes the developer experience better
which is something that me tira cares a
lot about and yeah yeah I don't know
kudos thing yeah kudos $99 if you're in
meteor day all day is is not a
prohibitive kind of price point either
yeah definitely agree with that so I
don't know hopefully good things come of
it good so you said that he's gonna be
on a podcast with you wednesday yeah
it'll come out wednesday come on one
thing okay great we already recorded it
yeah you know and i don't know like i
would i would love to hear listeners and
viewers opinions they should tweet at
meteor podcast and let me know i'm
thinking about changing the name of this
show and calling it the crater podcast
mmm because there's a little there's a
little confusion some people are getting
confused about having like meteor
podcast a meteor club podcast because
they both say meteor and they both said
podcast so it's not easy to
differentiate and I feel like I mean
this is all about weekly news and what
happening and that one's more about like
opinions or I don't know like
discussions and that kind of thing so
yeah yeah I like it you know but I first
you have to help me understand why do
meteors always land in craters I mean of
all the places they could fall there's
all it's just they make the crater right
oh nice yeah I like crater podcasts yeah
we'll see we'll see well well vote with
your tweet right so just tweet at meteor
podcast and let me know if you think we
should do something else or if you like
the idea of crater podcast uh let me
know and we'll figure it out so cool all
right by day Josh next yeah again yeah
alright thanks for tuning in guys we'll
see you next week this video has been a
meteor club production you can find out
