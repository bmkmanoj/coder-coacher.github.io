of October welcome to the October media
club Q&amp;amp;A session I invited aaron oda to
join me and I thought we could answer
some questions about meteor and what
people are dealing with and you know
just generally anything they have
questions on you know we'll take them
will answer them the best we can I
thought this would be a really fun one
because I've a feeling in the next
couple days we might see meteor one
point 0 given how the release candidate
sir are coming out now so ah look at
that Stefan whorehouses here hopefully I
said that right all right so uh why
don't we start with what you do and I'm
sure everyone knows but let's just do it
anyway hey so i'm working at meteor hex
I'm crying basically i'm running
projects not a purpose of projects
including VTO up and some of the other
class friend like that and i'm also
working with the project goal of the
reddit i also perform on 1
1,000,000,000,000 solid shampoo media so
you just need to plug in to lock up I
can you do a application then it will
show up the morale problems in your
application so yeah I working with two
other guys and the ambition colombo sri
lanka so that's that's it nice yeah all
right and so people don't know me I I do
freelance meteor work I also run the
meteor club I run crater I do the media
podcast seems like I'm forgetting some
stuff i started doing training classes
now meteor jas club / learn if you're
interested it's it's more of a
beginner's class walks you through some
stuff there
all right looks like we got some more
people here so we'll Mitchell from I met
him in person last week at the keys from
I don't know if he's from Raleigh maybe
he's in raleigh looks like we've got
Mike barkas from Charlotte as well so
welcome guys if you have any questions
feel free to just post them in the the
question app or I think on the page i'll
kind of be watching the page for updates
as well if people have questions and
we'll try to answer them here live
there's going to be a little bit of a
lag time so just to get started I'm kind
of curious like what what's the biggest
app you've seen since you're running
Khedira like what what kind of scalable
sights high scale look sites have you
seen okay I see and I have seen couple
of web so running more than now 50 / 26
service so one that means you have to
see so one appreciates a rod pops oh yes
that is still enough meda and actually
they are running a couple of servers and
I and plus crappy something else and
another one and there's another one from
the UK I don't even be a playa and then
yeah terribly kind like get a B&amp;amp;B to the
UK so there's a guys like that so me
actually yeah basically Muslim mostly in
there are only absolute couple of
service like mom or two prior to six
like i have seen mostly but i am I
haven't seen any a bit like 20 rows of
twenty20 servers maybe more than 50 is I
am at sea yeah yeah I remember a long
time ago I worked on the words with
friends project way back in the day and
it was on Rails and they had something
like 24 app servers and
I had a bunch of memcache database
servers with READ&amp;amp;WRITE slaves and it
was kind of crazy but it's also in here
people are getting to the point where
they have five or six kind of app
servers running their their
infrastructure I think it right now my
main contract is meeting hero and I
think they're running off for app
servers right now so seems about in line
with you know what it would take to run
production meeting heater needy he
really is online notice also post a
platform I mean AWS 0 on modular so uh
they're on amazon web services okay yeah
okay they're actually on Tom Tom and zol
run it there on what do they call it
it's not galaxy but they've got another
funny name for it they've got their own
little cloud that they run okay for
percolate clients all right yeah all
right so check the chat here and see if
we get any more questions I think that
makes me sad I really uh oh here we go I
want to know how we can join collections
in meteor you want to take this one uh
yeah I think I have enough experience
working with the towing collection but
the thing is that a lot of solutions out
there but Mr complete this actually
everyone is having issues actually he
can build a real working of product
actually the reason is it is protocol
and everything so so that's the thing so
we need to have something from the vta
cool Oh specifically meal for the day so
you can try hard to model with the
Emperor documents so it's but still we
need to be cautious about that so so
it's not a answer that I can say
lead so we lose this package and like
that and there's a would you stop
discussion happening on the Khedira hub
and there's a headband as well so i
think i can share some it's all the
links okay sounds good yeah and so my
response to that would also be number
one you can just return an array from
any publication and theoretically that's
a joint and so i think what most people
are asking for when they talk about
joins is they want a reactive join and
that's what it gets a little bit tougher
so um what what ends up happening is
let's say i do a find and grab i don't
know a meeting right and we'll use kind
of a meeting here oh esque description
here so i'll grab a meeting and then i
want to grab all the members that are in
that meeting and i want to publish all
those members as well that are in the
meeting and and then maybe i want to
publish the presence of whether they're
actually online for that meeting or not
maybe that's stored somewhere else and
so step one is you do a meeting dot find
and you'll you'll find your first
meeting and but then you need to inspect
that meeting and then you're going to do
like you know meteor users defined and
you're going to maybe grab a bunch of
user IDs that were stored in the meeting
right and so then from there you'll do a
meteor that users defined you'll hand it
an array and you'll get back all your
your meteor user users from the
collection and and so then you have the
meeting and then you have your users you
return those an array everything's great
until you add someone else to the
meeting and what happens is in the back
end you don't get an update so that
second query where you did meteor dot
users dot find and you gave it an array
it immediately never knows that that
array has changed and therefore it
doesn't actually rerun that code and so
you'll never get new user data coming in
so the meeting itself
we'll update and you'll get that pushed
down but then you'll never get new user
records push down the pipe properly and
so what you have to do is you'll have
like an observed change running on the
meeting and when you see that you'll
have to grab the ids and you'll have to
rerun all that that fine code and the
observed change and so that's I mean it
it's it gets pretty complicated
especially when you start joining you
know more than one collection in so
that's a that's kind of the gist of it
there are plugins out there to help you
but our packages i guess but i don't
know that they're you know you got to
look at each one and kind of understand
what they're doing under the covers and
make sure that it fits what you're
working on so all right get another one
here interested to hear any thoughts
that you guys have regarding the best
approach for combining ionic with meteor
I've actually used ionic have you used
iono kettle no I had I would not have
all right so I don't even even know what
that is framework it's like a competitor
to famous maybe front-end framework
hybrid apps angular yeah I have no idea
I know uh gosh there's so many of these
popping up now so you've got I think you
definitely have famous and then you have
ionic and then you've got another one
that Google put out to sort of the P
polymer yeah that's it yeah um and I
know people are starting to dabble in it
but I really have no idea best approach
for combining that i would say find
other people that are interested and try
to start like a mailing list or
something and get conversations going
like I I don't know that would be my
approach for getting something off the
ground
all right ah there's another one from
the far and sorry I hope I said that
right mongodb doesn't support
transactions is there anything we could
do in media to cancel a group DB
operation if any of these operations
fail Oh No so I mean that that are not
mere equation do that so normally when
woody be advised us to do use a one
document and they embedded okie much to
so then so one rocking one update is
atomic so we can have some like some
kind of rough transaction but
unfortunately it's not gonna work with
media because you know umbra dokey money
is not good as as it is we can use to
get mono and there are some pattern to
do like two pigs who pays commission
like that choosing the mongodb but there
is no direct way to do that with meteor
yet so you need to all out your way to
do that and there's a documentation on
the MongoDB documentation sign so you
can follow that yeah so I guess you just
have to write your own kind of cord
around that yeah mitting to the database
and enroll it back yourself sucks I'm
not sure that's the so happy I've heard
about the here DB package I oh yeah we
have heard of purity be actually I'm not
sure might be that that might have some
some kind of support for the transaction
i'm not sure i'm looking at the raid me
no no no it's not yes no yeah just
triggers though that's interesting
perhaps that's really hard to do
transaction on the altar server with
multiple service so the only base please
use the new phase comets have you used
this pierre de Piero no no okay yeah I
was kind of curious so I sort of looking
at this the other day and I didn't
really understand so is this actually
like do you run an actual separate
database server like a peer DB database
server or is this just something that
sits on top of mongo itself yeah I think
it's a collection of like collection
tools in post kima and the collection
line so it's a combination of couple of
packages yeah I don't really try to move
that one out here it's interesting yeah
so yeah it talks about some related
packages here trying to look around my
mic here my screen actually I hadn't
heard of media related well there you go
publish with reactive dependencies are
related queries so media related it's
one of those packages all right we got
another question here so what's been
your approach to modeling data between
collections
all right first time I try to embed it
if that's possible so that means a let's
say so i'm i'm working on a course so
it's like a cone economy so then the
salons in you need to get all the status
of the he's collected his courses what
else cause like that so then I I have a
chance to embed all the all the
information in this single document
because I need that one so if situation
like that I can amble to document inside
then I can get but so if the documents
are going to large light let's say no
post or I and comments then I so you
definitely need to go for a multiple
collections so then again reactive Joe
is coming I'm seeing maybe sometimes but
normally we can work without react
rejoins that's at some point then yeah
after that we need to go for that yeah
then that's a good point to like just
because you need to get data doesn't
mean it needs to be reactive so when I
look back at a fantasy hub we we did a
thing we have a couple publications that
join like a ton of data and one of them
is like you have to fetch the the
fundraiser and then you have to fetch
the users in the fundraiser and then you
need to fetch like all the players that
could possibly be selected for a draft
so it's fantasy sports and you know
perhaps the fundraiser and the users
might need to be reactive but the
players in a draft don't have to be
reactive because you always gonna have
the same set of players it's not like
they're they're bringing new players
into the game you know the football game
or something week to week you know it
changes a little bit but in the probably
20 minutes are gonna have the window
open there's not going to be a change
and if there is a change like they're
they're probably going to hear about it
or you can write something to email them
and say like hey you're your players you
selected just got injured or something
you know so like it's not always the
case that you need one hundred percent
reactivity for every query that you do
so it's probably good to think about
that up front the use case and how that
works and that kind of thing yeah okay
and then another thing is it if we try
to do the our database exactly as the
SQL so then then only we need to go for
the directive joints so we can this let
me think about other others coalition to
Nashville other possible way should go
things hmm yeah all right good question
hopefully we'll get some more here in a
second so with 10 coming out all i'll
just ask you like what's the most
frustrating thing that you've had to
deal with so far with me dear i'll do
that a lot of things i think recently
the problem is the quad code wheeler
time because now it's really really hard
to do like looking me there so there's a
lot of time and then we are trying to
get it something file then if they will
not open to reload the page and for the
problems there are some yeah i think
maybe we can have some some kind of more
data base level optimization I think it
will be really good because now it's
really hard to Intel not a document it
meteor so I think I wish there is more
more like nope performace doing like
that maybe yeah so are you talking about
like up log and inserting too many two
minutes into the database not up look I
mean so one thing is so when you are
having so so normally so
if you insert not on document Suzanne
mongodb neither upload it will normally
come to them mongodb saloons sorry to
the media application there could be
used to prevent that at the same time so
when we are inserting a lot of document
from the manga you care to the mongo so
there's some kind of overhead trees are
happening so so I really cannot say it
is a problem of meteor because our house
PL time works with media because MongoDB
is not a real-time database so you need
to do some things so I wished that a
couple of works here before 1.0 but
still what was you know is coming is
really nice to have I have that one yeah
right so I think we have a transaction
package yes see that I'm pulling up
right now well uh settings from is from
Brent undo/redo stack based on
transactions so it looks like it gives
you exposes an object called TX which
has all the methods you need to get an
undo redo stack going yeah and so you
can say TX insert until it you want it
to be on the posts namespace and then
give it the the info that you wanted to
insert or same thing with update and you
you essentially kind of get a rollback
so it looks like you can probably pass
it looks like you're passing an object
into it and so I wonder if there's
something okay so there's like a nun
doing a redo oh and starting to commit
okay that makes sense yeah so you just
say TxDOT's start and give it like an ID
or a handle or a name or some
and then run your TX queries and then at
the end you just say TX commit just
pretty slick so that it's just called
transactions on atmosphere so Randy a
friend I guess thing thanks for that my
back one classroom I think here this
application is he's using for the stand
bench so I think he's using the
transaction but it record for the the
application stand back stand bench I
think it's a kind of some related of
course materials I think he might need
some kind of transaction then he built
something like so it is anything is
there a way to share the links the
chapter where do you know any place I
think we just if we put it on the maybe
the Google+ page yeah I really wish we
okay add the other way so I'm just
pasted in there all right here we go get
some new ones from Stefan do you think
tap i 18 n will go the same route as
iron-router and become the de facto
solution for everything localization
related to use tap i18n no i haven't you
use much localization stuff i use a
simple package go simple I 18 or
something similar I haven't used tap I
ETA yet hmm
yeah I haven't either so I'm actually
having created accounts entry uh there's
accounts t9 end now and the problem is
the core team didn't do a great job of
exposing clean Ayers and they just
expose English error messages when
something bad happens in n log in and
that kind of stuff and whoa so what
someone did is wrapped up all those
error messages and provided a
translation interface and I don't think
it uses tap i 18 n I think it's doing
something else to handle the
translations but then there's a bunch of
translation file so you know i don't i
don't know like this is perhaps less of
a name like routing itself is a core
need whereas i'm not sure
internationalization is still a big need
but i'm not sure necessarily a core need
oh my thinking i think is that um you
know become a de facto solution the
better they do at documentation and the
better they do it keeping clean releases
and that kind of stuff like that that's
going to keep driving people back to it
and so yeah I guess there's that and
then starts to segue into the second
question which is me that core
components such as routing excuse me
aren't not part of the core team I'm
worried what happens if Chris falls in
love with polymer where would that leave
the state of the router and I tend to
agree with this yes this has me worried
to some degree may be less worried I
actually feel bad for Chris Mathur and
to some degree tom coleman as well both
trying to run this large project that's
pretty much an I'd bet ninety percent of
the meteor apps and you know my concern
is how much time of his is it taking it
to run this open-source project
and as someone who's trying to run a
business that's that's got to be really
really tough to kind of balance the two
on a project so large you know I'm sure
you understand to internet like running
several open source packages and also
having kind of a commercial venture that
you're trying to get off the ground yeah
it's yeah it's kind of like that this
sometime the that package is a lot help
us this will be because you can get the
traction like that but still a lot of
work to do because in a box comes so you
need to fix that because there are
plenty of people using the pack a then
need to make a fix and yeah that's
that's something you need to do is not a
work yeah and the other problem I think
that's tough is that even if someone
provides you with a fixed in a solution
that doesn't mean they're using like
every piece of iron router and their fix
may break something else and so like if
I iron-router doesn't have a great test
suite and you don't you know hand test
all the different features you may be
accepting liability from a pull request
into your ear package and that's always
tough as well so yeah accepting well who
request is a really tough job because
you need to go to everything even the
greatest works so still there could be
issues so you have to be a little more
cautious about those yeah yeah so even
if yeah that's a good point even if you
have unit tests that doesn't mean you
have like great coverage or you know
that that one corner case maybe even
with a hundred percent coverage like
they're still probably the ability for a
corner case to slip in and you know you
end up shipping a bug and didn't even
know it I know like I've been holding
off on releasing accounts entry because
I haven't had time to sit down and test
and prove that everything that I've
accepted is working and so like there's
code just sitting out there in master
that hasn't been
published atmosphere so left ill will
Rick Rick will request are really good
because it that really had a health
trust with us without who request so
there won't be beat out in the community
and like them yes really important but
actually you need to be so careful about
that yeah no I agree like polar cuesta
definitely like it's probably less time
for me to sit down and go through and
just test that account century works
then it would be to actually track down
a bug and fix it in the code so there's
still a huge benefit I would agree with
that alright so let's take some of these
other questions let's see Mike he was
first I have a couple years experience
as a developer using the lamp stack I
recently started learning meteor can you
recommend best practices or references
for someone with little experience to
learn media and the technologies behind
it such as blaze depp's etc you have any
suggestions I think we have something
coming up for the production like for
the like scaling performance line so
we'll be having something sunnah for
that one but we don't have much content
for the blaze and apps I think there
will be some content from the media
manual I think it will be releasing that
the medium animal lighting maybe on the
media day so there will not content on
me either yeah I think I may be meeting
in action book or something I'm not sure
about the places may be suffering can
chime in with the meteor in action book
help people learn blaze and depths etc
since he's listening the other thing I
would suggest is looking at javascript
is sexy calm now there's a great post
there that really walks walks through a
ton of meteor stuff and you know it it's
a 20 to 25 minute read and it's
definitely worth it in my opinion
yes and then of course like discover
meteor does a great job I'm sure media
in action will probably highlight some
of this stuff as well there's a guy
who's got a book called Pro meteor do
you talk about that in your book I'm
sorry your book you've got a prior book
don't you a problem with you and the
other one is easy it's more about mobile
media interest so this media explain so
we are trying to focus on how actually
the cables and the internet and we are
trying to release something new I think
maybe after two three weeks from now so
it's basically how to run a production
with the application nice a second we
are covering the oldest top like how to
do not about the place and eps knowledge
develop how do you tell a strap how do
you feel for the performance how do you
do database designing schema modeling
and like that basically stuff so we are
trying to go like like example based
approach so you have a triple and then
you're working on that repo as the most
progress like that nice and so is that
the meteor bullets then yeah it's so we
have renamed that can do something else
so it's a it's a bad thing okay all
right awesome and is there going to be
free or paid or yeah then there are two
version actually so you'll be much never
enough content to the free and there
will be in virgin ass word nice okay and
so uh looks like Stefan charmed in here
and said absolutely a meteor action will
be super helpful they're just putting
the finishing touches on chapter four I
commend them writing a book is very hard
you can check out the code samples and
already see what you will learn and he
links to and the questions here to his
github account it's like
why a you H is his github user name and
it's ch 04 dash working with data is the
link and you'll see that here in a
second if you're watching the video and
see the question the answer is popping
up maybe um yeah okay so we will move on
we've got quite a few questions here to
get through now um Wow their shift
around on me okay so I think Jordan was
first so we'll take his do you know of
any large ish production meteor apps for
the full test suite running does anyone
do TDD meteor development do you Aaron
Oda we write some of the tests for the
apps but not not not much like because
ya know actually middle lot of tests for
the package is for not for the f okay so
are you guys like are you guys using
something else no you use like a for the
some other projects but for the Khedira
we don't use like a because we try to do
it manually right now okay interesting
yeah single but you have to do that yeah
I would say this question will be
answered very differently I think in
like a month from now than it is right I
guess velocity unfortunately like I sent
an email to people that it purchased my
book but I'll just say it here again
publicly uh with the 09 change that
really kind of screwed the progress that
velocity was making at the time and um
basically when you did meat-eater add
you know san jo jasmine or meteor add
mike mocha those were sitting out there
and would become part of your production
bundle which obviously is not great I
mean it's if you're careful it wasn't
horrible but I mean no one wants extra
code just sitting out there
extended their production application
and especially code that you know may if
it picked up and ran tests that that
could be bad too because then it's
actually going to be trying to spin up
an extra application and run some code
and I know it just just seemed weird and
so with 09 for coming out they added
that debug only flag which in somewhat
misappropriated in the title but
basically it sets your package to be a
week dependency doesn't expose anything
into the global namespace and then it
doesn't bundle that into production and
so what has happened over the last two
weeks is you'll notice there's a lot of
velocity shim activity and some other
packages have changed as well and what's
what's happening is we need to pick up
those debug only flags and inject all
that code into the test environment so
that these these packages continue to
run and I think like in the next couple
days everything's going to be kind of
functioning together and so the testing
landscape will drastically change and
we'll be back to to come to where we
were and the other exciting thing is to
like the HTML reporter got a complete
facelift so that's that's going to be
pretty awesome as well yeah I think
audio ins are looking on the particular
limb most of the work right what was
that so only heads yes yeah from London
yeah he runs the the meteor meet up in
London and he's I don't know like he's
he's got a pretty good eye for design
and he brought up a lot of good points
that people didn't even think about like
I guess his dad's red-green colorblind
and says like the red and green dot
aren't very good because if someone's
colorblind they're not going to know if
their tests are passing her failing
they'll just see brown and so like he's
he's been working on adding a lot more
feedback that's not just color based so
good stuff
alright uh so we'll take this other one
that was just up there if / when will we
get a standard directory configuration
for meteor who would have to drive that
to make it happen so I would say like as
a guy who's blogged about this I don't
think we'll ever see a standard come out
I think we're where we've already seen
anything that's close to a standard
there's things that are documented
there's a couple paragraphs at the top
of the meteor docs that are pretty good
and they talk about how they treat
certain folders and other than that you
know I don't think we're gonna see a
whole lot more and so you know my
biggest thing that I always say is
document how you've configured things
like writer write an actual read me and
say here's how the app is structured and
here's how you should kind of follow it
and just have some simple rules and try
to make the rules easy enough that
people don't have to think too hard on
how to find you know a JavaScript file
or HTML template or something like that
my father and in the next room the
originating 1.1 or something similar so
there will be a special backup
controlfile so then he can soon we
cannot make it lower dear our own pile
loadings structure so we can configure
how the eyes are going to load it was so
this file roads were still alive right
now if you need to load some file you
need to fix them with 01 like like that
so it's with the alphabetical order so
with the control file we can change the
order as we need so I'm not exactly sure
how that's going to work but there will
be a project there'll be somewhere to do
that yeah and so I always heard that was
going to be part of 10 but I guess
timewise yeah or funding wise perhaps
but yeah so I
in again like I would say refer back to
the docks and we threw those couple
paragraphs because they talk about
special instances I you know lib
automatically gets loaded first and then
even within lib everything's
alphabetical so like Arenado mentioned
you can you know put a 0 or a 1 or a 2
in front of everything those will get
bumped to the top and and so you can get
actually kind of fine-grained with in
there if you need to if you have load
ordering issues but it's very rare that
I've had go that deep with that stuff
usually throwing in the libs just okay
enough all right um have you used the
mean stack at all air nada yeah I think
before media I work is not lots of the
time okay so you have any advice for
developers coming from the mean stack I
haven't use angular but I think in the
music we have mean works is you're
having the attached based communication
between this so when the clan so no man
exposing the api's so when it come to me
do things going to be chained because
now we are talking about it turns and
publications so then you need to think
like that so first you need to learn
about how Nathan then publication of
works so then model your application
based on that so I think you need to
forget some things in that you will
learn from them means that when you're
coming into video I think the please
call me to your book and Anna other
books are kind I'm going to this cycle
house how have you can train your
mindset around building with each
specific applications so there's the
funds first thing to do try to thinking
application based on these subscriptions
and the interest like that
awesome yeah I would say like the pub
sub is definitely the heart and soul of
meteor and then that's definitely where
you're gonna I think have problems first
when you have them and performance
issues and that kind of stuff like that
or security leaks or any of that stuff
like definitely think about the pub sub
all right keep them coming guys we've
got 20 viewers it looks like it's good
so we'll take this other one because i
think the the first one was kind of kind
of big how do you aggregate users emails
and send email campaigns or news to them
what packages and services do you use
for that and why do you automate the
newsletter to some degree or you just
using MailChimp and handling that yeah I
use the package called a customer
actually this is so it's called customer
at i/o so me simply like mixpanel we can
send events from the or application to
the server and then using custom I you
you can segment email group we can do
not obstruct and then send emails so
right now I'm not doing anything in the
meteor LAN so I'm trying to export
events to the some other service
customer at I you then so I can manage
my image from there yeah that's
interesting i just spent last night kind
of doing the same thing so when you go
to meteor jazz club / learn and you fill
out that little form at the bottom to
say you want to join the class that
actually posts to class stop meteor jazz
club and i'm using iron-router to pick
up the server-side route there and take
that post and then insert that email
into the database and then i'm using
mandrel and I've got a meteor method
that I call
an ID and it'll insert their name and
their email address and that kind of
stuff and package it up and then it uses
mandrel de shoot that email out so I
wouldn't say I'm aggregating necessarily
but I'm definitely like sending email to
I guess one user at a time but like I
went through this morning once I got it
all done and I you know click to email
16 times and shut it off to all those
people so there's that the other way
that I've seen it work is the same way
that or I guess the weight that
telescope does it Sasha uses a package
for mailchimp and when you say subscribe
he actually just shoots your email off
to MailChimp and then the second part of
that package is every night there's an
automated cron task that runs that
generates an email for you and inserts
it as a campaign into mailchimp and
let's say it's eight o'clock at night if
that's when it kicks off then at he sets
the send time to be now plus one hour so
it would send that nine o'clock and I
and so you can get in there and tweak it
if you wanted to but he's just
generating HTML and then inserting that
into mailchimp in so that that's another
good approach to kind of aggregating and
sending campaigns the people as well all
right what seriously I tried by the
doxies not 0 for 9 you cannot up maybe
all right so I'm gonna miss look like
this question and we'll just say it here
someone saying meteor 10 seems to be out
that's gonna flip my lid I think I did
that on purpose cuz I called tomorrow I
guess thursday as the day they would
come out I think they came out early
just because of me just kidding just
kidding uh yeah I don't see anything I
wonder where they're seeing that at
no please I stand on 09 full yeah
probably right in the middle of
releasing things a bit and I think Simon
can also the what how we go d yes yeah
yeah maybe Simon can chime in here how
he saw it up someone said they've tagged
to the release nice okay um so we'll
select that ok ok so this app let me
kill this app either your update let me
just run that and we'll see what
original your back on this class manager
I was working on last night that's gonna
be funny if it got released right now uh
it's that you do you want going dude oh
yeah one hour but yeah but it's not
fully released because when i run media
update it says this project is already
at meteor 094 so my guess is we'll
probably see like meteor updates gonna
start working an hour or so yeah i think
get a screen a peg and maybe dead us
some of the stuff to do yeah yeah my
guess is this is always a pretty manual
process for them or maybe it's automated
but you know it takes a while kick off
each phase of it who knows um yeah so
just get through all these people
talking about when i will being out
there's a linked the tag if you want to
see it all right
so what do you see the biggest
challenges for one point o Malley yes my
response to that would be like the
biggest challenge to people outside of
the media community I think is going to
be the fact that it's all Mongo like is
the officially supported database right
now that seems to be the number one
number one thing that I'm hearing from
people like when is it going to support
more databases you know when are we
going to get more than just Mongo that's
the biggest thing for me so he asking
what's the biggest challenge for 10 out
of 10 oh yeah I guess everyone in the
same right like after 10 I mean it's
gonna be a while before we see 11 would
be my guess so it's mainly for the
outside of the media company because
there are lot of people waiting for to
come to media so because it's not 1.0 so
there will be a lot of people coming to
the meteor then there will be more
requests and Auntie I think the
community will be much bigger after few
months from now so there will be a lot
of things happen yeah I would agree with
that I mean I've been seeing
month-over-month I've been seeing ten to
twenty percent growth on crater and so
that tells me that the community is
probably growing as well so my thought
is that just people starting to deal
with new issues or running into new edge
cases or corner cases whatever you want
to call them you know they're going to
be hitting bugs because they're going to
be thinking of new ways to use meteor
and you know we will probably be working
through that for the next couple months
just trying to figure out how to get
through you know production and scaling
and that kind of stuff is they they
build apps
and now the thing is you need to address
the this kind of question how how do we
compare UK with files Django and mean
stacked so what other performer sleep
paralysis so I think you need to be
ready answering those questions maybe
answer something yeah yeah I would agree
um and maybe a little nicer than my
meteor to killing rails blog post
alright so we'll take wills question
it's been hanging out for a while and
we'll get to Ben Ben God's question
since I didn't say his name on the
podcast will say it here I'm trying to
reconcile meteors whole application data
management approach DDP etc with data
store neutral backends such a strong
loop your thoughts on the trade-offs
here would be appreciated thanks I've it
used strong loop I'm assuming that we
can just insert compatible back in here
maybe something like firebase as well I
do use strong loop no okay but I think
he's he's kind of saying about some kind
of autumn layer like something like that
way perhaps yeah so I think yeah
there'll be some musics use case for
that one as well this ORM layer but
media team is not interested about ORM
because they are looking a word like
having us similar kind of latest on the
back end as a permanent Nashville so
yeah that's some something useful but
still I think if we have some kind of
our then stops like thing and there will
be a lot of new skaters for that s work
there are some common kind of
application that can build on top of the
ORM but still this is a yes or no
pressure the really hard to understand
sir yeah
perhaps more specific question something
you're looking at her thinking about
might hope here but my thought is
obviously like any time you're going to
look outside of meteor core like your
you're probably going to have a little
tougher time because things aren't going
to be documented you're not going to
have you know you know a thousands of
people kind of doing a similar thing as
you so i guess that's always a trade-off
as well the other interesting thing is
DDP is its own standard so I know people
have created like Ruby DDPs client
server libraries and same thing like
obviously there's a node 1 i'm pretty
sure there's a python one I know there's
objective-c client so you can subscribe
the data that's interesting as well so I
don't know like if if you want to give
us a more specific question we can
probably try to answer that all right so
I got Ben's name right that's awesome
but I will say it looked pretty easy any
suggestions this is from been any
suggestions for creating games or other
apps with real-time ish user interaction
issues that come up our time
synchronization between servers and
clients latency etc is DDP well suited
for this or would it be better to use
UDP somehow I have never made a game and
I have never really tried to use UDP
lake down that low so that's gonna be
hard for me to internship empanada is
since tequila X represents something
like my lapis on the line because it's
really hard to have UDP kind of
transport layer for them closer right
you don't have some ApS I think I don't
think we have a ps4 the UDP the
like the browser is inherently using
HTTP and and so I would imagine like um
well yeah go test it and you tell us and
and one thing is I if you need more
real-time data activities so it's really
good to have you something like database
like release and there's an experimental
a nice package as well for the media so
Mongo is not not a good solution a
people looking for more real-time
interactions yeah oh yeah i would say
Redis uh is that the one you just
mentioned Redis ya ready yeah I would
say definitely look at at Redis
especially I mean depending on the size
of your game like if you just have to
users in there then you can just kind of
create a key and just start you know
tossing real-time data on there and how
doesn't rattus has like its own kind of
pub sub interface doesn't it yes yes
fine and there's a package as well I
think those flowers working on affected
like it is VDP or something like so you
have a red easy supports for the new DP
yeah I think there's a package yeah is
that one but there's a package for that
there you go ready DDP yeah awesome it's
fallen digit Slava and the nesting work
on that yeah you need to promise me DDP
yeah release live data and its liability
yeah okay awesome so consider that
answer but you should come back and tell
us more when you figure it out ah let's
see
what can we do a greater someone yeah
someone said just from meteor update
dash dash release one point oh and that
should get you the 10 looks like two
people said that there was another
question from Simon if he wants to
rephrase that a little better we might
be able to get to it and then we've got
one more here from Zafar hopefully i'm
saying that right again where do you see
meteor after two years from now i see it
being huge just huge like everyone's
using it what do you see the two years
from now yeah i think i've run it using
that one and it's not only be a
JavaScript platform and they will be a
common platform light if we language a
its own media related component so I
think it will be utilized it's like
something like like dotnet stack so you
have you can write applications using
Java so most tea shop and couple of
other stuff nothing and Galaxy will be
the you piece together how we we can do
things like different kind of
applications so then if you have a large
team so so one part of the application
can be created using javascript and then
some other part can be created using
Java maybe C++ like that I think there
have been this kind of interaction so
that will be media from movies from now
I think that's the future yeah and I
would like to see better deferred
handling to write like so if I say maybe
I say meteor method and have that route
to a different server may be a server
running go and it's gonna handle that
request and then properly come back and
say like here are the results or you
know something along those lines but I
totally agree you know Jeff Jeff gave a
talk yes back in May and he talked about
the fact that
you know as DDP becomes a more accepted
standard then it becomes easier and
easier to implement other backends
besides node you know go or Erlang or
any of these other like highly scalable
solutions would be easy to drop in and
replace on the back end and you know go
from there but that's gonna be very
interesting all right and so oh okay so
Simon was asking which platforms would
you prefer the community to try and
unite at and he was saying IRC get her
github some forum community meteor
community or whatever so my thought here
is like uh I don't want to see anyone
unite anywhere like Khedira hub is kind
of doing its thing and hoping people
answer questions and figure out ways to
build code and you know crater is is the
place you go when you want news and it's
powering um uh sorry i was looking at
another question um it powers a twitter
account and a Google+ account and all
those kinds of things you know I I I
don't think there needs to be any one
spot that people go for certain types or
for all types of information I think
each each spot is good at certain types
of information and we probably shouldn't
try to shoehorn everything into one spot
like that's going to be a lot of noise
for things that you may not necessarily
care about and it's gonna be hard to
create
um a good way to aggregate and filter
down to what you care about necessarily
so it's kind of like Twitter in the fire
hose you would never really want to
drink from the fire hose at Twitter but
you do care about certain updates coming
out of it and so I think it would be
hard to rebuild something like Twitter
specifically for meteor itself so don't
unite anywhere would be my thought here
what about you another I also thinks
things like that because so media talk
is something else it because it used to
communicate with the problems in the
cove like loser problems we take boys
relay to the cocoa discussions I think
proud about the news like paddy rapidly
some some code related discussions so
yeah kind of things we need to have
different kind of places for different
things try to unify those things at
right now I don't think so good thing
for the right now right
right chicken dog media.com so been
posted his simple game app the Mediacom
I'll get on here Rolando it lists not
sure had a start playing all right well
I think that that's our our that's our
time I would say where can people find
you if they want to follow you and learn
more if they don't already follow you
era nada yeah I think the next place is
to go for them vtx website ETO hacks com
and then you can follow me at twitter I
don't at our own order a are you an da
da so that's that's a two places you can
go and also you can follow our set me TX
to try Cardassia yeah awesome and so for
me looks like we found a player in this
game for me you can follow me if you
want to keep up to date you just go to a
meteor jazz club you can toss your email
address in there and you'll hear about
my blog posts and anything else that I'm
working on I try to send something out
weekly except for last week I was crazy
busy flying giving talks in raleigh you
can also find me on twitter com sighs
josh owens and um yeah and then next
next month I haven't nailed down the
time and date but it looks like chris
mader will be on here and so will try to
get crowdcast working again hopefully be
a little better yeah so tune in next
month and hopefully we'll have another
awesome discussion thanks Erin Oda
