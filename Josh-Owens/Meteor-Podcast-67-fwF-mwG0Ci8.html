here yeah night and day difference from
where I was at before and a big shout
out for the team yeah that's really what
it is yeah so I don't I don't want to
like downplay your technical ability or
any of that stuff I mean like you got
the joke you're an awesome worker but
the connection happened a media club
didn't it dude it happened with you yeah
like yeah like so like hey like hey oh I
got an idea I'm at the bottom of your
screen right your site lasted over side
by side inside of my on right this side
yeah you're you're over on my right give
me a high five yeah okay ma'am you ready
ah oh there we go yeah no Josh you're
awesome man no no what I was gonna say
is like I you know the the patreon slack
chat room for meteor club has been
growing and growing and growing and it's
just like this awesome amount of
serendipity that happens in there and I
don't know it's it's been pretty awesome
so if people are interested patreon yeah
yeah I treo n-com / meteor club and it's
10 bucks a month you can get in there
and if you do like i don't know i may
make it away from using patreon but if
we hit the thousand dollar mark soon
then I'm gonna do like monthly private
QA hangouts for people to so that's
awesome yeah and I just want to like
build that up a little bit more like
that that group is amazing like
seriously Josh the group that you put
together they're all the authors the
meteor authors and heavy hitters that
are in the industry and the talks and
the conversations and the relationships
that are built there the tools that are
there developed outside of that group
and everything is pretty amazing like
I've never experienced a group like that
before yeah well and I you know this
week i finally got i'll i'll deed in
there right like everyone knows him is
ok but it's that rare yeah so right on
i've been working to get him in there
for a couple months and finally i got a
hold of him and he joined the chat room
and i think we're gonna do like a meteor
club QA with him for july so trying to
know we really oh man Media Club Q&amp;amp;A not
a podcast oh I know I got too many
things going on speaking of like if you
guys like Ben and I talking you can hear
more that over at podcast meteor jayus
that Club yeah all right let's let's get
into it what are we here to do again
let's talk about not our other stuff but
alright alright so let the meteor news
this this week and last week cuz July
4th hoorah America TV we're still here I
just lost one finger so this week we're
talking about meteor 1.2 and beyond to
infinity boo moon dot C oh yeah oh
that's a fun game react support little
behind that was last week but big stuff
yah es6 you just use it now with meteor
don't don't get a weight and any old
database with meteor no way man are you
serious we'll see we'll see cool let's
dive into this i real
like the first topic you have like that
was a huge announcement that was a big
announcement right and it made me sad
cuz it came out like june thirtieth
right after we posted the last episode
and and then we took the week off like
oh gosh so much news happened last week
I was bad we didn't didn't do a podcast
um yeah so this is this is kind of big I
think so that they're they're talking a
little bit about what's coming in meteor
1.2 and afterwards right and so though
um I don't think what did they say about
es6 support everything but modules right
yeah so you're gonna get a lot of that
stuff and they're gonna automatically
transpile through babel for you and what
well we'll talk a little bit more about
that later to the module stuff how you
can get that going um but yeah so I mean
I this is this is huge news right like
es6 just dropped and then all of a
sudden boom were like we're getting semi
native support for it I guess yeah and
you know what we had a hint in our
meteor club podcast with Yuri yeah we do
that yeah yeah and and Matt was on the
he did the last Media Club QA and that's
right so he talked a little bit about
that as well but i think you know like
aa big news we get me a six support like
natively built into the build tool so
that means like obviously the
refactoring the build tool little bit
but the big news is the angular in the
react right that was the other kind of
thing that Yuri was hinting out on that
podcast as well and now Matt dropped it
like I I remember when matt said that in
the QA he hinted it I like jumped up out
of my seat yeah that went right over to
Paul because I was in Toronto at that
time and I was like oh Paul I told you
Britt react is coming yeah was gonna
hate that I said that but boom I told
you yes exactly that's how it was and
then I threw his computer across the
wall smack it out of his hands see
yeah yeah I want you to be I was gonna
either hate us your laughs yes I don't
know um Paul's awesome i love that guy
so you know i mean the react stuff like
no big shocker to me I mean when you see
all the blades guys dabbling in various
react projects and trying to get things
working like I'm not shocked to see that
happen at all um you know and i don't
know how i feel about this honestly like
we keep going back and forth like a nile
and the chat room in the media club chat
chat slack room a little about how he
said that uh he keeps talking about like
um you know going back and forth like
should i use bleh should i used rhea
actually he's angular and I'm like you
know and he's almost worried that this
is going to become a problem because
there's too much choice in the ecosystem
yeah I remember you and I were in on
that conversation yeah and so I think I
don't know I I worry about it less just
because I've seen I've seen rails go
through similar things right and so like
you get this very opinionated framework
and you start building it and like right
now we we can all use Mongo and we can
all these blaze and anything else is a
little painful you gotta do it yourself
or you gotta like integrate it in some
way mm-hmm and there's a little bit of
pain there but you know now that they're
officially supporting it the worry is
that it's going to open up the community
too wide and if someone builds nap with
meteor and react you know does that mean
like as a consultant or a developer you
have to learn react in order to work on
that and actually thing not right like
the I think the the work available will
be bigger than you know what you know
and don't know and so you'll be able to
pick a project like if you're a fan of
blaze you'll probably be able to find a
project that is blaze or if you get it
if you get a green field client and then
it doesn't matter right so I don't know
not sure yet and and you my take on it
is that blaze is really easy to pick up
like that's like that's like
to fill up your brain and so you could
like do blaze and then pick one or the
other angular and react yeah either 1i
then man you're set well you know
interestingly enough i think you know
yuri said he's working with the angular
team regularly and you know i have a
feeling we'll see pretty fast support
for angular 2 point 0 when it drops in
so like meteor and angular to work
together nicely and that that's
interesting right like they have a more
established testing story and they're
obviously like the big fish in the
proverbial client-side JavaScript pond
here yeah you um and you know reacts got
a big company behind it like angular but
I feel like it's still in its infancy I
don't know like maybe I just didn't hear
about it soon enough but I I like the
idea of separating templating from my
code and so react always feels a little
funny to me sometimes yeah that's just
like how old are you again did you ate
mold enough yeah yeah like eight get off
my lawn no I mean seriously it was
around long enough that I remember when
we had the the chocolate in the peanut
butter and the you know Rice Krispies
all mixed together in our HTML right
like yeah HTML and JavaScript and CSS
like all that styling was happening
there and like things got better when
you started moving these things out well
we didn't have components either we
still don't well that's the whole reason
for it though you know so that's what
we're moving into yeah yeah yeah yeah
once I think once browsers support them
but there's such a like dichotomy of
like different options for how you're
gonna get to component support you know
like i know it safaris like doing almost
nothing as far as i know and then you
have thrown taking one approach and then
now you've got facebook taking a
different approach and even still like I
just saw something today we're uh google
released a brand new library for doing
like virtual Dom oh yeah yeah oh yeah so
I you know I don't know this stuff's
crazy but I'm glad that they're doing
more and offering more to developers I
think that's gonna grow meteor itself
and you know I see a lot of questions
like well when's the job market can I
hit for meteor I think this is gonna
help you know like if a developer can
use node and angular through meteor and
get like all that reactivity and all
that kind of stuff like they're gonna
probably choose that for a project and
we may write a project and it becomes a
successful business guess what all of a
sudden we need more media developers
yeah well and you know I can think of
three companies that I know that are
hiring all the time single right now
yeah I can think of a lot more than
three yeah that's what I'll say it like
I think you guys to be in the know right
like right now you if you're at a dev
shop they're spinning out clients that
are looking to hire people like I know
for sure that the guys down in Austin um
I worked on their app fantasy how
they're hiring you know like and then
they're paying a decent salary and
they're looking for people to join this
startup and go didn't build it faster
yeah I would say like the job market is
actually pretty out right now yeah for
meteor and I think like it's about to
explode yeah like I've got more work
than I can handle like i've been i've
been bringing people on to work with me
so i'm trying to grow the community that
way you're rocking at it man keep it up
alright so the other interesting bits
here are just that they've said that
they're looking at rest and micro
services and that they're trying to
figure out sequel like official sequel
support but we'll dive into that and a
little bit yeah yeah no later it's
awesome alright so moon dot co moon that
CEO we don't know what it is but you can
go there and play an awesome game oh
yeah yeah my question is how many hours
have you played me yeah I got frustrated
after 20 minutes for I'm not landing and
this was like when it first came out
yeah we ran your phone or a computer no
I was on a computer okay so i think the
slightly easier than the phone yeah
made it so sad for me I was like forget
this I can't swear on this podcast but I
would be like yeah I was about to call
my about here I was about to call my
seven-year-old son in and be like a bee
it show but this is like I mean just
like show me how to do it yeah yeah so
they they have a great post up I have to
see if I can find it in put in the show
notes but uh oh no it was on it was on
the crater link that was where it was
like he did a good job in the comments
like explaining I'll put the crater link
in the show notes as well but um he did
a good job of explaining kind of like
how they've built it and it was really
interesting I thought I thought it was
it was definitely worth a read they
didn't use any kind of gaming engine to
do it but they use html5 canvas and you
know they just talk about how it all
works and it's got like it's not really
a social component but you can see other
people playing it just yeah that's
always gonna say that that's right what
that's what I noticed right away and I
was like yep there's mid-year yeah yeah
yeah and that's that's kind of cool and
then I saw like I know I don't know if
they have some kind of like high school
or Auto kind of leveler but some of the
landing points change their scoring in
the middle of it in the middle of me
playing a game I thought that was
interesting um you got less points for
landing there um and then so like I'm
think are you playing it right now is
that what you're doing right now no but
it says on pilot number 68 so i logged
in with you watering no I've got it up
on my screen but you know the
interesting thing is as a game you know
they've got when you're on the phone you
don't get the actual velocity speed
numbers um like vertical and horizontal
velocity speeds and you have to get
below 3 on both of those in order to
land successfully yeah if you're going
faster than that then your ship blows up
damn it damn it all right what do I
gotta get below a three like you really
I don't like you as you're coming in for
the landing you got to keep hitting the
thrusters and try to not move side to
side and just kind of sleep
oh that's impossible it said someone do
this did you do it uh yeah I've landed
multiple times in different areas so oh
you just show off all right I just
crashed twice I'm giving up my my uh I
think the biggest i've hit is a 10x
though but it's it's hard cuz you run
out of fuel and then you're done so
anyway this is a lot of fun and someone
someone hit like a 500 x landing no way
yeah anything yeah they've got a video
of it somewhere good for them we know
who it is it's probably Colby no it's
not coal be the gamer it's uh oh gosh
now I can't think of it everyone's
looking at me around here it probably
thinking why I'm talking so loud in my
computer love it Richard lie that's who
it is lai lai la I don't believe a word
he says haha alright very cool I guess I
mean we kind of covered the react
support right like I don't know this was
probably portion oding on my part but um
the interesting thing is the next story
is about react support and you can go
read more about if you hit the link in
the show notes sasha co-wrote up a bunch
of stuff and they now have the tutorial
the regular meteors tutorial they've
kind of accorded to show you how to do
everything and react well so it's really
interesting and then he's got a bunch of
links to conversations on github like he
updated the the the post there to link
to a bunch of topics that are going on
right now so if you're using reactor
you're thinking about using reacts like
go take a look at all these docs go get
jump in these these github issues and
get involved and I don't know the you
know probably the most interesting thing
to me is that react has server-side
rendering support and so that's the one
thing that meaty relax right now that
would be kind of a big deal
cuz i'm pretty sure crater went down the
other day because Google BOTS formed me
again oh you know you know why I went
down cuz you're too awesome anonymous oh
yeah yeah they tweeted if you're gonna
be on crater tomorrow look out you're
really not gonna be on there and now
they have all the user accounts too yeah
yeah well that wasn't anonymous that was
hacking team well hacking team like
that's a whole nother story I think we
should add to our list er no no not
touching that with a 10-foot hacking
pool pop pop pop up but and that is why
the world's gonna end in a week mom and
go yeah and that's why josh folds cash
out yesterday you know that that
actually happened like we're sitting
here and like united says their planes
are grounded because you know they had a
computer glitch and then all of a sudden
like we're hearing that the New York
Stock Exchange went down for a computer
glitch or like way the same day yeah oh
when he's like sweet girl goes down yeah
when he's like should we go get her a
cash out of the bank yeah I was like I'm
going to the coin shop i'm getting
silver whoa who knows all right and
anyway doomsday uh so yeah next one is
es6 with meteor today whoo yeah so like
why wait for 1.2 when you could just go
to this article and like read this guy
stuff and this post on crater and then
check out all the packages and the
walkthroughs what does he have here so
it looks like right now your universe
modules yeah and that'll give you the
es6 module support which isn't dropping
with 1.2 oh that's right that's right
yeah yeah so that's gonna be the big
feature here right so i think you can
already install like the Babel stuff i
was i was misinformed now that I'm
looking at this it looks like this is
just module support so like you and I we
know why people should like get into
this and start practicing it because
you're a dry
a little bit of hints and Matt dropped a
few hints but they're finally gonna be
like separating the packages a lot more
yeah in the core yeah I think it'll be
pretty clean once that starts happening
yeah yeah this is the real deal this is
some big stuff and that's I think that's
why modules is not rolling out with 1.2
like it's like gonna mess with some big
stuff they want to make sure to do it
right mdg style yeah oh yeah it's gonna
take a while you know so anyone anyone
who's done a refactor like that should
know like it's it's kind of hairy yeah
you uh if you have tests I think it
makes a little easier and they do have a
big test suite so but yeah well
high-five to this guy for putting out
who who I did this Mac Roscoe on github
foz go Matt rusher oh it's a company Mac
Rosalyn yeah I don't know anyway well
anyway that pops to them did you have it
I like it uh because it just hooks into
the build tool and you just do like
whatever import is it'll pick that up
and run it through the es6 module babel
system j s stuff under the hood so I
mean yeah just like shows off how much
you can do with packages and I don't you
know I honestly don't know if people
know this but meteor itself is really
just a build tool with a bunch of
packages and like if you go look at
github com / meteor / meteor it's like
you just go into the packages directory
and there's like all the core stuff so
when people are like oh yeah we need a
core to support sequel it's like you're
just saying like you trust their code
quality more than someone else's that's
what you're really asking for because
it's really all just packages in the end
yeah you just don't put a colon in front
of it user name colon all right yeah and
watch out watch out for queso yeah watch
what you're josh owens is my yeah yeah
that guy
gosh talking about databases yeah so the
corcos brothers strike again both of
them you know they're there in the slack
chat room as well Chet and sam i think
chat like churns out code like crazy all
the time and then like Sam helps him out
and like tries to document it and help
him out and like work with it in
different ways like we did a little
paring session where I showed him how to
test packages and we worked on the neo4j
package and um I don't know it's a nice
little dynamic duo they got going on
there so I'm kind of hoping something
good will come of this um so he's uh
he's got this any DB package that you
can install see corcos colon any dashdb
and you can get reactivity for pretty
much any database or data source he's
got it working with Mongo neo4j rethink
DB and some rest api which is kind of
interesting to me i'd like to personally
dive into this a lot more yeah um so
what are they using for like the log to
log another burn like how we were like
how I Mongo uses the a blog mmm pulse
Christ had something similar but does
every every database or something
similar like that they can hook into uh
no not necessarily right so like with
postgres you have to hook into lake
that's that's the expensive part right
like you're talking about live query
itself yeah um so you know you you're
probably gonna have to figure out how to
implement something like that my guess
is for a lot of these you're going to be
doing like a poland diff which is
essentially like saying hey go fetch me
some data and then go watch for updates
every 10 seconds and that's how meteor
does it if you are using Mongo and you
don't use off log support you used pull
and if yep which is you know expensive
on the cpu on the server just something
to deal with if you
need to scale so my guess is like each
you can use this any DB and then on the
back end you probably just have to write
some kind of live query kind of rapper
to determine how it's going to get
updated depending on each individual
database but the interesting thing is is
like you know we've created this
interface you know like he's using DDP
and you can transfer the data back and
forth and it works so it's maybe like a
universal contract between the front end
and back end I think is what he's kind
of creating here mm-hmm this is a really
nice article yeah yeah yeah great job
definitely good article worth reading
especially if you're interested in other
databases and they have an example a pup
that shows you how to get going with
with neo4j and graphene database and
that kind of thing so very cool good
stuff it's good stuff man what's your
overall take on on just a meteor
community my overall take on the meteor
community like after the last two weeks
oh yeah yeah pretty pretty uh pretty
happy with where things are going okay
like uh two weeks ago I was maybe not in
the greatest of places thinking like you
know we're not seeing much from meteor
they're not talking about the roadmap
they're not announcing anything like you
know I feel like I feel like we should
be knowing something you know like kind
of my realm of knowing what they're
working on is starting to get like not a
sink so they should announce things and
and sure enough they did so I love that
a huge thing yeah yeah couple of huge
things right I mean the big question
mark i think is still galaxy when when's
that gonna come out but yeah I mean but
they're building out a great team over
at MDG they are developers like they're
bringing in like business side guys the
galaxy and like I'm pretty stoked yeah
yeah they've got like a vp of marketing
at a vp of business development and all
kinds interesting things going on now so
yeah yeah kind of cool heading times
yeah yeah
cool all right Josh it's been good man
yeah thanks for stepping in at the last
second bin I really appreciate that one
of these days I'll get better at
scheduling things with people that's all
good man anytime all right well thanks
for listening guys remember a sponsor
for this shows modulus and then also if
you want to join the slack chat room
it's a meteor no patreon calm REO n calm
/ media club another way to support so
thanks for listening guys and tune in
