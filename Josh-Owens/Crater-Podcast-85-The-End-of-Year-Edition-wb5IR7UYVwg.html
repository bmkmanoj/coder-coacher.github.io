31st 2015 welcome crater fans i'm your
host Josh Owens I'm your co-host been
Strahan welcome to our last episode of
the year yes yes what a year one day um
we decided to bump it up a little bit so
we could record it before the year ended
get some boomers out maybe maybe by
friday this will actually be in your
your feeds in your ear for real are you
are you excited for 2016 Josh uh yeah
yeah I definitely a.m. it's gonna be a
big year yeah it'll be an interesting
year yes that's what that's a better way
to describe it yeah yeah I don't know
about big right like someone I saw a
picture and someone's like was it in the
random chat room I think yeah well yeah
when you thought 2015 was gonna be your
year but here we are and it's like this
girl like pulling away and falling down
from her mom yeah really next year will
be a lot like that dude ah it's good
stuff it's good stuff I'm wrapping up my
second week off okay grow yeah and just
like hammering out books and reading a
bunch of new technical stuff and nice
it's fun i'm getting ready for 2016 you
should you should have told me we could
have paired on all this terrible craters
family dealing with oh yeah that's been
a battle right yeah so I've got I yeah
like I'll just apologize to Reid erson
and listeners like it's been a terrible
fight so first like the the problem was
we were getting like one to two posts a
day where people are like oh go watch
this pirated movie online and then like
all of a sudden it blew up one day
probably about a month ago and
maybe a little over a month ago and um I
was like you know breast augmentation in
orange county or chiropractors in
Minnesota and I was like oh what is this
like it's just been getting
progressively worse look in the last
since I put in the akismet spam detector
we've had 118 posts and like 69 of those
have been spam at least wow so it's
pretty bad but I think I've got it
mostly figured out so I installed a
kismet all right I wrote an akismet
package for telescope and it turns out
so I also did some other stuff I need to
write a blog post office but definitely
I moved to my own load balancing set up
since I got tired of waiting for my
invite to what do you call galaxy I just
I made my own galaxy with just engine X
and its load balancing and I got a
compiled so that it can do out-of-band
health checks which means that basically
can just every few seconds go check to
make sure the server's up normally
engine X you gotta sit there and wait
and get a 500 error and then it'll be
like oh we should stop sending requests
there these out-of-band checks are a
little better theoretically should
detect it down faster um but one thing
that happened is that it turns out
akismet needs an IP address to like
that's a big part of how it determined
spam and the IP address i was sending
was 127 001 and i started poking and
apparently there's a HTTP forward
account environment variable you can set
for meteor and it'll look at the
x-forwarded-for headers and it'll pick
like how far back it needs to go mmm so
then I got that working and it turned
out that like i was i was getting the IP
of the proxy mmm and so I started poking
even more and it turned out like I had a
typo
my exported for header setting in the
load balancer so I got all that fixed
and I'm kind of open now akismet will
start working properly we'll see wow wow
what's a feedback loop on that like he
fixed one thing and you're like and
discovering the next thing it's yeah
yeah well it all started like I'm gonna
make crater faster and so I ended up
spending like three days on that and
then and you know I will say this like
moving to a multi-server set up with a
load balancer it's been it's been a
dream like you know it's definitely like
people were seeing slowness on crater
because things were blocking on the
server and anytime you know the event
loop got blocked up and no like you're
just sitting there waiting for something
to happen and so now that we have two
servers like those blocks seem
distributed and much much better so very
cool yeah craters on the map now you
know once spammers find youth and that
means that good I guess so I mean
the problem is like I'm also seeing I
don't know if this is just a downward
holiday trend or Google's like
penalizing me for this spam that's on
the site but I'm definitely seeing a
Down trend in the Google traffic at the
moment yeah I bet it's the holiday
probably it's probably a little of both
yeah so I'm trying to catch them the
next step is probably like you'll have
to have positive karma before you can
post and then you know I don't know I
got I got a look at the Karma system a
little bit but I've got more ideas to
make it even harder to spam yeah i was
looking at stack overflow and like you
you can only do certain things when you
first sign up for an account it is so
annoying but it's probably one of the
keys to their success their anti spam
because I mean it takes you like you you
have to like successfully answer a
question mm-hmm before you can even like
leave a comment anywhere yes so yeah
that's that's quite the brass ring there
in my
yeah as a spammer if you're gonna take
the time to answer that question like
chances are you can find some other hack
form the spam faster yeah exactly when I
first got on it I was a new developer
and and I wanted to like post a comment
I to expand like a question like ask
another question right I I couldn't
believe I couldn't post a comment i was
like what kind of website is this yep
crazy light but really is valuable now
like it that's what all the content is
valuable there mm-hmm they have people
they have a very passionate ecosystem
people administer it very well because
of that yeah so that man you might be on
to something yeah maybe a whole slew of
like a blog post for 2016 I really do
have a lot because uh the other thing
that I did too was like trying to speed
it up I was looking at some of the
indexes that I had and so it turns out
like a little-known fact if you're sort
stuff isn't in your index and it's not
in there in the proper order you're
gonna you're gonna do what they call
like a scan and sort and that's really
terribly expensive and slow um so even
with an index you may end up having a
slow query because you didn't create
your index right and so like you know if
you do like in telescope we do a query
that says status to you know posted at
less than blah blah blah and then you do
the sort stuff right we sort by like
posted ad and score yes quarter and
posted on all that stuff so you actually
have to do status and then score and
then you know any of the sort stuff you
do and then you do post it at at the
very end and so if you're doing like an
inquiry dollar sign in query or less
than or greater than that needs to be at
the end of your index otherwise it's
going to have to do that sorting in the
server rather than just pull it out in
the sorted order do truth
too wow wow I think you might have like
a performance service on your hands did
we did yeah you had like a security
service right nose performance whoops
sorry yeah pittsville security but yes
that's right it turns out your end of
the day like if they're not sure what
they're doing with performance they're
not sure what they're doing security
either yeah my code reviews turned into
both yes that's why I got confused cuz
like yeah yeah you come across things
that you just can't like glazed over you
have to mention it yes yeah definitely
yeah so like glaringly obvious that they
don't have deny rules or something or
right they're not oh let's just take a
user ID and not bother to check anything
see the help login alright alright let's
get into the show man right citing stuff
so this week we're going to talk about
respond Lee Drecker 2 point 0 meteor and
graph ql unit testing with meteor 1.3
it's not even out yet and javascript
fatigue ah alright let's get into it
yeah so we got some good news here yeah
yeah this was super interesting so this
buffer acquired responding this is not
the first exit for a meteor shop right
location but I think this is maybe I
don't know if this is bigger or not but
respond me I think lake had a bigger
base right so if you look back the other
one was stream st REM acquired by
Dropbox and I don't think they had a
whole lot of customers and honestly like
I haven't seen a whole lot come out here
sometimes whisperings that Dropbox uses
meteor for playing around with things
but I just don't think like it really
changed the culture of dropbox right
well it was bought by box right not trap
oh it was box you're right now
yeah and it was definitely like MVP yeah
at the time so it makes me think it was
an acquire higher yeah that's kind of
what I was thinking as well oh but you
know I think this is interesting because
this isn't in a choir higher write
buffer legitimately wanted to have some
kind of customer service social media
tool and they said it felt like they
felt like it was going to take them at
least a year and a half probably around
18 months to get to a
hundred-thousand-dollar monthly run rate
and so i guess like that that's their
mark of where they want that product to
be and they felt like it was going to
take them too long to get there for the
amount of time they spend on it and so
instead they just went out and spent
some cash to acquire respond Lee and I
think they've already kind of renamed it
to respond and change the look of it a
little bit and they're working on
revamping the entire UI of the system
but you know there was a lot of
questioning concern like oh are they
gonna move away from meteor I think you
know us obviously in this community
we're kind of curious about that and um
they've actually come out and said that
they're gonna stick around on meteor and
that you know the the CTO has been
playing with it and he enjoys it so you
know they have no mood no plans to move
it anytime soon I think this is really
just a hey you've got a product we've
got an audience let's figure out how to
make this work and we can probably like
bring in a lot more revenue with your
product mm-hmm it'll benefit both
parties involved so yeah makes sense
it's the wind for the meteor community
for sure yeah the fact that they're
sticking around i think is a good win
that there and I just necessarily leave
the meteor community yeah absolutely
congratulations guys indeed pretty
awesome yeah absolutely so tracker two
point oh
so for those that don't know what
tracker is a lot of times you think like
blazes magical when you're making your
media apps and things just happen but
tracker is the thing in the background
that invalidates dependencies and reruns
them so when new data is available
things get invalidate it and reran and
then you get an update on your screen
and that's tracker running uh so James
Gilmour which is is this AC spacey this
is faci Spacey yeah yeah very cool I
stay out of the forum so I'm sorry no
but so I was we were we brought this up
this article and it's called a tracker
two point oh we're going to have a link
to it in the show notes and definitely
encouraged to read it it's great man it
was a fun read yeah this is a long read
it was a long read and but I i can
appreciate it because like this week
i've been reading all these technical
books and and this article kind of reads
like that where it lays out the problem
uh it it provides a good argument and
then it provides a solution so I mean I
don't know that's just the the mood that
I'm in this week I guess so I appreciate
it how was written if it was like during
the workweek I would not read this whole
thing leannan I I need my articles under
four minutes during the workweek yeah I
have no patience really so I like avi
ayer's articles ya know there were so
many to choose from and a lot of
articles that you know it didn't make
the list but he's been putting out some
good ones too yeah nice and short and
crisp anyway I don't want to take away
from this is a great article for track
or two point oh now it's not saying that
track or to point it was official like
he's not like writing an article by like
oh this is great new track or two point
O coming from mdg this is this is
exposing the issues of track or one
point oh right and his louts on what two
point O should be right yep exactly and
it's um it's interesting because he
wrote it so there's some obvious issues
with trekker one point oh I would point
you guys to the article to really
understand it because he lays it out
very well um a lot of people are saying
hey like there's Redux out there you
know it handles reactivity pretty
efficiently I mean like let's just go
that route uh and this whole article was
written by James to like say hold on
hold on like tracker like you don't need
to throw it away right yeah I agree
totally and you know this is a big
problem anyway right like I feel like
mdgs willing to throw away a lot of
stuff just because it's not seen as the
like the latest and greatest tool
necessarily you know and or maybe they
don't want to be the maintainer of open
source software I think that's a big
part of it as well it's definitely gets
pricey you know having maintained crater
over the last like two to three weeks
it's definitely into my billing time as
well yeah so I certainly understand that
stuff it's expensive and time-consuming
to maintain open source projects like I
I have a bunch at our private and I will
not release it and I really am envious
of the guys like Aaron ohta that just
like really stuff like crazy um because
like my big fear is maintaining it it
yeah I mean it can be you know it can
get a little expensive to maintain it
but at the same time I think that you
can end up with better software right
and so to me like we used to have this
unofficial saying at one of the dev
shops i worked at and it was like we're
better together and it was this idea
that like you know what we did pair of
programming there and everything like
that and the idea was like you know two
people thinking about a problem it's
likely gonna come up with a better
solution than just one person and I
think that open source tends to leverage
a lot of that you know you have stuff
like this post where someone's talking
about it and
you know maybe it gets the ball ball
rolling it's the conversation started
and and someone can key off of this and
and start working on something new who
knows yeah so yeah I do i do like that
aspect of it I do too there's another
aspect where especially in the meteor
world or meteors attracting a lot of new
developers and so you get tons of issues
of just like questions of like how to do
this how to do that and really it's
people lacking a deeper understanding so
they're not offering solutions there
they're just taking up the time of the
people that should be pushing a library
forward mm-hmm and that is like a grinch
i know i'ma grinch you guys could like
like blast me on twitter if you want for
saying that but it's just another thing
to concern myself with and ask myself
before I release something yeah and I
don't mind it like the libraries out
there that that I do maintain I think
it's great and to help people level up
like I needed that when I was young yeah
well I like I like I I was like a
graveler at the master's table you know
like I was like I would see some
response to issues I was like oh this is
what I did is so nice get off my high
horse now but anyway so I really liked
this article ya know well and I want to
say to like I appreciate you know James
writing this stuff and like sharing it
and thinking about a lot of this stuff
so I started watching a thread over on
the relay github repo the facebook one
and you know I it was about doing like
live updating subscriptions and how
they're like sort of figuring out what
that looks like and uh are you
subscribed to that too yeah and like out
of the blue like I just get an email in
my inbox and it's james and he's like
over there talking and mentioning meteor
and saying like hey we've already got a
lot of this stuff so like we could maybe
implemented in a smart way that the
meteor could hook into and
I'm just like yeah that that is super
awesome i'm glad he's over there being
an ambassador at least if no one else is
at this point but somebody's thinking
about it paying attention we're just
stalkers well I think it's like super
relevant and interesting to us right
because you feel like I feel like I came
to meteor because of like the reactive
stuff and like how it's all wired up
already for you and all that kind of
stuff so mmhmm yeah I'm interested to
understand when I could potentially the
meteor or stick with media but use
slightly different tooling who knows
yeah so meteor meet graph ql indeed you
know I read this a couple days ago and I
meant to clean said it before we get
started again um basically this is like
a tutorial and a marriage of some
packages there's a key de Graaff ql and
there's a laka I think that's how you
pronounce it package as well which is
like a react no client interface that
Aaron knodel created I believe did he
create locker I want to say a firm that
um so yeah I might be like being
confused with Zika if the names sound
closely related i don't know uh uh
anyway uh wait here we go lucky api yeah
that's definitely a Khedira thing as
well um but he you know he walks you
through like um setting up your all your
like the graph ql stuff that he's
written and it's kind of nice like uh
you know he's got a like a graph ql
landing page where you can see your
schemas um and then you know he walks
through like building and registering a
schema and then shows you how to use
laka to subscribe to it as
actually like pull that info in um and
then get it all set up and react and
then you know boom it's just like all
flowing and so the interesting thing to
me is that number one like he's got all
this working with meteor which is
awesome and then number two like this
means that we're no longer necessarily
reliant on Mongo's our data source right
so now if we can get it to work with
graph ql then you know you've got a way
to easily bring in graph ql data as well
um did you see that that retweet from
erin oda i think it was today know where
someone got this going wired it up to
postgres oh really ya may that's to me
that's the super interesting thing you
know people people are sitting here
thinking about how to get a graph ql and
postgres working or graph ql like I'm
I'm hearing that what's-her-name like
they've rethink DB has committed to like
being graft you all compatible right and
so nice boom you got another data source
now like you know you've no longer have
to wait on em DG because i think i think
maybe that's going to be a lost cause in
the end like waiting on mdg to get us
more data sources yeah i think mdg is
like restructuring themselves preparing
like like they are they're moving out of
the inventing phase and and they're
growing into a profitable in the black
company so it would make sense and they
they've come out and said that graph
kaalix really interesting yeah yeah i
mean they said they wanted to steer this
way anyway um you know and i'm sure in
the fashion that they do they're gonna
take some time and do some research and
experimentation and then come out and
tell us what they're gonna build and
then go build it and we'll get it so if
I to guess maybe we'll see something by
like April I don't
yeah or they might surprise us and
invent something you know and this is a
good segue to our next talk if we wanted
to talk a little bit about 1.3 sure yeah
yeah and because it was interesting
because at first they like showed
interest in web pack as well mm-hmm and
now 1.3 comes out and we talked about
the post that ben ben newman talked
about i think like two weeks ago mm-hmm
where they were going to just adopt akma
script 2015 module system hmm over web
pack and kind of build build out all
over that well so now 1.3 has been
released for testing yeah there's like a
beta out there yep yeah and I'm like
drawing a blank here sorry so our boy
Pete did ahead went ahead and released
an article as like super awesome about
now we now that we got module support we
can have awesome unit testing mm-hmm and
so over it on his blog on East Fifth we
got unit testing with meteor 1.3 awesome
article what do you think about all this
testing stuff Josh because you had a
testing course uh yeah yeah yeah so I
think it's it's super interesting so the
you know the problem was that if you
want to do some kind of testing with
meteor there was no way to just
incrementally say I need this code and I
want to run a test on this game right
right so the build tool would like give
you everything and so we need a way to
just say like load this code up and then
you can do a unit test and a unit test
is like you know you're not we don't
care about testing media itself we just
care about testing this particular piece
of code we wrote maybe this piece of
code takes a timestamp and converts it
into like most beautiful like time
string you've ever seen it I and you
want to test that and make sure like oh
here's timestamp I want to see the
beautiful
time-stream commander right Ryan like
you know meteor being reactive has
nothing to do with any of that and you
know but there's there's no easy way for
you to just like load this coding and
like you could you could do all kinds of
crazy tricks to try to make that work
and you know frankly uh velocity and
yonas like they did some interesting
things to try to get all this working
but at the end of the day like I you
know the real solution you need is just
the abilities they require this file and
it gets loaded into the environment and
then you can do things like mocking out
meteor calls because I you know when i'm
running this test i don't necessarily
care that I'm hitting the database I
just want to make sure that the maybe
the unit tests makes a call to a
collection and get something back and so
that that would be where you'd mock or
stub something out and you know I guess
if you don't care you probably stub it
out um but you know I this is a good
article i think this it should be
testing you know it i'm i'm sad we're in
this in-between State but I'm glad that
were we're getting somewhere where it
can get better yeah yeah and I think in
the end it'll be markedly better but you
know we're just kind of living through
this pain point right now but there's a
light and this is what the article is
about like there's a light at the end of
the tunnel we're getting to the end of
the tunnel soon and what Josh is
alluding to is that right now we're kind
of in this purgatory where velocity
isn't supported and and also it's really
hard to run unit tests how meteor sends
everything it's more geared for
end-to-end tests but I'm really excited
that mdg is still on top of Atma script
2015 and and it just opens up so much
more yeah possibly right and so to me
like an add an analogy to this would be
like you go to the apple store because
you want to buy a brand-new left
like top-of-the-line laptop and you get
there and they're all out of like every
type of laptop except the old like two
year old math right and then slow really
laptop but i'm going to cd-rom will buy
the two year old laptop so like it's you
know it sucks and you just gotta wait it
out or I don't know yeah I just waited
out at this point like that's that's
really my plan here um yeah uh but I
think this is great this walks you
through everything that you need to do
to to get everything going on and even
shows you like how you can inject your
dependencies in there so if you need to
do something but at the end of the day
like what all this is about like this
this incremental like the the module
loading and all this kind of stuff that
we're getting is about speed you know
when you ran your velocity test before
you're waiting on the build tool to do
something what is now you can just wait
on jasmine or mocha to just load that
file up and run the test and it takes
like you see there at the end it's two
milliseconds and I asked him and he said
like that's just it's just a straight
two milliseconds it's not like build
tool finishes it runs then I have two
milliseconds on top of the build tool
wait time so instead of like you know 12
seconds you get two milliseconds that's
awesome yeah awesome thanks Pete for
writing this it really makes us a thing
that could be a yak shave into something
really simple yeah yeah definitely thank
you for yak shaving before us that's
really what you mean to say that's what
I mean yeah I just don't I didn't want
to depress him yeah I'd you yak shave
didn't nada talk about yak shaving no
biggie i shaved huh i I'm just
gonna read this a few days ago I met up
with a friend and peer over coffee uh
saw how's it going me fatigued so family
me know JavaScript more accurately i met
react and
JavaScript ecosystem that comes with it
seriously and so like I'll say I'm
reading this article and I'm like oh my
god this is exactly kind of how I felt
lately because I feel like since we've
added react support were like
bilaterally like getting all this
JavaScript kind of fatigue flowing into
our community as well when you agree
mmhmm yeah yeah yeah totally and so you
know he's got a tweet quote here too
many newbies getting overwhelmed by
reacts learning curve why and that's
hunt which is a guy that like yeah kind
of spearheaded react uh and then what
else pointed out um they were talking to
Dan abramov I assume that's how you say
that this is killing me that setting up
a J's project is so damn hard took me an
entire evening last time and it's like
this is why I'm a meteor you know this
is exactly why I'm a meteor because
setting all this crap up is not
something I want to spend time doing I
don't care about it and at the end of
the day you know it's it's uh to me it's
a terrible exercise to spend your time
on like if you're interested in writing
a framework absolutely go spend your
time on it geez are you know you're
gonna be like a bit player right you're
never gonna be angular you're never
gonna be react um and it's gonna be hard
to catch them and I think if if you want
i I don't I don't see job markets
coalesce around like quad rarey you know
players in the space so I think you know
it's if you want to like have a vibrant
job market and a growing ecosystem
around a framework you have to do a good
job of like killing these kinds of
concerns in my opinion and like react
itself isn't doing that right now I
still think they're on a path to do it
and I think that a lot of people are
seeing this I mean
he hunts Aang was it so hard you know or
Dan Abramoff being mentioned in these
like these guys work in facebook and
they're working on react and I think
that they're going to start thinking
about this stuff they will it'll come
around to it like I'm thinking right now
it's probably like a small team that's
been there from the beginning at
Facebook or from the beginning of one
react started it's working on this and
they haven't like added a big drill but
more more developers on to it and it's
going to come like it's just like any
code base like say you work on a large
project you got a large code base and
it's like you and one other guy and
you're building it and also the other
guy goes and then the new guy comes in
and they're like what am I looking at or
you're reviewing is coding like oh you
don't need to do that I already got a
helper function doing that here that
then and us it's like why is it so hard
for you to understand and the new guys
like wow there's a mountain in front of
me yeah yeah totally right like it's
it's definitely like the knowledge level
that you've attained right and right if
your way up here it's hard for you to
understand like what kind of problems
are happening way down at the bottom now
and if you're the inventor or you're
there while you're inventing stuff you
can remember every decision that you
made on why you had to like do this and
why you had to do that yeah a new person
coming in none of those questions are
answered they don't know if they have
those questions yeah right so and and
it's more than just react you know like
it's the ecosystem they come Ned yeah
it's the fact that you have brunch or
you have web pack or you have like all
these numerous tools that you can choose
around or in between or you know
whatever like they started talking about
yau-man and plop and how like you can
have generators and just I mean you know
the article goes on and on and on about
like well there's so there's a lot of
new things out there there's a lot of
buzz words out there a lot of web packs
get a lot of press so you're like oh
well if I'm gonna learn react i might as
well like get wet back to build my stuff
okay I'm gonna learn web pack oh let's
taking forever okay I'm gonna learn what
pet crate alright men to react oh how do
I work handle CSS
oh I'm gonna like learn CSS modules or
radium or jss and you're like well which
one's the one I should pick you know the
problem is a lot of that on setting up a
lot of these tools it's it's a very
explicit thing to do right like you have
to you have to actually spell everything
out which were sort of moving to with
meteor 1.3 right we get like the the yes
2015 module loading and like I think
you'll probably see like a hot o loader
package that will do what meteor does
now but then you'll be able to like you
know pull the like ripping away the the
tablecloth and like leaving all the
dishes there there's gonna come a point
where you're just going to have to say
like we need to be able to incrementally
load the files we need and you know that
that's that's kind of what we're talking
about here a lot of these tools you have
to just set up those needs ahead of time
and I think that it's it's hard to
understand and appreciate what you're
gonna need when you're just getting
started with something yeah yeah I gotta
say I I felt this way too and when I got
in when I started this week of learning
right now I had a decision to make
either do i like learn a modern stack
right now and try to like monkey patch
where I'm like missing some knowledge of
basic JavaScript or acma script 2015 or
do I like go back to basics and like
just like strengthen my foundation and
then be able to like jump into these
other libraries ah quicker and I decided
to like go back and like strengthen my
foundation in JavaScript but first it's
interesting out it gone the other way
well and I started doing that and I just
was running into a bunch of yak shaving
stuff and I'm like I I just uh I want to
have a better overview of stuff and like
I'm reading these books and eighty
ninety percent of the stuff I already
know mmm but then I get to ten percent
and I'm like oh okay I mean there is
some syntax out there that and
especially with 2015 there's stuff that
I've just like okay I kind of understand
mm-hmm
so yeah that's the way that I took
because i was getting fatigued and and
you know i want to do the safe bet which
is right now there's a lot of dust
stirred up all right where's it going to
settle no one really knows we got some
directions nah what i do know for sure
is that I need to have a solid grasp on
2015 yeah I have to get a solid grasp on
how how these things are like structured
these libraries and stuff like that and
I decided to go that first and now when
I dive into react project and the
decisions that I'm faced with two make
now I could like I don't know I'm better
equipped at least for me that's that's
my way of making a decision and guess
what I'm not so fatigued anymore mmm
it's interesting because before I was
like it was like this unknown thing well
you know part I think part of this too
is like as a developer you gotta you
gotta like get work done every day right
like in and all this stuff is happening
and all these people were talking and
like you're you're hearing that
conversation across the room and you're
like what is that thing like I should
probably know about that thing they're
doing over there but you're like but I
gotta get this done and like that that
can be a very very tough thing to like I
think that contributes sometimes to the
fatigue and that's what what they're
kind of getting at here um and that's
where I was right but you know I think
my point is like you you've been able to
take two weeks off and kind of play
around with things and and take the time
to sit down and see what's going on and
like that sometimes that's what's needed
but i also think like you know that he
makes some points towards the end of the
article that you know I he thinks there
needs to be some kind of rapid
application development tooling out
there for doing prototyping and that's
kind of what's missing in the react
system no I don't know I've kind of guy
I've got a lot of thoughts here and I've
been thinking about like writing a
response post to this yeah and and
meteor could be that answer right yeah
that could be depends on my post be like
haha meteor yes yeah but we're like
kinda in a
state of like disarray a little bit
right now too so you we are but at the
same time like I I'd skewed for all that
for all the annoyance and teeth gnashing
that I do about where things are heading
at the same time generally mdg tries to
put out a smart release that gives you a
path for upgrading yes and if we read
this and our answer is me dear then I
think mdg will be really happy like they
like oh right we we accomplished what we
set out to accomplish if someone who's
familiar with media reads this article
and their answer is yo like meteor is
the tooling that you're looking for yeah
gonna be like her ray like that was
there and their unique selling
proposition right there yeah and I think
I think meteor 1.3 is going to be the
the key here right like the module
support I don't know I I haven't
honestly have any pulled down 1.3 but if
we get the NPM version 3 support as well
and it's a little more native into the
client along the lines of you know you
can go do my pretend typing um you can
go into a meteor app and like a de
Cordova package directly to it like I
never understood why you couldn't do
that with NPM back when they came out
with that and I realize like you know
they didn't there were different people
working on different things but my hope
is that we're gonna see that kind of
stuff coming in as well and that's gonna
be like you know you can just bring in
your client side packaging through mpm
and all of a sudden like we're full
participants in the JavaScript community
and I feel like will maybe be a little
more legitimate legitimized I don't know
I think so yeah yeah well I feel like
we're like we're like Joffrey or
something right now like illegitimate
heir but maybe we'll be declared a full
Baratheon soon yeah I could see that
yeah totally well here's for hope here's
4 2016
indeed go and that's how he ends article
to its to an exciting two things exactly
exactly that's funny oh well 2016 is
gonna be fun there's no letting up to
the momentum that is behind JavaScript
it's not gonna slow down at all no not
at all i don't i don't see it happening
right you know for all the other talk
you have around other languages uh you
know it still is the only language that
runs everywhere mm-hmm like there's no
asterisks accept this you know but it
it's it that's the only one yeah um and
you know i think frankly it's it's maybe
a little easier to learn than other
languages too like it's got its
annoyances and idiosyncrasies that you
gotta deal with but you know it's it's a
good option you know I've already taught
my son some JavaScript and he
comprehends it and you know I I feel
like I could have taught him Ruby and he
probably would've picked it up just as
well um mm-hmm but you know I also think
that javascript has the ability to you
know it's it's a functional language as
well right and so right now like I think
a lot of things are kind of object
oriented and some of the frameworks and
and whatnot but it has the ability to to
let you be that the functional
programming language as well yep yeah
all right guys here's to a great 2015
