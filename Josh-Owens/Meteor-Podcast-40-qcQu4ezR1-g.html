2014 welcome meteor fans i'm your host
josh owens along with a special co-host
today Greg nozzle screw up your knee I
know you do I screw up everyone's name
was it it's it's a podcast tradition
yeah so uh this week episode number 40
we are going to talk about Heroku versus
modulus versus digital ocean will be
talking about Triplett triple it I don't
know we debated we're not sure meteor
day check in playback and worldwide meet
you today since we missed last week due
to me being out of town will actually
talk about meteor day as well reese cup
a podcast yeah yeah last week I was a in
Charlotte so nothing in when we talk
about the media day though um so
sponsors this week we've got a code ship
you guys have I'm sure heard the are the
good stuff about code ship trying to
find my notes here of course I've lost
them here we go road chip is a free
hosted continuous delivery service they
focus on simplicity and usability you
can set up continuous integration in a
few steps they integrate with places
like Heroku Amazon Web Services modulus
no Jitsu etc you can also integrate with
github and bitbucket to kind of kick off
the builds I hear 100 builds a month and
five private projects for free and then
if you want you can also go to code
shipped iowa / media podcast signup and
any of the paid subscriptions you can
use the discount code meteor podcast to
get twenty percent off for three months
pretty awesome and the other sponsor
we're getting rid of
talk about as well and a story is
modulus modulus do you can go there sign
up we also have a discount code met
podcast and you get $25 credit when you
sign up so you get a when you first sign
up you get a fifteen dollar credit and
then when you use our code you get
another $25 credit so you can get
started there for quite a while on the
free and I think they're great for
hosting a meteor app but we'll we'll get
into that with the next story oh alright
so Roku versus modulus versus digital
ocean yeah you wrote this the night I
did I did I I really just want an excuse
to make that picture in the header if
the other great yeah yeah that and to
use the the Ryan Gosling Hey Girl meme
oh yeah but no so I actually took crater
on a little trip through all the
different hosting services unbeknownst
to probably most users of Crater it has
now run on modulus and then run on
Heroku and then right now it's currently
living on digital ocean and I'm trying
to decide if I want to keep it there
take it back to modulus but I did it all
in the name of science nice experiments
yes um so who wins i would say it really
just depends on what you're looking for
right so my recommendation is if you
like the platform as a service and you
want someone to email when when crap
goes wrong and maybe they'll have a
little bit more meteor knowledge then
modulus probably makes the most sense
for you if you're cheap bastard uh
Heroku might make sense but just realize
like you're gonna use your own custom
build pack and they're probably gonna
have no no clue what the hell you're
talking about when you email their
support and support yeah and digital
ocean those guys seem super smart I love
them and they they have good support and
they
we'll try to help you out when you email
them but I definitely think as far as
support goes modulus might be the best
option but cheap digital oceans
definitely cheap and affordable and I
think they give you a lot of flexibility
to depending on your scaling needs and
that kind of stuff so 00 to use a how'd
you do you a meteor up or yeah i did use
meteor up but so initially I did a
deploy to a slice and use meteor up and
had it installed mongo just to see what
that looked like and then since I knew I
was gonna be moving the site from one
spot to the next I went ahead and just
set up a coach Coach composed a oh um
database and that's where crater has
been running off that for quite a while
and so I really didn't have to move the
data around I really just changed I just
set the same Mongo URL on each of the
instances there they're probably whole
still I think the modulus ones turned
off because it actually costs money
every month but a crater still runs on
both Heroku and digital ocean
technically yes yeah is it actually are
requesting both sorry no you know like I
could do something crazy to get out I'll
be right whatever you open someday maybe
one greater gets a little more yeah a
lot more traffic yeah yeah it's a decent
amount now but nowhere near what what it
could be potentially someday oh yeah I
for a possible triple it yeah so I
actually saw this this gap posted on
crater but then I saw her I mentioned
some of the other guys that open sourced
it and uh thought a bigger one for you
to talk about you guys seem to be
talking about a lot yeah um let's see I
think god Nick where's it I don't even i
wintered which is yes but
yeah I know I don't even know but uh
yeah I heard you I heard you say last
podcast yeah he posted it in our team
slack channel our meteor slack channel
so we were all checking out earlier this
week actually just pulled it in and just
cloned it here locally just got up and
running so yeah it looks like it's a
mobile app for sharing but a trip trip
expenses yes see it's kind of you know I
guess what Nick pointed out to us was
that it has a nice pretty much like very
modular structure in the project itself
if you look at the code looks like if
using SAS and I'm just kind of poking
around here it looks like it's it's like
a components directory inside the client
directory and it just has pretty much
the entire app is just really broken out
into real small modular pieces which is
great I just pulled it in on running it
here looks like looks like he's got some
transition stuff going on like he wrote
a little package for mime or it's going
to be called mine that are you looking
at it Josh Oh looking but I'm looking at
some other stuff yeah it looks like he's
got a package called mime that kind of
animates looks like the on your life and
your layout template you can initialize
this mime package and give it a
container and it looks like you can
pretty much call page transitions kind
of a little easier than using the old
you I hooks so maybe it's like a wrapper
around that and looked at it to make but
they're working we're transitions some
always curious about their offline
support they claim to have yeah offline
kind of data support
I wonder how that works I'm into dug in
here too deeply but with like appcache
stuff it looks like oh IC package I
think they're using ground DB um warbles
yeah so I was looking at this and it
seemed like ground DB was perfect about
the problem and I'm bettin they they
don't set up their data are their
subscriptions in the router maybe uh
yeah yeah actually looks like they do
huh so there was a problem i was having
i tried to use ground DB with a Cordova
app and I was having issues with ground
to be actually kicking in and working
but maybe we've figured out how because
wait on doesn't like it doesn't like
properly ground because of the weight on
call yeah not uh yeah I really have a
minute I was talking with a wry nothing
long ago about using the county be but
it was dug into it yet oh yeah example
look at it was super easy so I do the
the training class and that's why was it
anyway doing the training class we we we
played last week with ground DB kind of
at the end of class and trying to get we
got the cord over to compile we got
location support kind of worked in and
and then we were trying to get ground
they be working but there's there's no
easy way to like get it to precache
things or anything like that so yeah oh
well yeah it looks like a good place to
good bitch threw out there and eyes open
source so you can pull it in play around
with it yeah before Cordoba oh yeah
honestly that's the greatest thing about
this story is the fact that these guys
open source the entire thing and so now
people have kind of a real world Cordova
example I think you know yeah pretty
awesome yeah yes alright so meteor day
check in playback this if you're
watching
I'll share my screen for the live
audience since we're doing this live
this week and if the audio turns out
okay we may keep keep doing this every
week it's kind of fun but this is uh
this is a fun thing can you see my
screen Greg like sure can yeah oh yeah
so uh I'll start to play back again and
it looks like um so I think the this was
created by some guys in Berlin and you
see these little dots race across to San
Francisco I guess that's like homage to
people checking in kind of tuning into
San Francisco so to speak yeah which is
where mdg is located and it's just kind
of fun to watch like all these chickens
start flowing in so you can see like the
time zones let's see uh say you were
down in charlotte right yeah yeah so
there you see Charlotte starting to pop
in now getting a lot of check-ins there
oh me oh yeah they're good yeah yep so
it's funny because um we some of the
guys were trying to hack the app and see
like so you see like a ton of check-ins
coming from Charlotte all of a sudden oh
and at some point I chose you guys yeah
I think it even goes white like Berlin
we just gotta check it out to see if it
would work and it did wait um one of the
books I mean it's beautiful yeah I don't
want to look at again another great I
don't know if they open source the app
itself hopefully they did another great
example kind of using location stuff in
Cordova and kind of using a two-piece
application they're sort of speaking out
good stuff yeah I guess leads to our
last story which is a worldwide meteor
day we stop sharing my screen and what
we you're down in Charlotte yeah yeah
you guys were in Cincinnati I was in
Charlotte unfortunately the timing on
that didn't work out great but luckily I
was in a place where they had an awesome
meetup land and so um Oh
funny I wore my I got my shirt ahead of
time cuz all the shirts came to me and
then I gave him two rye so he'd have him
for that warm yesterday nice yeah but
yeah they did a great job yet and swag
out and getting this whole thing
organized um how did the you know I
guess for people that didn't attend like
I don't know what rocky lived under but
um like meteor development group put
together they put you to read one of the
community guys in charge of rounding up
all the the meetups to have a worldwide
event day whatever one had had a meteor
meet up and it was structured in a
certain way with like an intro talk and
then what else did they do they did a
Q&amp;amp;A with core devs and then some
socializing and that kind of thing and
uh it was a lot of fun um you know for
us the the Q&amp;amp;A session went pretty well
I don't how'd it go for you guys um yeah
we jumped in I was a it was good we were
on and without know how that how does it
work do they like staggered out what
yeah so yeah right riot connected this
up and then we were on with like three
other cities i think maybe a fourth
jumped in but yeah it was good we were
sitting we were on with emily so nice so
were we that's out okay yeah yeah I so
right he was supposed to be on I think
it it started it was like eight to eight
thirty eastern time zone and you guys
went a little early um but that's
awesome then yeah it would maybe would
have dumped the gun yeah that was great
um in Cincinnati here I mean we had
about I'd say 20 25 people showed up
from here in cincy Indianapolis Columbus
Louisville Lexington it was amazing as
it's great to see everyone come out we
started hidden it we started hitting it
around two o'clock and then didn't leave
till you know eight or nine do right
like we uh right right did I like act
on the front of the meteor day didn't he
what did they do you guys did like a
hack day starting at two cloud yeah yeah
pretty much yeah we just actually was
great so we had a you know some people
who have been coming around our regular
meet up they showed up as expected but
then I we also had a bunch of newcomers
you were just really there seen meteor
in action for the first time so we
actually kind of broke off into two
groups since we had you know a large
enough crowd we could do that and we
took like the people who were seeing it
for the first time went off into one
room and a Bruce one of our other
partners here differential we me and
hims kind of took those guys off and
kind of did a walkthrough one like the
leaderboard app and getting that up and
running and just kind of explain the
basic concepts and then we had the other
group which is doing kind of like the
more advanced you might say kind of
topics and I jump back over there and we
were me and Reich and of a cut little
demos of things were working on and
stuff like that and then we just jumped
onto the under the Q&amp;amp;A session so great
I mean worked out perfectly nice yeah we
we we didn't go quite as long so we got
there i think around six-thirty and kind
of had pizza and socializing and talking
that kind of thing and then set up for
that we started the the demo the intro
demo around seven o'clock and just kind
of shot the breeze after that was done
till about eight and then we did that
excuse me the Q&amp;amp;A with Emily and then
afterwards we just kind of all anyone
that would that wanted to show stuff off
just got up on that they had a TV there
and shared chair to what we were working
on that kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah
yeah all uh good upper yeah great yeah
