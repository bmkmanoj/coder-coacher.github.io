JavaScript fans i am your host josh
owens along with my co-host been Strahan
hello everybody welcome to the new show
indeed first first show of the year new
name and we we have an awesome new topic
too so we have Bonnie with us welcome to
the show Bonnie hi thanks for having me
is it Bonnie eisenmann as I say it yeah
that's it Bonnie Iseman awesome I don't
think I've ever gotten a name right on
my first track right uh so um Bonnie you
uh you just released a book right tell
us about that yeah that's right so
learning react native just came out last
week from O'Reilly and I'm really
excited about it and it's basically just
a how-to guide for how to use javascript
and specifically react to build iOS and
Android apps so it takes you from like
braiding your hello world application
all the way up to deploying apps through
the iOS App Store and the google play
store oh nice yeah wow that's pretty
cool that was probably a really small
chapter right like to pluck up ski all
right just like a page or two yeah you
know totally simple no kings in that
process at all so if you're a listener
and like you've never tried that's
probably one of the like stupidest
things I've ever done is like getting a
nap ready for lunch yes yes yes we got
it we got a crazy project right now
where we have to script the submission
for both Android and iOS and we really
web scraping the UI and stuff it's like
oh but you might changes like every
other week yes this is why it's called
job security there you go nice yeah
iTunes Connect as a home fun Beast yeah
yeah yeah so one of the reasons I was so
excited about react native was I had
done mobile app development before
professionally um you know not a ton but
like say three months each iOS and
Android um and the difference in jumping
to working with JavaScript just made
everything so much nicer yeah and it was
such a relief to be able to work with
like you know tools that are actually
like pretty well developed and matured
it was nice
yeah resting let's talk about that for a
little bit so like react native is an
ambitious project um and a lot of people
probably are on the fence from using it
because like there's a stigma that it
might not be ready it's like brand new
like Android wasn't announced that far
back um what what is your sense of the
completeness of it and is it like ready
for production yeah um so what you said
about being ambitious is totally
accurate last year when they announced
it I react comp in January everyone was
like yeah what matters isn't that
they're trying to do it what matters is
if they do it well and I think we're
finally at the point where react native
is just about ready for production apps
android support is definitely less
mature it came out at i think in july or
august but at this point the community
is really strong and it's moving really
quickly and so I would say absolutely
like it's if you're a very large
enterprise then you're going to want to
wait a little bit right you're going to
want to say a little bit away from the
cutting edge but for most people I think
that react native is totally ready mmm
well for both platforms for both
platforms and the nice thing about it
also is that it makes it pretty easy to
dip back into Java or objective c or
Swift so if you need to and if the
platform if the framework isn't
supporting something that you need you
can go ad that yourself you know if you
already have mobile developers then
you're going to be able to do that now
say a small shop that is like purely
web-based they're like all JavaScript
developers uh and they're coming from a
Cordova ah delivery point in the past it
was a great topic or a great thing that
you just talked on do we need to know
objective-c do we need to know Java how
much can we just stay in one hundred
percent JavaScript land yeah that's a
really good question um I think if
you're building an app that's pretty
simple you're going to be able to say
one hundred percent in JavaScript once
if you have an app that requires you
write like very high performance code
for something or that's using some kind
of like rare API you might need to know
a little bit of Java or objective c um
but i think as a web developer or a
JavaScript developer
you don't need to be nervous about that
I think react native makes it pretty
easy to pick up just enough of the host
platforms language and be productive in
it and effective in it even if it's
still very new to you I included
objective c and java examples of my
books i was like even if you only know
JavaScript you can actually read these
and it's good to have sort of a little
bit of reading knowledge um you don't
need to master it for it to be really
useful for you hmm that's interesting so
you know for instance if you want to use
the camera or Bluetooth or you know
something along those lines it's pretty
easy to do with react native mmhmm yeah
so all that's baked good already okay I
think I'm not sure about what you that I
had a little bit but camera support
definitely yeah location yeah all that
kind of stuff yeah right that makes
sense so for me like I come from like
I've built a couple Cordova applications
and so I think there's there's like a
key difference when you compile for
Cordova you're actually just building
like a web app and you're getting that
that web UI view in iOS or an Android
and it's still just running a web page
you're just kind of like losing all that
chrome the you know the browser location
bar and back and forth buttons like what
is react native and regards to that like
how does it work yeah that's that's a
really good point and this is one that I
think a lot of people miss when they
first see react native in action Rach
name's not compiling to anything what it
is is that they've written this
interface to that from JavaScript react
is essentially calling normal rendering
api's so you're not writing a web page
you're just using javascript to control
the normal production of native views so
everything about your application is
actually rendering natively which is
really awesome because it means that you
know if say Apple changes the animation
of like how a sliding door appears or
something like that you don't need to
mimic that animation in JavaScript
you're still just calling the same API
so react when you're writing with react
native you're actually writing native
mobile apps and that's the key
difference it means that it's faster it
means that it looks real because it is
real hmm so it is truly data versus
corto
is giving you like that hybrid
application yeah exactly okay yeah any
Gordo but you gotta like kind of fake
everything what you I wise you know like
and you mentioned the animations you
know you're trying to like mimic buttons
and all the right which is why we have
frameworks like ionic or rehab or you
know things like that is to give you
that that easy you I that looks real but
hmm snaps the web page and then you
cringe every time like a new version
comes out right exactly because then
they suddenly all this work that someone
has to do to reimplement all of that
right mmhmm yeah yeah so you know I I
think for me like coming from a meteor
background and working on a Cordova
application one of the nice things is
the fact that Lake I'm writing kind of
like one application in meteor and then
I can compile to the different platforms
and so like I've got the web and I've
got the you know the iOS and i can add
android if i want and it'll spit out all
those builds for me um how much like
code reuse are you finding there is
between like even just android and iOS
like building that with react native and
then like you know does any of that
translate over to like an actual react
web app is there any going on yeah so
that's one of the awesome things um you
can write platform specific code if and
when you need to like say different UI
patterns right on different platforms
but so as part of the book i wrote a
like effective memorization flashcard
app in two weeks deployed it to the iOS
App Store iOS and play store and had one
hundred percent code reuse so that was
pretty great um and I was really happy
with how easy that was I had actually
written the app before Android came out
and then it just worked Wow easy really
really stunning facebook said that when
they launched their ad manager they saw
something like ninety three percent code
reuse so i think people are seeing that
the vast majority of your business logic
of you know you're you i can say the
same and then maybe I think like on
Android the tab bar is in a different
location than on iOS right so maybe you
add a teeny bit of code to switch
between that
and then for the web which i think is
going to be really interesting there's
no reason why reacts native and react
for web can't share the same code right
now that ecosystem is definitely
immature they're just starting to split
off the packages into like separate
things I fully expect to the next say
six months that we're going to see a lot
more people experimenting with that
there's already no reason why you can't
share your business logic and stuff like
that but it's definitely not easy to set
up a project that way and I'm looking
forward to seeing that happen very cool
yeah when they uh what was it zero point
14 for react and they had to react DOM
and you're like oh what are they doing
here with what's wrong man yeah it's
exciting yeah and I think that you can
see that there's a clear path forward
that could work and it's going to be
really awesome to be able to share code
across all three platforms mmhmm yeah
high quality code to like your not like
faking anything very cool so you were
mentioning a little bit about community
and the trattoria strong community
around it can you talk a little bit
about that it like is it mm p.m.
packages you know books training oh and
stuff yeah yeah so one of the nice
things has been watching how Facebook
runs their open source project I think
there's been a lot of involvement from
people contributing on github and a lot
of discussion and outside channels like
say twitter or IRC or there used to be a
slack which distance moved somewhere
else everywhere um and that's just been
really great to see because basically
Facebook has said we're going to
contribute the stuff that we need it's
up to you all if you find it useful to
contribute everything else and so I
think the last release had something
like 90 contributors and it was really
neat to be there at react conf last year
when they kicked off at announce that
they were doing this private beta and
then watching it expand out from that
and you're still I think some emphasis
on like in person communication to so
like at the next conference i'm going to
go to for reacts it's like oh if you're
contributor then you get just kind of
tickets based on how much you've
contributed
um last word and then went before that
it was like oh and we're gonna spend
lots of time thanking everyone has
contributed this mix of people like
trying to figure out best practices
together um because nobody knows the
answers to a lot of things like how
should i do ass and so everyone has to
find that out but just been neat to
watch yeah so yeah that's pretty
refreshing to hear so has there been
like a jump in and react native
exclusive code in the app store or I'm
sorry napster mpm yeah so there's react
native projects on a like new ones on
NPM every day and it's kind of hard to
keep track of which ones are just
experimental like someone building at a
proof of concept and which ones you
should actually feel comfortable using
everyone's also trying to figure out how
to package up a react native thing when
oftentimes it includes Java and
objective-c bits they need to import
into your project to some of the
packages of these really long list of
instructions on how to include them
although that's gotten a lot better in
the last couple months but it is funny
and so yeah like you know if you want
sequel support if you want like a video
player or stuff like that there's NPM
packages for it nice but often what
happens is that then they get folded
into the main project and then the
package will you know look I'm
deprecated very cool and then it's uh
evidence of a very active core team so
that's good rock and roll yeah and I
mean they keep adding people to I think
they've had a couple new core
contributors joint and last last couple
months so it's good to see the activity
very cool so I know that um uh like you
don't work at Facebook suit so I don't
expect to be like no but it they like
they were a pretty like famous fall from
from heaven when they like said oh html5
is not not goo mobile devices and things
like that and they were pretty strong
saying like oh we're going to go 100
that native for that um and now it's
like it's like oh look what they were
bacon in the back closet look what they
came out with like this is awesome yeah
like is that was that always the plan or
do you know the history of this you know
I don't know that I don't have any
insider knowledge of that but as an
outsider looking in I think it makes a
lot of sense as a narrative and it's
really cool to see right they took this
really risky bet on going like full web
for their mobile apps and then realized
that the technology just wasn't there
the sportage was there it wasn't fast
enough it didn't feel right um and so
they were like okay well we'll build the
best experience we can right now which
means normal standard native Android and
iOS development um but I think it makes
sense from a narrative arc like they
still the company had clearly seen all
the advantages you could get if you
could develop for mobile like you
developed your web so then they just
found this way to make it work right
there's like they had this goal they
wanted to have all the nice things of
web development they wanted to be able
to create best-in-class mobile apps so
that they did it and I think they've
been really successful with it and it
speaks to a really strong vision yeah I
think the whole react ecosystem has been
pretty successful it's wild like how
it's shaken up every JavaScript
developer out there so they're this
hasn't been like the only project that
was that that would take JavaScript and
it would like to spit out a native a
half there was native script before this
well there's there's paid projects to
like titanium mmhmm yeah do you have any
experience with those um I don't have
any first-hand experience with them when
reading up on them I'm not sure a lot of
them seem to compile down to native code
as opposed to actually acting as a sort
of interpreter layer which is
interesting and also what some of the
older ones it's interesting cuz I think
they existed before like the JavaScript
engines on mobile or as strong as they
are now
um so I don't actually do either of you
have first experience working with those
I so I never wrote code but I did manage
a team I was writing a ruby code at the
time but I manage a team that was using
titanium and you know I I was leading
them and made the decision to like ditch
titanium because it really wasn't
fulfilling the needs like we we had an
iOS app that didn't really feel like it
was it was hard to program in because
the way I was built and then like we
weren't gaining the ability to just spit
out an Android app either and even when
we did try to spit out an Android app
like none of us were Java people I don't
even think any of us like we had one
android phone for testing at the time um
and you know like it just like none of
us even knew how to how to fix what
wasn't working with titanium which was
frustrating and I have a feeling like
it's not that way with react native
because there's a really strong
community around because it's an open
source product not this paid you know
paywall kind of product mmhmm yeah yeah
it's interesting to hear so uh in meteor
uh we have this like funky thing called
hot code push where it detects like the
versions and what's up on the server and
it will push out the new code and it
will cash it in the cordova app so if
there's a new version that comes out and
it doesn't require any Cordova plugins
you can essentially just push up to your
server and it will update the app the
next time someone opens it up and then
cash is that that app code ok now if
negative if we act native is is just
JavaScript and it's executing a native
commands to JavaScript it would then
essentially be able to happen as well so
how quick the server just is pushing up
new react native JavaScript um yeah so
that's a really fun possibility and
someone actually already has a project
out that does exactly that mom Apple
only amended their guidelines I think
like a year ago to say that totally you
can say
and like if it's just JavaScript you're
sending sure you can change later
execute so it's entirely possible and i
think there's already at least one or
two projects out that do that i haven't
worked with that directly myself your
and it's interesting right because with
the Play Store you've got like a 24-hour
delay maybe if you go through the normal
channels to re-release with the App
Store you've got any one to two to three
to four weeks usually around two weeks
um and so there's a definite advantage
to being able to actually push out your
code early it often but that still
doesn't get you around of course the
really hard part about versioning on
mobile which is that you have to support
all versions always yeah because you
never know right whether or not someone
has updated whether or not they have had
whether or not they still have internet
connectivity but it is really exciting
to see the fact that you can get the
sort of hot good push thing i'm not sure
what i would call it in react man maybe
the same thing um but it's it's a really
cool function very cool so I would say
that's probably the unique selling
proposition against uh the other
platforms that had JavaScript and I
would compile down in native hmm if
we're staying in JavaScript like there's
so much more possibilities now that we
have especially now the Apple opened up
that that loophole I wonder if they're
ever going to close it because I hope
not it's awesome it's take advantage of
it every day that I mean this is this is
the joys of playing in apple's walled
garden right yeah they can chase the
rules at any time yes it's just it's
wild it's well yeah very cool rock and
roll so uh we're kind of new to react
native I guess what other kind of cool
things can you do with react native that
maybe you can't do with Cordova um we're
set experience of Cordoba either okay I
mean I think the main thing is really
that you get immediate access to like
the actual native rendering stuff in the
native API s70
that say if Apple I don't know drops a
new audio api or a new image processing
thing you can just immediately start
using that someone has to write the
bridge code but oftentimes the bridge
code is pretty simple there's a chapter
in my book where we go through and walk
through how to write a bridge yeah
because you know sometimes you're going
to want to use the really shiny new
things and just being able to do that
like immediately is I think really fun
yeah the other cool thing is that you
were talking earlier about like Oh
co-chairing across all the platforms
right there's no reason why it has to
just be iOS and Android so like
Flipboard had that cool demo a while
back where they had reactor entering to
Kim using the campus a netflix me uses
react native react native style approach
to render to hundreds of different
devices all with their own rendering
api's so i'm looking forward to seeing
when people start porting like the giant
bulk of react native that is the
platform support like you know weird and
unexpected places i mean sure we're
going to see stuff like look like
Windows Phone before we see like you
know an open source version of like for
my sony DVD player or whatever but at
the same time like you know i think it
could be interesting to see like apple
TV or a chromecast type of support as
well yeah be amazing and especially
because when you look at like Apple TV
they made that that weird call to decide
to not support like web views at all so
like you have to write native views in
order to make an apple TV app so i can
see that being super interesting in the
future yeah and i'd love to see a
project doing that and right anyone can
start taking a hack at it there was a
demo at midwest j/s this past summer of
basically a javascript d interface that
looks a lot like react native into
writing mac OS x desktop apps um like
it'd be neat to see javascript to eat
all these different platforms uzak react
native as a vector yes yes yes yeah it's
good that like we have facebook carrying
that torch as well you know like that
adds a level of seriousness seriousness
to it
and you could just see how they're
driving the developer community right
now yeah job javascript fatigue and all
those articles are like directly
attributed to react okay yeah i'm from i
was i would say no slack channel with
someone and someone dumped one of the
latest javascript fatigue articles and
then the first reply was i have fatigue
over all the JavaScript 14 but you know
as much as framework churn is painful
times and requires us to like keep
relearning and learning new things um i
think it's indicative of the fact that
these projects are solving problems that
we had right um people wouldn't be
jumping ship to react in such large
numbers if it wasn't doing really useful
things for so many people yeah so in
some ways it's like the javascript
fatigue thing is i think evidence of how
quickly the community is solving its own
problems so true so true yeah and
everyone has always predicted that you
know Java scripts gonna eat the world
now we're like like that was just like a
cult chant for a while but now it seems
like it's really happening you know and
it's exciting and things are gonna be
messy until it settles down but yes
doing so I'm kind of curious like um I
know with Cordova and with mediator like
my that's my comparison point and if I'm
building an application I get like that
that DDP client-server communication
channel to build something you know what
I need to talk to the server and get
data or something like that that
communication happens through GDP like
what what kind of options are there like
if I'm building a react native app let's
say like maybe ober or something right
like I need to do if the cars around the
corner I want to put a marker on the
right spot on the map like how does like
what's the best way to kind of do that
that kind of thing mmm so communication
with the server in general with reacts
has always been something where the
framework sort of stepped back and said
do what you want right it's JavaScript
it's the web do what you want and that's
why we had this proliferation I don't
know if you've been tracking like the
giant proliferation of flux libraries
mm-hmm
which has always been sort of an oddly
named thing that lots of people oh so
what is this why do I need it um and
recently has coalesced around a thing
called redux so on native it's pretty
similar the framework says is do what
you want um right you can import
whatever library you want you can rely
on whatever you need there's an
implementation of like you know standard
web requests on the native platform and
then you just use what you want I think
for a large vela purse that's pretty
confusing actually as when the pain
points because you're sort of left on
your own to assemble the tools you need
um so there's yeah I think in general
the answer is find a library that does
what you want and if you're coming at it
from a react web background you probably
you and your co-workers probably already
have a standard tool that your needs to
rely on and it should just work on
native okay that was a part for me when
I first did like npm install of i was
using green flux at the time and then it
miss worked now i want to say 2222 I
think they have WebSocket support yeah I
seem to remember hearing about that at
one point and I don't really understand
like where exactly that fits in so i
think that web sockets are i'm not sure
if they're implemented or not oh no way
I think they are I think that came in
late last year yeah and so the neat
thing about the way that when react
native implements a feature like this is
they they just polyfill in essentially
support for it and you as a developer
don't have to worry about how they
implemented it um really doesn't matter
you just access it like normal um so
apparently web sockets or think I need
to try playing around with this yeah I
think there was a guy in a meteor world
or at least he was for a bit that made
the PR for this for web socket support
so
I just linked it to you guys yeah that's
awesome looks like it works that's
really cool stuff to play with mmm yeah
like so much of this complexity is going
to be abstracted away in the coming year
um and it's going to be like almost like
a no-brainer because it's that mix of
the perfect world where you can have
JavaScript you can have have code reuse
but you have a perfect user experience
in UI that was like never passed that
was the Holy Grail yeah and it's coming
yeah and it seems like it's happened and
I think if you dig into the react native
code base it's a testament to how much
grunt work had to go in to making that
happen but now it's built and we get to
play with it mm-hmm so uh what are the
other pieces I kind of found interesting
like as I started to dig into react
native is that it does use CSS but it's
not like full-on like I can't just say
oh let's bring in you know bootstrap or
something like that because it's all
just it's all written kind of in a react
jsx template right mm-hmm so yeah you
don't have to mix it with your jsx but
that's that's a separate thing so CSS
has problems I think everyone even even
people who love CSS little bit that it
has problems right no and and you can
enumerate like I feel like usually when
I'm writing CSS I don't stop to think
about all the ways which is broken but
there's actually a lot right not at the
global namespace you have the problem of
like how like selector priority works
you've got the fact that there are all
these different ways to do very simple
things they collide with each other in
clash but at the same time it's a pretty
powerful way of describing styles um and
so what react native has done this has
its implemented a very small subset of
CSS um very very small and the goal is
to stop yourself from shooting yourself
in the foot with CSS um and so we no
longer have a global namespace
you there's you're not going to deal
with floats on flex box for everything
basically and it's interesting because
it's a pretty small subset but it does
basically all the things you're going to
need and so if you're coming at it from
like a web background of using CSS for
styling it's going to feel a little bit
weird at first but I think in the end it
means that you can keep your previous
knowledge and just apply it in this very
narrow focused way and you get more
maintainable styles so I have found it
pretty nice to work with if you haven't
used flexbox before then you're going to
have to get friendly with flex locks
looks like the main thing yeah but
that's probably a general principle for
the web as well exactly yeah this isn't
going to be react native only like
you're going to be using the Sun all
your web projects moving forward yeah
exactly and that's so you can actually
use the CSS subbable in it
implementation that they have you can
use that on web too mmm which is what's
really cool right because it's it
doesn't change any behaviors it just
tells you that there's certain rules
you're not allowed to use so back to the
thing about can you share code between
web and mobile yes especially with the
styles hmm yeah the other interesting
thing is that because it's jsx and
you've got your markup and your
JavaScript all living together it
focuses on separation of like concerns
and role as opposed to the separation of
technologies right so a component
includes the control logic the markup
the styles and that's your very small
atomic piece instead of separating at
separating out a javascript file an HTML
file CSS file um and because of that
with the CSS it looks like you're using
inline styles um which I think to a lot
of people when they first come to reiax
it's really cringe-inducing and really
good so um I promise it's worth trying
if you're coming to react for the first
time and it gives you a lot of really
nice separation of concerns it just
feels unintuitive at first mmhmm yeah
yeah there's a lot going on with CSS in
the react world yeah I don't know where
the dust is gonna settle with that but
I'm gonna play around three-act native
because that's gonna possibly give me
some insight because like whatever is
mostly supported by react out of the box
is the way to go so from a design
standpoint what are some other things
besides CSS that would like catch
someone by surprise when they're making
something with react native like I'm
thinking of like maybe is there
something different with a like the
views or pages or um routing work yeah
so so it depends on if you're coming
from like a background where you've done
mobile or not if you've done mobile
whether it's through Cordova or through
you know native mobile development then
I think a lot of these aren't going to
be gotchas but especially if you're
coming from a web background it's going
to be confusing to be like wait what is
navigation even what are all of these
different UI elements um remembering
that you have to have like touch
feedback right like a button needs like
a touch state to indicate that it feels
touchable so all this stuff and so Apple
and Google both have really good human
interaction guidelines that you know
basically will walk you through all of
this stuff and it feels like a lot to
absorb because it is if you're writing
for Android and iOS you better have both
devices just so that you get to know
what a good or excellent experience
feels like um and then yeah I think the
biggest gotcha is probably still
navigation because navigation and mobile
apps feels very different than
navigation on the web you can do a web
style like stack of pages if you want
but then like how do you fit your tabs
into that how do you fit your menus all
that stuff yeah and so there's there's a
couple different options react native
has its own navigator component that
handles a lot of that logic or gives you
an easy way to wire up that logic and I
found it pretty easy to use but it
definitely requires rethinking the way
that you like wireframe your different
interaction screens yeah
yeah I think you know the the weird
thing when you go from web to mobile is
realizing like there is no browser bar
there is no back button so like you have
to make sure like if they navigate down
into this corner of your app that
there's a way for them to get back to
the other parts as well you know and
yeah that's kind of what you're talking
about yep and that part can be really
confusing if you use the standard
navigator component though and you push
something onto the stack it'll also add
that bar at the top with the back arrow
oh yeah it's really nice but then you
still have to be like okay how does like
the equivalent of a hyperlink work right
like if I have a button that goes to
some other flow in my app how do I
connect them logically and figuring that
out I feel like if you're not careful
and if you're not working with like a
good designer or like us person you're
gonna build the app and then be use it
and like it'll work in your demo and
then after using it for a week you'll be
like that was not what I wanted it's
gonna be like to pick your own adventure
books you know where like where you turn
the page like you're dead what I just
turn the page what you mean up dead good
no yeah that's fun I'm pumped you are so
efficient answering our questions by
yeah yeah I like blow it away you're
like amazing like running out now well I
have a question to ask you so you said
you're going to give react native a try
what are you what are you going to work
on building uh for me I right now I'm I
do training so I'm gonna work on a
training class that's going to be
reacting Cordova and then I'm going to
port that to react native and that'll
probably my second class this year will
be like a react native and it'll be the
same application and essentially it's
just a I've built it a meteor already so
now I want to do like react um but it's
a have you heard of urbanspoon yeah so
it's like a clone of that essentially
and it's just got like i'm using google
local api to just pull in information
and then
populating pins on a map and it's is
basically just fine in restaurants and
bars that are around you and so like as
you walk around on the map it's actually
pulling in in real time pulling in new
pens and that kind of thing cool yeah
that sounds like a really really solid
like a good-sized project well you know
maybe that's a good question too um you
know that's that's something that I've
been able to do you know I can teach in
about four hours it took me about eight
hours put the course together but I was
able to just pull in leaflet or
something like Google Maps to get the
mapping going on like what kind of
options are there and react native can I
just pull in those same things or
something different or yeah so you can
do that if you want so you can actually
do the work of porting over an existing
mobile sdk which is pretty cool but it
also includes the standard map component
right so both iOS and Android have
standard out of the box map api's know
so I think when I wanted to include a
map it was basically an angle brackets
you right map okay and then you got what
and then markers on it yeah and then you
know it exposes a standardized API for
adding markers getting the users current
location setting a watch on it you can
do your usual set timeout to poll if you
want geez it sounds like it'd actually
be easier to write because the the book
like i'd say at least an hour of the
course is spent like getting the maps
working properly with me here so yeah
and yeah although maps are always fun to
do in a classroom setting cuz then how
do you debug your mat so I ran into some
fun issues while writing the book where
I was like occasionally my geo like the
chapter I was touching the Geo api's
occasionally things would crash an
invalid input I was like I don't I can't
walk around until I find something that
makes this crash what's going on I had
switched latitude of launch Jews what
had happened oh but it was still really
interesting since one of those
situations where you're like a howl like
to test something that requires me to be
like you know constantly mashina bug
settings yeah that's kind of funny like
we've got a guy we've got a slack
room for space dojo and people join in
there we basically like it started as a
mediator slack chat room and one of the
guys was building a Cordova application
and it was kind of like Europe you're
talking about here he called it walk of
claim and basically like you would walk
around a shape and well once you close
that box like you claim that space and
that it was like this little game um but
then like every time he'd make a tweak
he'd be like all right everybody has to
go out like test it out go walking you
know make a square somewhere though it's
kind of funny yeah that's cool yeah so
you know it's funny uh before we started
we were asking you where you worked like
we've been talking about facebook
facebook facebook but you actually work
at Twitter right yeah that's right i
started at twitter about two months ago
okay nice so what are you doing react
native stuff before you you start a
twitter obviously right yeah so before
twitter i was a software engineer at
codecademy which is like a free online
site for learning to code um and so it's
a very rich single page web app so when
i joined code Academy I actually started
the week that everyone had decided to
learn react um so um I got to
participate over I think my first three
months there we did a full rewrite of
the app and react really yeah which was
a really awesome way to learn uh and
that was about a year and a half ago now
so react was still I think um latrine
brush yeah wow yeah it was a really
great learning experience and we you
know hit a lot of issues with react and
then like we it was like everyone was
again figuring out best practices as we
went uh and that was really awesome and
then react native hit and having had a
bit of mobile experience in the past and
really enjoying what react i had done i
was really excited about it so we didn't
Codecademy doesn't actually currently
have a developed mobile app but you know
I did some react native prototyping and
then just really dope into it as like a
side project nice yeah that's awesome
just doesn't have like a
code for 10 minutes a poor something
like that yeah there's an hour of code
app oh is that is that built with react
native or no no that's native iOS app
and I think its iOS only um it's been
around for a while yeah yeah I think it
came out about two years ago and it
hasn't actually been actively developed
on since well they could just poured it
to react native and then it'd be
everywhere very cool so uh that is you
know one other interesting question for
me is um what what have you heard like
we talked a little bit about other
platforms but have you heard any
whisperings of like the Facebook team
working on something like Windows
support windows phone support or that
stuff former I haven't heard any
whisperings again not being at Facebook
I can genuinely say I don't know um fair
enough but I i mentioned windows Tony
because i know that some other companies
duolingo for instance was Windows Phone
first in a lot of ways because it's a
platform but i think you know in the
american taxi might be easy to overlook
but it actually has a lot of traction a
large user base yeah i hear its popular
in Germany mm-hmm no idea why you know
it's a it's a good product at the price
is right um but I'd be curious to see if
that happens and I'm also really really
curious to see if and when people start
pornographic negative 2 like I don't
know game consoles Apple TV whatever
yeah I can I mean even something like
the Apple watch like that would be so
much easier to do is react native app um
yeah totally agree because I like I
don't you don't get again that's another
one where you don't have a concept of
like a web UI at all and I don't you
know like looking at a little 42
millimeter scream whoa I got a Windows
Phone app or Windows Phone I'm ready for
this wow that's crazy loose all you
listeners I'm showing them a Windows
Phone app I am NOT out of touch I'm
running the latest stuff windows phone
I've run there right I don't know he was
98 whatever I don't want a fashion with
his phone I actually like interest with
it as a product I I went I I came from
I'm in consulting room right now and we
can start ups and stuff so that's great
so I'm on the cutting edge now but I
came from the corporate world hmm and I
remember when those phones came out and
like our CTO honest like multi-thousand
company thousand employee companies like
Windows Phone is the latest technology
everyone needs to turn in their iphones
to get a windows phone and I was just
like oh it was such a horrible
experience I gotta say I'll look
performed well outlook performed well
there you go I gotta give it yeah you
know that's this is a sure that is
interesting because lake as i'm looking
to ditch mailbox right because it's
shutting down yeah sorry i keep looking
at these these lists of like best email
clients and outlook it's always on there
mmm wow I mean it's interesting right so
I was a sparrow user and then gmail
eight sparrow Hawks user mm-hmm um yeah
it's one of those things maybe you
should make it react native up well I
like inbox I thought inbox um I like
inbox but I'm not allowed to use it on
all the domains which I have there's the
road right mmm I you I don't even think
you can enable it like you have to like
email no it's open now I'm custom
domains but your administrator has to
enable it yes oh ok well i try i would
have to have gmail right i guess yeah
you know google perhaps absolute
business yeah the bad thing for me is
like i like the fact that my you know
mailbox inbox shows me all my accounts
kind of in one view and there's you know
i'd have to go look at like different
mailboxes and it's like it's like one of
the rules right people will complain
about the email clients about JavaScript
framework churn about hey you know what
it is I try not to complain that malls
uh it's the fur if it's windows but
anyways
pika I don't want to seem old if I
complain I'm gonna be all like I'm
absolutely you know like I was it's
funny wheres outcome my uh my daughter
goes to the junior high here and they've
got these little like lenovo touchscreen
tablets and she's got you know a macbook
and she's got a high pad and iphone and
like you know i saw a text the other day
where she's telling her friend like oh
you're so lucky those are amazing and
it's like he's running windows this is
her first exposure to Windows was this
year so you know I don't know it's
really interesting to watch that happen
yeah I am so I volunteer teach
programming two days a week at a high
school in the city and it's always
really interesting because for for the
teenagers i'm teaching mobile comes
first and they care about very different
things than i do like in terms of you
know your daughter's not sink mac vs
windows she's seeing like this one
device this one kind of experience right
um and it just like really confused me a
bit when i'm we were talking about i
think tumblr or something and then one
of them was like wait tumblr has a
website because it's very much at first
a great idea to like stay relevant as a
developer is donate your time to a high
school yeah writes like a know what the
kids these days are talking about
hahahaha all that's crazy yeah I really
like uh doing it because I like teaching
right same reasons similar toy is a
child tell me about your phone yeah like
the first day right this is these are
students there like 15 who have never
programmed before um some of them don't
have computers at home stuff like that
mm-hm but it's like we were like okay so
tell me about a website or a technology
thing you use and like how you use it
and that was like the first day just to
like establish like a baseline of look
code is everywhere oh and the answers
they gave we're all really great and
just a lot of stuff where I was like wow
I did not think about that but yes that
is in fact a thing you could program
yeah like you know the ways in which
technology exists in their lives is uh
it's the cutting edge
yeah working at twitter has been funny
because now i have to learn how to like
you know exist on vine I'm starting to
get hooked on vine yeah I got we we sat
on the couch one night and probably
watch like three hours of line stuff
instead of watching TV it sounds awesome
it's it is good when you find a good
channel you just like keep going and
it's holding there's amazing stuff on
there yeah yeah yeah or one thing that
I'm trying to get over still and like
you guys might call me old for this but
like I still have that the snapchat
stigma when I like first came out you
know and now but everyone's on snapchat
does it's just like what it is and like
I don't know I don't want to go and
snapchat that you know that's shady mm
well I was introduced to snapchat by my
little brother so I have that bias
against it oh nice right so I guess
we're at the end of our time mm-hmm it's
been naughty Bonnie tell us what 2016
looks like for you are you are you going
to be any talks given any toxin any
conferences oh yeah I will be so 2016
I'm gonna be at react to europe in june
so they'll be in Paris and that should
be really fun you'll be talking about
react native go figure um other than
that right now I'm working on some
different stuff on the side with react
native hoping to get some more tutorials
and things like that out very cool and
the name of your book is learning react
native by o'reilly yes that is correct
available from o'reilly and amazon in
print and ebook and that just came out
right yeah came out last week how's the
feedback been so far um it's been really
positive I'm really excited to get it
into the hands of actual people and so
for people to divide it useful so cool
I'm gonna go on by right now awesome hey
so uh we usually end the show with like
a thought or a thing that has like
improvement life in the last one in two
weeks we kind of forgot about the last
couple months yeah we did a pic yes okay
because in the JavaScript you ever we
totally stole it from them
yes but we got to prove that we're like
not stuck to our desk we're not nerds
but we actually get out in the world
everyone oh dang I'm so nerdy babe
that's why i framed it like this because
i think i can also be a nerd and also do
other things yes promise yes see we we
are normal you know we interact so all
right all right so anyway so that's what
this we put one so a thing that's
improved my life in the last week or two
or something that's cool yeah you just
want to give props to UM so one thing
that I wanted to do last year was start
reading more poetry oh I've been working
my way through prelude to bruges by syed
jones and that has been a wonderful
wonderful experience and i had the
pleasure of seeing him perform live a
little while ago and now i'm finally
working for the rest of his book of
poetry so I think that's gonna be mine
oh that's fun nice that's fun very cool
well I'll go next so it's January what
is January known for besides cold
weather new year's resolution New Year's
dieting yes my wife is awesome she goes
to the gym every day but man she does
not look forward to January's because
they're packed with resolution errs
that's what they all yeah people who sit
upside down on and on the equipment and
I heard a joke about that is like you
know someone was saying they go to the
gym and it's legit he's like oh wait
I'll just be back next week and they'll
be no line mmhmm yeah yeah when I wish I
I've been getting in a little bit in a
health but I don't want to exercise so
do it I'm gonna hack it cuz i am a nerd
i'm like well what if i just changed my
diet if can i just change my diet and be
healthy okay just do that mm-hmm so
that's what i'm doing so like i have
breakfast and lunch out of a bottle are
you saw relenting that's what got me
started okay but I didn't like the
ingredients on it and I wanted to like
kind of include some I just heard about
nootropics to about a weeks ago so I
wanted like include some of that stuff
and there's if you go to DIY Soylent com
it's a whole community of people I can
this stuff and my wife is like you're
gonna miss the variety of life and all
this foods I'm like no way I want
efficiency I don't want to think about
it when i wake up in the morning I want
to mix it up I want to I want to be
powerhouse okay so so this is what it is
I wait how many days are you into it I
think it's my third week they're
differently I am I just feel it for a
little while because I have dietary
restrictions um and it's good an
experience you know at my ten bells
month haha well I do have a regular
dinner so like my wife was gonna be
really angry if I stepped out of dinner
every day but um so I had to keep her
happy there good luck wish go I don't
ever righty but I've been trying um I've
been like a vegan and vegetarian for a
long time and like always kind of
flirted with that when I was like off it
I was like oh I'm still gonna keep those
mantras really but I've been trying the
arm oh forget what's cookie dough ciao
Tito yes oh also so now I'm the opposite
I'm like all and all fat and all stuff
in all cheese and and it's been fun I
think losing weight like crazy it's nice
nice no idea why this is happening I eat
more fat I lose more weight I don't
understand anyway that's my thing yo Joe
but so I'm actually looking for
something new so maybe I'll have to look
into keto ciao um we just started to my
pic will be like literally right before
we started I just got done working out
and like ran in here and my face was
probably read when we started but um so
we started doing the 21 day fix which
has been pretty interesting so it's only
like a 30 minute workout and it's it's
from Beachbody I don't know some people
might not like that but they've got an
apple TV app so it's like 15 bucks a
month we get access to all their videos
we've been doing that one and then it
comes with these little basically you're
just supposed to have like six cups of
green a day six cups of protein
you know for a 2 cups of carbs total so
you're just like trying to balance out
your meals throughout the day and that's
been working pretty good i'm down
probably about six pounds so far and
I've lost about nine inches because of
working out yeah Wow and you know what
you've been a you are a prolific runner
to going in so it's not like you are
like fun healthy well you know the last
time I ran was november 21st up until
like saturday i think it was um and you
know i'll say this like you know running
every day for two months trying to get
ready for my daughter's 5k like get back
to a speed i i'd be happy with like it
took me all of two months and like I
took a month off and now like I've done
two weeks of just a little bit of like
30 minute weightlifting and light cardio
and like I was still at the same pace
that I was you know month and a half ago
so hmm lifting weights matters very cool
yes well good stuff well finishing up
Bonnie where can people find you are you
