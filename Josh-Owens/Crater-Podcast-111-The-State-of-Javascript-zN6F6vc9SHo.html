6 2016 welcome crater fans i'm your host
josh owens along with my co-host Bobbi I
my bearded co-host beards cut up going
the beard out nice fresh man Jessica
slowly so yes it was a very interesting
week in Crater land so this week we're
gonna talk about the new version of
crater we're going to talk about the
state of java script and talk about a
new react native tutorial / book and
then we're gonna have a discussion on is
it time to fork meteor I don't know
let's figure it out yeah alright so the
first one and I've got a blog that's
gonna accompany into this as soon as I
can finish writing it but um ya know
like i was i've been i've been super
stressed about crater as of late as of
the probably the last four or five
months it's been feeling slow and slower
I've been having trouble with pre-render
like my install pre-render working
properly which is led to like you know
Google getting airs and so the Google
traffic's been dying off and whatnot and
so these are problems I needed to fix
and I also felt like it didn't really
fit with the space dojo branding either
and so like I just didn't have the time
and like I'm not a designer to like
really work on this and I ended up
talking to Sasha and like he really
wanted to get someone on the newer
version of telescope using react and so
he ended up putting together design
right like two or three weeks ago and
you know I've been working on getting it
ready like testing and tweaking it
making sure it look right with
you know the production data ended up
putting it up on a staging server that
use the same production database and
then put that server into the mix for
some people to use so for like week like
abby and i have been using the nibblers
yeah prior to it launching and probably
10 or 12 people that were kind of using
it and give me feedback and it was good
like we got some good feedback like
Sasha and I ended up swapping the fonts
so the main fonts more legible like the
font that you see up by the logo that
was the font that was everywhere and a
system font for headlines is kind of bad
it turned out yeah hard to read so yeah
like it just it felt good to get it out
there and like it's amazing the amount
of speed so the major piece that changes
that the entire front end isn't
reactants to the place um I think I
pretty sure under the covers may be
using create container so still using
tracker and whatnot yeah still use a
mini Mongo pub/sub but the big piece is
gonna be react and I haven't like I was
thinking about it today I want to go
through and look at the Nova stuff and
see like did the optimistic UI stuff
change or did that stay the same because
I've been feeling like maybe that
changed a little bit and maybe that's
where some of the speeds coming from
yeah now when you upload like it's just
like boom done you know what is before
likes it and chug and chug and chug and
then what would happen and same thing
like clicking into look at comments like
that would take forever and yeah anymore
um and I also like you know like Sasha
worked hard to get server-side rendering
to work so you see a lot of hoops for
that one yeah he got fast friend or
working late fest winters been working
for a while but he got it working with
react react router and the reactor outer
SSR package that's out there and that
took a little fiddling as well because
there were some bugs in fast render and
I've got there's even been a fixed
lately so like DDP batching rope fast
render
and so I don't like we talked about DDP
batching I think we have yeah cool for
those the idea is like if you come to
the page and you load like a hundred
things onto the page DDP would process
each of those hundred items as they were
coming in and like react to each one and
DDP batching kind of gives you this this
little 500 millisecond delay or it's
configurable but umm it'll like wait and
then it'll run like from the time it
hits the first piece of DDP data coming
in to it hits the time limit then it'll
batch out those changes and so you're
not rerunning the code all the time and
so David matchings actually turned off
right now and I have a feeling if I go
back and put in this new version of fast
render and turned EDP etching back on
like we may even see slightly speedier
performance on it which I mean might be
negligible at this point with how fast a
bill yeah if every night and day a man
like seriously like I mean aside from
the theme which is very like you know in
line with the space dojo theme that's 30
a plus and then the speed or so many
people were commenting already saying
like talking about the old days and
created like it was a couple you know
just a couple days ago is the old word
yeah so I'm pretty excited like it's
funny how things can change when you
just change technology right just
looking on you that actively developed
yeah yeah I mean and it's like Facebook
cares about performance and that's not
to say like mdg didn't care about
performance but mdg cared about like a
whole bunch of other things inside of
the media framework and this is this is
kind of like playing into my recent
thoughts on frameworks versus libraries
and like why libraries make a lot more
sense because you can have a small
focused team that's like quickly
iterating and fixing problems and like
they're just kind of focused on that one
thing you know and yes that's why I
think it's like super interesting graph
ql looks interesting and react looks
interesting and these kinds of things or
or even view view looks
dressing you know that I think that
stuff works well because you have a
smaller focus team that cares about like
one particular problem or two or three
yeah I'm deadly to that you know kind of
front end piece here um and the other
nice thing that I game because this is
because like because we don't need
pre-render anymore because we have fast
runner SSR the grid would serve up
proper HTML to the Google BOTS and
whatnot um all the spiders and we're not
dealing with the performance issues we
had before um we're spider able or
pre-render and we're getting like actual
like you can actually see like I've got
google webmaster install which by the
way if you don't if you're running a
site you don't have Google Webmaster
installed like you should go to do that
now but um like you can see this air
truck where it was like one to two
thousand airs a day to google and then
just just a straight drop down to zero
yeah Google's getting a hundred percent
like served up responses now and I have
a feeling like the speed increase and
the lack of errors like should hopefully
help you know propel the site back to a
good page rank everywhere yeah a huge
benefit and then I turned on page
caching as well so if you're not logged
in you're gonna be served up a cached
version of HTML based on the SSR and
it's actually really neat to see so if
you go and the cash is slightly old and
you're not logged in like you'll get
that cash version and there's a new post
or something or the upload numbers
change like you can load the page and
then DDP kicks in and like the page
updates as well and it's yeah actually
see that happen yeah actually I think I
owe most of this like speed increased
definitely to server side rendering
because you know I think there's a
misconception about server-side
rendering where it's only for that page
load time and of course it is but as you
said like you hear it affects a lot more
pieces of your business like a quality
score when you have search engine
marketing you know if Google can see
that page fast
they're going to rank you a lot higher
in terms of quality of the website yeah
and what does that mean for a consumer
business that means that more people are
going to land on your website because
Google ranks you a lot higher so if
you're doing a lot of search engine
marketing that means you can push a lot
more people to your website and if the
perceived performance of loading that
page is also higher for the user it's a
double win because they're going to like
your product a lot more so I definitely
think that server side rendering in any
library if you're doing like any HTML
rendering type library needs to focus on
server side rendering and the crazy
thing is most are by default now you
know like every new framework not
framework library in the last couple
months including react has had a very
good focus on server side rendering
happening ability to do so so that's
this is great to see like two years ago
you would have to do that as a separate
part of the the library's experience you
know yeah and now it's just a part of
like that's part of how it is it's
probably because client you know you
know a single page apps are huge
probably three or three or four years
ago and no one was really thinking about
everyone was really focused of getting
away from these you know server pages
but now we realize that we actually need
the server to do a lot for us as well
you know so yeah well nothing well
circles like if you deliver a stitch
page of HTML right like that's just
going to be easier for the client to
digest and it's gonna feel a little
faster and so as long as you like
optimizing for the delivery speed I
think that can be a good thing um
because you know you gotta you gotta
download I think it's particularly when
it comes to meteor apps it's a
particularly big deal because like we've
got four mags in the JavaScript on all
right like that's just that's ridiculous
and like you have to download those 4
Meg's before the page could render and
so we've we've kind of cut that problem
out a little bit like it's just
occurring to me that that's actually
happened
um and that's maybe why it also feels
faster so even though we're serving the
four mags via CDN which should be fast
like you still unless it's cash like you
still got to download that before you
can render the page though sizable
amount for sure yeah absolutely the
sorority has that ready to go and it's
able to serve that up and so that helps
a lot and like you know I'm looking at
the analytics stats and I think you know
looking at the design the core
functionality of design actually didn't
change that much right so they still
have the main focus the layout is
relevant stories that are like today's
top news and like you click through and
read those and we went from a
seventy-six percent bounce rate to uh
one-point-three percent bounce rate but
solid that to me that has nothing to do
with the design that has everything to
do with the PageSpeed I think that's it
no fast everyone's more willing to click
around and stay on the side a little
longer episodes they are staying on the
side a little longer to we went from
like one second average duration to like
142 so that's like a sixty-eight percent
bump right there um yeah which is pretty
pretty amazing so um so here's the
unfortunate thing there are people like
myself let us fill an iron router and
making the transition and you know we
have a lot of JavaScript in our apps do
you have any like recommendations on how
to deal with that because there are
going to be people right now who can't
stir beside rendered anything because
they are legacy code in iron router and
we we get around this at work probably
get around this by saying anything we
want to service that render like screw
the meteor we're gonna use our Express
server let's make it happen and we have
a speedy end for JavaScript we'll just
make it happen and then once the user
converts they like I do with the fat
pale to take slow you know the initial
one was fast but the next one it's
terrible um but that's just so that's
just a bandage to the bleeding right so
like there's no there's no great answer
so if we're talking like react versus
blaze
the answer is you can incrementally
start to move there but I think what the
router like there's no super great
answer I feeling that's one of those
things you can't partially do one way
i'm partially do another um i guess i
guess my my recommendation would be just
to like the movement from iron-router to
flow router isn't bad and doesn't
require you to buy into something like
react right yep and so like that would
probably be my recommendation because
they're there are ways to server-side
renderer flow router but it's still
going to be you know it's an effort it's
it's something that it's you know you
really gotta commit to and like
debugging and making sure it works
correctly um yeah and you know I saw Ken
Dodd posted a tweet the other day like
you know given the amount of effort you
have to put into getting SSR to work is
it worth the benefit and I think that
there are a lot of people in the
JavaScript world that are starting to
think no but I think those people have
access to things like tree shaking and
code splitting and that's not something
anyway we have access to so i think yes
this R is like a huge win to me yeah
it's definitely better than nothing
we're fair yeah yeah all right yeah oh i
feel like when i get the blog post out
part of it was yeah one of the like have
a better like performing site for the
community to kind of use and rally
around um because i don't like someone
asked the other day and the forums like
you know if i don't want to use meteor
what are my other options and like I
don't like the meteor team just shut
down the thread because they felt like
it was gonna go negative and I feel like
it's legitimate question and I welcome
those kinds of questions on traitor
because I think that you know the
community is bigger than just what
meteors offering um and with that like
I'm putting together a code of conduct
that's going to be on the site now and
I'm going to be opening up a slack chat
that is uh
free for any critter fans to join and
kind of talk about new stories and ask
questions that kind of thing so that's
awesome yeah yeah I'm kind of excited so
I'm gonna try to get all that done maybe
tonight or this weekend and see where it
goes but yeah that's that's a big thing
for me is just trying to grow up the
community I guess and make it more
inclusive and more welcoming I'm
definitely the freakin about communities
and javascript in general stasha um has
been wondering he said having this
questions like what is the state of
JavaScript right now in terms of
front-end frameworks or libraries and so
he said you know a couple weeks ago he
sent me this google doc where he was
putting together questions that he was
going to ask the community there's a lot
of great questions so he you know a lot
of people China Dana what's to eat what
should be asked and he launched the
survey call it the state of JavaScript
the scene of jobs for 2016 survey and he
got man over like three thousand
responses probably going now yeah and so
that's great it's great to see that he
has a huge community that he can ask and
it wasn't even meteor people he's asked
uh people outside of his network so it
wasn't very biased so that was cool uh a
lot of the traffic came from like reddit
or Yemen we we announced it in the chat
room so maybe there was slight meteor
vias there and space don't you but you
know like I don't we've got three
hundred people it's not three thousand
so who's that boy it's weighted that
much it pretty much has like different
questions on different frameworks like
if they were satisfied you know what are
the top you know what are the top
frameworks like what are you mostly
interested in and the contenders were
react angular angular to ember view jets
and I think you do backbone in just for
a consolation prize um I don't know how
there's a lot of people still using
backbone but it's like legacy
um and young and too it was what there
was a write-in so you could write in oh
yeah yeah there's other yeah but then
you can buy and so he got you know I
thought it was interesting you got a lot
of right ends for knockout jazz oh yeah
I think Microsoft products Microsoft
should developers are using knockout
that's a long time ago in any case the
interest he plugs cool a cool chart be a
chart blocks it's a great chart chart
like service I guess where you can just
produce cool charge for your blog posts
so pretty much the interests obviously
react was at the highest seventy-three
percent interest then surprisingly view
at forty-eight percent I don't know and
I'm surprised by that I'm not actually
I'm not I thought owes me angler too
though I've had some conversations with
Ben um like a while ago where where's
work six in informal survey survey
getting oh no like oh turn now you
should be concerned on each speaker
school yeah um where he was doing like
they were pulling some people in Chicago
and like at the javascript meetup and
stuff and a lot of the things that we're
interesting there were like um feathers
and view and stuff like that and so like
I'm I guess I'm a little less shocked by
that myself I think there are a lot of
people that really like and enjoy view
yeah you know it started to follow
patterns in react which is kind of
effort watch happened as well I was a
little surprised by where amber was at
perhaps like it was barely above
backbone right all right and it was par
with angular so like I feel like maybe
either the Emperor communities not that
big which I don't think it's true or
it's just we didn't reach them somehow
so far oh yeah
reach yeah or they talk a big game all
the time but maybe no one's interested
so my conference dedicated to it right
like I don't know I feel like it's a
little surprising that that view would
beat it out by that much yeah could be
some sampling bias here but that's what
the interest was I am actually so really
surprised with Amber being so low
especially is like big companies like
LinkedIn that's their front end library
linkedin so just industry um you know
what was actually super interesting is
the amount of repeat customers right
like he asked a question about who
you've been framework again and like
ninety two percent would use react again
yes which is stunning to me right like
uh react view and angular all were over
fifty percent but everyone else was
under fifty percent which I think yeah
maybe again I you know I think amber
like a question like is now outlier
because we didn't get enough people in
or what but I guess this question would
indicate this question it wouldn't
matter how many people you get in right
like yeah it's all about this is about
if you've used it would you use it again
yep so these percentages are out of the
number of people that have used it so
that's really really interesting not
only yeah what do you something percent
would use it again my views right up
there right like 86 percentage per said
that means they have the best developer
experience beside from react right react
has the best dev experience because and
i genuinely feel very happy building
with it you know or it feels very
natural well minute i would say there's
a cost associated with hiring people
especially in the valley or in the
surrounding area in san francisco and
like it's better to I think it's cheaper
to retain people than it is to go find
new people to hire yes def oh like
making a good developer experience on
their internal tooling I think makes a
lot of sense yeah
so it's crazy that you know Evan you
solo solo man project in the beginning
has such a good developer experience and
I said this before but I think he really
liked just learned what the competition
was doing and did what they were not
doing and so kind has a little bit of
people like template so he has a little
bit of templates people of components so
you got the components in the j sx
people want server-side rendering he did
that it's like almost like when every
library got some flack about not having
this he took some notes and he was like
okay when I'm build my stuff it's gonna
be this the exact problem with their try
my salsa that's why I'm totally
surprised you'd put a lot of care into
it well it does this maybe denote since
he's one guy versus the team like reacts
or Facebook's put together with react
like business maybe denote in your mind
that he's done a good job a community
management like maybe he's getting yet
he has actually participation in
shepherding them in a good direction yep
that's good for the framework yet the
dry up the baddie built this very
modular so there are just different like
modules that go with view that are
maintained by companies other people deb
shops that fell in love with the
framework he has like ten core
contributors um in view I think that are
just like in a close-knit group that may
be right documentation or whatever but
then you have these companies that are
just you know you know part of his
patreon campaign that are using it in
their product that depend on it so
they're like really invested as well in
terms of community and all that so I
think it's just a very organic how it's
just you know blown up especially since
a whole framework of laravel is just
adopted that is their front end friend
and choice that's a lot looks like the
whole page fifty community essentially
is using laravel now that's a huge
amount of people that you know I don't
usually talk to and in terms of like you
know back-end communities but that's a
full computer community that's just
adopted it so
that's really cool I'm really excited
about that um yeah yeah I'm running some
numbers here cuz I'm kind of curious
like what this ends up looking like as
far as contributors go so meteors that
like 56 commits per contributor on
average um and react is at ten it's like
slightly under tenants that like 9.5 /
contributor and um view comes in in the
middle it's got 82 contributors for
almost 2,000 commit so um and that comes
out to be like 24 commits per
contributor so what that yeah yeah it's
definitely like not at the react level
but it's it's certainly seems like it's
trending that way you look the big
indicator is like if 24 is the average
you gotta look and see like how many
people yeah yeah see here's a problem no
one falls above that average except for
Evan so yeah just indicates that he's
doing a really really great job yeah
he's taking onesie twosie Smith's from a
lot of people as well yeah and that's
how it starts right once you once you
start doing those one or two commits
then people feel more comfortable and
they'll start progressing the the
library forward yeah I guess at this
stage debut he's the architect so he
still has his own plans for it you know
yeah definitely cool anyway it's a great
read and it's interesting and I think
like you know I would love to see like
I'm glad number one he wrote this blog
post because i think it links back to
the survey and my hope is you know he
gained even more and I I suggested to
Sasha like he should be going to all the
subreddits like the ember subreddit and
posting it there and react subreddit and
like those I think that's the way to
maybe get more of a particular type of
person in the door and if you do that
the range of subreddits like hopefully
we're maybe a little more inclusive
and the what this looks like results
while yeah that's so i don't know i'm
super-interested i will say like set
aside 15-20 minutes to take this thing
um and don't walk away yeah just get it
done in one sitting because someone said
they lost their results because I walked
away and came back to it later but he's
still powered through um that's like you
tell me but it's like that would be that
would be very annoying cuz it is it like
20 minute survey so well worth the time
though the whole goal of this is to have
see like you know new people are always
asking like what to do what should I do
if you have this if you have data on the
satisfaction report of people actually
using these products and you can make
your decision a lot easier yeah yeah
yeah for sure well and I also think just
in general there's safety numbers right
like react routers probably a safer bet
than floor ever at this point just
because there's a 10 x 20 x number of
people using react router so ya gonna
know library should do a mps scores we
just like you know you're running a
thing it's just say hey we take the NPS
survey he's give him a 10 or like sticks
or whatever that would be actually
pretty interesting as well see as you go
i had an early idea like years ago i
actually had a domain called plugin hub
and it was the idea that like you could
basically pull in packages from like mpm
or Ruby gems or any of these places and
like try to try to basically give
metrics scores off of it you know like
how active is library yeah how many
people are downloading it like and that
would be one of the things that would be
really cool to do is like ping people
and be like hey we notice you jury this
like yeah give us give us an idea like
does this make you happy or sad would
you recommend it it makes me sad anyway
hey there just wanted to take a quick
second to tell you about something
that's coming up in
Space Camp two point oh so last year we
ran Space Camp one point O and
gatlinburg tennessee in the mountains it
was a lot of fun and so this year we
decided we wanted to go bigger and it
took some searching but we found an even
bigger place it has 30 bedrooms and it's
on the coast of North Carolina and outer
banks super super excited for this you
know we're going to follow a similar
format to last year so the first day
we're going to have talks and it's going
to be kind of the the open camp style of
like you know everyone just kind of
saying hey I've got to talk and we'll
pick the best ones in the mole we'll sit
down and listen to those they were great
last year I'm expecting some some touch
not top-notch once again this year we
also have like home-cooked meals the
entire time my wife is an excellent
excellent cook and she's going to make
all those meals and I think anyone that
went last year would attest to how tasty
everything was and how much food there
was and it was just it was amazing and
we plan to replicate that this year and
you know talks during the day then in
the evenings beer board games a lot of
hanging out talking watching funny
videos all kinds of stuff so if board
games or anything this is definitely the
event to come to I may even try to bring
the ps4 or something we'll see how that
works out the car was pretty packed last
year so I don't know how much space
there will be but if you're interested
it's like November it's like the first
week in november right after the
election so that that weekend the second
day we'll have hacking hackathon contest
where we'll be building fun things using
javascript so if you're a fan of
JavaScript like this is the event you
want to be at so check it out Camp dot
space todo calm it will be an amazing
time
promise you see you there yeah so the
the next story be good is from our one
of our community members town oh gosh
Tom Goldenberg which we met in New York
yes um he is co-writing a book with
Nicholas brown and they're both in New
York City and they're building their
writing a react native tutorial book and
so it looks interesting to me I haven't
actually seen a copy of it but one of
the fun things I talked to him a little
bit after he posted it on crater was
like what are you using to show off some
of the the parts of the book like
they're talking about user accounts and
api integration and mapping and I was
kind of curious what they were using on
the back end and he said they're using
something called deployed have you heard
of deployed no um but to look it up I
it's deployed com no II um yeah
basically you can bill o it up yeah it's
really cool you can build like rests
api's um and they've got a little dpd
WebSocket library that's that's cool
alright dpd you gotta set this up
confusing ugly familiar here but yeah
they totally have a front end kind of a
socket listener that you can utilize so
that you can get kind of like the
real-time updates and stuff if you need
it and they've got the user management
so you can use their little DDP library
dpd library I just did it I do handle
like the login stuff and all that kind
of so I'm kind of interesting like I
honestly I may want to just read the
book just to see like what it looks like
with them building a library using this
deployed um I don't know where's today
pricing on here that's the only thing
they're free right now
maybe oh no it's uh well they don't have
any pricing but yeah that's weird they
should put the price Tom you put the
price on the website man with Tom's
thing um well it's 25 votes yeah the
books 25 bucks but I was kind of curious
what deployed would cost Oh deployed
yeah uh so yeah I think you know if you
if you're interested in react native
there's certainly a lot of tutorials out
there right lake ah my good friend Scott
to Olinsky has a like six hour video
course that you can take only so videos
more your thing you could go do that I
level up tutorials or you could do this
which is build react native calm you can
get this book right now it's like 13
chapters so yeah like a lot of good
options there and I know someone I used
to work with Spencer spoke at critic off
mobile edition and I think he's working
on a book about using react native and
meteor together so you know you have a
lot a lot of good options available I
love a lot of books like this where like
you're learning things with the goal my
it's this total book has a project that
you're trying to build like assemblies
like the meetup clone or something yeah
that's cool you know you buy the book at
the end of the day you get some working
prototype that you can then use as
reference when you build something by
yourself yeah I'm not that huge superfan
of building clones as a way to teach
because I think a lot of people um like
that's my master meteor class in my um
my Cordova class are both centered
around like master meteor you build a
Twitter clone and then in the Cordova
class you build a urban spoon clone
surance odd but if you're not familiar
it's like finding restaurants with
ratings and that kind of thing um and I
think like people can look at those
applications if there's somewhat
familiar with them and understand that
functionality inherently and kind of
know how the how it should act and so
they can equate that idea in the mind of
like here's how this feature
works too like here's how we actually
write that code and make it yeah you
know and I think that that's like it's
easy to make that connection and like
learn something from it yeah and you
also realize that a lot better apps are
like the same you know it functionality
was a lot of absolute the same things
yeah yeah that's definitely overlap here
man um is it time oh man I think it's
time it's time no I don't know about
that but our last topic of the today is
a forum a meteor forum post called um is
it is it time to fork meteor and so this
is just an interesting topic as most
topics on the meteor forum get to that
you know like this this gentleman Ramiz
I think he's just very um you know very
unhappy with the way meteor it's
progressed he wanted to replace Mongo
with really think TB or my sequel and he
was kind of like he was upset that
meteor development has slowed down in
comparison to the Apollo development and
I think you know and he's thinking what
everyone else is thinking is like you
know if meteor development group is
pushing changes in their just slowing
down the main part of the framework what
happens to all the people that are using
it and you know is it does it make sense
for us as you know community of meteor
to fork it and take it in a different
direction now from what I understand in
the past with forking libraries like I
ojs and nodejs you know that happened
and you know they eventually came back
together so maybe a fork is interesting
where a group of people go out and build
the feature that they want to see and
maybe they'll come back to the main
meteor core it's someday in the future
but giving people that option
and to not use meteor and use maybe a
different design or thinking or train of
thought a meteor is interesting to me
but for me my perspective I ever want to
run the engineering team with a big
product and you know we can't take risks
like that you know for his as risky as
the current product well I will not risk
my you know element on there and like
you're a medium-sized company right
that's still taking on like my guess is
you'll have another round of funding and
like that said risk you want to take on
when you're still like looking at
funding you know yeah and we're trying
to build and move fast you can't be
switching into technology every day
because people need to learn new
technology and that's the cost of future
development time and bug figures from
time and stuff like that yeah um I don't
know this is interesting it's not the
first time this has come up right and
and we definitely like so I'll say if
you're not aware of it there already is
a community fork out there right like
clinical meteor is a release track and
this is a thing that you can do you can
release a version of meteor to the
package servers and people can then go
install that release um and and
basically they'll be operating on that
version rather than the core version
that media team is putting out so like
meteor itself actually thought about
this and it's something interesting when
they allow people to put out their own
media releases um the thing that I'll
say is like I number one um I think
there's a little bit of BS going on in
this post like depa um it just smells to
me like anytime someone says like react
is good for the consultant community
like I don't I don't buy that to me that
just tells me you haven't tried react
yet like I don't hit like looking at the
state of JavaScript like I don't think
you hit a ninety-two percent reuse rate
on the survey if it's only good for
consultants and I don't like it's not
necessarily easy to get started with
either so like I don't that's actually
bad for consultants
the fact that like there's a little more
overhead to get it get started with it
um like that's one of the reasons like I
was so happy with meteors because as a
consulting company like we could
absolutely pop out apps like every six
weeks to clients and move on and do
another one and like sales teams
concerned with keeping the pipeline for
the problem I have a meteor now is like
looking at how things have gone with
like the crater update like blaze is
terrible blaze is really really actually
terrible um it's terrible and it's just
like you can't you can't compete you
can't compete with react and there's
another thread that's probably worth
reading the forums and I put a lot of
thoughts into it's like the the guy was
complaining about reacting there again
and like you're not gonna you can't
compete like there's no way even if if
mdg decided we're going to compete with
react like there's no way there's no way
they're there tooling in there there I
on performance and that kind of stuff
like they've already captured a lot of
mindshare and interest and like they're
already like their performance is
already probably 10x better than what
blaze could be and like they're still
pushing that forward because it matters
to them and like Facebook literally
makes money off you staying on the sunny
and if their site gets slow that cost
them dollars right you think you can go
read about how like one second of
delayed load time on a page costs him
amazon an estimated like 1 billion
dollars like almost two billion dollars
1.6 I like this stuff matters to those
people and at some point it's gonna
matter to you as well like yeah we can
absolutely see from crater like the
speed matters and say that it doesn't i
think is a little ridiculous or to say
that it's somehow benefiting someone
else like a consultant like that doesn't
make much sense to me i I think you know
meteors I don't know they made some
weird moves right but ultimately if you
look at it at the end of the day for
a dollars perspective for a start-up it
makes a ton of sense like react will
always be better than blaze and so why
should you spend time walking like that
when it doesn't make a lot of sense and
it's not integral right like there's
plenty of other front-end options if you
don't like this one you can go plug in
another one and like that one's probably
still doing better than blaze would do
because you have this team this team of
initially like eight people or whatever
it's been that were focused on multiple
areas and trying to build something and
it turns out like it was a lot for them
to care about and work on and build and
they didn't do a great job of separating
that out like they did try to make blaze
it's it's own living entity and it
didn't work that first time and there's
trying to do it again but I still think
it's just not it's not going to take off
in the world of you know angular 2 and
react and VI this there's some of the
comments in this thread or just
ridiculous like oh like thanks for the
classic meteor I'm gonna be building
blaze tools or Oh Facebook's only
solving Facebook's problem and get out
it turns out Facebook's problem is
really actually close to my problem as
well same here to stay on the pages as
long as they can and then I want them to
do something that somehow financially
rewards me right and that's it
everyone's building that if you're not
building that like G building a
non-profit with chances are nonprofits
still in these money coming in the door
lake I just don't get it telling us with
a comment here that says performance
doesn't matter thank you absolutely Matt
you a hobbyist dude like okay like this
is the problem i've always had with
meteor community also before i get into
that you know on twitter like people say
that were grumpy little people talking
about me here but you know what I'm
gonna keep keep talking about it but um
look blaze is terrible okay and the
reason why is you know companies like
look back and class crap
defended blaze when I rant about it
saying that we built all these libraries
and so that's cool but I'll tell you
this from a production standpoint like
you build those libraries and you
probably spend a lot of time and effort
perfecting those libraries where
something and react you could have built
the same thing in half the time and like
less bugs you know um maybe I mean I
think definitely you know I'll say this
like I felt like meteor packages were
more polished but part of that comes
from the whole mindset of frameworks
versus libraries right and so I think
the other thread the thoughts from a
newbie thread they talked about um what
was I going with this I totally lost my
train of thought what was I just saying
the newbie thread which had more
ridiculous comments in there it did um
no I can't think of what I was gonna say
oh yeah so the integration points so if
you look at like uh graph cool and you
look at the ecosystem that's springing
up around that like you're getting smart
little libraries that are integrating
angular with Apollo and graph cool and
that's great but you don't yet have an
accounts system that's been built around
that and part of that is like that's out
of the purview of graph ql or Apollo to
some degree right and like because
you're choosing the smoke smoke focus on
this one small piece which is good as a
library like that's what they should be
doing and things are moving the right
direction as a result of that you end up
with like not getting these deeper
integrated kind of packages that come
along as a framework and so like that
that's part of the problem right like
maybe the meteor packages felt better
because
though they were easier to install and
integrate and but at the same time like
I think that now you're running into a
maintenance problem because people are
moving on and like meteor isn't as open
you know the package system is its own
thing and not an MPN thing and so like
other people can't benefit from a lot of
these packages and therefore like people
move on and things die off yeah and so
that to me that's that's kind of
interesting as well and so I think like
people look at graph you all or Apollo
and they go like terrible it's terrible
idea like I just I just want rethink tdb
why can't we just have rethink DB in the
current meteor ecosystem and make that a
thing like horizon one often did it like
why can't we just do an immediate and I
think to me the realization that you
have a back-end database driver and you
build a front-end database driver like
mini Mongo you start like ah crap like
I've got a now officially support a
second database driver on both the front
and the back end you know the back end
is slightly easier to do because you can
rely on node but at the same time like
you now have to make sure that it's
utilizes correctly to DDP to flow across
the wire and then you have to have a new
cache on the front end or you say screw
it you get mini Mongo on the front end
right and you just have this like sure
you can everything DB on the back end
and then you just use Mongo syntax on
the front end and it's like yeah sweeter
that's kind of weird so like it turned
out that i think they spent they
actually spent time right working on
rethink TB they spend time with postgres
and trying to figure out is there a
smart way we can do this and they went
yeah actually we could just do graph qol
and redox Torin Bob that's it call it
big yeah so I I feel like it's
interesting in there moving the right
direction um but if you're you know
building production app like it maybe
feels a little weird still with Paulo as
the option um and it definitely like I
got to say I spend some time outside of
the meteor community and like it's
it's you get analysis paralysis and
that's the danger of living outside of
meteor is like figuring out how to wire
together all that stuff and like it's a
one-time thing for a chap but it still
feels like maybe a little daunting I
gotta figure out how to do web pack and
then I gotta figure out how to make like
react autograph ql and you know make all
these things happen um and you get a lot
of that nice stuff from meteor and so
like I I I guess I get it but at the
same time like at some point you're
building something for someone that's
gonna bring value and like you're gonna
you're gonna run into problems with
meteor in the long run I think yeah i
mean my personal experience now my team
we're literally building everything at
mpm modules just because we cannot deal
with the slowness of the build we can't
we can't be bothered to be slowed down
by 10 minute build times or whatever all
of our back end is not going to
microservices so we're not even touching
the media rap anymore and then grab
kills going to play a big part in that
that orchestration and on the front end
thank you are anoda we started building
everything with storybook so all of our
front-end modules none of it's going to
be in the app we're all importing
everything if you want to test and write
CSS you need is Aphrodite for CSS
injurious and then we just write
everything in our npm modules we test
them on storybook we have a whole new
workflow how storybook integrates with
everything once that's all done we put
it in the app and then we have to deal
with the slow freaking build but you
know what you save a bunch of time not
doing that stuff in the application hmm
but the fact that we have to do all that
outside the application just talk it's a
very tough should tell you that this is
just not working out for a big bigger
team you know right like pick up a lot
of code so and just those things that's
that's a big part of it right because
now you get to this point where it's
like oh we docked a meteor it's fast in
me ty needs this is great like we're
gonna move quick we're gonna enter
we're gonna find product market fit good
for you like that's really really good
that's what you should be doing is an
early stage but surprise surprise you
hit series a series be someone in there
you got to start paying off that
technical debt and there are other
things that you start to care about and
one of those is speed speed of the team
which ship working with with blaze in
the long run like large applications
doesn't quite feel right um using place
like I've done some pretty large
applications and we've suffered through
some rendering performance problems and
like you know again they'll keep they'll
continue to do like little speed
increases in the various parts but it's
never going to be like to me it's like
if you do a/b testing you can slowly
move your way towards like a ten or
twenty percent increase right that's
what we're doing here like we can make
blaze slightly better slightly better we
can make the build tool slightly better
here and there and those are great but
you know unless we go back to the
drawing board and do a complete redesign
like that's the only way you're ever
gonna be able to do like a major major
speed upgrade or a major like you know
in the a/b testing world conversion
improvement if you do a redesign chances
are you might be able to capture like
fifty percent increase in sales or
something you know yeah like we're just
we're at this point where we're
maintaining a lot of legacy stuff like
absolutely someone like rethink DB can
build horizons quickly because they're
building you know that that eighty
percent portion which you can do quickly
and it's gonna take them a long time to
get that that other twenty percent
polish that they need to make it really
good um but they're also not dealing
with the legacy at this point like you
know if you just started again today I
think you could rebuild meteor pretty
fast like the core of it using yes
pre-built things like passport and react
um but I do think like you know it would
take you months and then there would be
like you would start to slow down just
because you've you've got so much comb
please
it's big it's big it's a big undertaking
cute yea though what they're doing it I
you know I'm curious to see what kind of
speed improves we get with 142 yeah I
hope they're big we can only have been a
bigot yeah so and frankly like they did
it build some performance testing tools
on the build side of things so like and
if if it's slow for you and you want to
help like there's a great document
mm-hmm out there on the repo somewhere
that you can read and they show you how
to run the performance testing which I
know you've done you posted work pops so
yes no I don't so here's the thing i'll
say i don't think it's time to fork it
um i think you're gonna you're gonna
have a bad time he can have matt time um
but if like start the discussions right
and so out of this thread came the
discussion that i started part of the
problem i have is that oh I needed
accounts Twitter an accounts facebook
and guess what blaze is now on craters
front end do you need blaze to do
anything ooh but it part of that
JavaScript bundle that's being delivered
and that's a problem until um you know I
worked off an issue from the discussion
and started talking and just doing some
investigative work and posting my
findings here in there over the course
of like two hours and ended up tracking
now what the problem was and I think
we've got a solution that maybe we can
fix in meteor 142 or 15 it seems
attainable so like that but that's what
it's gonna take right like meteor itself
they're not gonna fix that they'll say
yeah we think it's a problem yeah the
solution looks okay you should go do it
um and that's a lot of what's gonna
happen going forward yeah either be okay
that essentially yeah don't lie cool
all right whoo that was raiatea I don't
know I apologize listeners I felt a
little ranti I don't know I have a lot
of this a little romantic uh yeah about
that yeah I think it's you should you
should know where it's going right i
think if you listen to this show you
maybe have an idea what I meteors had
any like it shouldn't be a shock to you
that when you go look at the commits
page it's all been Newman oh yeah and it
shouldn't be a shock to you to see like
ever nicks or Lauren or someone loaf a
blouse AB I don't know how you say is
get handle but other people like chiming
and on on the threads that you're in
because they're they're trying to build
that community involvement and
governance and that kind of thing so
it's slow but i think it's ya know yeah
thanks for listening hey it's all I got
this week ah yeah so let's try something
if you enjoy this show uh you know we
don't we don't advertise we know we
posted on crater now with the new design
um and you can listen to the podcast on
the crater site ah but if you enjoy the
show tweet about it let other people
know about it because that's the only
the only way people find out yeah you
sharing it in some way and we super
appreciate that and if you have
questions like will have that select
chat up soon and obvi and I will be in
there um and you know like you can post
your questions in their post them on
Twitter like we'll be happy to like I
would love to do a little segment on
here where we answer questions for a
couple minutes so absolutely get that
stuff posted like at Crater podcast on
Twitter and then of course you can go to
patreon page or a un comedy club and
help support the efforts like editing
and that kind of thing because we have a
an audio editor and I've got a an
assistant that posts this stuff because
I'm terrible at remembering all the
little things so I
them handle that I just rant and then
save the file and give it to them yeah
tweet us and stay tuned for that slashed
at it's gonna be great yes super excited
